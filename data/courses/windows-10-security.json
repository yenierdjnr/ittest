Very good, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.050\nWhen it comes to this course, it's really\ngonna be for anybody that wants a better\n\n9\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.254\nunderstanding of the security mechanisms\nthat are inside of Windows 10.\n\n10\n00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:32.600\nKeep in mind that this isn't really\nfocused at any different skill level.\n\n11\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.730\nYou could be entry level, if you will.\n\n12\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.270\nMaybe somebody that just kinda home user\nif you will what is a little bit more\n\n13\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.840\ninterested in how you can secure your\nWindows 10 machines around the home.\n\n14\n00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.910\nYou could be an employer or\nan employee for that matter,\n\n15\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.190\nthat maybe you want to stand out\na little bit more than the rest and\n\n16\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.380\nbuild your skills inside of Windows\n10 by learning how to secure it.\n\n17\n00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.350\nAgain, like I said employers too.\n\n18\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.490\nIt could be managers as well, so this\nreally isn't focused to any one person.\n\n19\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.620\nAnd when it comes to the skill levels\nitself there aren't any prerequisites,\n\n20\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.330\nso it's a good way to kinda up your\nskills when it comes to security.\n\n21\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.430\nNow, what are some of the topics\nthat we're gonna look at?\n\n22\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.670\nWell, we're gonna look at various topics,\nthings like data security, authentication\n\n23\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.530\nand some of the authentication mechanisms\nthat you can see inside of Windows.\n\n24\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.820\nWe're gonna look at some\nconcepts like host security.\n\n25\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.990\nWhat does it mean to get your\noperating system secure so\n\n26\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.820\nyou're less vulnerable to some of\nthe attacks that are out there?\n\n27\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.870\nAs well as things like\napplication security.\n\n28\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.360\nNot only host security is important,\nbut the applications and\n\n29\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.030\nthe software that runs with inside of the\nWindows operating system is gonna be very,\n\n30\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.430\nvery important to be able to secure them.\n\n31\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.770\nWe'll look at concepts like some of\nthe enterprise-level concepts as well,\n\n32\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.320\nlike group policy, how about web browsers?\n\n33\n00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.620\nEverybody out there has used a web browser\nonce or twice I'm sure, so we're also\n\n34\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.260\ngonna look at things like web browser\nsecurity and functionalities that you can\n\n35\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.350\nuse to maybe even enhance your experience\ninside of the web browser itself.\n\n36\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.130\nWe'll look at things\nlike account management.\n\n37\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.820\nDo you know how to create user account,\nand some of the things that you can do to\n\n38\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.770\nrestrict to the access that a user might\nhave, if they're using the computers.\n\n39\n00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.290\nFor instance, maybe you have a child\nthat's logging into the machine,\n\n40\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.370\nyou wanna be able to control\nthe user experience that they have,\n\n41\n00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.630\nmake it a little bit more safe for them.\n\n42\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.940\nSo we'll look at things like\nbasic account management.\n\n43\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.720\nNow, Ronnie, we're gonna have all\nother kinds of things there, but\n\n44\n00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.730\nthese are some of the high level of\ntopics that you can expect to see\n\n45\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.810\ninstead of the Windows 10 security.\n\n46\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.840\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, is this particular\nshow then exam-focused or\n\n47\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.630\ndo we have to worry about anything like?\n\n48\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, this one is one that kinda\ndeviates from other things like our\n\n49\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.130\nWindows 10 courses that we have that are\nspecific to the MCSE and specific exams.\n\n50\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.620\nThis really isn't exam-centric.\n\n51\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.500\nKeep in mind, however, that you always\nbenefit, if you are out there right now\n\n52\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.720\nmaybe currently studying for a Windows 10\ncertification, well, this can benefit you\n\n53\n00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.540\nbut keep in mind that we're not gonna be\nfollowing things like skills measured and\n\n54\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.840\nthe objectives that you would\nfind in those certifications.\n\n55\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.710\nBut more information is always better\ninformation so if you wanna learn a little\n\n56\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.205\nbit more about Windows 10 security, stick\naround cuz we got a lot more coming up.\n\n57\n00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:07.424\n[NOISE]\n\n",

to\nanother exciting episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.260\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.830\nToday we're going to be diving into\nsome Windows 10 security content.\n\n6\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.960\nIt's very good stuff and\nwho better to help us out with that\n\n7\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.960\nthan none other than Mr Wes Brian I\nhave in the studio today.\n\n8\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.060\nHow you doing today Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.820\n>> Man, I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.690\nIt's good to be here and today in this\nepisode of Security and Windows 10,\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.640\nwe're specifically gonna focus on\nsomething known as data security.\n\n12\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.620\nAnd when it comes to data security,\nwe have a whole bunch of different\n\n13\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.850\ntechnologies that we can use in order to\nkeep that data a little bit more secure.\n\n14\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.440\nOne of the first things that we're\ngonna mention is an oldie but goodie,\n\n15\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.050\nbeen around for a while, and that.\n\n16\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.020\nThat's what we call our NTFS permissions,\nsee these permissions that we have\n\n17\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.180\ninside of Windows allows us to govern\nwho gains access to different files and\n\n18\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.290\nnot only gaining access to those files\nalso controls the amount of access.\n\n19\n00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100\nWhat kind of actions can\nthey perform on the file.\n\n20\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.440\nSo we're going to dive right in here and\n\n21\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.600\nlet's take a look here at\nmy Windows 10 computer.\n\n22\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.200\nI've got a document ready to go or\n\n23\n00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.820\na folder, I should say, that's ready\nto go here, and this is a docs folder.\n\n24\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.040\nOne of the first things that we're\ngoing to do is we're going to work with\n\n25\n00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.850\na couple of user accounts\nthat I have on this machine.\n\n26\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.200\nWe've got a DEV team, a development staff\nhere, and there's two user accounts that\n\n27\n00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.050\nwe're going to be torturing here with a\nlevels of access and removing that access.\n\n28\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.440\nSo let's go ahead and set that up.\n\n29\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.140\nThe first thing that we're\ngoing to do is we're going to\n\n30\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.790\nany folder that you create\non your Windows machine.\n\n31\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.660\nYou can always right click on\nit you can choose Properties.\n\n32\n00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.640\nAnd from the Properties tab or\nthe Properties options,\n\n33\n00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.670\nexcuse me here, you have the Security tab.\n\n34\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.130\nNow the Security tab is very important\nwhen you're setting permissions.\n\n35\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.340\nIt's what's known as an access control\nlist, so dive into those words,\n\n36\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.550\naccess control.\n\n37\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.430\nThat's what we're doing here and\nif you're on the list, well,\n\n38\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.590\nwe're gonna control how much\nthe level of access you have.\n\n39\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.070\nNow one of the first things that I'm gonna\ndo here is I'm gonna go ahead and we're\n\n40\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.080\ngonna see if this user account by the name\nof Billy has access to this folder or\n\n41\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.630\nnot, so let's go ahead and what I'm gonna\ndo is, I'm gonna go ahead and just,\n\n42\n00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.790\nlets do a switch user here so we don't\nhave to wait for the Log on, log off.\n\n43\n00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.850\nAll right, we're gonna log in as Billy.\n\n44\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.090\nAnd we're going to see if Billy has access\nto that folder that I've created here.\n\n45\n00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.170\nSo we'll go ahead and open up our file\nexplorer here, and I've already pinned it\n\n46\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.190\nto our quick access menu and get there\na little bit quicker, hence the name.\n\n47\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.190\nAnd we're going to try\nto get into this folder.\n\n48\n00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.700\nNow, Dan, one of the first\nthings you're gonna see here.\n\n49\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.210\nBilly doesn't have any access, right?\n\n50\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.310\n>> Yeah, looks like Billy's getting\na big fat no thank you, sir.\n\n51\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.020\nGo somewhere else and take your business.\n\n52\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.660\n>> That's right.\n\n53\n00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.550\nWell, maybe that's not what we want.\n\n54\n00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.950\nMaybe we do, and of course we usually do\nwant our users to be able to work with\n\n55\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.860\ntheir information, so we've got to make\nsome modifications to the permissions or\n\n56\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.470\naccess control list in order for that to\nhappen, so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n57\n00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.650\n>> So if I'm Billy and\nI sit down at my desk and I plug in, I go,\n\n58\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.480\nyou know what,\nI've got to access this file.\n\n59\n00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.590\nBoss asked me to make some changes,\nmake some modifications.\n\n60\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.210\nI need to go into that file.\n\n61\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.580\nI try to get in the folder.\n\n62\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.930\nAnd I meet with this lovely\nlittle no thank you,\n\n63\n00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.570\nplease go away error that I've been given.\n\n64\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.310\nNow I'm probably calling the help desk and\n\n65\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.000\nsomebody like Wes is going to be on\nthe other end, and I'm going to say, hi,\n\n66\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.740\nI need access to this file, and\nI'm getting permissions denied.\n\n67\n00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.320\nAnd this is where this is why\nwe need to know how to do this.\n\n68\n00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.490\nSo that we can set permissions that I will\nbe able access, if I'm Billy, of course.\n\n69\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.737\n>> That's right, that's right, and\n\n70\n00:03:44.737 --> 00:03:47.163\nI know you've had to troubleshoot\nsome of these issues before, yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:47.163 --> 00:03:49.320\n[LAUGH] So\nI know Dan's familiar with this.\n\n72\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.366\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n73\n00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:54.275\nwhat we're going to do here is we're\ngoing to change Billy's level of access.\n\n74\n00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:58.615\nNow, one of the first things that you\nmight notice here if I can zoom in on\n\n75\n00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:03.015\nthat, notice that Billy isn't\neven in the access list.\n\n76\n00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:04.187\nI want you to think about something.\n\n77\n00:04:04.187 --> 00:04:06.527\nYou're going to a restaurant, right?\n\n78\n00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:08.300\nAnd it's reservation only.\n\n79\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.430\nWell, you get up to the front door and\nyou haven't called ahead of time,\n\n80\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.700\nyou don't have your reservation.\n\n81\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.240\nGuess what?\n\n82\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.360\nNo food for you,\nyou don't get to sit down.\n\n83\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.080\nSo Billy starting out, going out the gate,\nhe doesn't have access all right?\n\n84\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.530\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee if we can change that.\n\n85\n00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.280\nSo what we're gonna do here is\nwe're gonna choose the edit button.\n\n86\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.320\nWe choose the edit button.\n\n87\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.619\nNow, this allows us to make\nmodifications to the ACL or\n\n88\n00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:31.001\nthe access control permissions list.\n\n89\n00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:32.481\nWe're going to go ahead and choose add.\n\n90\n00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:37.458\nNow, Billy is a part of a team, and one\nof the things that we want to understand\n\n91\n00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:41.288\nis that when you manage permissions,\nit is easier to manage\n\n92\n00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:45.860\npermissions on a group of people\nthan it is to do this user by user.\n\n93\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.480\nNow, we're going to pick on Billy\na little bit more coming up.\n\n94\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.010\nBut let's go ahead and implement this with\nthe least amount of administrative effort.\n\n95\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.040\nBilly's in the dev team, so what I'm gonna\ndo here is in my select user group, I'm\n\n96\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.570\ngonna type dev, and I'm gonna choose OK,\nand now you can see dev is in the list.\n\n97\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.310\nAll right, now let's go out and\napply the changes,\n\n98\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.560\nand we're going to switch back over, and\n\n99\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.440\nwe're going to see if we have given\nBilly the appropriate level of access.\n\n100\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.290\nLet me go ahead and just do a switch\nuser here, makes it a little easier.\n\n101\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.270\nAnd we'll sign back in as Billy.\n\n102\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.580\nAll right.\n\n103\n00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.330\nNow notice we still have\nour file explorer open.\n\n104\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.220\nNothing's changed here, so we're going to\ngo and see if we can access that folder.\n\n105\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.710\nSo now we've got this.\n\n106\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.090\nNotice that Billy can access the folder.\n\n107\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.140\nAll right.\nNow, one of the things that you might have\n\n108\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.790\nnoticed is that when we gave\nhim a level of access, and\n\n109\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.420\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nswitch users one more time here.\n\n110\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.030\nAll right, and we'll put in our\ntrusty super secret password.\n\n111\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.700\nI want to go back to that permissions\nlist, and more importantly what I want to\n\n112\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.480\nlook at is what level of access did we\ngive that team that Billy's a part of.\n\n113\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.190\nNow, you'll see right here\nthat we gave read and\n\n114\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.010\nexecute, list for contents, and read.\n\n115\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.410\nNow in a scenario where maybe you want\nyour end users to be able to just view\n\n116\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.700\nthe documentation, but you really don't\nwant to make in too many changes,\n\n117\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.500\nyou don't want them to get in\nthere messing too many things up,\n\n118\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.170\nand that's definitely\nsometimes a good thing here.\n\n119\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.000\nNotice that there's no,\n\n120\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.980\nthese other permissions don't\nhave check marks on them.\n\n121\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.330\nLet me take a second here and just tell\nyou the difference between some of these\n\n122\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.310\npermissions, and\nthen we'll see them in action.\n\n123\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.230\nFull control does exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n124\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.350\nYou've got to be careful giving\nsomebody's full control,\n\n125\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.870\nbecause they can set permissions.\n\n126\n00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.810\nThey can take ownership.\n\n127\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.870\nThey can delete documents\nthat are in folders.\n\n128\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.230\nAnd again, you might not want to\ngive somebody that much control.\n\n129\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.880\nModify permission?\n\n130\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.320\nThis allows them to make changes to\ndocumentation and delete it, but\n\n131\n00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.250\none of the things that they can't\ndo is bona-fide permissions,\n\n132\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.690\nand again, sometimes that might be handy.\n\n133\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.560\nWe've got read and execute.\n\n134\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.510\nRead and execute means if this is\nan application within this folder,\n\n135\n00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.360\nthey're going to be able to execute it.\n\n136\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.460\nList folder contents.\n\n137\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.710\nNow, this is one of the five\nstandard NTFS permissions.\n\n138\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.760\nIt's only on a folder.\n\n139\n00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.640\nWell, because you don't\nlist file contents.\n\n140\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.350\nThat's the read permission.\n\n141\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.870\nSo that only applies to files,\nor, excuse me, folders.\n\n142\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.410\nThen we have the read permission.\n\n143\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.130\nRead permission allows\nyou to do exactly that.\n\n144\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.410\nAny documents that you want someone to\nbe able to view allows in that ability.\n\n145\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.990\nAnd the last one here is\nthe write permission.\n\n146\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.260\nNow the right permission.\n\n147\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.690\nThe right permission allows you to\nmake changes to a document, but\n\n148\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.390\nit doesn't allow you to\ndelete the document.\n\n149\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.020\nSo whatever,\nthese are called basic permissions.\n\n150\n00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.345\nWhatever the permissions or\naccess levels that you need to set,\n\n151\n00:07:42.345 --> 00:07:44.677\nthese are your standard options.\n\n152\n00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:48.430\nWe've given the dev team\nthe default permissions.\n\n153\n00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.543\nThe read permission you can see here.\n\n154\n00:07:50.543 --> 00:07:52.877\nOn the properties of the docs folder.\n\n155\n00:07:52.877 --> 00:07:55.640\nWe've got the read and execute permission.\n\n156\n00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.479\nWe've got the list folder content and,\n\n157\n00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:59.790\nwell, we've got the read\npermission as well.\n\n158\n00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.380\n>> Yeah.\nNow, that works great if all we need Billy\n\n159\n00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.160\nto do is be able to read\nthe contents of the file.\n\n160\n00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.980\nBut if we want him to be\nable to make changes,\n\n161\n00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.850\nit looks like those defaults probably\naren't going to cut the mustard for us.\n\n162\n00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.460\n>> They're not, and\nyou've got to be careful,\n\n163\n00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.670\nbecause the defaults could be more\nrestrictive than you want them to be.\n\n164\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.730\nBut they can also be a little bit less\nrestrictive, but let's go ahead and\n\n165\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.000\nshow what we're talking about here.\n\n166\n00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.868\nSo the dev team,\n\n167\n00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:24.350\nwe definitely want the dev team to\nbe able to read the information.\n\n168\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.520\nBut if I log out here, and we're going\nto log back in as a lady by the name\n\n169\n00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.840\nof Sally,\nnow she's part of the dev team, right?\n\n170\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.260\nSo I want her to have access,\n\n171\n00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.480\nI want her to be able to read\nthe documentation as well.\n\n172\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.050\nBut I want you to see what goes on here.\n\n173\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.890\nWhen she goes into the doc's folder,\n\n174\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.070\nnow I've got an application here called\nBginfo, so it's an executable, and\n\n175\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.680\nwhen I double click on this, notice\nhow she can launch this application.\n\n176\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.930\nSo with the defaults here,\nif I want somebody just to be able to view\n\n177\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.840\nthese documents, well,\nit's a little bit less restrictive.\n\n178\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.660\nSo we do have to make some modifications.\n\n179\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.390\nSo that would be one of the first\nthings I would be looking at\n\n180\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.380\nto make a modification to.\n\n181\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.014\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nlet's switch back over and\n\n182\n00:09:06.014 --> 00:09:09.578\nsee if we can restrict Sally\na little bit more here.\n\n183\n00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.199\nSo what we're gonna do,\n\n184\n00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:17.210\nwe'll go back to our permissions\nlist on that documents folder here.\n\n185\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.650\nWe're gonna choose security.\n\n186\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.760\nAll right.\n\n187\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.200\nAnd you can see just under my name there,\nWes, give it a second there,\n\n188\n00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.680\nthere's the dev team, and\nwe're gonna choose edit here.\n\n189\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.550\nAnd one of the things I want you to see,\n\n190\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.000\nwe're going to remove,\nnot the read permission.\n\n191\n00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.240\nWhat we're going to do is we're going to\nremove the read and execute permission.\n\n192\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.900\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nchoose okay.\n\n193\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.590\nWe'll choose okay again.\n\n194\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.110\nAnd now let's see if\nthat's restricted Sally,\n\n195\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.160\nat least,\nfrom being able to run those programs.\n\n196\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.430\nWe'll find out here in a second.\n\n197\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.168\nWait for it.\n\n198\n00:09:57.022 --> 00:10:00.306\nAnd when we browse back\ninto that location,\n\n199\n00:10:00.306 --> 00:10:05.380\nhopefully what we'll see is, and\njust as a real quick adjustment.\n\n200\n00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.910\nNotice what it says here.\n\n201\n00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.270\nIt says, no,\n\n202\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.290\nyou don't have the appropriate\npermissions to run this application,\n\n203\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.510\nand that might be what I want, but\nthat doesn't stop old Brian, right?\n\n204\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.860\nBrian's our manager.\n\n205\n00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.490\nMaybe I want Brian to be able\nto do a read and execute.\n\n206\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.230\nAnd like Dan said, go even farther.\n\n207\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.420\nMaybe I want him to be able to make\nmodifications to any of the documents in\n\n208\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.000\nhere cuz as that administrator, maybe he\nhas to update things like network docs.\n\n209\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.830\nThe problem is Brian had\nthe read functionality, but\n\n210\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.310\nhe didn't have the ability\nto make changes.\n\n211\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.010\nWell let's go ahead and we'll modify that.\n\n212\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.590\nWe'll change that.\n\n213\n00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.880\nAll right.\n\n214\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.650\nSo we'll go ahead here and\nwe'll get logged back in.\n\n215\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.365\nAnd here's where you might have to, we\ntalk about being you know, an easier way\n\n216\n00:10:55.365 --> 00:10:59.475\nto manage your permissions is to manage\nthem on a group-by-group basis and not\n\n217\n00:10:59.475 --> 00:11:02.865\nreally on a user-by-user base, especially\nif you've got hundreds of users.\n\n218\n00:11:02.865 --> 00:11:06.707\nWell you might have to make modifications\nbased on the user here, so.\n\n219\n00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:09.257\nLet's go ahead and do an edit to this.\n\n220\n00:11:09.257 --> 00:11:12.067\nWe'll do an add here and\nnow we're gonna pick on old Billy.\n\n221\n00:11:13.217 --> 00:11:15.297\nWe're gonna add Billy's name to the list.\n\n222\n00:11:15.297 --> 00:11:16.027\nAll right.\n\n223\n00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:18.477\nBecause some of the permissions\nthat I want Billy to have,\n\n224\n00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:19.900\nI only want Billy to have.\n\n225\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.920\nI don't want everybody to have them.\n\n226\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.180\nSo now what I can do is I can\ngo to Billy's account here.\n\n227\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.550\nNotice Billy has read and execute.\n\n228\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.670\nBilly also has read all right,\n\n229\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.630\nbut what I can do here is I can add\nmodify to the list oop not full control.\n\n230\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.155\nNo, that is modify okay.\n\n231\n00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:36.590\n>> I was like yes!\n\n232\n00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.370\n>> Yes, yes now we have the power.\n\n233\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:44.790\nAll right now choose okay, and now let's\nsee, moving back over to Billy's account.\n\n234\n00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.077\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:11:47.077 --> 00:11:51.320\nGo ahead and log back in as old Billy.\n\n236\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:54.910\nAll right.\n\n237\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.040\nAnd now that Billy's got read and\nexecute, and he's got the ability,\n\n238\n00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.820\nlet's see if he's got the ability to make\nsome modifications to his documentations.\n\n239\n00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.450\nNow one of the telltale signs that Billy\ncan make changes to this document is that\n\n240\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.570\nMicrosoft Word or\nOffice Word, if you will.\n\n241\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.310\nIt understands the permissions.\n\n242\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.080\nSo if I set this to read-only this folder,\nautomatically Words gonna pick up on that\n\n243\n00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.370\nand you'll see this little in parenthesis\nover here it'll say read-only,\n\n244\n00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.720\nnotice you don't see the read-only.\n\n245\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.060\nSo that should mean.\n\n246\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.560\nHopefully if everything's gone all right.\n\n247\n00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.680\nOops.\n\n248\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.490\nMaybe we add a DNS server.\n\n249\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.460\nRight.\nWe wanna add the IP address.\n\n250\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.310\nAnd we do a save here.\n\n251\n00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.650\nNotice that Billy can make changes.\n\n252\n00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.950\nHe can make changes to the documents.\n\n253\n00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.690\nAnd we're still good with that.\n\n254\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.900\nNow let's see if with old Sally, if she\ncan make any changes to the documentation.\n\n255\n00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.820\nLet's see if we've implemented what's\nknown as Principle of Least Privilege.\n\n256\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.490\n>> Oh, yeah, that's a really good concept\nthat everyone should be familiar with.\n\n257\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.990\nWes, it's basically\nan industry standard term.\n\n258\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.360\nCan you explain that for me?\n\n259\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.270\nMaybe we have a few viewers that\nhave never heard of that before.\n\n260\n00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:05.960\n>> Yeah.\nDefinitely.\n\n261\n00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.160\nSo when we talk about\nthe Principle of Least Privilege,\n\n262\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.360\nwhat we're talking about is I\ngive you exactly what you need,\n\n263\n00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.600\nthe level of access that you\nneed to perform your job.\n\n264\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.970\nNo more, no less.\n\n265\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:16.570\nRight?\n\n266\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.130\nWe gave the defaults to the dev team and\n\n267\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.070\nunfortunately those defaults\ngave her too much access.\n\n268\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.480\nAll right.\nShe could execute those programs.\n\n269\n00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.860\nThat's not what we wanted.\n\n270\n00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.490\nSo what we're doing here as kinda like\na due diligence, is we're following up to\n\n271\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.980\nmake sure that she's got just\nthe permissions that she should have.\n\n272\n00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.730\nAnd see if we can get a, there we go.\n\n273\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.290\nSo notice there Read-Only.\n\n274\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.160\nAll right.\nWith the Read-Only,\n\n275\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.980\nthat lets you know that you're not gonna\nbe able to make any modifications.\n\n276\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.180\nNow let's also go ahead and\ndouble check Billy here.\n\n277\n00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.700\nLet's see if Billy can execute anything\n\n278\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.680\nthat's in that folder with the read and\nexecute permission that\n\n279\n00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.080\nwe gave him because remember if\nwe put me as an administrative.\n\n280\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.820\nI put multiple applications and\n\n281\n00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.810\nhere I wanna verify that he\ncan run them if he needs to.\n\n282\n00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.190\nAnd sure enough,\nall right one of the things that we see\n\n283\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.560\nis that Billy has the ability\nto run these applications.\n\n284\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.520\nSo we've basically set Billy up.\n\n285\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.390\nAll right.\nBilly has been set\n\n286\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.600\nup with the read permission.\n\n287\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.940\nThe read and execute permission,\nthe modify permission as well.\n\n288\n00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.840\nAll right.\n\n289\n00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.140\nWe've also double checked that\nSally can view the documents.\n\n290\n00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.650\nBut she can't make\nmodifications to the documents.\n\n291\n00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.880\nSo with the NTFS permissions here,\nit's a real good way that you can control\n\n292\n00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.820\nthe level of access that somebody\nhas to your files and folders.\n\n293\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.100\nNow there's standard permissions.\n\n294\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.120\nOne of the things that we need\nto keep in mind is that there's\n\n295\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.900\nalso a finer level of control that\nwe could potentially get as well.\n\n296\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.880\nThat finer level of control is through\nwhat is known as special permissions.\n\n297\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.390\n>> Is that the little grayed\nout at the bottom there,\n\n298\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.913\nit says special permissions and\nyou can't really do anything with it?\n\n299\n00:15:03.913 --> 00:15:05.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n300\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.630\nNow, we've talked about so\nfar with just modify full control.\n\n301\n00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.650\nWe talked about right.\n\n302\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.900\nThese are standard NTFS permissions.\n\n303\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.180\nMicrosoft says for most account, you\nknow most situations and scenarios that\n\n304\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.400\nyou should be able to just get by on the\nstandard permissions and one of the things\n\n305\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.650\nwe also have to worry about is\ntroubleshooting resource access problems.\n\n306\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.650\nI want you to notice something.\n\n307\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.755\nLet me go ahead and log back in as me.\n\n308\n00:15:34.282 --> 00:15:38.168\nAll right.\n\n309\n00:15:38.168 --> 00:15:43.340\nAnd when I come to the access control\nlist or the permissions list here.\n\n310\n00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.075\nAll right.\nAnd I select any user or\n\n311\n00:15:45.075 --> 00:15:49.949\ngroup that's in the list I can see\nright away the basic permissions,\n\n312\n00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:53.325\nbut what I can't see\nare special permissions.\n\n313\n00:15:53.325 --> 00:15:54.440\nSo what's that all about?\n\n314\n00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.537\nWell, these basic five permissions, six\nif you include the list folder contents.\n\n315\n00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:00.895\nIt's only on folders.\n\n316\n00:16:00.895 --> 00:16:07.320\nThey also have a subset of\naccess level that they give you.\n\n317\n00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.160\nSo even though we see the basic.\n\n318\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.860\nLet's find out.\n\n319\n00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.840\nWhere's Billy in the list?\n\n320\n00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.100\nThere's Billy.\nLet's keep picking on him.\n\n321\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.350\nAll right.\n\n322\n00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.050\nAnd here is those basic permissions,\nagain.\n\n323\n00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.050\nNot much difference, right?\n\n324\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.400\nAnd like Dan said, special\npermissions are even great out here.\n\n325\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.800\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\n326\n00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:29.870\nWell, notice we have this show advance\npermissions task link over here.\n\n327\n00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:36.040\nAnd when I choose that, oop, now we're\ngonna make it a little bit more difficult.\n\n328\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.750\nNotice that we have a column of\nadditional permissions on one side.\n\n329\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.130\nAnd we have additional\npermissions on the other side.\n\n330\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.410\nNow that is because each one\nof these permissions, for\n\n331\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.000\ninstance if I give somebody\nthe read level access.\n\n332\n00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.810\nRead access gives them read\npermissions over here.\n\n333\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.130\nRight.\n\n334\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.500\nThat gives them read extended attributes,\nread attributes,\n\n335\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.550\nlist folder and read data.\n\n336\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.035\nSo maybe.\n\n337\n00:17:07.035 --> 00:17:07.985\nIf you want.\n\n338\n00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:11.655\nYou don't want to give somebody\nthe ability to change documents.\n\n339\n00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:16.555\nMaybe you only want them modifying\nlet's say, for instance, and tributes.\n\n340\n00:17:16.555 --> 00:17:19.845\nI don't have to give them\nthe right permission.\n\n341\n00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:23.400\nAll right, notice that If I\nuncheck the write permission and\n\n342\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.260\ngo back to show advanced,\nnotice that the write attributes has gone.\n\n343\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:27.880\nAll right.\n\n344\n00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.310\nAnything that starts with\nwrite is gonna be removed.\n\n345\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:36.070\nBut maybe I want somebody to be able to\nmodify the attributes within a document.\n\n346\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.210\nIn that case, what I can do is just apply\n\n347\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.230\nthat write attributes feature\nto Billy's account here.\n\n348\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.260\nAnd we can choose OK to that.\n\n349\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.980\nWe'll choose OK or apply.\n\n350\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.380\nNo different here.\n\n351\n00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.160\nAnd we'll choose OK again.\n\n352\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.300\nNow, I kind of did that quick.\n\n353\n00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.560\nI want to show you that\npermissions list again.\n\n354\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.420\nAnd this is one of the things\nyou have to be careful with.\n\n355\n00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.950\nSee, when we're troubleshooting\nresource access problems,\n\n356\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.790\nif somebody doesn't have\nthe ability to modify a document.\n\n357\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.790\nI can look right here and\n\n358\n00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.510\nnotice that modify is gone,\nthere's no check mark there.\n\n359\n00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.690\nAll right.\n\n360\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.820\nWhen you start getting into special\npermissions, however, it gets very,\n\n361\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.610\nvery difficult to\ntroubleshoot resource access.\n\n362\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.270\nWhy?\n\n363\n00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.620\nWell, under special permissions,\nall I have is this little list.\n\n364\n00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.326\nThat's all I have.\n\n365\n00:18:21.326 --> 00:18:22.679\nAll right.\n\n366\n00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:25.040\nSo let me go ahead and choose OK to that.\n\n367\n00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.030\nAnd let's see what Billy can do now.\n\n368\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.920\nAll right.\nSo we'll go ahead and.\n\n369\n00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.710\nChange users here.\n\n370\n00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.210\nOne more time.\n\n371\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.479\nWe'll log back in as Billy.\n\n372\n00:18:39.229 --> 00:18:40.430\nAll right.\n\n373\n00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.540\nNow, opening that\nDocuments folder back up.\n\n374\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.640\nAll right, we got a read only, right?\n\n375\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.937\nSo we still can read.\n\n376\n00:18:50.937 --> 00:18:55.354\nBut I want you to notice another thing.\n\n377\n00:18:55.354 --> 00:19:01.012\nBilly can not delete if he tries to\nthe legal paper rename he can rename,\n\n378\n00:19:01.012 --> 00:19:03.980\nbut he can delete all right.\n\n379\n00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.400\nNotice it prompts inference\nministering to credentials.\n\n380\n00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.170\nSo he can't he cannot make a delete\nthis document which is what we want.\n\n381\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.030\nBut can he modify the document\nin any other way?\n\n382\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.397\nAnd that's where the properties come in.\n\n383\n00:19:15.397 --> 00:19:19.856\nBecause we gave him just\nthe special permission, all right,\n\n384\n00:19:19.856 --> 00:19:22.354\nof writing extended attributes.\n\n385\n00:19:22.354 --> 00:19:27.150\nIf he chooses read only and chooses apply,\nnotice it didn't give him a hard time.\n\n386\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:32.120\nThe reason it didn't give him a hard\ntime is because we specifically said\n\n387\n00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.920\non that special permission.\n\n388\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.790\nI only want to give you\nthe right attributes.\n\n389\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.240\nWe could go farther than that,\nwe could say right extended attributes.\n\n390\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.000\nAll right, oops, shut that down.\n\n391\n00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.910\nOr Wes could click all over the place and\neventually we will load it up.\n\n392\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:53.390\nLet's go and use Advanced Attributes and\nchoose Compression.\n\n393\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.040\nAnd then choose OK.\n\n394\n00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.270\nAnd then OK again.\n\n395\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.860\nAll right.\n\n396\n00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.160\nNow, what's that about?\n\n397\n00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.130\nWe said that he could change attributes.\n\n398\n00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.370\nWe gave him the write\nattribute permission.\n\n399\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.530\nBut yet he's getting an access denied\nhere and it's gonna challenge him.\n\n400\n00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.450\nRight?\nIt's gonna say put in\n\n401\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.970\nyour administrative credentials\nif you wanna do this.\n\n402\n00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.839\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nleave that to the side for now.\n\n403\n00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.640\nLet's find out what's going on with that.\n\n404\n00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.480\nWhy can't he change that attribute?\n\n405\n00:20:23.187 --> 00:20:25.330\nSo we'll go ahead and log back in.\n\n406\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.440\nAnd I want you to see something here.\n\n407\n00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.610\nNotice with the properties,\nsame place, Security tab.\n\n408\n00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.790\nWe're going to that Advance button,\neventually.\n\n409\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.580\nAnd we're gonna find Billy's\ncredentials here, or username.\n\n410\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.270\nWe're gonna go back to write attributes.\n\n411\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.160\nAnd then if you notice here, there's\nanother option, write extended attributes.\n\n412\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.220\nThe extended attributes are the ones\nthat it was blocking him from changing.\n\n413\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.950\nAll right.\nSo maybe you don't wanna give\n\n414\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.670\nhim the ability to encrypt a document or\nto compress a document.\n\n415\n00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.920\nWe're gonna talk about attributes\ncoming up in another episode.\n\n416\n00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.350\nBut notice that he doesn't\nhave that ability.\n\n417\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.310\nSo with the extended, or\nthe special permission, excuse me.\n\n418\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:14.000\nWe can really rifle down on, specifically\nwhat we want to give somebody access.\n\n419\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.030\nAnd again, principal least privilege\nreducing it down, just to what you need,\n\n420\n00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.820\nbut it gets very difficult to\ntroubleshoot resource access problems.\n\n421\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.090\nCuz all you get is that little\nspecial permissions check mark.\n\n422\n00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.770\n>> Yeah, so\n\n423\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.470\nthe standard permission that you have\nthat we'd normally end up working with.\n\n424\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.280\nIt's kind of like the shotgun approach,\nright.\n\n425\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.980\nI hit it with the with\nthe right permissions.\n\n426\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.880\nAnd he gets all the right permissions\nthat are that are available.\n\n427\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.470\nBut if I need that sniper's\nbullet I really need to find tune\n\n428\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.362\nhow Billy access is a certain resource.\n\n429\n00:21:41.362 --> 00:21:43.920\nI'm gonna want to go into\nthat special permissions.\n\n430\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.740\nFind the exact right ones for\nBilly's situation.\n\n431\n00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.420\nAnd check those off make sure that I,\nI go in and be more surgical in my strike.\n\n432\n00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.312\nAs it works for those permissions.\n\n433\n00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:55.479\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n434\n00:21:55.479 --> 00:21:57.840\nSo with the N.T.F.S. permissions.\n\n435\n00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.340\nAgain we've got our standard permissions,\nthey're easier to manage and\n\n436\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.940\nmaintain, all right.\n\n437\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.060\nWhen it comes into special permissions, it\nreally allows you to rifle down in on what\n\n438\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.890\nyou wanna do, or what level of\naccess you wanna give somebody.\n\n439\n00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:14.834\nBut the problem with that is it\ndoes get problematic when you can't\n\n440\n00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:18.021\nfigure out what permissions you've set.\n\n441\n00:22:18.021 --> 00:22:19.771\nIt might not have been you,\nit might not been you.\n\n442\n00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:24.700\nIt might have been another admin, and\nhopefully we've got documentation there.\n\n443\n00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.460\nIf we don't have documentation we're\nnot going to be able to track it.\n\n444\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.180\n>> Much more of an administrative\nnightmare when come to trying to.\n\n445\n00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.305\nOh goodness who said,\nthank goodness for event logs?\n\n446\n00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:34.065\n>> That's right.\n\n447\n00:22:34.065 --> 00:22:34.605\nThat's right.\n\n448\n00:22:34.605 --> 00:22:37.752\n>> Now Wes, when it comes to permissions\nwe've talked about the NCSF permissions,\n\n449\n00:22:37.752 --> 00:22:40.375\nthe standard permissions,\nthe special permissions.\n\n450\n00:22:40.375 --> 00:22:45.485\nNow we've got to throw in the old\ncurveball of the shared permissions.\n\n451\n00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:47.045\n>> Yes.\nShared permissions.\n\n452\n00:22:47.045 --> 00:22:48.155\nNow what are we talking about?\n\n453\n00:22:48.155 --> 00:22:51.010\nWell, we've got another\nset of permissions.\n\n454\n00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:55.010\nSee NTFS permissions, one of the things\nthat we have to understand is that it\n\n455\n00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.760\napplies when I'm sitting at\nthe computer that I'm logged into.\n\n456\n00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.120\nAll right?\nWhen I'm logged into a computer that.\n\n457\n00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.670\nHas these files or folders shared out,\nNTFS permissions apply and\n\n458\n00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.350\nI don't have to worry\nabout shared permissions.\n\n459\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.644\nBut the moment I move to another machine,\nconnect back over the network,\n\n460\n00:23:12.644 --> 00:23:15.978\nto the same machine I was\noriginally sitting in front of.\n\n461\n00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:19.516\nNow we've got an extra set of permissions\nthat we've got to consider and\n\n462\n00:23:19.516 --> 00:23:21.896\nthat's where the shared\npermission to come in.\n\n463\n00:23:21.896 --> 00:23:26.040\nSo let's go ahead and let's show you\na little bit about the shared permissions.\n\n464\n00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.100\nNow, in my Documents folder here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and create a share.\n\n465\n00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.870\nAll right.\nSo, how are we gonna do that?\n\n466\n00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.760\nSimple.\n\n467\n00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.620\nI'll create a folder.\n\n468\n00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.860\nWe're gonna call it Share.\n\n469\n00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.005\nNot too creative on that one.\n\n470\n00:23:36.005 --> 00:23:38.340\n>> [LAUGH] And yet very descriptive.\n\n471\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.120\n>> Very good.\nVery good.\n\n472\n00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.830\nYes, that's right.\n\n473\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.990\nAnd we're gonna choose Properties.\n\n474\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.150\nNow we're to go to the sharing tab.\n\n475\n00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.060\nNow to share a folder,\npretty straightforward.\n\n476\n00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.871\nAll right.\nI'm gonna choose the advanced\n\n477\n00:23:48.871 --> 00:23:53.147\nsharing option to share this folder and\nwe'll leave the name the way it is.\n\n478\n00:23:53.147 --> 00:23:55.041\nAnd we're gonna choose the permissions.\n\n479\n00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:59.201\nNow, notice that we don't\nget The same amount of\n\n480\n00:23:59.201 --> 00:24:02.146\npermissions that we do with NTFS.\n\n481\n00:24:02.146 --> 00:24:04.226\nShare permissions\nare a little bit more vague.\n\n482\n00:24:04.226 --> 00:24:05.892\nNTFS permissions allow,\n\n483\n00:24:05.892 --> 00:24:10.684\neven without special permissions,\nallow finer granular set of control.\n\n484\n00:24:10.684 --> 00:24:15.480\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're going to give everyone full control\n\n485\n00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.220\nshare permissions, and\nwe'll choose OK and then close.\n\n486\n00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.790\nAll right, now,\nif everything's gone all right,\n\n487\n00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.980\nhopefully we're going to find out here.\n\n488\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.640\nAll right, we should have the ability\nto switch over to our other machine.\n\n489\n00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.440\nAll right, and let me make sure,\nwe're logged in as Sally.\n\n490\n00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.630\nI'll tell you what, let me go ahead and\njust log in as Billy.\n\n491\n00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.640\nSince we're picking on Billy,\nlet's keep on picking on Billy.\n\n492\n00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.470\nNow we're all in CL2, Client 02.\n\n493\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.348\nAnd the shared folder\nresides on Client 01.\n\n494\n00:24:47.348 --> 00:24:51.910\nSo we're connecting over the network\nback to where that shared resource is.\n\n495\n00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.840\n>> This is different from the way we're\ndoing it before, where we had one machine.\n\n496\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.680\nAll the users were logging on to that\nmachine, so when Dewey was done,\n\n497\n00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.840\nhe would get up and walk away.\n\n498\n00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.020\nWesley would come sit down,\nadministrative tasks.\n\n499\n00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.930\nSally or whoever else he had, they\nwould come in, they would sit down and\n\n500\n00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:05.850\ndo their job.\n\n501\n00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.440\nNow we've got a true\nnetworked environment.\n\n502\n00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.066\nYou've got CL01, CL02,\ntwo client machines networked together,\n\n503\n00:25:12.066 --> 00:25:14.620\naccessing a resource over that network,\nright?\n\n504\n00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.980\n>> That's exactly it, so we're gonna go\nahead and I've got that share pulled up.\n\n505\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.550\nWhile, it's typing in the UNC path here,\nand notice we've got the share.\n\n506\n00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.910\nNotice we've also got a problem here too.\n\n507\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.320\nIt says cannot access the share.\n\n508\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.040\nWell, Dan, I thought we gave\neveryone full control, and\n\n509\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.690\nhere's a special consideration when\nit comes to shared permissions.\n\n510\n00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.010\nNTFS permissions are always in effect.\n\n511\n00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.290\nIt doesn't matter if I'm logged\nin locally to CL2, or CL1,\n\n512\n00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.050\nexcuse me, where we shared the folder,\nand CFS is in effect.\n\n513\n00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.630\nWe moved over to CL2,\nconnected back over the network.\n\n514\n00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.170\nWell guess what?\n\n515\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.190\nNTFS isn't letting us off the hook.\n\n516\n00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.350\nIt's still in effect.\n\n517\n00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.620\nBut now we've also got\nthe share permissions.\n\n518\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.900\nSo now that you talk\nabout a shared resource,\n\n519\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.870\nwe have to worry about NTFS likewise.\n\n520\n00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:08.320\nSo let's go ahead, and we'll switch\nback over to our other machine and\n\n521\n00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.860\nverify that our dev team has\nthe appropriate NTFS permissions.\n\n522\n00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.270\nAnd let's see.\n\n523\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.840\nSo if you remember, just double checking,\nalways double check.\n\n524\n00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.860\nEveryone's got full control here share.\n\n525\n00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.400\nLet's find out what we see\nhere in the NTFS permissions.\n\n526\n00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.840\nNotice that the dev team isn't here,\nall right.\n\n527\n00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.230\nThe dev team isn't here.\n\n528\n00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.190\nIf they don't have the appropriate\nlevel of NTFS permissions,\n\n529\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:38.000\nit doesn't matter what your share\npermissions would get them.\n\n530\n00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.302\nLike you can see we gave you full control.\n\n531\n00:26:39.302 --> 00:26:41.730\nAnd they still can't access it.\n\n532\n00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.010\nSo what we're going to go ahead and\ndo is we're to choose Add,\n\n533\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.570\nwe're going to put our dev team in here.\n\n534\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.602\nDo a check names if you want,\nand choose OK.\n\n535\n00:26:49.602 --> 00:26:54.130\nAll right, and what I'm going to\ndo is just leave the defaults.\n\n536\n00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.590\nWe're not going to get too\npicky on the defaults.\n\n537\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.231\nRead and execute, list folder contents and\nread, and we'll choose OK, and then close.\n\n538\n00:27:00.231 --> 00:27:05.530\nNow we're gonna switch back over to the\nmachine that Billy couldn't access before.\n\n539\n00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.480\nAll right, and\nwe'll type it in again, so \\\\CL01.\n\n540\n00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.280\nAnd it's going to be whatever the share\nname is, in this case, it's share.\n\n541\n00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.840\nNow notice that when Billy\ntries to access this file or\n\n542\n00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.270\nthe folder, the shared folder, the shared\nresource, he can now gain access to it.\n\n543\n00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.980\nAll right, now next thing.\n\n544\n00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.320\nLet's find out,\nwe create anything in here?\n\n545\n00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.390\nAnd notice it says, you need\nthe permission to perform this action.\n\n546\n00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.710\nThat's another thing to keep in mind.\n\n547\n00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.990\nIf they're going to make modifications,\nthe share permissions are full control.\n\n548\n00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:49.030\nWe're going to set those NTFS\npermissions to modify as well.\n\n549\n00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.400\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that real quick and\n\n550\n00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.450\nsee if that solves our\nresource access problems.\n\n551\n00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.730\nSo, we'll go back to the Properties.\n\n552\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.953\nGo to our Security tab,\nwe'll find Billy in the list.\n\n553\n00:28:00.115 --> 00:28:03.035\nAnd we'll choose Edit.\n\n554\n00:28:03.035 --> 00:28:06.400\nIn fact we're going to do\nthis to the dev team here.\n\n555\n00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.770\nWe'll just keep it we'll\nkeep it consistent we'll get\n\n556\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.240\nthe the whole dev team.\n\n557\n00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.335\nModify, choose OK.\n\n558\n00:28:13.335 --> 00:28:16.740\nAnd let's switch back over to\nour other machine here, and\n\n559\n00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:21.218\nlet's see if it's updated Billy's\npermissions on the NTFS permissions.\n\n560\n00:28:21.218 --> 00:28:26.140\nRight-click, choose New,\noh, and it did not.\n\n561\n00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.882\nWell-\n>> Refresh the-\n\n562\n00:28:27.882 --> 00:28:28.427\n>> Yeah.\n\n563\n00:28:28.427 --> 00:28:30.806\nLet's see here.\n\n564\n00:28:30.806 --> 00:28:33.300\nLet me just double, oh, and you know what?\n\n565\n00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.210\nIf you're going to set the permission,\nyou have to set it on the right folder.\n\n566\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:37.890\n>> It does help.\n\n567\n00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:41.970\n>> It does help if you\nset on the right folder.\n\n568\n00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:42.515\nAll right.\n\n569\n00:28:42.515 --> 00:28:44.047\n>> [LAUGH] This happens to everybody.\n\n570\n00:28:44.047 --> 00:28:44.894\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n571\n00:28:44.894 --> 00:28:46.519\n>> [INAUDIBLE] than I care to get into.\n\n572\n00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:49.454\n[LAUGH]\n>> So when you're testing resource access\n\n573\n00:28:49.454 --> 00:28:52.123\nproblems, make sure you're\ntesting the right resources.\n\n574\n00:28:52.123 --> 00:28:56.525\n>> So one of the last things I always did\nwhen I was testing permissions was I would\n\n575\n00:28:56.525 --> 00:28:58.015\ne-mail the user and say,\n\n576\n00:28:58.015 --> 00:29:02.100\nlet me know if you're able to do this\nbefore I sign off on my work ticket.\n\n577\n00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.772\n>> Good advice, good advice.\n>> And until I get that,\n\n578\n00:29:03.772 --> 00:29:07.250\nif everything's working,\nI kept that ticket open.\n\n579\n00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:11.140\n>> Yeah, so let's go ahead and Wes'll\nset the right permission this time and\n\n580\n00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.640\nwe'll edit the dev team's permissions\nhere on the right resource.\n\n581\n00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:22.640\nWell add Modify to it, choose OK,\nand give it a second, wait for it.\n\n582\n00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.040\nWait for it some more.\n\n583\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.740\nAnd then hopefully if we browse back over,\nlet's see if that's updated.\n\n584\n00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.369\nOr if I was a little too impatient.\n\n585\n00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.099\nYeah, that was probably impatient.\n\n586\n00:29:36.099 --> 00:29:40.740\nA little too impatient there,\nlooks like it's thinking about it there.\n\n587\n00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.970\nSo hopefully it doesn't\nthink about it too much.\n\n588\n00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:43.500\nYou know what?\n\n589\n00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.969\nI'm going to go ahead and\ncancel that real quick [LAUGH] or not.\n\n590\n00:29:54.101 --> 00:29:59.500\nYes, yes, yes, yes, try that again.\n\n591\n00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.890\nAnd there's the dev team,\nthey've got Modify, okay.\n\n592\n00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:08.270\nSo hopefully what we'll see now is\nwe can make changes to that folder.\n\n593\n00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:08.806\nAnd there we go.\n\n594\n00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:15.550\nSo yay, for changes.\n\n595\n00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.053\nAll right, so now they have a level\nof access that you want them to.\n\n596\n00:30:19.053 --> 00:30:24.000\nI do wanna mention one more thing\nabout the share permissions and\n\n597\n00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.400\nthe NTFS permissions.\n\n598\n00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.110\nNotice that we have full control share.\n\n599\n00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.540\nWe have Modify on the NTFS permissions.\n\n600\n00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.417\nOne of the things that you have to make\nsure, is that you set them appropriately.\n\n601\n00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:41.594\nBecause the most restrictive\npermission is the one that wins out.\n\n602\n00:30:41.594 --> 00:30:43.742\nNotice we have Full Control and Modify.\n\n603\n00:30:43.742 --> 00:30:48.257\nAll right, Modify is a little bit\nmore restrictive than Full Control.\n\n604\n00:30:48.257 --> 00:30:52.775\nSo on this, at the surface level here,\nyyou might not see any restrictions or\n\n605\n00:30:52.775 --> 00:30:54.950\nnot understand what's going on.\n\n606\n00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:59.934\nLet's see if we can set ourselves up\nkind of our failure here on this one.\n\n607\n00:30:59.934 --> 00:31:04.200\nRight so what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to take the share permissions.\n\n608\n00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.630\nI'm not going to I'm not doing any\nchanges to the Security tab here.\n\n609\n00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.420\nI'm just gonna reduce the sharing\npermissions a little bit.\n\n610\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.500\nActually a lot of it.\n\n611\n00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.228\nAnd we're going to move this down to read.\n\n612\n00:31:16.228 --> 00:31:20.000\nAnd we're going to choose OK to that.\n\n613\n00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.160\nWe'll choose OK again and\nhopefully that modifies it like we want.\n\n614\n00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.364\nSo, the next thing we're gonna do is\nlet's try to make another folder in here.\n\n615\n00:31:33.465 --> 00:31:35.630\nNotice it didn't allow me to.\n\n616\n00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.460\nAll right,\nyou have to be careful with that.\n\n617\n00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.100\nYou can run into additional\nresource access problems.\n\n618\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:46.220\nIf you set the share permissions\nmore restrictive than the NTFS,\n\n619\n00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.990\nand honestly on this one then it doesn't\nmatter which side of the tracks, whichever\n\n620\n00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.470\nis the most restrictive permission\nis the one that tends to win out.\n\n621\n00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.850\nSo as a best practice on this,\na lot of times administrators, so\n\n622\n00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:00.940\nthey only have to troubleshoot one\nside of the tracks, NTFS versus share,\n\n623\n00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.740\nwhat they'll do is they'll set the share\npermissions to full control everybody, and\n\n624\n00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:11.510\nthey were strict with the finer granular\nsettings that you can set inside of NTFS.\n\n625\n00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:15.180\nBut if somebody doesn't have shared\nlevel access and you think they should,\n\n626\n00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.620\none of the things you want to come back,\nis you want to test and\n\n627\n00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.550\nmake sure that the share permissions and\nthe NTFS permissions match,\n\n628\n00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.940\nto give you the effect that\nlevel of access that you need.\n\n629\n00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.985\n>> Yes,\nit can definitely be a little confusing,\n\n630\n00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:29.427\nso especially when someone's asking you,\nI don't have permissions in this.\n\n631\n00:32:29.427 --> 00:32:32.450\nYou're looking at a set of permissions,\neverything looks right.\n\n632\n00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.820\nAnd you're thinking to yourself, why do\nthey not have the correct permissions?\n\n633\n00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.920\nGotta remember, is it on a share?\n\n634\n00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.870\nMaybe those share permissions\nare causing a conflict and\n\n635\n00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.430\nthen that's why they're\nnot able to get in there.\n\n636\n00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:48.420\nSo you gotta remember that if it is\non a shared drive, that you've gotta\n\n637\n00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:53.100\ncheck both to make sure one's not trumping\nthe other and stopping the access.\n\n638\n00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.450\nWes, is there anything else we\nneed to know about permissions\n\n639\n00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.770\nbefore we call it a day?\n\n640\n00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:58.830\n>> They can be tough.\n\n641\n00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.410\nDo your research.\n\n642\n00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.300\nStick with standard NTFS permissions.\n\n643\n00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.730\nYou get into special permissions,\nyou could cause problems, but\n\n644\n00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.950\nthey're there for a reason, so use them.\n\n645\n00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.521\nBut when it comes down to it, just make\nsure that you're setting them correctly.\n\n646\n00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:12.676\n>> Awesome.\nWell, looks like we've come to the end of\n\n647\n00:33:12.676 --> 00:33:15.500\nyet another excellent\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n648\n00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.510\nThank you for watching.\n\n649\n00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:20.010\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n650\n00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.692\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan, and\nwe'll see you

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.470\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery and\ntoday's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.640\nwe are going to be moving into more of the\nWindows 10 security content that we have,\n\n5\n00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.390\nwhich is specifically\ncalling out data security.\n\n6\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.000\nNow we had a previous episode\nif you haven't seen that,\n\n7\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.280\nyou should check that out.\n\n8\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.250\nAnd it was all about how we can secure\ndata using NTFS as permissions,\n\n9\n00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.420\nboth standard and special, and\nalso using the good old share permissions,\n\n10\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.330\nas well, how they work together.\n\n11\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.520\nNow in today's episode, we're gonna talk\nabout a thing called effective access.\n\n12\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.590\nI brought along Mr.\nWes Brian here to help us out with this.\n\n13\n00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.670\nHe's an expert on all things permissions.\n\n14\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.080\nSo, [LAUGH] who better in\nwhich to do this episode with.\n\n15\n00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.470\nWes, thanks for joining the show today.\n\n16\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.590\nEffective access, where do we begin?\n\n17\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.720\n>> Very good, now, just like Dan says,\nwe gotta permission here,\n\n18\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.420\nwe gotta permission there, is it a special\npermission, is it a shared permission?\n\n19\n00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.940\nWhat do we have to make it\na little bit easier to figure out,\n\n20\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.030\nwhat level of access does\nsomebody have to a file or\n\n21\n00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.240\nfolder without having to call him up and\nsay hey, can you login to that computer?\n\n22\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.178\nI would really like to find out\nwhether you can access it or not.\n\n23\n00:01:15.178 --> 00:01:18.730\nAnd that's where effective\naccess comes into play for us.\n\n24\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.040\nSo, let's go ahead and check that out.\n\n25\n00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.633\nI've got a file on my desktop\nhere called strong passwords.\n\n26\n00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:29.050\nWe're gonna see if anybody can\ngo get into this file here.\n\n27\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.270\nI'm gonna go ahead and right-click on it,\nwe're going to use Properties.\n\n28\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.300\nRemember, when we're talking\nabout NTFS permissions,\n\n29\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.990\nwe're typically dealing\nwith our Security tab.\n\n30\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.630\nOne of the things to be\ncareful with this one,\n\n31\n00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.730\nis because to go into effective access, it\ndoes show you share permissions as well.\n\n32\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.860\nSo don't let that confuse you.\n\n33\n00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.996\nIt's still from the Security tab,\nwhere you modify NTFS permissions, and\n\n34\n00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:51.616\nit's this Advanced button down here.\n\n35\n00:01:51.616 --> 00:01:53.694\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n36\n00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:59.876\nAll right, so we've got our advanced\nsecurity settings for this file, open.\n\n37\n00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:02.410\nAnd notice that I can manipulate\nthe permissions here.\n\n38\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.180\nI can also set share permissions,\nbut what we're really looking at,\n\n39\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.935\nwhat's most important for us here,\nis the Effective Access tab.\n\n40\n00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:12.315\nNow, when we first look at\nthe Effective Access tab, Dan,\n\n41\n00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:15.595\none of the things you're gonna notice is,\nit doesn't look too effective, it's blank.\n\n42\n00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:19.303\nWell, that's because we haven't\ntold it who we're looking for.\n\n43\n00:02:19.303 --> 00:02:21.875\nNow we're gonna go ahead,\nand what we're gonna do is,\n\n44\n00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.626\nwe have a user here on this machine,\nand his name's Billy.\n\n45\n00:02:24.626 --> 00:02:28.826\nAnd I'd like to find out, well, what kind\nof access does Billy have to my strong\n\n46\n00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:32.791\npassword file, if I was to leave this\nconfiguration right where it is now?\n\n47\n00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.280\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n48\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.450\nNow you can select a user, and\none of the things I'd like to point out,\n\n49\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.420\nis that you can select a user or group.\n\n50\n00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.604\nIt doesn't matter.\nIf you want to find\n\n51\n00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:43.772\nout collectively what a group has,\nwhat level of access they have,\n\n52\n00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:45.680\nyou could put the group's name in here.\n\n53\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.630\nIf you're just looking for\n\n54\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.880\na specific user,\nyou can put the user in there as well.\n\n55\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.810\nWe're gonna pick on old Billy here.\n\n56\n00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.100\nAnd in your select user or group here,\n\n57\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.420\nall we're gonna type is whatever\nthe username is or the group name.\n\n58\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.196\nCheck Names, there he is.\n\n59\n00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:02.375\nSo it looks like he still exists,\nhasn't had a pink slip yet.\n\n60\n00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.440\n>> [LAUGH] I tell you, that Billy,\nhe's gonna be waiting for\n\n61\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440\nus in a parking lot one day.\n\n62\n00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.312\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n63\n00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:10.778\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll choose, notice the button here\n\n64\n00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:14.570\nis now populated, it's not grayed\nout anymore, View effective access.\n\n65\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.100\nAnd when we look here,\n\n66\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.920\nwe'll see that there are red check\nmarks in there, red check marks?\n\n67\n00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.060\nHow about red x's?\n\n68\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.110\nI swear I know my [LAUGH] symbols here.\n\n69\n00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.370\nAnd then,\nthere's also some green check mark.\n\n70\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.990\nNow the green check marks mean, this is\nthe level of access that that entity has,\n\n71\n00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.710\nagain, whether it's a user or group.\n\n72\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.920\nNow, I want you to notice something here.\n\n73\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.250\nIf you look to the left-hand side,\nnotice that Billy's not in the list.\n\n74\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.860\nBilly is not in our permissions list,\nbut somehow,\n\n75\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.460\nBilly has manifest maybe some\nsecret powers or magic here,\n\n76\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.600\nbecause he still looks like\nhe's got a level of access.\n\n77\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.350\nNow where is that coming from?\n\n78\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.783\nThe good thing about effective access,\nis it tallies all permissions.\n\n79\n00:03:55.783 --> 00:03:59.633\nWe talk about the proverbial,\nlet's lay the cards on the table and\n\n80\n00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.950\nsee what hand everybody has,\nso we know where we're at.\n\n81\n00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.292\nWell, with effective access,\nit tallies everything together.\n\n82\n00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:11.040\nIt says, if I'm looking at a user,\nwhat groups does is the user a part of?\n\n83\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.210\nIs the user a part of group a,\nis it a part of the administrative group?\n\n84\n00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.240\nIt takes into account the share\npermissions that you see here as well.\n\n85\n00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.633\nIf it's a local account, it takes\nthe permissions on a local account or\n\n86\n00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:23.375\nlocal groups.\n\n87\n00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:27.390\nAnd what's really cool about this, Dan,\nis that if you're in a domain environment,\n\n88\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.820\nit also calculates those too.\n\n89\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.502\nSo, if you're logged in locally, it's just\ngonna show you those local permissions.\n\n90\n00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:34.261\nBut if you're in a domain environment,\n\n91\n00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:37.120\nit can show you all the permissions\nover the domain environment.\n\n92\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.233\nSo, a really powerful utility here.\n\n93\n00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:41.722\nAnd what I can see,\nis that Billy's permissions,\n\n94\n00:04:41.722 --> 00:04:47.500\nthat he's got right here, most likely,\nhe's pulling it from the dev team.\n\n95\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.190\nSo, if I don't want Billy to have access,\nlet's go ahead,\n\n96\n00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.570\nwe're gonna modify, in fact I probably\ncould have just done that right from here.\n\n97\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.500\nLet's modify that, and\nsee if that's the case.\n\n98\n00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.190\nNotice the dev teams there.\n\n99\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.802\nBilly is a part of the dev team.\n\n100\n00:04:58.802 --> 00:05:01.520\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndo a little bit of a edit here.\n\n101\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.380\nAnd in fact, let's just select,\noh, yes Windows.\n\n102\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.047\n[LAUGH] We'll remove that,\nWindows is warning me,\n\n103\n00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:10.744\njust because you change the order, it's\nnot gonna change the permissions here.\n\n104\n00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:11.466\n>> It's very angry with you.\n\n105\n00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:12.104\n>> It is.\n\n106\n00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:14.740\n[LAUGH] We'll go ahead and\napply those settings.\n\n107\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.010\nAnd, now let's go back, and\nlet's pick on Billy a little bit more.\n\n108\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.760\nWe're gonna choose Select a user.\n\n109\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.800\nAnd again keep in mind,\nI can put a group in here if I wanted to.\n\n110\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.550\nBut we'll put Billy in the list here.\n\n111\n00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.610\nAnd we'll View effective access.\n\n112\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.090\nAnd like that, well, now Billy,\nno food for him, he can't eat.\n\n113\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.032\nWe've given, maybe,\nthe level of access that we want there.\n\n114\n00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:39.223\n>> That's right.\nThat's very nice of be able to say, okay,\n\n115\n00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:42.494\nwell, I've seen that Billy is\nmaybe gaining access to something\n\n116\n00:05:42.494 --> 00:05:44.570\nthat he shouldn't have access to.\n\n117\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.830\nIf that's the case, obviously if we're\nputting permissions on a group itself and\n\n118\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.550\nBilly is a part of that group,\nhe's supposed to have those permissions.\n\n119\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.720\nBut, if he moves out of that group and\n\n120\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.800\nwe forget to remove him\nfrom the group itself.\n\n121\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.620\nSo, he no longer works for the dev team,\nmaybe he's now gone out on to sales.\n\n122\n00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.360\nHe's like, you know what,\n\n123\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.910\nmy life as a salesman's gonna make me\ncomplete, that's where I wanna live.\n\n124\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.460\nWe forget to take him out of the dev\ngroup, and he's still accessing files.\n\n125\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.880\nWe can use this effective permissions to\nsee, wow, he does have access to this.\n\n126\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.580\nI need to figure out what's going on.\n\n127\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.774\nI can then do what a Wes just did,\nexactly, and\n\n128\n00:06:16.774 --> 00:06:18.419\nsee all the groups that are there.\n\n129\n00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.740\nI see Billy's not in that list,\nnot in the ACL list.\n\n130\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.167\nBut that dev group is there.\n\n131\n00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:25.885\nI guarantee he's probably not a part\nof the administrators group or\n\n132\n00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.320\nany of those other groups.\n\n133\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.300\nSo I'm gonna look in that dev group.\n\n134\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.720\nOh, that's right,\nBilly used to be a developer.\n\n135\n00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.310\nLet's take him out of there.\n\n136\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.240\nOr, we'll give him some denies or whatever\nthe case is we need to do so that he no\n\n137\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.100\nlonger has access to this, and then we\ncan verify it using the effective access.\n\n138\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.080\nIt's a very nice thing to\nhelp troubleshoot access\n\n139\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.080\nissues when it comes to either, they're\naccessing things they shouldn't be or\n\n140\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.640\nthey don't have access to\nstuff that they should.\n\n141\n00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.276\n>> Yeah, very good.\n\n142\n00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:53.758\nNow, we've been talking about permissions,\nright?\n\n143\n00:06:53.758 --> 00:06:54.977\nPermissions are important.\n\n144\n00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:57.636\nIt's based on an identity, right?\n\n145\n00:06:57.636 --> 00:07:01.800\nThe Windows operating system,\nwhat it's gonna do is,\n\n146\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.960\nit's gonna take a service,\nI almost said a service and identifier.\n\n147\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.980\nWe're not in wireless here.\n\n148\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.440\nA security identifier,\nnot a SSID, but an SID.\n\n149\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.660\nAnd it's using that SID, that identity,\nto verify what level of access they have.\n\n150\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.240\nNow, there is a complete other topic\nhere that really gets confusing.\n\n151\n00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.560\nAnd that's something known as attributes.\n\n152\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.290\nWhen it comes to attributes,\nwhat's the difference here?\n\n153\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.010\nWhat's the difference between\na permission and an attribute?\n\n154\n00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.560\nWell, like I said, with permissions,\nit's based on identity.\n\n155\n00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.290\nIt's, Billy logs into the computer and\nwhen he goes to access a resource,\n\n156\n00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.270\nthe Windows operating system says okay,\nis Billy on the list?\n\n157\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.436\nAnd if he is on the list,\nwhat does the list say that he can do?\n\n158\n00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:49.130\nSo, what level of\nauthorization does he have?\n\n159\n00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.710\nAttributes, on the other hand,\nthey go a little bit farther than that.\n\n160\n00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.015\nAttributes are not based on identity.\n\n161\n00:07:55.015 --> 00:07:59.442\nWhat they're gonna be based on,\nis more of what the operating system sees,\n\n162\n00:07:59.442 --> 00:08:00.971\nregardless of identity.\n\n163\n00:08:00.971 --> 00:08:04.673\nYou see, an attribute is\napplied to a file or folder and\n\n164\n00:08:04.673 --> 00:08:09.261\nit lets Windows know This is what\nyou do with that file or folder, and\n\n165\n00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:13.760\nit doesn't matter who the identity is,\nour identity is.\n\n166\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.600\nSo let's go ahead and check that out here.\n\n167\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.110\nSo I've got that same file, right?\n\n168\n00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.409\nStrong passwords here.\n\n169\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.880\nAnd if I right click on it,\nI can choose Properties.\n\n170\n00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.350\nAnd from the properties here,\n\n171\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.130\nnotice down at the bottom we've got\nthe attributes here in the GUI.\n\n172\n00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.960\nAnd we've got read-only,\nwe've got hidden, and\n\n173\n00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.970\nthen we also have some\nadvanced attributes too.\n\n174\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.250\nUp here at the top here,\nwe've got the archiving attribute.\n\n175\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.260\nWell, what does the archiving\nattribute mean?\n\n176\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.860\nNow, keep in mind it's not\nbased on identity anymore, but\n\n177\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.570\nthe Windows backup subsystem, and not just\nWindows, other operating systems do this,\n\n178\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.140\nthey use the archive attribute to say,\nyou know what,\n\n179\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.450\nyou've modified this file since\nthe last time a backup's run.\n\n180\n00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.240\nSo because it's been modified,\nyou don't have a current copy of it.\n\n181\n00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.850\nSo when the next time\nthe Windows Backup subsystem runs,\n\n182\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.190\nit looks for all these archive attributes\nand it says our IPs are the files that I\n\n183\n00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.900\nneed to include in the backup to\nmake sure that I'm aware of them.\n\n184\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.810\nNow you can also do this from\nthe command prompt as well.\n\n185\n00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.770\nSo when we do that,\nI've got a file here called a.txt.\n\n186\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.660\nAnd now I'm doing the the name\nhere is arbitrary but\n\n187\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.300\nit definitely helps me spell.\n\n188\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.080\nLet me show you this\nin the command prompt.\n\n189\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.005\n>> Wes can spell a.\n\n190\n00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:26.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> I can spell a, that's right.\n\n191\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.620\nMake sure I bring up the right\ncommand prompt here,\n\n192\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.620\nwe don't need deployment\nimage servicing manager.\n\n193\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.990\nNow when it comes to the attributes,\nhow do we view them?\n\n194\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:44.160\nWell we view them with a command\ncalled attrib and a-t-t-r-i-b.\n\n195\n00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.090\nAnd you can see that there's\na series of attributes.\n\n196\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.150\nNow I always like this\nbecause it's easy to remember\n\n197\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.430\nthe attributes with a little mnemonic.\n\n198\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:57.380\nIf you can remember that every file gets\na rash, or every file can have a rash,\n\n199\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.480\nyou can remember what\nthe four main attributes are.\n\n200\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.920\nThat's read-only, archive,\nsystem, and hidden.\n\n201\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.090\nSay that a little bit slower,\nread-only archive system and hidden.\n\n202\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.870\nAnd I can actually apply\nattributes if I want to,\n\n203\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.090\nto a file with the attrib command.\n\n204\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.700\nSo let's go ahead and do that, I'm going\nto navigate over here to my desktop.\n\n205\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.900\nAnd we'll do the dir and you'll see\nthat I've got that a.txt file here.\n\n206\n00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.150\nNow, if you're in a location and\n\n207\n00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:30.020\nyou just run the attrib command,\nIt's not going to be very specific, it's\n\n208\n00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.950\njust going to give you the attributes of\nevery, if I can figure out how to spell.\n\n209\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.440\n[LAUGH] It's going to give you all\nthe attributes of every file here.\n\n210\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.140\nNotice that the a.txt\nhas that a attribute.\n\n211\n00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.185\nNow remember,\nthat a attribute's the archive attribute,\n\n212\n00:10:47.185 --> 00:10:48.700\nbecause I just created this file.\n\n213\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.760\nI haven't run a Windows backup since then.\n\n214\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.750\nBut it's letting me know that I need\nto include this in the next backup.\n\n215\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.710\nNow you get a little\nmore specific with that.\n\n216\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.980\nWe could actually drill right\ndown to that a.txt file.\n\n217\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.360\nAnd I can do attrib.a.txt.\n\n218\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.060\nRemember to name the extension in the\ncommand prompt because it's not going to\n\n219\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.150\nfill it in for you.\n\n220\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.010\nAnd notice that it has\nthe archive attribute.\n\n221\n00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:16.360\nNow one of the things that I want to\nshow you relative to NTFS permissions,\n\n222\n00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.280\nyou have to be careful.\n\n223\n00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.650\nWhere this can get you into trouble is\nwhen there's a conflict of interest.\n\n224\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.500\nWhat do we mean by that?\n\n225\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.240\nWell, let me show you here.\n\n226\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.115\nWe're going to go just temporarily\nback to that a.txt document.\n\n227\n00:11:28.115 --> 00:11:30.779\nI'm going to choose the properties here,\nand\n\n228\n00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:33.908\nwe're going to look at\nmy level of permissions.\n\n229\n00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:36.880\nAnd Dan, you'll notice right there,\nmy level of permissions says I got full\n\n230\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.270\ncontrol so I should be able to do\nabsolutely anything I want to a.txt.\n\n231\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:47.901\nSo I can open this file and\nI could say, this is my amazing text.\n\n232\n00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:51.240\n>> You are a.txt's king.\n\n233\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.213\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n234\n00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.570\n[LAUGH] And I could save this.\n\n235\n00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:01.330\n[LAUGH] Once I save this, notice I can\nmake modifications and I should be\n\n236\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.260\nable to make modifications to it, because\nlike I said, I'm the creator/owner.\n\n237\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.000\nAnd like we've talked about, if you got\nfull control you do whatever you want with\n\n238\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.790\nthe document,\nincluding changing permissions.\n\n239\n00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.830\nNow if we jump back over to\nmy command prompt, however.\n\n240\n00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.410\nAll right, and I do an a-t-t-r-i-b,\nthe attrib command.\n\n241\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.015\nAnd I name the document.\n\n242\n00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:21.490\na.txt.\n\n243\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.460\nAnd this time what I'm\ngoing to do is a +R.\n\n244\n00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.470\nIf you remember the R was\nthe read-only attribute.\n\n245\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.570\nSo we're going to say is assign\nthe read-only attribute to this file.\n\n246\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.800\nNow look at that.\n\n247\n00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.240\nAbsolutely amazing,\nit looks like it did nothing.\n\n248\n00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.260\nBut yet what you can do is you can\nrerun that command and now look.\n\n249\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.100\nWe've got a R.\n\n250\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.032\nWe're only mission of 15 after that and\nwe'll be great.\n\n251\n00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:47.080\n[LAUGH] So we've got archive and\nwe've got read only.\n\n252\n00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.720\nNow let's see how that affected the\npermissions that I have as an owner over\n\n253\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.080\nthis document having full control.\n\n254\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.090\nNow we're going to go ahead\nwe're going to open that up.\n\n255\n00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.275\nRemember, here's my amazing text.\n\n256\n00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:04.246\nAnd we're going to say,\nthis is more amazing text.\n\n257\n00:13:04.246 --> 00:13:08.445\nAlright and\n\n258\n00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:11.400\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going do\na file and I'm going to do a save.\n\n259\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.250\nNow this time,\nnotice that it's challenging me.\n\n260\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.350\nIt didn't do that last time, right?\n\n261\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.310\nIt saved it, we closed the file down,\nwe went right back into command prompt,\n\n262\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.800\neverything's good, good day at the office.\n\n263\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.120\nIt didn't do that this time,\nso what's going on here?\n\n264\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.670\nWell, let's go ahead and let's save it.\n\n265\n00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.050\nNow if I rename this, guys, in fairness,\nyou're creating a new file.\n\n266\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:29.880\nIt's not the same file.\n\n267\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.650\nSo let's save it with the same name.\n\n268\n00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.888\nAnd it's as well, hey, Wes,\n\n269\n00:13:32.888 --> 00:13:35.520\ncan't you figured it out you already\ngot a file here by that name.\n\n270\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.480\nSo we're going to say yes.\n\n271\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.630\nI want to override it or not.\n\n272\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.410\nNotice that it says read-only.\n\n273\n00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.470\nSo you have to be very careful\nwhen it comes to an attribute.\n\n274\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.175\nBecause when you try to make\na modification to one that already has\n\n275\n00:13:48.175 --> 00:13:51.780\nthe read-only attribute applied to it, it\ndoesn't matter if you have full control.\n\n276\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.560\nFull control, you can change permissions,\nyou can even take ownership.\n\n277\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.360\nYou take ownership all you want but\nat the end of the day comes down to it.\n\n278\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.420\nYou're not going to be\nable to modify the file.\n\n279\n00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.180\n>> So, the attribute's kind of\nlike a trump card, or even right.\n\n280\n00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.170\nYou know, even though Wes has\nfull control over this file,\n\n281\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.070\nthat attribute is overriding\nhis permissions, really.\n\n282\n00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.820\nAnd saying no, no,\nthis is a read only file.\n\n283\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.200\nThat's the attribute of the file itself.\n\n284\n00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.330\nYour permissions really\ndon't mean anything because\n\n285\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.060\nthis is the nature of the file\nthat it is read-only.\n\n286\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.340\nSo what good does it have\nto say you can write to it?\n\n287\n00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.530\n>> That's right and now there's\none thing I also want to mention.\n\n288\n00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.580\nYou might say well, Wes, Dan,\nwhat does that have to do with security?\n\n289\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.620\nWell, one of the big things about the\nprinciples of security that we talk about\n\n290\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.540\nin our other episodes that you've got\nto check out is the fact that we talk\n\n291\n00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.910\nabout availability.\n\n292\n00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.820\nRight.\n\n293\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.560\nSecurity is much or\nas much if I could say that about giving\n\n294\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.580\nauthorized users access to their data\nas it is making it confidential and\n\n295\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.340\nnot that it doesn't change.\n\n296\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.850\nSo this could cause an excess ability\noption or access problems, right.\n\n297\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.530\nThe other thing I want to mention that's\nabout security is another attribute.\n\n298\n00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.530\nNow you might not have seen it here.\n\n299\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.720\nLet's go ahead and let's rerun that\nattrib command, one last thing here.\n\n300\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.720\nAnd I've got to mention this.\n\n301\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.430\nNotice there's this s option, all right?\n\n302\n00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.860\nAnd there's h.\n\n303\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.320\nThe H attribute is hidden.\n\n304\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.730\nThat is not really a security\ntechnique because the default view\n\n305\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.770\nin file explorer is to hide\nthese hidden files and folders.\n\n306\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.110\nIf I change that, well, they're no longer\nhidden anymore and I can see them so\n\n307\n00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.940\nthat doesn't nothing for security.\n\n308\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.590\nBut that S option,\nthat's a little bit different.\n\n309\n00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.300\nThat's how Windows can maintain\nthe integrity of it's system files.\n\n310\n00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.020\nDon't they file extension?\n\n311\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.200\nRemember, just like we're\ntalking about permissions,\n\n312\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.310\nwe don't care about\nthe identity at this point.\n\n313\n00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.790\nIt's the operating system\nthat's going to look at that.\n\n314\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:47.019\nSo, when you flag a file with a system\nattribute, what you're doing is you're\n\n315\n00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:52.574\ntelling Windows this is now hence a system\nfile regardless of what the extension is.\n\n316\n00:15:52.574 --> 00:16:00.032\nSo if I wanted to, I could do\na-t-t-r-i-b name the file again.\n\n317\n00:16:00.032 --> 00:16:01.703\nAnd I could do a + S.\n\n318\n00:16:01.703 --> 00:16:03.375\nAll right.\n\n319\n00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:06.049\nAnd, if we rerun that a trip command,\n\n320\n00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:10.910\nnotice now that we have a A.S.R.,\na Archive System and Read only.\n\n321\n00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.830\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n322\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:18.200\nNow, the Windows resource protection is\na technology built into Windows that says,\n\n323\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.120\nmonitor all your crucial system files,\n\n324\n00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.930\nregardless of their extensions looking\nat this attribute, and protect them.\n\n325\n00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.240\nDon't allow modifications to himself.\n\n326\n00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.140\nThe system attribute is very,\nvery important from a security\n\n327\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.070\nstandpoint in maintaining\nthe integrity of the operating system.\n\n328\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.420\n>> This is a nice little\nthing that we have.\n\n329\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.960\nSo if you need to make sure that\na file never gets written over\n\n330\n00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.650\neven if someone has permissions,\nyou can set that read-only and\n\n331\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.930\nthen when you're done with that\nyou can remove the read only.\n\n332\n00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.760\nYou have that ability to\ncontrol the file by its nature.\n\n333\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.790\nThat's the important part of it,\nis that it's really built\n\n334\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.300\ninto the file's structure,\nwhich is separate than permissions.\n\n335\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.410\nNow another way that we can secure our\ndata, it's probably a very important way,\n\n336\n00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.690\na very effective way even,\nis using encryption.\n\n337\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.970\nNow encryption I know a lot of people here\nthat we're in a set of many times and\n\n338\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.540\nit sounds like you're here we go.\n\n339\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.100\nLet me get out my PhD in\nmathematics in and calculus and\n\n340\n00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.883\nall that and\nyou do not need to do that Wes.\n\n341\n00:17:14.883 --> 00:17:20.100\nWe were talking about this before, this is\na very simple function that we can employ.\n\n342\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.540\nAnd it is extremely\neffective when it comes to\n\n343\n00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.630\nkeeping people out of your business,\nreally.\n\n344\n00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.270\n>> It is.\n\n345\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.790\nWe mentioned also,\n\n346\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.590\nif you're gonna format a Windows operating\nsystem, you format it with NTFS.\n\n347\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.150\nBut why don't we recommend that?\n\n348\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:37.900\nWhy don't we recommend maybe\nformatting it with FAT32, right?\n\n349\n00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.070\nWell the reason is FAT32 you lose\nsome of the security abilities and\n\n350\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.890\none of them is something known\nas the encryption attribute.\n\n351\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.930\nNow with the encryption attribute,\nall you're doing is\n\n352\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.770\nyou're applying an extended attribute to\nany of the file or folders on the system.\n\n353\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.800\nNow let's go ahead and see.\n\n354\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.430\nIt does sound like it's pretty complex,\nlike you gotta get your shades out,\n\n355\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:03.270\ngotta have that little curly white\nearpiece, working for the CIA and-\n\n356\n00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.200\n>> Go ahead, gold leader.\n\n357\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.910\n>> That's right.\n>> Yes, we are.\n\n358\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.140\nWe are good.\n\n359\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.195\n>> My job's so\nsecret even I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n360\n00:18:08.195 --> 00:18:10.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's very straightforward.\n\n361\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:12.790\nLet's go ahead and I'm just going\nto right click on the desktop.\n\n362\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.890\nI'm gonna choose new, and\nwe're gonna call this folder secrets.\n\n363\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.168\nEverybody's gotta have a secrets folder.\n\n364\n00:18:20.168 --> 00:18:23.576\nAnd I'm gonna go into this folder were\nkinda prepping this maybe we've got\n\n365\n00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:24.290\na file in here.\n\n366\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.300\nWe'll call it top secret.\n\n367\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.085\nTop secret file.\n\n368\n00:18:30.798 --> 00:18:32.110\nAnd I won't call it file there.\n\n369\n00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.798\nWe know it's a file.\n\n370\n00:18:32.798 --> 00:18:33.638\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n371\n00:18:33.638 --> 00:18:37.590\n[LAUGH] this is, again,\nnothing more than an attribute.\n\n372\n00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.480\nSo if I go to my folder here, and\nI right click, choose properties, and\n\n373\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.680\nright here in the general tab,\nwe're going to go to advanced.\n\n374\n00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.730\nI want you to notice something here.\n\n375\n00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.300\nNotice we have a compression attribute\nwhich we'll talk about in another episode.\n\n376\n00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.060\nBut this encryption attribute\nencrypt contents to secure data.\n\n377\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.097\nThis is going to turn E.F.S. on.\n\n378\n00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.590\nNow EFS what is that for?\n\n379\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.790\nSo, we'll go ahead we'll\napply that to the system.\n\n380\n00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.220\nEFS is the encrypted file system.\n\n381\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.500\nEncrypted file system.\n\n382\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.320\nWhat it does is it will, your computer\nwill generate a digital certificate that\n\n383\n00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.360\nis tied to your user account and\nevery file and folder that you create\n\n384\n00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.350\ninside of this folder now is gonna\nbe tied to that digital certificate.\n\n385\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.410\nNow, what it's doing is it's asking us,\nbecause the hierarchy we got a parent\n\n386\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.350\nchild relationship, if you encrypt\nthis folder, do you wanna go ahead and\n\n387\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.720\nencrypt everything that's in it?\n\n388\n00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.400\nFolder, sub folder,\nsub folders within folders.\n\n389\n00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.440\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and say yeah.\n\n390\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.992\nI don't know if there's much sense on\nencrypting a folder, but- [CROSSTALK]\n\n391\n00:19:36.992 --> 00:19:38.622\n>> Encrypting the context is\n\n392\n00:19:38.622 --> 00:19:39.860\ncompletely open.\n\n393\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.300\n>> Yeah.\n\n394\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.260\n>> So one of the things that\nalso came up back here is,\n\n395\n00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.760\nlet me go ahead and\nsee if I can show you this real quick.\n\n396\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.810\nIs backing up your encryption certificate.\n\n397\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:55.000\nOne of the things to keep in mind is that\nif your hard drive gets corrupted and\n\n398\n00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.750\nyou're trying to do data recovery,\n\n399\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.220\nif you lose this certificate you're\ngonna lose access to your data.\n\n400\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:01.860\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n401\n00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.720\nWe'll back that up later but\njust keep that in mind.\n\n402\n00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.580\nBut you're gonna want to back that\nencryption key up in case you need to do\n\n403\n00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.300\nthings like what we call DRA,\ndata recovery agent.\n\n404\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.090\nSo again, it's all about availability and\n\n405\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.860\nif you lose that certificate,\nyour data might not be available.\n\n406\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.600\nNow, it didn't look like anything,\ndid it, Dan?\n\n407\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.810\nI mean,\nit's still the same secret folder, right?\n\n408\n00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.413\n>> There's a file there,\nand a folder [CROSSTALK].\n\n409\n00:20:21.413 --> 00:20:23.399\n>> That's right,\nwe got a pretty little icon here,\n\n410\n00:20:23.399 --> 00:20:24.416\nso\n>> If I open this,\n\n411\n00:20:24.416 --> 00:20:26.569\nyou'll notice that the colors\na little bit different on that.\n\n412\n00:20:26.569 --> 00:20:30.932\nNow the color lets you know that, hey,\nthere's an encryption attribute applied to\n\n413\n00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:33.942\nthis, and you can see how\nthe parent child relationship,\n\n414\n00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:37.770\nit's going to inherit down to whatever\nthe object is, the child object.\n\n415\n00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.890\nIn this case, it's the top secret file.\n\n416\n00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.360\nNow, if you'll notice something\nwith the advanced attributes,\n\n417\n00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.600\nthe encryption attribute.\n\n418\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.830\nApply right to that file.\n\n419\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.890\nNow, let me show you one\nother thing here too.\n\n420\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:55.600\nLet me create one more file and\nany file really.\n\n421\n00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.980\nDo a Word document here.\n\n422\n00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.280\nWe'll call this top secret as well.\n\n423\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.610\nAll right, now notice, it also has\nthat green lettering to it, and\n\n424\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:09.640\nit just lets me know I don't have to come\nback and tell Windows every single time.\n\n425\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.580\nI want to encrypt the information that I'm\nnow adding, so it's gonna inherit down.\n\n426\n00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.870\nLet's see how this works for us.\n\n427\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.880\nNow, if you remember Billy, we're gonna\npick on poor Billy a little bit more here.\n\n428\n00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.490\nBilly's logged in.\n\n429\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.980\nLet's see if we can access that\nfile that we just encrypted.\n\n430\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.320\nSo we'll go ahead and browse to that.\n\n431\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:33.820\nAll right, and that's somewhere down here\nin local disk C, and there's my account.\n\n432\n00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.250\nAnd you can see on the desktop here,\nthere's that secrets folder.\n\n433\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.910\nLet's see if Billy can gain access\nto top secret documentation.\n\n434\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.900\nAnd Access is denied.\n\n435\n00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.590\nNow Billy, we've actually put\nBilly in the administrative group.\n\n436\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:54.120\nKeep in mind that if you don't have the\nencryption key, you can't decrypt, right?\n\n437\n00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.080\nSo since the encryption key is\nassigned to Wes as a user and\n\n438\n00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.270\npart of the Wes's user account,\nit's available only for me.\n\n439\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.470\nIt's not available to Billy,\neven if he is an administrator.\n\n440\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:10.060\nAccess is denied and it becomes very,\nvery easy to protect your information.\n\n441\n00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.780\nOne of the final things I\ndefinitely would recommend,\n\n442\n00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.470\nthough, is backing up that encryption key,\nbecause if you lose the encryption key,\n\n443\n00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:22.250\nif it gets corrupted, I might come back\nin here as the owner of the document and\n\n444\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:26.970\nget the access denied, and if you've done\na lot of work on your documentation and\n\n445\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.950\nyou've been working all weekend and\nit gets corrupt, well,\n\n446\n00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.460\nit might not be a good day at the office\non Monday if you you tell the boss,\n\n447\n00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:38.078\nI swear, I swear I've got that work done,\nbut the dog ate my encryption key.\n\n448\n00:22:38.078 --> 00:22:42.130\n>> [LAUGH] You take your right hand and\nyou wave bye-bye to that file.\n\n449\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.100\n>> That's right.\n\n450\n00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.660\nIt's not a bad day at the office.\n\n451\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.710\nThe printer works, right?\n\n452\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:46.990\nBecause then you can print your resume.\n\n453\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.730\n>> That's right.\n\n454\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.155\nThat's a good thing.\n\n455\n00:22:49.155 --> 00:22:50.830\n>> [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n456\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:56.070\nSo one of the technologies that\nwe also have to look at here\n\n457\n00:22:56.070 --> 00:23:01.075\nis something known as data\nexecution protection, DEP.\n\n458\n00:23:01.075 --> 00:23:05.645\nWith data execution protection,\nthis is really an industry wide standard.\n\n459\n00:23:05.645 --> 00:23:09.455\nIt's something that's available in all\nof your major operating systems like\n\n460\n00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:11.197\nLinux makes Distro support this.\n\n461\n00:23:11.197 --> 00:23:12.467\nWindows supports this.\n\n462\n00:23:12.467 --> 00:23:15.907\nMac supports it, and even your\nmobile operating system supports it.\n\n463\n00:23:15.907 --> 00:23:18.037\nSo what is data execution protection?\n\n464\n00:23:18.037 --> 00:23:21.127\nThink about a location within memory.\n\n465\n00:23:21.127 --> 00:23:24.337\nThat we're going to allow programs\nto store information, right?\n\n466\n00:23:24.337 --> 00:23:26.457\nI mean data,\nyou have programs come online.\n\n467\n00:23:26.457 --> 00:23:27.867\nThey request memory access.\n\n468\n00:23:27.867 --> 00:23:31.847\nThey tell the operating system,\nhey, I need a memory address.\n\n469\n00:23:31.847 --> 00:23:34.750\nI need to put data in there and\nI need to be able to work with it.\n\n470\n00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:35.882\nBut we want to protect it.\n\n471\n00:23:35.882 --> 00:23:39.320\nWe wanna make sure that programs work\n\n472\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.300\nwith that memory the way we expect them\nto and they don't try to sidestep that.\n\n473\n00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.820\nYou guys know some of the attacks viruses\ncan do, cause all kinds of problems.\n\n474\n00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:53.106\nDEP or Data Execution Protection\nis based off of stater called NX.\n\n475\n00:23:53.106 --> 00:23:54.871\nThat's no execute.\n\n476\n00:23:54.871 --> 00:23:58.061\nAnd it's something that you can\nenable here inside of Windows.\n\n477\n00:23:58.061 --> 00:23:58.781\nNow.\n\n478\n00:23:58.781 --> 00:24:02.741\nLet's go ahead and\nwe're gonna check DEP out.\n\n479\n00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:07.521\nPretty straightforward process, if you\njust go to your quick links menu there,\n\n480\n00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:10.980\nyou can type system if you want\ninside of the search field.\n\n481\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.170\nAnd notice we have the advanced system\nsettings over here on the left hand side.\n\n482\n00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.550\nAll right now Billy's an administrator so,\n\n483\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.130\nthank goodness,\nwe can see this here in Billy's account.\n\n484\n00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.700\nAnd we have the system properties.\n\n485\n00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.090\nNow notice from the Advanced tab,\nI haven't gone anywhere else.\n\n486\n00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.120\nWe're going to choose settings.\n\n487\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.430\nAnd then you've got these\nthree tabs at the top.\n\n488\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.730\nData Execution Protection is one here\nall the way on the right hand side.\n\n489\n00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.060\nNow data execution protection,\nit's turned on by default, but\n\n490\n00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.140\nwhat they do is they limit it\nto just the Windows binary.\n\n491\n00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:50.076\nSee, Windows trusts itself, so it's\njust saying that if it's working Windows\n\n492\n00:24:50.076 --> 00:24:54.214\nis not being attacked and\nit hasn't been modified, it understands\n\n493\n00:24:54.214 --> 00:24:58.730\nwhat a corrupted Windows file is and\nwhat a non-corrupted Windows file.\n\n494\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:04.360\nSo going out the gate here, it's just\nbasically saying protect Windows.\n\n495\n00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.770\nNow we can go a little bit\nfarther with this one, all right?\n\n496\n00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:13.010\nAnd this is what's a difference between\na blacklist and whitelist, right?\n\n497\n00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.280\nIf it's on the list we're going\nto watch it with the DEP.\n\n498\n00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.270\nIf it's not on the list,\nit's not going to be able to execute.\n\n499\n00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.230\nNow that is kind of complex.\n\n500\n00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.970\nYes, you can keep your system protected\nbut you might go a little bit over.\n\n501\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.700\nYou might break some applications\nthat maybe aren't expecting this.\n\n502\n00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.400\nAnd you can turn around and you can\nadd your programs here if you want to.\n\n503\n00:25:33.042 --> 00:25:35.580\nGot to mention it,\nI would leave it on the defaults, and\n\n504\n00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.690\njust let Windows protect itself.\n\n505\n00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.560\nAgain, when you start turning this on and\nhave to manage it, you might notice that\n\n506\n00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.230\na lot of applications are going to\nnot run the way you want them to, and\n\n507\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.450\nthey could be legitimate applications, and\nthat's always going to cause problems.\n\n508\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.650\nBut data execution protection,\n\n509\n00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:55.930\nvery cool technology that's built into the\nmajority of your major operating systems.\n\n510\n00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.170\nAnd that's how you configure\nit inside a Windows here.\n\n511\n00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.890\n>> All right, Wes, yeah that DEP\nstuff is obviously very, very nice,\n\n512\n00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.020\nvery awesome for us to have.\n\n513\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.420\nThe fact that the operating system itself\nhas a check and balance system to say,\n\n514\n00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.030\nhey now, just because you're a program\non my computer here doesn't mean\n\n515\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.620\nI'm going to necessarily let you run.\n\n516\n00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.010\nWe can set that as a type\nof a permission to say,\n\n517\n00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:20.170\nonly these computer programs\nare going to run and nothing more.\n\n518\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:20.950\nBring down the big hammer.\n\n519\n00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:21.720\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n520\n00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.350\n>> All right, that looks like we've\ngot a little more to go, Wes,\n\n521\n00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.110\nbut we're at the end of the time here, so\nwe're going to have to do a part three.\n\n522\n00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.760\nI look forward to that as well,\nand I hope you do as well.\n\n523\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.230\nAs for this episode we're going to\ngo ahead and bring it to a close.\n\n524\n00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:38.470\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n525\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.250\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n526\n00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.705\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n527\n00:26:42.705 --> 00:26:48.050\n[SOUND]\n\n",

everyone.\n\n4\n00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:16.530\nAnd welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.520\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n6\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.530\ntoday we're talking Windows 10 security,\nspecifically data security.\n\n7\n00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.330\nNow if you haven't checked out our\nprevious episodes on data security,\n\n8\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.820\nyou should check those out.\n\n9\n00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.650\nBut today we're gonna move into BitLocker,\n\n10\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.730\na nice lovely security system built\ninto the Windows 10 operating system.\n\n11\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.920\nAnd joining us to help us understand\nthis technology a little bit better\n\n12\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.420\nis none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.710\nHow you doing today, Wes?\n\n14\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.190\n>> I'm doing good, and\nit's good to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.600\nSo we get to talk about drive\nencryption technologies.\n\n16\n00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.970\nWell, you might have seen in one of\nthe other episodes we talked about EFS and\n\n17\n00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.690\nthe encrypted file system and\nwhat that means for us.\n\n18\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.340\nSo, well, what's the difference?\n\n19\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.620\nIf we're talking about encryption and\nencryption and more encryption,\n\n20\n00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.750\nhow do we differentiate?\n\n21\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.490\nWell, I want you to know that EFS,\nthe encrypted file system,\n\n22\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.710\nworks on folders and files so\nthat's tied to an identity.\n\n23\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.200\nBitLocker's a little bit different.\n\n24\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.600\nFor the most part, yes, it's tied to\nan identity because the person has to know\n\n25\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.680\neither a password or\nhave a certain device.\n\n26\n00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.310\nBut it's about drive encryption,\nthe entire Windows volume encryption.\n\n27\n00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.940\nAnd it's very important to\nunderstand that in today's day and\n\n28\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.610\nage with mobile devices, laptops,\nthey can be stolen fairly easy.\n\n29\n00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.680\nSo this gives us a way that we\ncan lock down our machines.\n\n30\n00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.220\nAnd if somebody doesn't have either\na password, or they don't have\n\n31\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.130\nthe right recovery key, which we'll talk\nabout, they can't get into the machine.\n\n32\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.520\nOne of the first things you need to do is\nyou need to make sure that you're computer\n\n33\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.360\nwhether it's firmware, platforms, BIOS or\nUEFI, make sure that it supports the TPN.\n\n34\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.940\nWe're actually in BIOS within\nour Windows 10 machine here.\n\n35\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.000\nSo, when we take a look at that,\n\n36\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.814\njust make sure that you navigate to\nthe security section within the BIOS.\n\n37\n00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:56.860\nIt mght be able a bit different depending\non what operating system you have.\n\n38\n00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.280\nAnd you can see up here towards the top,\nI have a few different options.\n\n39\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.390\nBut more specifically, you'll see\nthat there is security here, and\n\n40\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.990\nyou'll notice that it says TPM\nsecurity and it is enabled.\n\n41\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.150\nAnd that's important to make\nsure that you have that enabled.\n\n42\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.910\nNow what is TPM for us?\n\n43\n00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.610\nThat's the trusted platform module.\n\n44\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.280\nWhen it comes to the trusted platform\nmodule it's a cryptographic processor.\n\n45\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.635\nIt's a part of the chipset that stores\nthe BitLocker security information.\n\n46\n00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:27.095\nNow once you've verified\nthat you do have the TPM,\n\n47\n00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:31.115\nthat it is enabled, then what we\nhave to do is we gotta get inside of\n\n48\n00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:36.440\nthe operating system and\nwe've got to work with it as well.\n\n49\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.960\nNow when it comes to\nthe BitLocker drive encryption,\n\n50\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.270\nmake sure that the checks and\nbalances are in place.\n\n51\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.610\nAnd one of the things that, first of all,\n\n52\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.590\nthat we do is make sure\nthat the TPM's there.\n\n53\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.220\nNow, when it comes to\nturning on BitLocker, for\n\n54\n00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.900\nthe most part it's fairly easy if\nyou know exactly where to look.\n\n55\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.420\nSo here on our Windows 10 machine,\nfairly easy, just launch up file explorer.\n\n56\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.130\nAnd let me go ahead and just change\nthe view a little bit so we can see.\n\n57\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.950\nI know it's a little bit difficult\nthere on the explorer bar,\n\n58\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.690\nthe left hand side but\nnotice we have local disc C.\n\n59\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.130\nNow when it comes to encryption it's quite\nliterally as easy as right clicking on\n\n60\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.140\nwhatever the drive is that you\nwant to turn on BitLocker, and\n\n61\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.480\nyou'll see in the options menu,\nyou'll see turn on BitLocker.\n\n62\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.160\nYou can also go down to\nthe control panel and\n\n63\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.850\nthey've got a section in there for\nthe control panel.\n\n64\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.080\nNow, one of the first things\nthat BitLocker is going to do,\n\n65\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.420\nis it's going to check for the TPM.\n\n66\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.080\nIt wants to see is that\ncryptographic hardware device,\n\n67\n00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.810\nif you will, on the board itself.\n\n68\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.210\nOnce it's found that, it's now\ngonna ask me about my recovery key.\n\n69\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.322\nSee, the recovery key's important.\n\n70\n00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:50.920\nIf BitLocker,\nit does more than just encrypt your drive.\n\n71\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.410\nIt looks at the earlier boot files and\n\n72\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.610\nit makes sure that they\nmaintain their integrity.\n\n73\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.500\nIf you think about a rootkit,\nwhen a rootkit installs itself,\n\n74\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.083\na lot of times it'll install in a boot\nloader, or it tries to launch before any\n\n75\n00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:10.120\nof the anti-malware software\nkicks in on your machine.\n\n76\n00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.270\nSo we got to make sure that all\nof that maintains its integrity.\n\n77\n00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.620\nSo that's what it's gonna do here.\n\n78\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.900\nIf it finds that there's a tampering,\nwell, then it's going to\n\n79\n00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.540\nthrow it into recovery mode and\nyou're gonna need this recovery key.\n\n80\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.770\nIt's a forty-eight digit key, so\n\n81\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.780\nit's not something that you're\ngonna commit to memory.\n\n82\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.170\nSo I'm actually gonna\nprint the recovery key.\n\n83\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.400\nYou can save it to a file if you want to.\n\n84\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust print mine out here.\n\n85\n00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.270\nOne of the things that I, let me go ahead\nand take a second to show you this.\n\n86\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.330\nIf you try to save this\nfile to the same drive,\n\n87\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.540\nthe root drive,\nyou're gonna notice something here.\n\n88\n00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.030\nNow, I've already printed it so\nI should be okay.\n\n89\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.130\nBut when I go to try to save it here,\nit's gonna warn me.\n\n90\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.340\nIt's gonna say, hey, you can't do that.\n\n91\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.250\nNow, Dan, one of the reasons\nwe might not wanna do that,\n\n92\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.270\nif you think about it,\nwe're gonna encrypt this drive.\n\n93\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.340\nAnd then inside of the encryption drive,\nor the encrypted drive,\n\n94\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.376\nwe're gonna have a recovery key.\n\n95\n00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:01.080\n>> Yeah.\nIt's kinda gonna\n\n96\n00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.410\nmake it a little difficult for you to get\nthat recovery key if it's encrypted in\n\n97\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.740\nthe drive you're trying to access and\nyou need the key to unencrypt that drive.\n\n98\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.336\nRight?\n>> That's right.\n\n99\n00:05:09.336 --> 00:05:10.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nothing like taking the key to\n\n100\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.340\nthe front door and\nputting it in a lock box and\n\n101\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.268\nthen I don't know, burying it somewhere.\n\n102\n00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:15.026\n[LAUGH]\n>> Blindfolded.\n\n103\n00:05:15.026 --> 00:05:17.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n104\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.470\nNow we've gone ahead and\nwe've printed that recovery key.\n\n105\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.870\nSo it shouldn't give us a hard time here.\n\n106\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.340\nAnd we can choose Next.\n\n107\n00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.360\nThere's a couple of different\nthings that you can do.\n\n108\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.190\nOne of the new features,\nBitLocker's been around for a while.\n\n109\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.346\nIt goes back, it started in the days of\nVista, and it's definitely matured through\n\n110\n00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:32.690\nthe different operating systems,\nseven, eight, 8.1.\n\n111\n00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.660\nOne of the cooler features,\nand newer features,\n\n112\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.820\nis the ability to just encrypt\nthe space that you're using.\n\n113\n00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.960\nSo if you've got a one terrabyte drive,\nyou might find that this is a little bit\n\n114\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.130\nfaster, if you're only\nusing about a hundred gigs.\n\n115\n00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.480\nBut, with anything that gives you\na benefit, it's gonna be a pro and con.\n\n116\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.370\nAnd the con to this is,\nif you formatted that drive,\n\n117\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.620\nlet's say you're installing\nyour operating system fresh.\n\n118\n00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.340\nYou formatted the drive.\n\n119\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.230\nYou had a lot of information on there,\n\n120\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.590\nnow you're down to 100\ngigs out of that terabyte.\n\n121\n00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.630\nWell, all of that information that's out\nthere, and we probably recognize this\n\n122\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.950\nfrom other security episodes that we have,\nthat information can still be read.\n\n123\n00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.250\nSo, benefit, encrypts faster.\n\n124\n00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.070\nDrawback, might be information\nthat's recoverable.\n\n125\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.850\nSo I'm gonna actually\nsteer away from that.\n\n126\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.820\nNow, we'll cut against the grain\non this one and we'll choose Next.\n\n127\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.260\nI'm gonna do the entire drive.\n\n128\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.630\nNow it's a little bit slower.\n\n129\n00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.760\nBut it just ensures that the entirety\nof the volume is encrypted.\n\n130\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.460\nNext thing we have here is running\nthe BitLocker integrity check.\n\n131\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.180\nNow, that TPM, again,\n\n132\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.710\nit's just a component that\nstores security information.\n\n133\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.713\nBitLocker runs it's integrity check,\nand you don't have to, but\n\n134\n00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:43.083\nI would recommend it because it says,\nokay, let me write the information,\n\n135\n00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:46.910\nthat security information, and then turn\naround to see if I can read it back.\n\n136\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.865\nAlmost like the same concept of,\nin servers, if you have ECC memory, right?\n\n137\n00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:52.155\nWe write a little bit of information.\n\n138\n00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:54.465\nWe read it back and\nhope that it's what we expected.\n\n139\n00:06:54.465 --> 00:06:57.788\nCuz nothing like encrypting a drive,\nright, and then turn around and\n\n140\n00:06:57.788 --> 00:07:01.001\nyou restart the machine and\nthose encryption keys are corrupted and\n\n141\n00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:03.052\nyou can't, you lock yourself out so.\n\n142\n00:07:03.052 --> 00:07:03.553\n>> That would be bad.\n\n143\n00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:04.522\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We don't\n\n144\n00:07:04.522 --> 00:07:06.292\nwant to do that, for sure.\n\n145\n00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:08.173\nSo we'll go ahead and choose continue.\n\n146\n00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:11.472\nAnd what it should tell us is that it\ngoes through the integrity check and\n\n147\n00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:16.082\nthen it says we're gonna go ahead and\nencrypt this after we restart the machine.\n\n148\n00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:18.412\nSo good thing with\nthe action center up here.\n\n149\n00:07:18.412 --> 00:07:18.912\nOops.\n\n150\n00:07:18.912 --> 00:07:20.302\nThere we go, try that again.\n\n151\n00:07:20.302 --> 00:07:23.532\nGood thing with action center is,\nwell, it looks like it's gone there.\n\n152\n00:07:23.532 --> 00:07:25.690\nI clicked on it too quick.\n\n153\n00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.060\nBitLocker doesn't start working,\nit doesn't even start anything,\n\n154\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.450\nuntil you restart the machine.\n\n155\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.760\nSo, that's what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo here.\n\n156\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.100\nWe'll restart the machine.\n\n157\n00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.970\nAll right.\n>> It waits for\n\n158\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.230\nthat restart because system files and\nother files are probably in use,\n\n159\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.930\nbeing used by the system itself.\n\n160\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.600\nAnd it needs to have\nnobody touching anything.\n\n161\n00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.890\nI gotta take a look at this drive.\n\n162\n00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.480\nSee how exactly it's supposed to look.\n\n163\n00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.870\nAnd then start the encryption process,\nright?\n\n164\n00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.490\n>> That's it too.\n\n165\n00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.370\nAnd the other thing that it's also doing\nis it's taking any of the startup files,\n\n166\n00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.540\nthe firmware platform.\n\n167\n00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.520\nRemember, one of the last things that\nit goes through when you're starting up\n\n168\n00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.170\nan operating system it says,\ncan I find the master boot record.\n\n169\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.630\nCan I find the boot code?\n\n170\n00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.010\nWell, you can find the boot code, but if\nit's encrypted, what can you do with it?\n\n171\n00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.780\nSo, we also have to make sure that those\nstart up files aren't encrypted on\n\n172\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.700\nthe drive, too,\nwhich typically they're not by default.\n\n173\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.890\nSo, if we get back in here.\n\n174\n00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.030\nAll right.\n\n175\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.290\nAnd hopefully it'll log me back on.\n\n176\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.170\nAnd nothing happened, right?\n\n177\n00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.330\nImagine that, this is so amazing that\nyou can't really see anything work here.\n\n178\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.190\nBut if I launch a file explorer,\none of the things that you'll notice is\n\n179\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.980\na little bit different now is\nI got this little lock icon.\n\n180\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.510\nThat lock icon lets me know that BitLocker\nis going through the process right now\n\n181\n00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.840\nof encrypting this drive.\n\n182\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.600\nKeep in mind that the route\nthat I went was the long route.\n\n183\n00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.720\nThis is the scenic approach.\n\n184\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.750\nSo if you've got a very large drive do\nkeep in mind that it could take a while\n\n185\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.352\nfor this.\n\n186\n00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:55.080\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n187\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.790\nSo, yeah, it's gonna take a little\nwhile for that to go through.\n\n188\n00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.430\nNow one thing I'm thinking about when it\ncomes to Bit Locker is you talk about\n\n189\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.780\nthe TPM, right, is that it works with\nthe TPM to make sure that everything is\n\n190\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.695\nencrypted, it trusts that TPM.\n\n191\n00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:09.700\nThey kind of works together.\n\n192\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.240\nBut what if I don't have a TPM?\n\n193\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.990\nAm I still able to use Bit Locker?\n\n194\n00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.510\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n195\n00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.290\nmost of the newer systems are gonna have\nyour trusted platform module in them.\n\n196\n00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.900\nBut if you don't,\nyou still have a contingency plan.\n\n197\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.670\nNow, please understand that the next\nthing that we're gonna do will\n\n198\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.840\nhinder BitLocker's encryption.\n\n199\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.290\nYou're not gonna get the full blown\nearly start up integrity check.\n\n200\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.170\nSo, yes.\n\n201\n00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.990\nYou can, but you can still do that.\n\n202\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.560\nNow you're gonna have to make\na modification to a GPO to make this work.\n\n203\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.790\nSo we'll go back local GPO,\ngroup policy editor here.\n\n204\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.800\nWe'll launch that up.\n\n205\n00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.880\nAnd this is gonna be\na computer configuration, and\n\n206\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.110\nit's under Windows components.\n\n207\n00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:52.470\nSo that being said, here at the top\nyou'll see computer configurations,\n\n208\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:58.050\nadmin templates, or administrative\ntemplates, and then Windows components.\n\n209\n00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.260\nAnd then BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n210\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.770\nThe operating system drive\nis the one that you want.\n\n211\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.510\nAnd then there's a setting down here,\nit's the third down from the top.\n\n212\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.570\nIt says require additional\nauthentication at startup.\n\n213\n00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.540\nAnd when you configure this, if I turn\nthis on, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n214\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.400\ndisable it cuz I don't wanna lower\nthe integrity of the system that\n\n215\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.780\ndoes have the TPM.\n\n216\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.840\nWhat it's telling you is\nthat you can use the TPM and\n\n217\n00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.110\nyou can use additional options,\na pin or a password.\n\n218\n00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.650\nSo if you don't have the TPM\nthat's what it's gonna say, hey,\n\n219\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.550\nwhen I run that early warning, or\n\n220\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.550\nthat system integrity check, no I\ndidn't find the TPM, but I did look for\n\n221\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.630\nthe group policy and it says, nah,\nthat's okay, don't even worry about it.\n\n222\n00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.690\nNow I'm not gonna, like I said,\nI'm not gonna go ahead and\n\n223\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.590\nput that into play because we definitely\ndon't want to lower the security.\n\n224\n00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.270\nBut if you don't have a TPM,\nit's still gives\n\n225\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.520\nyou the ability to encrypt the volume\nthere, get some kind of protection.\n\n226\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.640\nBut not the full-blown protection\nthat BitLocker was intended for.\n\n227\n00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.630\n>> Awesome.\nSo that's nice.\n\n228\n00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.010\nSo if you get a little, maybe some legacy\ntechnology, or something that just didn't\n\n229\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:06.300\ncome with a TPM, whatever reason that case\nmay be, you can still implement BitLocker.\n\n230\n00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.270\nNow one last thing when\nit comes to BitLocker.\n\n231\n00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.860\nThis is probably my favorite.\n\n232\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.940\nIs BitLocker To Go.\n\n233\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.540\nThat's right.\nYou can get through the drive thru.\n\n234\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.479\nGet you some BitLocker with\na side of fries and a shake.\n\n235\n00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:17.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's BitLocker To Go, right?\n\n236\n00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.705\n>> Yeah, perfect.\n\n237\n00:11:18.705 --> 00:11:22.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As we talk about mobility,\n\n238\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.260\nwe talk about portability of our data,\na lot of people will\n\n239\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.670\nwant to be able to take their\ninformation from device to device.\n\n240\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.815\nWell, as some of you\nare probably very aware of,\n\n241\n00:11:33.815 --> 00:11:35.925\nUSB drives becoming more and\nmore popular, so\n\n242\n00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:38.985\nwe wanna, we want the ability to\nencrypt removable devices as well.\n\n243\n00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:41.385\nAnd that's also something\nthat you can do here.\n\n244\n00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:45.585\nAnd it's really not much difference that\nencrypting any kind of fixed data drive or\n\n245\n00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:47.095\noperating system drive.\n\n246\n00:11:47.095 --> 00:11:51.275\nSo I've actually got\na removable drive plugged in.\n\n247\n00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:53.603\nAnd, let me make this\na little easier to see here.\n\n248\n00:11:53.603 --> 00:11:55.255\nNotice that removable drive.\n\n249\n00:11:55.255 --> 00:11:57.035\nAnd the same thing goes again.\n\n250\n00:11:57.035 --> 00:12:01.520\nIf I right click on it, and I choose\nturn on BitLocker, it's gonna tell me,\n\n251\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.990\nwait a second here, let me check\nto make sure this drive is okay.\n\n252\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.250\nNow you really only get a couple\nof options here when it comes to,\n\n253\n00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.970\nbecause you can't use the TPM, right?\n\n254\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.870\nTPM is tied to a specific\npiece of hardware.\n\n255\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.690\nWe're talking about, Bitlocker to Go.\n\n256\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.240\nSo we're gonna pull this drive out,\nso it can't be associated with a TPM.\n\n257\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.520\nSo I can use a smartcard authentication\nif that's what you have implemented.\n\n258\n00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.360\nYou don't have to go that\ndrastic if you don't want.\n\n259\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.150\nIt's obviously even the more secure way,\nbut we could enter a password, and\n\n260\n00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.310\nwe can password protect this drive.\n\n261\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.913\nSame thing that happens, again, it's also\ngoing to take a recovery key because if\n\n262\n00:12:37.913 --> 00:12:42.716\nthere's conditions of tampering and stuff,\nthis USB drive will also go into recovery\n\n263\n00:12:42.716 --> 00:12:47.420\nmode and it'll require you to enter that\n48 bit recovery key in order to unlock it.\n\n264\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.793\nWe'll go ahead and print our-\n>> Yeah.\n\n265\n00:12:50.793 --> 00:12:53.692\nThat key's a long mamma-jamma.\n\n266\n00:12:53.692 --> 00:12:54.280\n>> It is.\n\n267\n00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.660\nIt's 48 characters, I said 48 digit.\n\n268\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.640\nNotice that it was printed.\n\n269\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.745\nHere's something that's interesting, too.\n\n270\n00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:04.030\nBitLocker's smart enough to know that,\nlet's say that I\n\n271\n00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.050\nstored the recovery key to my operating\nsystem drive on this thumb drive.\n\n272\n00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.930\nBitLocker's smart enough that when\nit looks at that file, it says,\n\n273\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.450\nwell, wait a second here,\nthat's your recovery key on that drive.\n\n274\n00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.280\nAnd it'll do the same thing if\nyou're trying to save a recovery\n\n275\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.210\nkey on the root drive.\n\n276\n00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.260\nIt's gonna say, no, no, we don't think so,\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n277\n00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.870\nSo we went ahead and printed it out.\n\n278\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.970\nAnd this also has that same\nability to just say, hey,\n\n279\n00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.870\nare we gonna just encrypt\nthe space that's being utilized or\n\n280\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.010\nare we gonna go ahead and\nencrypt the whole thing?\n\n281\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.600\nWhen it comes down to it guys,\nif you've got a little bit of time,\n\n282\n00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.590\nI would recommend doing the full\nencryption, you know due diligence.\n\n283\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.000\nAnd it asks if we're ready to encrypt\nthe drive, and now it starts.\n\n284\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.980\nSo, again, is it the one stop shop for\ndata security?\n\n285\n00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.340\nNo.\nBut if you think about it,\n\n286\n00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.120\nit's nice to have something\nbuilt into the operating system.\n\n287\n00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.750\nYou've all ready paid for\nyour operating system,\n\n288\n00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.550\nyou don't have to go to a third party and\n\n289\n00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.950\nget additional technologies even if maybe\nsome of those technologies you like.\n\n290\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.290\nIt's nice to have\nsomething built right in.\n\n291\n00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:01.870\n>> Yeah.\nIt is.\n\n292\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.490\nIt's right there.\n\n293\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.290\nThere's no going to third parties, even\nthough theirs are fantastic technologies\n\n294\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.740\nas well, probably,\nmaybe even better than what Windows has.\n\n295\n00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.990\nBut how many end users are gonna go, oh,\n\n296\n00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.280\nyou know what,\nI need to get some encryption technology.\n\n297\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.090\nI'm gonna go out, I'm gonna do my\nresearch here and find the best one.\n\n298\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.780\nIf it's built into\nthe operating system and\n\n299\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.700\nyou show them it's as easy as doing a\ncouple of clicks and making some nexts and\n\n300\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.720\nwriting down a key or printing it out,\nit's that's that simple.\n\n301\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.480\nThey're gonna do it.\n\n302\n00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.530\nThey're gonna say, oh, wow,\nI can give myself some security and\n\n303\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.660\nit's built into my operating system,\nso I guess I'll do that.\n\n304\n00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.070\nSo it's a very, very nice thing.\n\n305\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.140\nI've used it a lot.\n\n306\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.612\nIt's been very, very helpful.\n\n307\n00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:41.450\nWes, is there anything about\nBitLocker that we should know before\n\n308\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.160\nclosing the show out?\n\n309\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.745\n>> No.\nI think you've really got it.\n\n310\n00:14:43.745 --> 00:14:45.195\nJust remember those recovery keys.\n\n311\n00:14:45.195 --> 00:14:48.030\nThere's a reason they tell you to store\nit in a couple of places because it's\n\n312\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.510\nimportant when you need it, and\nit's always one of those things,\n\n313\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.428\nof course, if you have it, then you\nwon't need it, but if you don't have it,\n\n314\n00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:54.705\nyou're gonna need it tomorrow.\n\n315\n00:14:54.705 --> 00:14:56.692\nSo make sure that it's there.\n\n316\n00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:58.452\n>> That's right.\nDon't print it out and\n\n317\n00:14:58.452 --> 00:14:59.267\ntape it to the drive.\n\n318\n00:14:59.267 --> 00:15:00.192\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, you don't want to do that.\n\n319\n00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:01.030\n>> Don't do that.\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.293\nWell, thanks for watching and\nthanks for joining us Wes.\n\n321\n00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:03.859\n>> It's been fun.\n\n322\n00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:05.717\n>> All those great\ndemonstrations with BitLocker.\n\n323\n00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:07.094\nHopefully you guys enjoyed it.\n\n324\n00:15:07.094 --> 00:15:09.022\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ItPro TV.\n\n325\n00:15:09.022 --> 00:15:10.982\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n326\n00:15:10.982 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.650\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, on this show\ntoday we're coming at you with some more\n\n4\n00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.050\nWindows 10 security, specifically,\nwe're moving into authentication.\n\n5\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.740\nNow this is how we actually let\nthe computer know who the heck are we, and\n\n6\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.510\nhow do we secure that system up,\nand get into our system, so\n\n7\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.290\nthat we can actually, well,\nwork with the computer itself.\n\n8\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.580\nNow I brought along Mr. Wess Bryant today.\n\n9\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.930\nHe's joining us on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.730\nHe's gonna walk us through all\nof many mechanisms, in which,\n\n11\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.430\nwe have built into Windows 10,\n\n12\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.120\nand Wess where's a good starting point\nwhen it comes to authentication?\n\n13\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.340\n>> Well one of the first things that we\nalways think about locking our machines.\n\n14\n00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.580\nProbably the most common\nsecurity implementation,\n\n15\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.710\nand widely used is a password.\n\n16\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.083\nWell, when we look at passwords, we have\nto think about what makes a password\n\n17\n00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:04.063\nsecure, and\nwhat doesn't make a password secure.\n\n18\n00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:09.463\nIt's a concept we call strong passwords,\nand there are many different tips and\n\n19\n00:01:09.463 --> 00:01:13.986\ntricks to getting a strong and\nsecure password onto your systems.\n\n20\n00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:17.210\nBut remember that when we add\na little bit of complexity,\n\n21\n00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.650\nwe add a little bit of a flare,\nif you will, to our password.\n\n22\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.460\nWe hope to make them a little bit more\nimmuned to these password cracking\n\n23\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.390\nsoftware out there.\n\n24\n00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.580\nSo one of the first things we wanna look\nat when we talk about strong passwords is,\n\n25\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.270\nwell, what is the make\nup of a strong password?\n\n26\n00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.490\nSo let's go ahead and check that out here.\n\n27\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.310\nWhen we go to consider strong passwords,\n\n28\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.870\nwe've got a few different things,\ncharacteristics.\n\n29\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.308\nSo let's go ahead and type this out here.\n\n30\n00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:53.231\nWe'll make this a little easier to see.\n\n31\n00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:54.680\nIncrease that font size.\n\n32\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.720\nThere we go.\n\n33\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.350\nAll right, so\nwe've got strong passwords, and\n\n34\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.315\nthe make up of a strong password,\nis first of all, knowing how to type.\n\n35\n00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:06.569\nWhat do we have here, right?\n\n36\n00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.796\nWe've got what are known\nas character sets, and\n\n37\n00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:11.415\nthere are four character sets\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n38\n00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:16.410\nThe first one is going to be your\nuppercase, right, uppercase letters.\n\n39\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.155\nThe second character set that we need\nto be aware of is, well, lowercase.\n\n40\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.590\nOops.\nAnd we've got lower case here.\n\n41\n00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.030\n>> I see you've been taking\nthe Ronnie Wong School of Typing.\n\n42\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.923\n>> Yes, yes, yes I have.\n\n43\n00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:31.300\nHe taught me everything he knows.\n\n44\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.240\nNext thing we have is, well,\nwe've got numbers too.\n\n45\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.010\nSo we've gotta include\nnumbers in the list.\n\n46\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.330\nWell there's one more character\nset that's gonna come into play.\n\n47\n00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.190\nAnd that is, well, special characters.\n\n48\n00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.840\nAnd I can tell you with my typing here,\nit is definitely special, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.730\nSo let's take a take a password.\n\n50\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.590\nNow this pass that I'm gonna to show\nyou is commonly used in training,\n\n51\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.590\nin virtual machines, so while it does\nfall under the line of a strong password,\n\n52\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.990\nyou might not wanna use it.\n\n53\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.430\nAnd so, we're gonna use our\nsuper secret password here.\n\n54\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.620\nWell, find out, well,\n\n55\n00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.210\ndoes this really fall under a strong\npassword as far as its makeup?\n\n56\n00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.020\nAnd if you'll look here, if we take,\nwell the first letter here, right?\n\n57\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.106\nThat's our uppercase.\n\n58\n00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:22.860\nWe've got the @ symbol here, right?\n\n59\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.680\nThat is what are special characters,\nso number four in the list.\n\n60\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.149\nAnd then,\nwe've got a couple of lowercase letters.\n\n61\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.380\nSo that's number two in the list.\n\n62\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.920\nAnd then,\nnotice that we have this number in here.\n\n63\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.980\nSo now that we've got a number in here,\nwe've got three.\n\n64\n00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.560\nAnd last but\n\n65\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.880\nnot least, we've got a couple more letters\nhere that also fall under lowercase.\n\n66\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.150\nSo when it comes down to it,\nfour character sets, this is what is going\n\n67\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.290\nto make a stronger password, and then we\nalso can add the amount of characters.\n\n68\n00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.460\nWhen you include these\nfour character sets,\n\n69\n00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.150\nany time you add another character to\nthe length of the password, you get this\n\n70\n00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.820\nexponential curve in the computational\npower that it takes to crack the password.\n\n71\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.820\nSo that's definitely something you\nwanna have when it comes down to\n\n72\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.470\nstrong passwords, and being able to\nimplement them in your environment.\n\n73\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.530\nIt starts with knowing what makes\na strong password to begin with.\n\n74\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.529\n>> Yeah, so is that gonna stop\nme from using all lower case?\n\n75\n00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.110\nWhat if I just wanted to say\nmy password is password?\n\n76\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.050\n>> Yeah, well, in a work group\nenvironment, where maybe you're not in\n\n77\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.740\na corporate setting,\nthe passwords aren't really in force.\n\n78\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.420\nIt's not something that you really see\nif you're not in a corporate setting.\n\n79\n00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.710\nSo let me go ahead and\ndemonstrate that here.\n\n80\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.710\nWe're saying hey,\n\n81\n00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.750\non this machine we wanna make sure\nthat our users have strong passwords.\n\n82\n00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.280\nSo I'm gonna create a user here\nreal quick in computer management.\n\n83\n00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.300\nAnd we'll see if I can create,\nI would say the opposite of it, right?\n\n84\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.390\nYou know a weak password, so we're going\nto, let's see who we want to pick on?\n\n85\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.320\nWell I don't wanna pick on myself,\nwe'll pick on Mike here.\n\n86\n00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.330\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna use a password of 1234.\n\n87\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.365\nYou know that's super strong, right?\n\n88\n00:05:06.365 --> 00:05:11.030\n1234, and I choose create, and, well,\n\n89\n00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.520\nin the background, now we've got Mike\nthere, and Mike's got a password of 1234.\n\n90\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.050\nProbably not what we want here,\nso in a work groups\n\n91\n00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.570\nsituation you don't really have\ntoo much going on out of the box.\n\n92\n00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.890\nYou don't have too much control over\nwhether these passwords are gonna\n\n93\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.692\nbe secure, or a whether your\nsystems are gonna be secure,\n\n94\n00:05:33.692 --> 00:05:36.995\nor even if the end users\nare creating them that way.\n\n95\n00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:40.290\n>> Yeah,so the defaults are whatever\nyou wanna make it, go ahead.\n\n96\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.850\nIt's fine with us.\n\n97\n00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.830\nWe're just really nice and\nlaid back here in our Windows environment.\n\n98\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.280\nBut kinda what this show is about,\nnot a good idea,\n\n99\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.830\neven though it'll allow you to do that.\n\n100\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.830\nIt'll say, hey you can make your\npassword 1234, if you like, but we know,\n\n101\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.160\nand that's, again, what the show is about,\nthat that is not a secure password.\n\n102\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.180\nThat's not gonna pass muster when it comes\nto people trying to attack your machine,\n\n103\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.370\ntrying to guess your\npassword to gain access.\n\n104\n00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.870\nSo we've gotta do something about it.\n\n105\n00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.180\nNow Wess, is there any way we can\nenforce a stronger set of passwords\n\n106\n00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.270\nin our systems?\n\n107\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.050\n>> Yeah, you can, in fact, on your\nWindows 10 Professional machines your\n\n108\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.140\nWindows 10 Enterprise machines,\nyou can do that.\n\n109\n00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.480\nNow if you've got a home based\nWindows operating system,\n\n110\n00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.510\nyou don't really have a way to enforce\nthis, because in the home environment\n\n111\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.320\nthey're not really worried about more\nof these advanced security features.\n\n112\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.820\nSo do understand that\nwhen we enforce this,\n\n113\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.480\nthat what I'm gonna show you\nhere is limited to the Pro and\n\n114\n00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.200\nthe Enterprise editions, and there's\na technology here that we can use that.\n\n115\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.226\nAnd this is also done in\na corporate environment, as well.\n\n116\n00:06:41.226 --> 00:06:47.910\nSo, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna go\nahead, and I'm gonna launch up our gpedit.\n\n117\n00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:54.503\nNow what is gpedit for us, but\nthat is our local group policy, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:54.503 --> 00:06:59.889\nAnd with the local group policy,\nwe have the ability to tell the end users,\n\n119\n00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.592\nyou know what, you might like\nto use your 1234 password, but\n\n120\n00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:08.122\nwe're not gonna allow\nthat here in our network.\n\n121\n00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:10.630\nSo let me go ahead and show you that.\n\n122\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.820\nYou get down in here into\ncomputer configurations,\n\n123\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.810\nand in your local group policy,\nand under the security settings,\n\n124\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.540\nyou'll see this account\npolicies option here.\n\n125\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.690\nGet into account policies, and\nnow we've got some information,\n\n126\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.240\nour password policy, and\nthe characteristics of a password policy.\n\n127\n00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.420\nSo what does that mean?\n\n128\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.380\nAll right, with our group policy, when we\nput this in place, when we configure this,\n\n129\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.760\nthis means that anybody that logs\ninto this computer, that tries to set\n\n130\n00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.290\na password of 1234, we're gonna hope that\nit restricts that, and it challenges them.\n\n131\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.730\nAnd we've got a few different\nsettings in this list here.\n\n132\n00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.700\nOne of the first settings that you see\nhere is the Enforce Password History.\n\n133\n00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.032\nWell, what is\nthe Enforced Password History for me?\n\n134\n00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:59.791\nThink about it this way, you've got,\nprobably, that one favorite\n\n135\n00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:04.632\npassword that you like to use,\nlike my fluffy bunnies or something And\n\n136\n00:08:04.632 --> 00:08:09.410\nwe don't wanna have passwords with\nindefinite life spans, right?\n\n137\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.580\nBecause that gives the hackers all\nthe time they need to crack the password.\n\n138\n00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.500\nSo when we say password history.\n\n139\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.970\nWhat we're saying is, how many unique\npasswords do you have to come up with\n\n140\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.160\nbefore you can reuse a password?\n\n141\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.900\nSo the password history by default,\nyou can see it's set to zero.\n\n142\n00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.239\nAll right, so\nit's not really enforcing that.\n\n143\n00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:33.060\nBut let's go ahead and\nmodify that real quick.\n\n144\n00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.801\nI'm gonna choose the properties here.\n\n145\n00:08:34.801 --> 00:08:39.437\nAnd inside here, I could say how many\nunique passwords do I wanna require\n\n146\n00:08:39.437 --> 00:08:42.864\nsomebody to cycle through\nbefore they can reuse one.\n\n147\n00:08:42.864 --> 00:08:44.740\nAnd we'll say ten.\n\n148\n00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.830\nTen passwords, ten unique combinations\nthat they have to come up with.\n\n149\n00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.620\nNow once that's set, I'm gonna go ahead\nand skip over one because I wanna talk how\n\n150\n00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.260\na couple of these\ncharacteristics work together.\n\n151\n00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.060\nNow, I can do, if I want, a Ctrl+Alt+Del\nand I could change my password.\n\n152\n00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.820\nWell, I've only got ten history,\nten unique passwords I gotta come up with.\n\n153\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.760\nSo what stops your end user from doing a\nCtrl+Alt+Delete, changing their password,\n\n154\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.960\nlogging back in, Ctrl+Alt+Delete and\nwash rinse repeat ten times.\n\n155\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.200\nAnd now they've bypassed that setting\nalmost like it, well, what good did it do?\n\n156\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.050\nAnd that's where the next\nsetting comes in, and\n\n157\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.920\nthat's the one that says\nminimum password age.\n\n158\n00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.600\nNow the minimum password age says.\n\n159\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.380\nSure you can change your password.\n\n160\n00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.160\nAll right.\n\n161\n00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.930\nBut once you change your password.\n\n162\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.150\nHow long do you have to use it?\n\n163\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.780\nAll right so, I can complement password\nhistory by saying you know what.\n\n164\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.080\nChange your password if you want.\n\n165\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.390\nBut when you do you have to use that\npassword let's say for two days.\n\n166\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.050\nNow when somebody changes their password,\nit kind of helps assist password history,\n\n167\n00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.770\nbecause they change it.\n\n168\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.509\nBut now if they try to change it again,\nit's gonna say no, no, no,\n\n169\n00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:57.031\nthat's not gonna happen.\n\n170\n00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:59.028\nAnd it's gonna have,\nthey're gonna have to wait two days.\n\n171\n00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:00.605\nSo if you look at it there.\n\n172\n00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:03.114\nThey would have what is\nit two times ten 20.\n\n173\n00:10:03.114 --> 00:10:07.272\nIt would take them 20 days before\nthey could ever reuse a password.\n\n174\n00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:09.900\nAnd that's one of the reasons I did\nthese a little bit out of order\n\n175\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.276\ncuz they complement each other.\n\n176\n00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:16.350\nNow the next one is,\nhow long do we want a password to last?\n\n177\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.554\nWe don't wanna, again,\nyou never changing passwords.\n\n178\n00:10:19.554 --> 00:10:23.674\nBecause it gives attackers all the time\nthey need to try to use software and\n\n179\n00:10:23.674 --> 00:10:27.180\nguessing techniques to get\nthat password cracked.\n\n180\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.390\nSo what we can say, and\n\n181\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.050\nyou'll see the default here even\nthough it's not enforced 42 days.\n\n182\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.810\nYou might do, like say, once a month\nyou have to change your password.\n\n183\n00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.860\nNow, what have we done so far?\n\n184\n00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.470\nAll right, we have said.\n\n185\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.430\nHow many unique combinations?\n\n186\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:47.170\nWe've said you're going to change\nyour password at the end of 30 days.\n\n187\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.340\nYou have no choice.\n\n188\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.420\nWe've also said that if\nyou change your password,\n\n189\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.640\nthis is how long you're gonna use it.\n\n190\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.960\nNow, the next thing that we have\nin the list is password length.\n\n191\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.050\nThis one's pretty simple here.\n\n192\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.550\nThis is just how many characters\ndoes your password have to be.\n\n193\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.830\nNotice it says default zero characters.\n\n194\n00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.330\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n195\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.490\nThat doesn't mean you can have\na zero character password.\n\n196\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.050\nIt just means that it's not configured,\n\n197\n00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.320\nbecause we're inside\nof the work group now.\n\n198\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.235\nLittle honorable mention here is that,\ninside of a domain environment,\n\n199\n00:11:17.235 --> 00:11:20.183\nthese settings are configured by default.\n\n200\n00:11:20.183 --> 00:11:21.890\nAnd they're typically pushed out.\n\n201\n00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.975\nSo you won't have the option\nto come in here, and\n\n202\n00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:28.150\nyou won't have that ability,\nthat capability.\n\n203\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.850\nThese are already set, and\nI believe the default is eight characters.\n\n204\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.990\n>> Yeah I think it's eight.\n\n205\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.550\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n206\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.940\nSo we'll go ahead, we'll set up what we\ncommonly see in corporate environments.\n\n207\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.480\nWe'll go ahead and\njust set the default to eight.\n\n208\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.050\nNow, eight character length password\n\n209\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.160\nat this point isn't really\ndoing us much benefit, right?\n\n210\n00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.470\nIf I go one, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight.\n\n211\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.089\nThat's not really a strong password.\n\n212\n00:11:51.089 --> 00:11:54.166\nAnd that's where the next setting\ncomes in, and it really helps us out.\n\n213\n00:11:54.166 --> 00:11:57.683\nAnd that's the password must\nmeet complexity requirements.\n\n214\n00:11:57.683 --> 00:12:00.828\nNow notice that it's disabled by default.\n\n215\n00:12:00.828 --> 00:12:01.798\nAnd if I enable it,\n\n216\n00:12:01.798 --> 00:12:05.990\nnow we're saying you're required\nto use those four character sets.\n\n217\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.090\nAgain, we're not giving the option.\n\n218\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:12.120\nYou're gonna have to use a combination\nof upper case, lower case.\n\n219\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.000\nYou're gonna have to use numbers.\n\n220\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.210\nYou're gonna have to\nuse special characters.\n\n221\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.530\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you get a lovely little\n\n222\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.840\nprompt that let's you know\nthat hey there buddy.\n\n223\n00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.300\nYou didn't use a complex enough password.\n\n224\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.810\nIf you try to get away with one,\ntwo, three, four,\n\n225\n00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.980\nfive, six, seven,\nit's gonna say no, no, no, no.\n\n226\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.770\nYou need to beat our\ncomplexity requirements.\n\n227\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.235\nThat are enabled on this machine so\ngo back and try again.\n\n228\n00:12:32.235 --> 00:12:33.940\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n229\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.510\nNow we've got another one, here.\n\n230\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.580\nAnd this next one is interesting.\n\n231\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.476\nStore passwords.\n\n232\n00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:43.129\nUsing reversible encryption.\n\n233\n00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.770\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n234\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.940\nNow, that's an interesting setting\nyou have there Mr West Brian.\n\n235\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.030\nWhat in the heck would we ever\nwant to enable this setting?\n\n236\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.860\n>> Okay, so you enable this setting.\n\n237\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.230\nNever.\n\n238\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.970\n>> Never.\n\n239\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:55.700\n>> Never.\n\n240\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.510\nSo when you never need to use it,\nnever use it.\n\n241\n00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.580\nReversal encryption.\n\n242\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.100\nI want you guys don't over think this one.\n\n243\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.620\nIf I encrypt something.\n\n244\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.480\nI'm changing plain text into ciphertext.\n\n245\n00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.210\nIf I reverse the process what am I doing?\n\n246\n00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.610\nI'm decrypting.\n\n247\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.002\nSo what this is saying here,\n\n248\n00:13:12.002 --> 00:13:15.891\ntechnically is store your password in\nplain text of the whole world can read it.\n\n249\n00:13:15.891 --> 00:13:20.680\nNow, joking aside when would you use\nthis really for old Legacy systems?\n\n250\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.670\nSystems that are using the challenge\nhandshake authentication protocol chat.\n\n251\n00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.510\nThe server needs to be able\nto compare a hash value of\n\n252\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.020\nthe information that you're sending over,\npart of that authentication process.\n\n253\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:38.060\nAnd if it can't read your password, then\nit's gonna use an already hashed version\n\n254\n00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.520\nto try to do that authentication\nprocess and it's just gonna fail.\n\n255\n00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.611\nSo really Dave, the only time\nyou would use this is just if\n\n256\n00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:49.375\nyou were going to be in\na non-Windows environment.\n\n257\n00:13:49.375 --> 00:13:51.918\nCuz we have things like I MS-CHAP,\nMS-CHAPv2.\n\n258\n00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:55.510\nBut in a non-Windows environment, where\nthey have CHAP and even older systems.\n\n259\n00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.550\nIt might be one of the things\nthat you're gonna set up.\n\n260\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.190\n>> Awesome.\n\n261\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.610\nWell we talked about the password here.\n\n262\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.820\nIt's obviously one of the old venerables\nthat we all kind of know and love, but\n\n263\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.630\nwith Windows 10, even some other\nversions of Windows I believe.\n\n264\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.345\nBut specifically in Windows 10, they\ngive us other options for the password.\n\n265\n00:14:12.345 --> 00:14:14.175\nIt's not the good old standby.\n\n266\n00:14:14.175 --> 00:14:15.985\nIt's if some,\nactually some pretty neat stuff.\n\n267\n00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:19.675\n>> Yeah, yeah, definitely one of\nthe things that's been introduced for\n\n268\n00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:22.695\na bit is a concept known\nas the picture password.\n\n269\n00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:27.920\nIf you need a fast way to get into your\ncomputer that's relatively simple.\n\n270\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.720\nYou can use something known as well,\nthe picture password.\n\n271\n00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.840\nAnd the picture password for\n\n272\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.750\nthe most part, it's another one of those\nthings that if you know where it is.\n\n273\n00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.480\nIt's relatively easy to set up.\n\n274\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.380\nSo here on our Windows machine you can go\nover to the Action Center if you want.\n\n275\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.880\nAnd from the Action Center\nthere's an all settings button.\n\n276\n00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.030\nAnd then you have Accounts over here.\n\n277\n00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.050\nYou can choose accounts.\n\n278\n00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.330\nAnd notice that on the left hand side\nsecond down from the top here we've got\n\n279\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.170\nsign in options.\n\n280\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.020\nAll right.\n\n281\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.420\nAnd we've got various options here\nthat we can use for signing in.\n\n282\n00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.650\nSo one of the first things I want you to\nnotice is that we can change our password\n\n283\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.590\nif I wanted to.\n\n284\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.640\nBut I want you to scroll\ndown just a little bit and\n\n285\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.850\nshow you this picture password.\n\n286\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.835\nNow we go to a picture password, and.\n\n287\n00:15:13.835 --> 00:15:15.495\nThen we're gonna add a picture.\n\n288\n00:15:15.495 --> 00:15:17.655\nFirst thing it's gonna do\nis it's gonna challenge me,\n\n289\n00:15:17.655 --> 00:15:19.555\nmake sure that I am who I say I am.\n\n290\n00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.915\nAnd we could go with the default picture\nif we wanted but I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n291\n00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:24.825\nchange this.\n\n292\n00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:29.715\nSo we'll choose a picture and,\nwell everybody needs an evil chicken,\n\n293\n00:15:29.715 --> 00:15:31.635\nan evil rooster here, so-\n>> Very demonic.\n\n294\n00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:35.005\n>> We're gonna use that and\nit's gonna asked us hey imagine this.\n\n295\n00:15:35.005 --> 00:15:36.025\n>> The Devil's wake up call.\n\n296\n00:15:36.025 --> 00:15:36.925\n>> We're gonna use the picture.\n\n297\n00:15:36.925 --> 00:15:38.140\n>> Here we go.\n\n298\n00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.750\nAll right.\n\n299\n00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.850\nAnd we'll set our picture password here.\n\n300\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.080\nAnd it's going to ask us to do that again.\n\n301\n00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.692\nAnd it says congratulations.\n\n302\n00:15:50.692 --> 00:15:52.052\nWell, we'll find out.\n\n303\n00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:53.253\n>> You can repeat yourself twice.\n\n304\n00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:54.472\n>> That's right.\n\n305\n00:15:54.472 --> 00:15:56.192\nIt'll ask you to confirm it.\n\n306\n00:15:56.192 --> 00:16:01.726\nNow, let's see how well it worked.\n\n307\n00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:03.989\nAll right, so here's our picture.\n\n308\n00:16:03.989 --> 00:16:06.752\nAnd if we repeat those same steps,\n\n309\n00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:11.150\nhopefully we'll see that it logs in and\nwe're set up.\n\n310\n00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.179\nNow, again,\nif you're using a touch screen,\n\n311\n00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:14.920\nit's gonna be a little bit easier here.\n\n312\n00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.121\nI'm in a virtual machine so\nit makes it a little bit more complex.\n\n313\n00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:20.957\nI don't know if it actually\nhelped you at [LAUGH] all.\n\n314\n00:16:20.957 --> 00:16:21.671\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n315\n00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:25.514\nnothing like trying to use the old\ntrackpad to use touch gestures that's\n\n316\n00:16:25.514 --> 00:16:27.360\nmeant for a touch screen.\n\n317\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.250\n>> That's right.\n\n318\n00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.880\nNow we also have, while we're in\nhere additional sign-in options,\n\n319\n00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.120\nwe also have something known as the pin,\n\n320\n00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.600\nnow the PIN is something that you can\nset up, also from sign-in options.\n\n321\n00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.288\nAnd I've already got a PIN set up.\n\n322\n00:16:39.288 --> 00:16:41.667\nSo let me go ahead and\nchoose forgot my PIN.\n\n323\n00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.150\nAnd it's gonna let me\nreset this real quick.\n\n324\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.086\nAll right, so no different in the setup.\n\n325\n00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:53.266\nGonna choose a strong pin of 1234.\n\n326\n00:16:55.763 --> 00:16:57.503\nAnd we'll choose OK.\n\n327\n00:16:57.503 --> 00:17:01.626\nAll right, now that gives us\nan additional sign-in option.\n\n328\n00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:05.468\nLet's see if we can test that out,\nhow that works too.\n\n329\n00:17:05.468 --> 00:17:09.380\nAll right, so we're gonna go back to the\nlockout screen, or I'm a lock myself out.\n\n330\n00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.660\nAnd I've got a couple of options.\n\n331\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.210\nNotice that I've got picture now,\ngot the little key.\n\n332\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.260\nThe key here is just your\ntraditional password.\n\n333\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.110\nBut then I also got this little\nalmost like text and when I,\n\n334\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.230\nlet me switch from one of the other so\nyou can see the transition here.\n\n335\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.893\nThere's the picture password.\n\n336\n00:17:26.893 --> 00:17:28.482\nNotice I can put in the pin.\n\n337\n00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:32.919\nAnd the pin actually makes it even easier\nto log in so in a situation where maybe I\n\n338\n00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:36.899\nneed to log in constantly and\nI'm right there in front of my computer.\n\n339\n00:17:36.899 --> 00:17:40.640\nOr you need to get to a specific\napplication like the Windows Store.\n\n340\n00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.980\nIt makes it easier and\na little bit more fluid to log in.\n\n341\n00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.460\n>> Yeah, now Wes, the one thing I noticed\nis that you used 1234 as your pin.\n\n342\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.652\nIs that any different and\n\n343\n00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:53.320\nwith the complexity issues when it comes\nto a PIN as it does with a password?\n\n344\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.570\n>> Yeah, PINs can reduce the amount of\nsecurity so you have to be careful.\n\n345\n00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.940\nI think what is it,\nten to the power of four, so\n\n346\n00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.890\nthere's like 11,000 combinations roughly.\n\n347\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:07.860\nSo, you gotta be careful with\nthe password, but it's a familiar concept.\n\n348\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.610\nMany of you guys out there\nhave your cell phones and\n\n349\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:15.240\nyou have your tablets out there so,\nreally, what you're doing is bringing that\n\n350\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.245\nfluidity and that familiar concept\nover to the client itself.\n\n351\n00:18:18.245 --> 00:18:19.535\n>> Gotcha.\n\n352\n00:18:19.535 --> 00:18:22.605\nWell, anything else when\nit comes to Windows 10 and\n\n353\n00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:25.365\nits ability to authenticate us as a user?\n\n354\n00:18:25.365 --> 00:18:26.945\n>> Yeah, there actually is.\n\n355\n00:18:26.945 --> 00:18:31.700\nIf you have any kind of\nbiometrics implementation.\n\n356\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.570\nOne of the things that you\nmight be able to do is you\n\n357\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:39.260\nmight be able to implement something\nknown as the Windows Hello feature.\n\n358\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.020\nNow the Windows Hello feature again,\n\n359\n00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.350\nit's gonna require to having\nsome kind of biometrics device.\n\n360\n00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.330\nIf you've got the biometrics\ndevice plugged into the machine or\n\n361\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.500\nintegrated in the machine,\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n362\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.078\nYou're ready to go right away.\n\n363\n00:18:53.078 --> 00:18:57.594\nIf you don't, then you have to do your\nresearch on what kind of finger print\n\n364\n00:18:57.594 --> 00:19:01.913\nscanner you might want to implement,\nso you can plug into the machine.\n\n365\n00:19:01.913 --> 00:19:08.430\nAnd that'll really be contingent on your\ncompany and how you're gonna support that.\n\n366\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.040\nWe've got our fingerprint\nscanner connected.\n\n367\n00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.510\nOne of the prerequisites for\n\n368\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.210\nusing the Windows Hello feature\nis you have to have your PIN set.\n\n369\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.460\nSince we've already got that set up,\nwe should be good to go.\n\n370\n00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:25.230\nNow, when you first launch the Windows\nHello, you'll see the Set-up option.\n\n371\n00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.990\nAnd it's gonna ask you,\nwell let's get started.\n\n372\n00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.570\nIt'll ask you to authenticate.\n\n373\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:34.980\nAnd when you set it up.\n\n374\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.810\nWe're gonna do that one more time here.\n\n375\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.810\nNow what you're gonna have to do is\nyou're gonna have to swipe your finger\n\n376\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.060\nacross the fingerprint reader, slowly.\n\n377\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.580\nI've made the mistake of doing this\ntoo fast and you might see it here.\n\n378\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.850\nWe're actually doing pretty good.\n\n379\n00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:57.140\nIt might tell you that the device\nis having a hard time recognizing\n\n380\n00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.500\nyour fingerprint.\n\n381\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.150\nIf that happens just a little blue\ntext down there at the bottom,\n\n382\n00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.300\nit's gonna say just slow down and\nit'll set it.\n\n383\n00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.420\nNow.\n>> Pump your brakes and slow your role.\n\n384\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.625\n>> That's right, clutch.\n\n385\n00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.215\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And notice that it says, okay,\n\n386\n00:20:12.215 --> 00:20:13.415\nyou're all set.\n\n387\n00:20:13.415 --> 00:20:14.805\nLet's find out if that worked, though.\n\n388\n00:20:14.805 --> 00:20:18.755\nLet's make sure we're not at a magic show,\nhere.\n\n389\n00:20:18.755 --> 00:20:22.705\nAnd hopefully this\nactually implemented it.\n\n390\n00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:25.980\nAnd let's see what kinda\noptions we have here.\n\n391\n00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.950\nWe'll go ahead, and notice it says scan\nyour finger on the fingerprint reader.\n\n392\n00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.400\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n393\n00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.190\nWe do the scan and look at that.\n\n394\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.530\nWe've got fingerprint action here,\nand goodness, and we're ready to go.\n\n395\n00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.960\n>> Well obviously that is quite a more\nconvenient way in which to login,\n\n396\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.240\nbe able to just swipe a finger\non a piece of plastic, there.\n\n397\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.610\nI thought it was actually, sweet.\n\n398\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.040\nJust swiped it and logged right in.\n\n399\n00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.600\nNo passwords, no pins.\n\n400\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.220\nAnd guess what?\n\n401\n00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.720\nI don't have to remember any passwords or\npins.\n\n402\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.200\nAnd the only person that has my\nfingerprint is, well, me, so and\n\n403\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.340\ngood luck getting that away from me,\nbeing able to log into my computer.\n\n404\n00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:07.060\nSo kind of the gets away from the whole\ninsecurities that are in passwords,\n\n405\n00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.350\nthat are in PIN numbers.\n\n406\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.830\nIt's probably the best way to go,\nright, Wes?\n\n407\n00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.750\n>> Yeah, I would say so too.\n\n408\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.250\nThey've also got built-in support for\nretina but you need the hardware,\n\n409\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.060\nand since it's a relatively\nnew technology,\n\n410\n00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.860\nthere's not a lot of hardware out\nthere that quite supports it yet.\n\n411\n00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.890\nBut you should look for more cameras and\nstuff so you can also get not\n\n412\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.230\nonly the fingerprint recognition, you\ncan also get the retina display as well.\n\n413\n00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.065\n>> Awesome.\nWell, guess what, people?\n\n414\n00:21:29.065 --> 00:21:31.700\nWe are running out of time for\nthis episode but\n\n415\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.620\nwe have a few more methods and tricks up\nour sleeves that we wanna show you when\n\n416\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.830\nit comes to authentication inside\nof a Windows 10 environment.\n\n417\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.335\nSo, we're gonna have to make\na part two on this guy.\n\n418\n00:21:41.335 --> 00:21:42.620\nWes, I look forward to seeing you there.\n\n419\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.920\nI look forward to seeing all\nof our viewers there as well.\n\n420\n00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.990\nThanks for watching.\n\n421\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.000\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n422\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.834\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n423\n00:21:49.834 --> 00:21:51.622\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n424\n00:21:51.622 --> 00:21:57.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.437\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrey and\n\n4\n00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:23.750\ntoday we're gonna be discussing Windows\n10 security, specifically authentication.\n\n5\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.051\nNow don't forget to check out part one.\n\n6\n00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:29.252\nBut here in part two, we're gonna move\nright on into a few more things we can\n\n7\n00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:33.520\nuse to make sure to secure our\nauthentication when it comes to Windows.\n\n8\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.830\nAnd Wes, we've got Wes Bryant\nhere on the show today.\n\n9\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.440\nThanks for joining us, Wesley.\n\n10\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.090\nWhere do we begin or\nwhere do we continue should I say?\n\n11\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.880\n>> That's right.\n\n12\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.050\nYou know in part one we talked about\nmanaging things like credentials and\n\n13\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.070\nputting in passwords and\npictures and pins.\n\n14\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.910\nWell, one of the things that we have\ninside of Windows that can make our life\n\n15\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.780\na little easier and help us manage\nall of that credential information\n\n16\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.570\nimagine this is something\ncalled the credential manager.\n\n17\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.000\nNow the credential manager very,\nvery handy little tool.\n\n18\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.632\nSo let's go ahead and check that\nout here on our Windows machine.\n\n19\n00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.920\nAll right,\nwhen we get in to our control panel.\n\n20\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.760\nNow, let me show you\nthe Windows feature here.\n\n21\n00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.550\nI can just type credential.\n\n22\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.660\nIn fact, C R, it's all I had to type and\n\n23\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.920\nlook at right up there at the top\nthe credential manager comes up.\n\n24\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.890\nSo you can find this in\nthe Control Panel but\n\n25\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.415\nyou know use that Search functionality.\n\n26\n00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.215\nThat search feature.\n\n27\n00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.285\nThat's what we have it there for.\n\n28\n00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:26.065\nIt makes life a whole bunch easier.\n\n29\n00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.915\nNow the credential manager.\n\n30\n00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:32.825\nAs you visit websites and\neven log into networks what the credential\n\n31\n00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:37.850\nmanager is going to do is it's gonna\nstore your authentication credentials.\n\n32\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.310\nNow you can see we have\nweb credentials here.\n\n33\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.180\nWe also have some local\nWindows credentials.\n\n34\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.290\nNow I don't have many credentials in here.\n\n35\n00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.410\nBut as you start to browse\nto different locations,\n\n36\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.395\nyou login to different websites.\n\n37\n00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:52.370\nIt'll start to store this information for\nus.\n\n38\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.800\nNow that's handy,\n\n39\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.420\nbecause it can help us to do things\nlike implement single sign-on, right?\n\n40\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.050\nWe can enter our password just once.\n\n41\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.110\nAnd we don't have to turn around and\nenter them again.\n\n42\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.980\nNow you can also, if you want,\nyou add additional credentials here.\n\n43\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.360\nYou'll see up at the top, that little\njump link that says add credentials here.\n\n44\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.360\nAnd if I've got a specific website\nthat I like to visit a lot, and\n\n45\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.850\nI've got my user name and password, I can\nenter it right here, and I can store that.\n\n46\n00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.640\nNow, when we say store that information,\nis it stored securely?\n\n47\n00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.580\nWell, it is.\nYour passwords are stored in what\n\n48\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.260\nare known as vaults.\n\n49\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.850\nAnd they're stored in a specialized\nlocation here on the machine\n\n50\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.050\nkeeping them protected.\n\n51\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.070\nSo it's a good way that if you do log on\nto different places, if you join networks,\n\n52\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.890\nif you visit websites, rather than\nhave to remember all those passwords.\n\n53\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.560\nOr get some kinda third party password\nmanager, which are common today.\n\n54\n00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.700\nYou can do this all\nnatively inside of Windows.\n\n55\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.615\nYou can also do more advanced\nauthentication storage here too.\n\n56\n00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:51.092\nSo if you work with a company and\nmaybe they're issuing certificates and\n\n57\n00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:53.264\nreally trying to strengthen that security.\n\n58\n00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:54.970\nWell, you can add certificates here.\n\n59\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.467\nSo Credential Manager here this is a very,\nvery good thing to have on your machines.\n\n60\n00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:05.987\nAnd one of the things also I like to\nmention because from a security stand\n\n61\n00:03:05.987 --> 00:03:08.170\npoint you probably\nshould be aware of this.\n\n62\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.999\nIf you're in a work group you're\nnot joined to a corporate domain or\n\n63\n00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:13.016\nWindows domain.\n\n64\n00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:15.776\nThe credential manager\nis turned on by default.\n\n65\n00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:18.732\nHowever, due to the security\nof domain environment.\n\n66\n00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:24.220\nWe have other authentication mechanisms\nand in a domain environment it's disabled.\n\n67\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.660\nIt can be turned on but it's disabled,\nbecause they certainly don't want your\n\n68\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.340\ncorporate information being\nstored on the local machine.\n\n69\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.400\nEspecially like a laptop where\nI take my laptop and I go home.\n\n70\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.540\nI've left it somewhere, maybe someone\ngrabbed the five-finger discount,\n\n71\n00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.450\nsteals it.\n\n72\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.870\nAnd now all of those credentials for\n\n73\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.840\nyour corporate environment\nare stored on the local machine.\n\n74\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.798\nSo workgroups, gonna be enabled,\non your domains,\n\n75\n00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:47.848\nit's gonna be disabled by default.\n\n76\n00:03:47.848 --> 00:03:50.773\n>> Yeah this does remind me of\nthings like LastPass, right?\n\n77\n00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:54.474\nI wanna, keeping a centralized\narea where all my passwords are,\n\n78\n00:03:54.474 --> 00:03:56.570\nfor all the logins that I go through.\n\n79\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.530\nI know this is one of the biggest\ncomplaints of an end user.\n\n80\n00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.462\nThey always talk about,\nyou don't know how many usernames and\n\n81\n00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:03.913\npasswords I have to remember.\n\n82\n00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:06.901\nI've got a whole list of them written\ndown, sitting next to my keyboard at work.\n\n83\n00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.193\nYet not a good idea, something like\nthis credential manager right here,\n\n84\n00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:11.798\nbuilds into the operating system.\n\n85\n00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:13.700\nYou don't have to install\nthird party software.\n\n86\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.030\nThat's gonna make it easy to use, and\nit's gonna allow them to keep it safe.\n\n87\n00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.040\nThey're not writing it down on a piece of\npaper, of course one of the most insecure\n\n88\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.730\nand even stereotypical ideas when it\ncomes to unsecurity I guess is the term.\n\n89\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.546\n>> [LAUGH] Write it down on a sticky\nnote and put it right on the monitor or\n\n90\n00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:33.230\nunderneath the keyboard,\na perfect place for your password.\n\n91\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.310\n>> Don't do that.\n\n92\n00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.960\nAll right Wes, but\nvery cool I'm glad it's there.\n\n93\n00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.650\nI admit it does make it\na whole lot easier for\n\n94\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.420\nend users to implement some\nsecurity that is easy for them.\n\n95\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.420\nNow we're talking about credentials.\n\n96\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.710\nIn Windows 10 there is a new feature\nwhen it comes to credentials, right Wes?\n\n97\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.330\n>> It is.\nAnd\n\n98\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.070\nyou might have heard me kind of mention\nit accidentally here because we've got\n\n99\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.080\ncredential manager.\n\n100\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.690\nThat centralizes\nthe authentication information but\n\n101\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.440\nwe've also got something that's\ncalled a credential guard.\n\n102\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.032\nNow credential guard is\na little bit different.\n\n103\n00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:07.284\nThis one's under the hood and\nit's disabled by default,\n\n104\n00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:09.638\nbut it is a really cool feature.\n\n105\n00:05:09.638 --> 00:05:13.830\nSee when you log into a machine you\nhave your Local Security Authority.\n\n106\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.990\nThat's the service that runs within\nWIndows that it takes your password and\n\n107\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.761\ncompares it to a database where\nusernames and passwords are stored.\n\n108\n00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:26.286\nWell that information can be\naccessible to things like viruses and\n\n109\n00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:29.206\nmalware if you get these on your machines.\n\n110\n00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:33.049\nSo what they've done with credential\nguard is they've said let's take\n\n111\n00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:35.641\nthe virtualization\ncapabilities that we have.\n\n112\n00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:39.097\nAnd those interactions between\nthat local security authority and\n\n113\n00:05:39.097 --> 00:05:42.500\nsome more of these services like that,\nlet's virtualize them.\n\n114\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.530\nAll right?\nAnd the point of this is not so\n\n115\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.190\nmuch to get into virtualization,\nbut virtualization isolates, right?\n\n116\n00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.970\nIt's one of the good things about\nvirtualization is you have this\n\n117\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.680\nisolated communication.\n\n118\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.360\nSo now this interaction\nbetween these securities\n\n119\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.110\nfeatures are in a virtualized environment.\n\n120\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.733\nSo the operating system,\nif it gets a virus,\n\n121\n00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:03.951\nit won't be able to interact with it.\n\n122\n00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:07.318\nBut it is disabled by default and you\nhave to know where to go to turn that on.\n\n123\n00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:08.377\nSo let's go ahead and check that out.\n\n124\n00:06:08.377 --> 00:06:11.825\nYou're gonna do this with your\nlocal group policy editor.\n\n125\n00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:16.045\nNow if you're in a domain environment just\nbe a gpo inside of active directory here.\n\n126\n00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:21.350\nSo let's go ahead and what we'll\ndo is we'll type our gp edit .msc.\n\n127\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.540\nAnd I could just launch it here\nfrom that search functionality.\n\n128\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.350\nBut you should really know Gpedit.msc.\n\n129\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.000\nIt's an easy way to open up\nthe Local Group Policy Editor.\n\n130\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.130\nNow this is a computer configuration.\n\n131\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.767\nAll right.\nSo we're gonna be under the top portion of\n\n132\n00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:38.406\nthis GPO.\n\n133\n00:06:38.406 --> 00:06:40.904\nWe're gonna be under\nComputer Configuration.\n\n134\n00:06:40.904 --> 00:06:43.794\nWe're gonna be under\nAdministrative Templates, and\n\n135\n00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:46.200\nthen we're gonna be under System.\n\n136\n00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.540\nNow here's where it gets a little cryptic,\nall pun intended.\n\n137\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.540\n>> All pun intended.\n>> All pun intended.\n\n138\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.880\nIs it doesn't say credential manager.\n\n139\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.990\nI want you to look here, it says Device\nGuard, and that's a little confusing.\n\n140\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.740\nWe call it Credential Guard, but\n\n141\n00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.290\nto turn it on, we'll name it\nsomething completely different.\n\n142\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.990\nSo just be careful with that,\nand like I said,\n\n143\n00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.040\nthis one's kinda tucked\naway hidden a little bit.\n\n144\n00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.551\n>> That was a brilliant moves\nby the powers that be, right?\n\n145\n00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:11.242\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n146\n00:07:11.242 --> 00:07:14.558\nI'm not sure if big brother was involved\nin that one, but it certainly makes sense.\n\n147\n00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:18.675\nNow notice it says right there turn\non virtualization based security.\n\n148\n00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:22.064\nAgain, all we're doing is\nthose core security features,\n\n149\n00:07:22.064 --> 00:07:26.084\nwe're gonna isolate them so\nonly this technology can work with them.\n\n150\n00:07:26.084 --> 00:07:31.620\nAnd they're gonna be protected from\nthe rest of the operating system and\n\n151\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.081\nit's very easy If you see here\nwe've got not configured.\n\n152\n00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.460\nSo it's not turned on by default,\nand we can enable it.\n\n153\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.800\nYou probably don't want to disable it.\n\n154\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.630\nIf you don't want to use it,\nyou know just out of sight, out of mind,\n\n155\n00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.980\njust don't mess with it, yeah.\n\n156\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.820\nSo we're gonna turn it on.\n\n157\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.230\nAnd now, under Device Guard,\nwe have Credential Guard.\n\n158\n00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.180\nAnd when we turn this on,\n\n159\n00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.680\nyou can see it basically virtualizes some\nof these more important security features.\n\n160\n00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.560\nWe turn it on, and\njust like that, it's enabled, and\n\n161\n00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.930\nyou don't really see much of it.\n\n162\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.630\nSo you don't see much of it,\nwhen it's disabled.\n\n163\n00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.631\nAnd well you probably see even\nless of it when it's enabled.\n\n164\n00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:12.834\nBut the good thing about it is,\nonce we do have that set in configure,\n\n165\n00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:15.878\nwe can be a little bit more sure that,\nhopefully,\n\n166\n00:08:15.878 --> 00:08:19.371\nviruses won't have direct\naccess to that information.\n\n167\n00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:21.883\nLike they did in earlier\nadditions of Windows.\n\n168\n00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:26.491\n>> And with the fact that virtualization\nis becoming one of the ways in\n\n169\n00:08:26.491 --> 00:08:31.345\nwhich we segregate out a user's\npersonal device from their private,\n\n170\n00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:33.600\ntheir work environment.\n\n171\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.725\nAnd that's becoming more common everyday.\n\n172\n00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:38.995\nThis is the kinda technology that we\nneed because that's one of the big\n\n173\n00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:40.655\nworries out there in the IT world.\n\n174\n00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:43.763\nWe gotta worry about,\nokay if they're using their own laptop.\n\n175\n00:08:43.763 --> 00:08:46.395\nIf we're not providing them a device and\nyet\n\n176\n00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:49.965\nthey need to do work on that\ndevice how do I keep that secure?\n\n177\n00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:52.887\nCuz a lot of times shops will\ngo to a virtualized environment.\n\n178\n00:08:52.887 --> 00:08:54.557\nThey'll install virtualization software.\n\n179\n00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:58.913\nBut you still gotta worry because they're\nsharing resources like RAM and hard drive.\n\n180\n00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:05.206\nYou don't want viruses to be able to jump\nfrom their home OS to their work OS.\n\n181\n00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:09.930\nAnd start doing bad things and taking over\nand getting into data and stuff like that.\n\n182\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:10.540\n>> Definitely.\nAnd\n\n183\n00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.570\nthis is one of the newer technologies with\nvirtualization that Windows 10 implements.\n\n184\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.990\nSpeaking about Credential Guard,\nis something known as the Microvisor.\n\n185\n00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.750\nWe talk about a hypervisor and\n\n186\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.990\nthat's just virtualizing the entire\noperating system on hardware.\n\n187\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.740\nMicrovisor does a lot what this is doing.\n\n188\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.210\nIt takes a specific piece of software.\n\n189\n00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.670\nAnd it virtualizes the whole process.\n\n190\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.410\nSo, if a virus infects the software,\n\n191\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.880\nit doesn't have access to\nthe protected hardware.\n\n192\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.060\nAnd that's really what your\nCredential Guard is built on.\n\n193\n00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.190\n>> Awesome, yeah, very,\nvery cool piece of technology Now Wes,\n\n194\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.790\nis there any other hangers on some other\nrandom tidbits of authentication goodness?\n\n195\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.310\n>> Yeah, we do have some honorable\nmentions that we kind of want to bring to\n\n196\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.360\nthe forefront here.\n\n197\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.380\nNow we've talked already pretty\ngood about things like your GPO\n\n198\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.260\nyour local group policy editor.\n\n199\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.160\nBut I do want to mention something\nknown as the local security policy.\n\n200\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.740\nAnd for the most part what you're going\nto see here is it's not really much\n\n201\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.620\ndifferent than GPO or\ngroup policy objects.\n\n202\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.040\nAnd you can get to that\na couple different ways.\n\n203\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.820\nI'm just going to type secpol here.\n\n204\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.760\nIn fact, I love the search functionality.\n\n205\n00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.440\nI don't even have to type\nthe whole thing here.\n\n206\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.540\nAnd that brings up your\nlocal security policy.\n\n207\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.180\nNow, all of these setting by the way guys,\n\n208\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.950\nthey're not any different than\nwhat you see in your GPO.\n\n209\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.670\nAnd let me just prove that\nto you here real quick.\n\n210\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.830\nWe'll, so used to a touch screen,\nI'm ready to touch the screen here.\n\n211\n00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.650\nIf I pull these just side by side\nnotice the security settings that we\n\n212\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.830\nhave in the group policy.\n\n213\n00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:39.343\nSide by side here, you'll see, and if you\nlook here, notice that they're identical.\n\n214\n00:10:39.343 --> 00:10:42.110\nSo what they did with the local\nsecurity policy is they said.\n\n215\n00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.853\nWell maybe all you're worried\nabout is configuring security.\n\n216\n00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:49.949\nYou're not worried about all the other\nsettings that you can get really down\n\n217\n00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:53.416\nto the nitty gritty and the gpo,\nthe group policy editor there.\n\n218\n00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:55.480\nAnd you just wanna pull\nthose security settings out.\n\n219\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.250\nSo that's really what your\nlocal security authority is.\n\n220\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.250\nIt's just taking all those\nsecurity settings and\n\n221\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.670\nputting them in a single interface.\n\n222\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.200\nNow we've got a couple\nof other things too.\n\n223\n00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.360\nWe've got, for instance, we've got\nsomething known as the Windows Passport.\n\n224\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.970\nThis is another thing that\nyou don't really see.\n\n225\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:15.940\nYet it works with the Windows Hello and it\nacts like a single sign on implementation.\n\n226\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.100\nAnd once you have it set up,\n\n227\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.610\nyou can do things like authenticate\nto your Microsoft account.\n\n228\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.590\nYou can authenticate to an active\ndirectory domain, or Azure.\n\n229\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.100\nThere's the cloud,\nif you're implementing it.\n\n230\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.620\nAnd like I said, it integrates with that\nWindows Hello, and biometric scans too.\n\n231\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.670\nThe other one is something that's been\naround for a while, is the Windows lock.\n\n232\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.800\nAnd one of the things that\nwe say in basic security,\n\n233\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.380\nlet's go back to the simplistic nature.\n\n234\n00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.010\nIf I can gain access to your computer.\n\n235\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.930\nWell, Microsoft says one of the ten\nimmutable laws of security,\n\n236\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.430\nif I can touch your computer,\nits no longer your computer.\n\n237\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.200\nSo, this is just as simple as doing\nthe Windows key and L shortcut.\n\n238\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.500\nLocks your machine when\nyou walk away from it.\n\n239\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.990\nRequires a password to be able\nto get back to the desktop.\n\n240\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.818\nOne of the last ones I think I would\nmention is an oldie but a goody, and\n\n241\n00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:03.210\nthat's screen savers.\n\n242\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.340\nYou might say, well wait a second,\nscreen savers?\n\n243\n00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.385\nDo we really worry about\nsaving our screens?\n\n244\n00:12:08.385 --> 00:12:12.310\nIt's not so much for the screen saver\npart as it is a security technique.\n\n245\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.080\nLet me show you that, fairly easy.\n\n246\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.530\nAnd again, with that Windows search\nfeature we can just do change screen\n\n247\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.870\nsaver here.\n\n248\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.320\nNotice all I did was typed in saver,\nby default it's not turned on.\n\n249\n00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.530\nIt says none.\n\n250\n00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.463\nBut if we want to mystify\neverybody out here.\n\n251\n00:12:28.463 --> 00:12:31.480\nWe can turn on our old\nmystify screen saver.\n\n252\n00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.543\nMore importantly what I want\nto kind of show you here.\n\n253\n00:12:34.543 --> 00:12:37.556\nIs this on resume display\nthe login screen.\n\n254\n00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:42.155\nSo if you're gonna walk away from your\nmachine, you should be locking it so\n\n255\n00:12:42.155 --> 00:12:45.660\nthat it requires a password,\nbut you know, it happens.\n\n256\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.250\nSometimes you gotta get to that\ncoffee quick, you don't have time,\n\n257\n00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.250\nyou forget about it.\n\n258\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.900\nWell if you set this to\nsomething like wait one minute,\n\n259\n00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.460\na little too restrictive there.\n\n260\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.990\nWhen you walk away and you come back,\nto get back into your computer.\n\n261\n00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.730\nYou're gonna have to enter\na password to log back on, and\n\n262\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.580\nthat's always a good thing.\n\n263\n00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.230\nYou never want to leave\nan open system like that.\n\n264\n00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.960\nIt doesn't matter where it is.\n\n265\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.380\nIt doesn't matter if\nit's a Windows machine.\n\n266\n00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.360\nIt doesn't matter if it's your phone.\n\n267\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.180\nIt doesn't matter if\nit's a wireless network.\n\n268\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.720\nMake sure if you're not going\nto be in front of your machine,\n\n269\n00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.560\nthat it's protected.\n\n270\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.080\n>> Yeah it's-\n>> Kind of like you bought a big old vault\n\n271\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.360\nwith a three foot thick door.\n\n272\n00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.840\nAll these locks and bolts and stuff on it,\n\n273\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.300\nand you can just leave it open with\nthe money sitting right there.\n\n274\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.830\nThat's basically what you're doing\nwhen you don't lock your system.\n\n275\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.074\nSo if you're gonna walk away from your\nsystem, do the ctrl-alt-delete or\n\n276\n00:13:26.074 --> 00:13:27.905\nthe Windows Key Well, then lock it.\n\n277\n00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:31.035\nRight, then somebody just can't\nwalk up and start accessing data,\n\n278\n00:13:31.035 --> 00:13:34.815\ncopying files, implanting viruses, or\ndoing whatever it is they wanna do.\n\n279\n00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:36.608\nWe used to have a lot of\nfun with it actually.\n\n280\n00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:39.921\nAnd teach people this is\nprobably not a good idea Wes and\n\n281\n00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:42.092\nI used to work for the same company.\n\n282\n00:13:42.092 --> 00:13:42.846\nNot at the same time.\n\n283\n00:13:42.846 --> 00:13:43.716\n>> Not at the same time, yeah.\n\n284\n00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:44.773\n>> But we worked for the same company.\n\n285\n00:13:44.773 --> 00:13:48.094\nAnd the company we worked for,\nwe would do what's called Pooh You.\n\n286\n00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:48.917\n>> Yeah the backgrounds.\n\n287\n00:13:48.917 --> 00:13:52.490\n>> Put a Winnie the Pooh background,\nall this other stuff.\n\n288\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.760\nAnd, funny little icons and.\n\n289\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.010\nIt was just a good reminder of\ndon't walk away from your computer\n\n290\n00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.110\nif it's not locked.\n\n291\n00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.300\nLock that thing.\n\n292\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.440\nThen walk away.\n\n293\n00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.010\nAnd an easy way to protect that and\n\n294\n00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.570\nmake sure you didn't have to worry\nabout was implement that screen saver.\n\n295\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.520\nAdd that time on there.\n\n296\n00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.120\nMake it five, ten minutes, whatever it is.\n\n297\n00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.300\nSomething reasonable.\n\n298\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.380\nAnd that way if you do walk away,\nit's gonna lock automatically and\n\n299\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.830\nit's gonna ask for\nyour password when you come back.\n\n300\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.810\nIt doesn't just give\nthe keys to the castle out.\n\n301\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.960\nAuto locks, that's really what it is.\n\n302\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.290\n>> That's right.\nNo coming back and\n\n303\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.110\nall of a sudden you've got your\nfavorite boy band as your background.\n\n304\n00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.970\nAnd I swear that's my story and\nI'm sticking to it.\n\n305\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:26.600\n>> That's right.\n\n306\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.130\nNot that he's a huge INSync fan.\n\n307\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.475\n>> Yeah, right.\n>> But he's a huge NSync fan.\n\n308\n00:14:29.475 --> 00:14:31.113\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n309\n00:14:31.113 --> 00:14:31.995\n>> All right Wes,\nis there anything else we need to cover?\n\n310\n00:14:31.995 --> 00:14:34.154\n>> No.\n\n311\n00:14:34.154 --> 00:14:36.380\nRemember basic security.\n\n312\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.320\nAgain, like Dan was just saying.\n\n313\n00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.570\nYou walk away from your machine at\nleast make sure its password protected,\n\n314\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.310\nthat's a start.\n\n315\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.810\nNo accounts, open systems.\n\n316\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.320\nLock it when you walk away.\n\n317\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.840\nSet your screensaver if you have to,\nnot for\n\n318\n00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.770\nthe purposes of obscuring your screen\nas more as it is securing your desktop.\n\n319\n00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.160\n>> All right.\nThanks so much for that Wes.\n\n320\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.520\nWe appreciate you being here.\n\n321\n00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.835\nWe thank you guys out there for watching\nthe show and hanging out with us today.\n\n322\n00:14:57.835 --> 00:14:59.218\nWe're gonna go ahead and call it a close.\n\n323\n00:14:59.218 --> 00:15:01.819\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n324\n00:15:01.819 --> 00:15:03.072\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n325\n00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:04.698\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n326\n00:15:04.698 --> 00:15:06.375\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

exciting\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.110\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.120\nIn today's episode we\nare covering Windows 10 security,\n\n6\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.180\nspecifically host security, and\ntoday I brought along none other than\n\n7\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.220\nMr Wes Bryan to help us\nbetter understand said topic.\n\n8\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.470\nHow are you doing today, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.090\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.310\nMan, it's good to be here and one of\nthe things in hopes security that we're\n\n11\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.170\nreally going to be talking about a lot is\na concept you might be familiar with and\n\n12\n00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.560\nif not, well you're in the right place.\n\n13\n00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.030\nWe're going to be talking\nabout system hardening.\n\n14\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.750\nNow that term system hardening just\nbasically means doing things like\n\n15\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.410\nprotecting the operating system.\n\n16\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.550\nYou can go from a physical standpoint\ntalking about hardware, but\n\n17\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.740\nwe're really dealing with the software\ninside of the Windows 10 operating system\n\n18\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.910\nthat we have, to ensure that the system\ncollectively is a little bit more secure.\n\n19\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.020\nSo that's what we're setting up today.\n\n20\n00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.390\nOne of the first things that we have to\ntalk about is patch management, right?\n\n21\n00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.900\nSo, what do we mean when we\nsay patching a system up?\n\n22\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.920\nBut you've probably seen before,\nWindows might tell you that, hey,\n\n23\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.040\nyou've got a couple of days and\nwe're gonna restart your computer, and\n\n24\n00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.690\nit's just going to happen, and\nyou're not going to like it.\n\n25\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.140\nAnd you might not even be ready with it.\n\n26\n00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.420\nWell you know,\nthat's Window's Update for us today and\n\n27\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080\nthat's one of the things said that\nthe primary interfaces that we\n\n28\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.505\nuse to make sure that our systems have\nsecurity patches, have any hot fixes.\n\n29\n00:01:33.505 --> 00:01:37.900\nCuz it happens, you know,\nwhen an operating system is released it\n\n30\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.450\nalmost always within a couple of days you\ngot all the hackers worldwide go out and\n\n31\n00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.630\nsay hey,\nhow can we break into this system?\n\n32\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.480\nA lot of times they're\ngoing to find something.\n\n33\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.080\nMaybe find some zero day exploit, some\nkind of little loophole that maybe they\n\n34\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.470\nweren't aware of or the developers were\naware of and, unfortunately, if we're\n\n35\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.260\nnot patching these systems up through\nWindows Update, then we're going to be,\n\n36\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.240\nyou know, we're going to have a hard day,\na bad day at the office, if you will.\n\n37\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.200\n>> You know I've I've been playing around\nwith windows down a little bit since\n\n38\n00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.120\nits release.\n\n39\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.150\nAnd I notice one thing Wes, about this,\nnot talking about system updates.\n\n40\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.000\nI love updates I've run SUS servers and\nit's been fantastic.\n\n41\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.224\nI cannot stinking find\nthe the Windows Update,\n\n42\n00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:19.500\nit's no longer in the control panel.\n\n43\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.240\n>> That's right and\n\n44\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.360\nyou know what's interesting,\nis that this is a big departure.\n\n45\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.190\nYou know if for the last,\nlet's just go back, maybe,\n\n46\n00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.600\nmaybe as far as Vista,and then\nwe'll come back to the future here.\n\n47\n00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.980\nWhen we look at it, for the longest\ntime it has been in control panel.\n\n48\n00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.730\nAnd you really had your choice.\n\n49\n00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.936\nThey give you this option that\nsays hey do you want to update or\n\n50\n00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:38.942\nyou don't want to update.\n\n51\n00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.637\nWell, guess what?\n\n52\n00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:42.809\nThey've taken that option from you and\nthat's why, Dan,\n\n53\n00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.950\nyou have a hard time finding it, because\nit's not in the traditional control panel.\n\n54\n00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.180\nSo let's show you where where it actually\nis today here on our Windows 10 machine.\n\n55\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.140\nIf I bring up the Action Center.\n\n56\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.450\nAnd all settings,\n\n57\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.270\nnow, the new way to find this is in this\nnew interface that you see right here.\n\n58\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.630\nAnd it's right here with the update and\nsecurity, and\n\n59\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.350\nI kind of want to show you\nguys these side by side.\n\n60\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.930\nSo you can see what Dan's telling you, I\nwas going to say what Dan is showing you,\n\n61\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.102\nbut I guess it's not there anymore so\nthere's nothing really to show.\n\n62\n00:03:15.102 --> 00:03:17.444\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For the longest time, there, guys,\n\n63\n00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:21.612\nyou would see, right up under, somewhere\nbetween Firewall and System, you know,\n\n64\n00:03:21.612 --> 00:03:24.270\nthere would be the Windows Update\ninterface, here.\n\n65\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.130\nThen you could open up that\ntraditional interface.\n\n66\n00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.060\nBut, notice it's gone.\n\n67\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.170\nSo I get big departure from\nwhat we've been talking\n\n68\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.550\na from what we've seen in the past.\n\n69\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.720\nWindows Update isn't done through the\ntraditional system control panel anymore.\n\n70\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.960\nAnd it's going to be done\non this new interface now.\n\n71\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.690\nNotice that it says your\ndevice is up to date.\n\n72\n00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.030\nAnd you can check for updates.\n\n73\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.440\nVery easy to do here.\n\n74\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.714\nYou can also look at the Advanced Update,\nor the Advanced Options, let me go ahead\n\n75\n00:03:48.714 --> 00:03:51.569\nand show you that one more time right\nhere we have the Advanced Options.\n\n76\n00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.047\nAnd what they're trying to do really\nwhat it comes down to to simplify this\n\n77\n00:03:56.047 --> 00:04:00.322\ninterface and they don't want you\nto let say not installing updates.\n\n78\n00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:02.270\nSo you'll see one of the options up\nhere says automatic recommended.\n\n79\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.150\nNow that really didn't differ from the\nearlier versions of Windows we had that\n\n80\n00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.410\nsetting that said automatically download.\n\n81\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.248\nAnd that's the recommended choice and\nwhy is that the recommend a choice?\n\n82\n00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:18.000\nWell you set it, forget it,\nyou hope that any time in those\n\n83\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.280\nsecurity patches those hot fixes those\nfunctionality flaws in the operating\n\n84\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.470\nsystem are going to get fixed and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n85\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.060\nBut they would give you\nthe option to say never install.\n\n86\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.750\nWell, they've taken your\noptions away today.\n\n87\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.760\nNotice it says notify to\nschedule restart and automatic.\n\n88\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.450\nSo you really don't have a choice anymore.\n\n89\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.570\nIf you look at updates, when it comes\ndown to it, you're going to install them.\n\n90\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.080\nNow, through this interface you\ncan defer things like upgrades,\n\n91\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.470\none of the newer features\ninside of Windows,\n\n92\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.345\njust in general in the Windows\nenvironment on the client side.\n\n93\n00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:55.875\nAre these incremental updates,\n\n94\n00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:59.645\nand, you know if you have other operating\nsystems that maybe you're familiar with\n\n95\n00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:02.195\nmaybe Mac or Linux out there I\nmean that this is going to happen.\n\n96\n00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:06.015\nIt's going to be incremental, you know,\nupdates and additions to the operating\n\n97\n00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:08.519\nsystem so they're really bring\nin this in line to where\n\n98\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.510\nwhen you update a system rather than going\nto like a service pack like we've done in\n\n99\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.480\nthe past you'll see service sack one\ntwo three and XP.One and Two in Vista.\n\n100\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.781\nAnd then I believe\nService Pack One in Seven.\n\n101\n00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:26.891\nNow we have these incremental upgrades so\nwe go from 10.1.\n\n102\n00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:29.817\nWindows 10 maybe 10.1 10.2.\n\n103\n00:05:29.817 --> 00:05:36.220\nNow you can also view the updates\nthat you've installed before.\n\n104\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.460\nAnd it's fairly easy it's all\nfrom the same interface and\n\n105\n00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.740\nthere's this little task link right\nhere that says view your update history.\n\n106\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.300\nAnd if we click on that,\n\n107\n00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.220\nyou can see a few different updates\nthat I've already installed here.\n\n108\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.010\nI've got Windows Defender\nin the background and\n\n109\n00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.990\nthat's one of the really good things about\nfrom a security standpoint is that when\n\n110\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.050\nyou have these Windows updates on, turned\non and they are automatically downloading.\n\n111\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.450\nIn the background some of the other\nproducts that you have that are built into\n\n112\n00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.940\nthe operating system also get\nautomatically upgraded, too.\n\n113\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.948\nOne of the great things, too, is if you're\nnot familiar with what this information\n\n114\n00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:15.770\nmeans to you, you can always click\nthese little task links here.\n\n115\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.020\nAnd it's going to tell you.\n\n116\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.340\nNotice that says install this update to\nrevise definition file, so basically,\n\n117\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.930\ngenerically, it's just an update\nto your Windows Defender.\n\n118\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.790\nNow, you also can uninstall\nupdates from this location.\n\n119\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.810\nAnd this is another thing that's kind of,\nI don't want to say that it's changed, but\n\n120\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.550\nit's an addition,\n\n121\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.580\nbecause we used to be able to do\nthis from the Program and Features.\n\n122\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.260\nSo, I'll go to the little\nquick links menu here.\n\n123\n00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.090\nWe'll choose Programs and Features and\nthen you have this View Installed Updates.\n\n124\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.300\nSo you got a couple of different ways\nthat if you review an update and\n\n125\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.950\nmaybe you install it and for\nwhatever reason it might cause a problem.\n\n126\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.740\nYou could still get in here and\nyou can select, and\n\n127\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.440\nthen if you right click on any one of\nthe updates that might be in question,\n\n128\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.090\nyou can turn around and\nyou can uninstall them.\n\n129\n00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.300\nSo, that's still around for us..\n\n130\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.590\nWe still get the ability to do that.\n\n131\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.280\nYou also have with these\nincremental build updates,\n\n132\n00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.830\nyou can actually revert\nthose to if you want.\n\n133\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.790\nSo go back to the previous build\nyou can see that here as well.\n\n134\n00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.010\nNow inside of more of\na corporate environment, and\n\n135\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.410\nlet me show you one more thing here, too.\n\n136\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.870\nChoose how updates are delivered.\n\n137\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.810\nAll right, and you can see, you can turn\nthis on you can say okay PCs on my local\n\n138\n00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.570\nlocal network or\nPCs across the Internet likewise, too.\n\n139\n00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.450\nIf you're in a corporate environment.\n\n140\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.970\nChances are you will not be really\ninteracting too much with this page.\n\n141\n00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:43.660\nWhy do I say that?\n\n142\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.970\nWell you heard Dan mention SUS, right?\n\n143\n00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.231\nWell, Windows Server Update Service, WSUS,\n\n144\n00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:54.376\nis really the way that we manage our\nupdates from a corporate environment.\n\n145\n00:07:54.376 --> 00:07:59.001\nAnd you can set that with your group\npolicy so if I launch up my G.P.\n\n146\n00:07:59.001 --> 00:07:59.833\nedit here.\n\n147\n00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:06.116\nWe have a few options that we can use.\n\n148\n00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:09.332\nSo if I navigate down into\nComputer Configuration,\n\n149\n00:08:09.332 --> 00:08:13.730\nthen at the Administrative Templates,\nand then Windows Components.\n\n150\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.776\nFor the longest time at the bottom of\nWindows Components, it was always easy to\n\n151\n00:08:17.776 --> 00:08:21.782\nfigure out where Windows Update was,\nbecause it was the last one in the list.\n\n152\n00:08:21.782 --> 00:08:25.391\nBut when some new technologies come in,\nlike work folders,\n\n153\n00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:27.741\nit's not longer the last one the list.\n\n154\n00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:30.949\nBut still fairly easy to find, it's all\nthe way here at the bottom of the list.\n\n155\n00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:32.824\nAnd we've got a few options now.\n\n156\n00:08:32.824 --> 00:08:34.528\nWith some of these options,\n\n157\n00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:39.001\nthere are some new things to Windows\nthat weren't in the previous versions\n\n158\n00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:42.907\nwhen it comes to managing your\nupdates through the group policy.\n\n159\n00:08:42.907 --> 00:08:46.832\nBut the first one I wanted to show you is,\nthis is a setting right here that you're\n\n160\n00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:49.573\nprobably gonna use inside\nof a corporate environment.\n\n161\n00:08:49.573 --> 00:08:53.823\nAnd that's the that specify\nIntranet Microsoft service location.\n\n162\n00:08:53.823 --> 00:08:56.057\nAnd if we open up that setting here,\n\n163\n00:08:56.057 --> 00:09:00.906\nyou can see this is where we can deliver\nthings like your WSUS Server updates.\n\n164\n00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:04.730\nAnd even though it doesn't say WSUS,\nI've always thought this was interesting.\n\n165\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.690\nA little cryptic, right?\n\n166\n00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.000\nIt says Microsoft Intranet Service Update\nlocation.\n\n167\n00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.990\nWell, that's basically saying, don't go\nout the Windows Updates to perform your\n\n168\n00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.400\nupdates and\npull them down from their servers.\n\n169\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.310\nGo to the internal network,\nconnect to that server, and\n\n170\n00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.430\nthen whatever the administrator\nhas set it up it.\n\n171\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.450\nFor instance, if Dan's the patch\nmanagement administrator,\n\n172\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.770\nwhatever he's approved for the updates,\njust pull them off of there.\n\n173\n00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.450\nSo this is a setting that's\nbeen around for a while,\n\n174\n00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.610\nyou could say it goes back to XP.\n\n175\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.341\n>> God forbid they just call it WSUS.\n\n176\n00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> It would make it so much easier.\n\n177\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.580\n>> That's what we all call it.\n\n178\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.680\n>> And you said SUS,\nthat's what we all call it.\n\n179\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.680\nAnd unfortunately it's, you know, it's one\nof those things that they just decided to\n\n180\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.905\ncall peanut butter or something.\n\n181\n00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:50.380\n[LAUGH]\nNow,\n\n182\n00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.880\na couple of other things that I want\nto mention in here, to be careful with.\n\n183\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.365\nThis is a newer setting, and let me kind\nof rifle in here so you can see that.\n\n184\n00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:00.950\nThis is a Defer Upgrades.\n\n185\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.185\nNow when we looked at this in\nthe newer Windows Update interface,\n\n186\n00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:07.116\nyou could turn this on or off.\n\n187\n00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:09.157\nOr you can also force\nthis through root policy.\n\n188\n00:10:09.157 --> 00:10:12.271\nSo regardless of what the user might say,\nif a user logs in and\n\n189\n00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:16.074\nthey go to the Windows Update,\nthey're not going to be able to modify it.\n\n190\n00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:19.866\nSo, whether you want to defer it or\nnot will really be up to you.\n\n191\n00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:24.630\nA couple of other settings I want to\nmention in here that will affect how\n\n192\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.906\nWindows Update is going to work.\n\n193\n00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:31.560\nAnd a couple of them that are almost\nwill conflict with each other.\n\n194\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.670\nLet's see here.\n\n195\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.700\nThe no auto-restart.\n\n196\n00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.420\nAll right, when users are logged on,\n\n197\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.470\nkeep in mind that that might\nbe something that's important.\n\n198\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:50.225\nRemember that you don't want somebody that\nis in the middle of that next latest,\n\n199\n00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:52.105\ngreatest patent that we're working on, and\n\n200\n00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:55.705\nall of a sudden, in the middle of\nthat work, the computer reboots.\n\n201\n00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:57.935\nAnd now it's installing its updates.\n\n202\n00:10:57.935 --> 00:11:00.530\nThere's another one in here too.\n\n203\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.200\nDelay and then reschedule.\n\n204\n00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.130\nSo you've got some ways that\nyou can really rifle down on\n\n205\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.900\nexactly how you want to control\nyour Windows update here.\n\n206\n00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.950\nSo, with Windows update a lot of times,\nlike I said guys,\n\n207\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.860\ninside of a corporate environment you\nmight not even be managing these settings.\n\n208\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.710\nBut if you're in a home environment,\n\n209\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.870\nyou're in a work group, then you'll\ndefinitely wanna manage these settings.\n\n210\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.250\nOr even in a small business, small office,\nhome office like a Soho environment.\n\n211\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.300\nIt's decentralized, but\n\n212\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.990\nyou might still have to go from\ncomputer to computer to computer.\n\n213\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:38.080\nSetting those group policies up to ensure\nthat your end user's updates are happening\n\n214\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.040\nthe way you want them to and not the way\nmaybe the end user think they should be.\n\n215\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.810\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's through what we've been kind of\n\n216\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.600\nhinting here a little bit,\nthe Windows Server Update Service.\n\n217\n00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.780\nThat is the defacto standard for\na corporate environment\n\n218\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.280\nto allow those updates to go out,\nto control what computers get what.\n\n219\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.110\nMaybe I have server pools, all sorts\nof cool ways in which you can control\n\n220\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.590\nthe update service itself for\nyour end devices in it.\n\n221\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.620\nAnd it's through that control that\nwe make sure that our systems stay\n\n222\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.410\nhardened, right?\n\n223\n00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.500\n>> Yes sir, absolutely.\n\n224\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.970\nNow, since we're on\nthe topic of Updates and\n\n225\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.260\nyou know we talk about patch management,\n\n226\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.080\none of the things that comes along with\npatch management are drivers, right?\n\n227\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.280\nThe drivers sometimes are updated.\n\n228\n00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.532\nWhen you update a driver, you typically\nget the latest and greatest functionality.\n\n229\n00:12:25.532 --> 00:12:30.439\nWe can go through windows updates, but\nlet's face it, there's a lot that goes\n\n230\n00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:34.407\non in getting those updates into\nthe Windows updates database.\n\n231\n00:12:34.407 --> 00:12:37.960\nThey got to file, for\ninstance if you're in Vidia.\n\n232\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.070\nRight?\nYou've got the latest and\n\n233\n00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.670\ngreatest graphics card there.\n\n234\n00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.470\nWell, you're gonna have to,\nas a publisher, you're gonna file with\n\n235\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.410\nMicrosoft for what's known as a PLC,\na publisher's licensing certificate.\n\n236\n00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.340\nIt's just jargon for saying, hey,\nwe're gonna be a recognized publisher of\n\n237\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.440\ndrivers, and then you submit your\ndriver for testing to Microsoft.\n\n238\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.960\nIt goes through a division of Microsoft\ncalled the Windows Hardware Quality Labs.\n\n239\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.050\nThey rigorously test it,\nthey make sure that it's not a virus,\n\n240\n00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.190\nthat it doesn't modify\nthe operating system and\n\n241\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.680\ncause system instabilities, before they're\ngoing to put it in the Windows Update.\n\n242\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.030\nAnd then you're going to have\nit delivered to your machine.\n\n243\n00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.991\nWe don't always go to Windows Update,\nright?\n\n244\n00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:15.948\nBecause of that,\nespecially with video drivers.\n\n245\n00:13:15.948 --> 00:13:20.689\nVideo drivers get updated like,\nI don't know athletes change socks, and\n\n246\n00:13:20.689 --> 00:13:23.407\nsometimes it's hard to keep up with them.\n\n247\n00:13:23.407 --> 00:13:26.857\nAnd a lot of times we tell you to go\nout to the manufacturer's web site,\n\n248\n00:13:26.857 --> 00:13:29.760\ndownload the next latest and\ngreatest driver.\n\n249\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.800\nWell, those drivers have to fall under\n\n250\n00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.260\na certain technology that\nis built into Windows.\n\n251\n00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.470\nIt's been around Windows.\n\n252\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.670\nIt's not new to Windows.\n\n253\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.920\nIt goes back to Windows Server\n2003 Service Pack 1, and\n\n254\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.190\nit's enforced on all 64\nbit editions of Windows.\n\n255\n00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.020\nIf you have a 32 bit,\nx86 edition of Windows.\n\n256\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.860\nThey don't enforce it.\n\n257\n00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:55.730\nThey recommend that you use something\nknown as Kernel Patch Protection, okay?\n\n258\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.480\nKPP, or Kernel Patch Protection,\nit sounds like a lot of jargon guys, but\n\n259\n00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.540\nit really isn't.\n\n260\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.760\nIt's a good technology.\n\n261\n00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.150\nIt's a good thing that we have it.\n\n262\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.310\nIt means that if a driver is\ngonna interact with the Kernel,\n\n263\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.960\nunderstand the lowest portions\nin the operating system.\n\n264\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.135\nIf it causes problems, it doesn't just\ncause problems for that driver itself.\n\n265\n00:14:15.135 --> 00:14:17.991\nIt's in a unified memory space.\n\n266\n00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:22.169\nIt's going to cause a problems for\nother executive services, the Kernel and\n\n267\n00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:22.949\ndrivers too.\n\n268\n00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:25.494\nSo one of the things that with\na Kernel Patch Protection that's\n\n269\n00:14:25.494 --> 00:14:26.366\nbuilt into Windows.\n\n270\n00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.562\nIt's one of the things under\nthe hood said that you don't see,\n\n271\n00:14:29.562 --> 00:14:32.577\nis the fact that any driver\nthat interacts with the Kernel,\n\n272\n00:14:32.577 --> 00:14:35.680\nit can't make modifications\nthrough undocumented means.\n\n273\n00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.820\nAnd that's where we go back\nto the Windows Update.\n\n274\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.860\nSo it's a good thing to have.\n\n275\n00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.220\nIt also means too that in\n64 bit editions of Windows,\n\n276\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.910\nevery one of your drivers\nhas to be digitally signed.\n\n277\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.010\nNow let's go ahead and show that.\n\n278\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.050\nWe have a utility inside of\nWindows today that can allow us to\n\n279\n00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.070\nfind out are those drivers,\nare they digitally signed?\n\n280\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.590\nAnd it's a technology\nthat's been around for\n\n281\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.450\na little bit,\nit's not something new to Windows.\n\n282\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.656\nBut it is something good to have and\ndefinitely good to see.\n\n283\n00:15:03.656 --> 00:15:05.199\nAnd that's something called SigVerif.\n\n284\n00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:09.698\nSo if we go to our Windows here, and\nwe launch up our command prompt.\n\n285\n00:15:09.698 --> 00:15:16.157\nI'm just gonna type Sigverif,\nmaybe, verif there.\n\n286\n00:15:16.157 --> 00:15:19.992\nAnd it is an executable, but one of\nthe good things about command prompt today\n\n287\n00:15:19.992 --> 00:15:23.660\nit's an intuitive enough that you\ndon't have to put the exe, all right.\n\n288\n00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.540\nNow, when we look at this here's another\none of those cryptic meanings like Dan\n\n289\n00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.420\nwas talking,\nwhy don't we just call it WSUS?\n\n290\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.430\nWell this is\nthe File Signature Verification Utility.\n\n291\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.484\nDan, got any ideas what files\nwe might try and be verifying?\n\n292\n00:15:38.484 --> 00:15:39.679\n>> Files on our computer?\n\n293\n00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:42.030\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n294\n00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.660\nAnd that's exactly it,\nit doesn't really make sense.\n\n295\n00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.550\nWe're looking for\ndriver signatures here, but yet,\n\n296\n00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.610\nthey call this\nthe File Signature Verification Utility.\n\n297\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:55.280\nSo again, you've got to be careful\nwith some of these these utilities.\n\n298\n00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.910\nThey might not just come out and\nsay what they're looking for.\n\n299\n00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.578\n>> The terminology tends\nto be a little more vague\n\n300\n00:15:59.578 --> 00:16:00.876\nthan we'd like it to be sometimes.\n\n301\n00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:03.128\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n302\n00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:07.303\nSo, notice that it says here to help\nmaintain the integrity of your system,\n\n303\n00:16:07.303 --> 00:16:11.545\ncritical files It should say drivers\n[LAUGH] have been digitally signed to make\n\n304\n00:16:11.545 --> 00:16:13.780\nsure that they can be detected quickly.\n\n305\n00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.310\nSo let's go and run this.\n\n306\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.770\nFairly easy, doesn't take too long.\n\n307\n00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.660\nKeep in mind that today you want those\ndigital signatures on 64 bit operating\n\n308\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.760\nsystems cuz the digital signature verifies\nthat we know they get on Invidia here,\n\n309\n00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.050\nthat that driver came from Invidia.\n\n310\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.410\nWe know who the driver manufacturer is.\n\n311\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.010\nThis isn't just some drive by virus here.\n\n312\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.990\nThe other thing too that\nthe digital signatures verify for\n\n313\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.940\nus is the fact that the driver\nhasn't been modified, right.\n\n314\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.400\nYou don't wanna know that you've\ndownloaded it from the right person.\n\n315\n00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.260\nYou get this little man in\nthe middle attack, right?\n\n316\n00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.690\nThat hacker come lately scrapes that\ndriver from you, modifies it and\n\n317\n00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.900\nthen sends it back to you.\n\n318\n00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.030\nThe digital signature is going to\nverify that that hasn't happened.\n\n319\n00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.870\nAnd if we look here it says,\nYour files have been scanned and\n\n320\n00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.230\nverified as digitally signed,\nwhich is always a good thing.\n\n321\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.551\nThere's one more thing about SigVer or\n\n322\n00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:09.250\nFileSigVer Drive we're signing here that I\nwanna show you, there's one more utility.\n\n323\n00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.350\nAnd this utility is really used for\nyour video subsystem.\n\n324\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.090\nBut it is good to mention\nthat it runs that same\n\n325\n00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.960\ntest that file signature verification\ndoes and it's called DxDiag.\n\n326\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.790\nSome of you guys out there\nare probably Xbox fanatics.\n\n327\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.330\nIt's the same place that\nwe get our term Xbox from.\n\n328\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.880\nDirectX is a graphics\ntechnology that PC's built on.\n\n329\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.150\nAnd they didn't wanna call\nit the DirectXbox, so\n\n330\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.400\nthey removed the Direct, but\nit's the same technology.\n\n331\n00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.319\nNotice it says right\nhere the moment I run it.\n\n332\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.950\nThis isn't so cryptic, right.\n\n333\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.270\nIt just comes out and says,\n\n334\n00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.390\ndo you want to check to see if\nyour drivers are digitally signed?\n\n335\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.142\nSo that's always a good thing and\nwhen we run this utility.\n\n336\n00:17:48.142 --> 00:17:51.220\nIt's gonna do the same thing and let me\nsee if I can catch this, there we go,\n\n337\n00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.120\nbefore it finishes, it's probably\nalready done in the background.\n\n338\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.730\nNotice it says check for\nWHQL digital signatures,\n\n339\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.260\nthat's that Windows\nhardware quality lab so.\n\n340\n00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.158\nCouple of good ways that\nif you are going to,\n\n341\n00:18:03.158 --> 00:18:07.040\nif you wanna make sure that the drivers\nhave maintained their integrity and\n\n342\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.730\nthey are digitally signed,\nthat that you have access to that.\n\n343\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.520\n>> Yes, awesome, obviously digital\nsigning is a good thing, it helps us\n\n344\n00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.700\ndo that verification, make sure no funky\nbusiness is going on with our drivers.\n\n345\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.020\nSo then we install them,\n\n346\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.610\neverything's going to be peachy\nclean just like we like it.\n\n347\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.900\nNow Wes, there's another idea\nwhen it comes to drivers.\n\n348\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.240\nIt's called driver staging.\n\n349\n00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.850\nThis is something that probably maybe\nsome people haven't heard about.\n\n350\n00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.870\nAnd you're gonna help us out with this.\n\n351\n00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.010\n>> Well, I hope so here.\n\n352\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.810\nIf you think about it, imagine this,\nyou've got a component.\n\n353\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.410\nYou as an administrator, Dan or\nmyself as an administrator,\n\n354\n00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:46.780\nwe've got a device that we know that\nall of our end users are gonna use.\n\n355\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.850\nAll right, but now, when they go to\nplug that device in, they're getting\n\n356\n00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:55.030\na little User Account Control, a little\nprompt that blocks you and says, no,\n\n357\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.100\nyou need administrative privileges\nto be able to install that.\n\n358\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.520\nAll right, so what do they do?\n\n359\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.180\nThey get on the phone.\n\n360\n00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.700\nThey call the Help Desk team.\n\n361\n00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.560\nThey submit a ticket.\n\n362\n00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.180\nNow, we've got a ticket in the system, and\nwe've got into all the hassle that goes\n\n363\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.290\nthrough making sure that\nthat ticket has been.\n\n364\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.490\nSolve their problem and stuff and a lot\nof extra processes that go behind that.\n\n365\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:22.980\nImagine the ability to take that driver\nfrom the device you already know.\n\n366\n00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.510\nWith its driver, is authenticated,\nyou know you wanna use it.\n\n367\n00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.510\nWell, that's where\ndriver staging comes in.\n\n368\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.970\nSee, drivers are stored in a protected\nlocation that standard users, for\n\n369\n00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.530\nsecurity reasons, can't install.\n\n370\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.750\nWe don't want standard users\njust installing any driver.\n\n371\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.710\nBefore we know it,\nwe've got conflicts and problems.\n\n372\n00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.990\nBut if it's a scenario in which you know\nyou want that driver to be installed,\n\n373\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.520\nyou don't wanna get\nadditional Help Desk tickets,\n\n374\n00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.510\nbecause you want your end users to\nbe a little bit more productive.\n\n375\n00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.100\nThat's where utility\nnotice PnPUtil comes in.\n\n376\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.610\nPnPUtil is short for\nthe plug and play utility.\n\n377\n00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.559\nLet's show you how we do this.\n\n378\n00:19:56.559 --> 00:20:00.460\nThis is a really cool technology,\nlikewise.\n\n379\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.571\nAnd you notice I've been typing CDM?\n\n380\n00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:06.146\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm doing that on purpose because I\n\n381\n00:20:06.146 --> 00:20:08.238\nhave the Deployment Image Services Manager\nup.\n\n382\n00:20:08.238 --> 00:20:09.144\nKind of funny here.\n\n383\n00:20:09.144 --> 00:20:11.629\nAnd every time I do that,\nI launch the wrong utility so\n\n384\n00:20:11.629 --> 00:20:15.060\nit's intuitive enough to know that\nif I misspell it, it figures out.\n\n385\n00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.290\nJust bring the Command Prompt up there.\n\n386\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.860\nSo our PnPUtil, what are we going, oh.\n\n387\n00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.220\nAnd I gotta make sure,\noh by the way, with this.\n\n388\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.120\nThat being said, however you spell it,\n\n389\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.330\nmake sure that you launch\nan administrative command prompt.\n\n390\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.720\nBecause there again, you have to make sure\n\n391\n00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.900\nthat you are an administrative\nuser to first stage this driver.\n\n392\n00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.750\nOnce it's staged,\nthen standard users can work with it,\n\n393\n00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.090\nyou don't have to really deal with it.\n\n394\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.510\nSo the first thing you\nhave to do is identify\n\n395\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.230\nwhat drivers do you have currently staged.\n\n396\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:52.110\nVery fairly easy to do with\nthe pnputil -e, short for enumeration.\n\n397\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.670\nIt just means show me the drivers\nthat are in the driver store.\n\n398\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.210\nNow all of these drivers, even the various\ndrivers that are already here for us,\n\n399\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.640\nand they've got a unique\nnaming convention here.\n\n400\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.860\nOEM, original quick\nequipment manufacturer.\n\n401\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.350\nAnd you really gotta be careful because\nwhen it comes to staging these drivers,\n\n402\n00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.150\nthe moment you stage a driver,\nits name is gonna change and\n\n403\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.120\nlet me see if I can\ndemonstrate that here for you.\n\n404\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.000\nI've got a location of a driver here.\n\n405\n00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.440\nAnd I went ahead and\ncopied this path out beforehand.\n\n406\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.620\nAnd it's one of the things I\nwant you to see though is,\n\n407\n00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.770\nnotice that name on the end of it.\n\n408\n00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.008\nYou gotta love those names,\n\n409\n00:21:30.008 --> 00:21:32.596\nthey're very hard to find,\nthat name means nothing to me.\n\n410\n00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:36.911\nBut one of the things that it should mean\nto you is that when you stage this driver,\n\n411\n00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:39.074\nit's no longer going to have that name.\n\n412\n00:21:39.074 --> 00:21:44.415\nIt's going to rename it to oem and\nwhatever the next sequential number is.\n\n413\n00:21:44.415 --> 00:21:47.828\nNow, I've already counted all these out\nbecause boy, there's a lot of them here.\n\n414\n00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:52.216\nThe top number here is, well an unlucky\nnumber, the top number's oem13.\n\n415\n00:21:52.216 --> 00:21:56.767\nSo that's a good thing to know cuz you\nneed to know which driver it is you\n\n416\n00:21:56.767 --> 00:21:57.394\nstaged.\n\n417\n00:21:57.394 --> 00:22:00.694\nSo just find out what the top number is,\nand when you stage your driver,\n\n418\n00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:03.280\nit'll be the next one\nin line sequentially.\n\n419\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.930\nSo let's go ahead and let's go ahead and\ndo that here real quick.\n\n420\n00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.986\nAll right.\n\n421\n00:22:09.986 --> 00:22:16.827\nSo to add the driver,\nwe're gonna do the pnputil -a,\n\n422\n00:22:16.827 --> 00:22:22.199\nalpha ad if you will,\nand then a space and.\n\n423\n00:22:22.199 --> 00:22:26.599\nApparently, I did not copy that,\nlet me do that one more time,\n\n424\n00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:30.929\napparently I didn't copy that\nfile location like I thought.\n\n425\n00:22:30.929 --> 00:22:34.318\nSo now that we've got that pasted in, keep\nin mind that the driver's name is going to\n\n426\n00:22:34.318 --> 00:22:36.734\nchange and that's going to be very,\nvery important here.\n\n427\n00:22:36.734 --> 00:22:39.961\nSo we'll go ahead and\nlet's stage this driver here.\n\n428\n00:22:39.961 --> 00:22:46.303\nYou'll notice that it says blah blah blah\nblah dot inf has been re-changed to oem14,\n\n429\n00:22:46.303 --> 00:22:49.940\nso you can see we've seen\nthe top number was 13.\n\n430\n00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.380\nSo this is the next one in the list.\n\n431\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.490\n>> And congrats on the proper\npronunciation of that driver name.\n\n432\n00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.070\n>> You like that, huh.\n\n433\n00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.812\n[LAUGH] La la la.\n\n434\n00:22:55.812 --> 00:22:58.389\nAll right, so you can pronounce\nit like a Thanksgiving gobbler.\n\n435\n00:22:58.389 --> 00:23:03.375\n[LAUGH] Now, if you wanna see the driver,\nand you wanna make sure that it is been\n\n436\n00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:08.304\nstaged appropriately, that's where\nyou just go back to that pnputil -e.\n\n437\n00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:10.254\nIt just means show me the driver here.\n\n438\n00:23:10.254 --> 00:23:13.360\nAnd we should find it in the list.\n\n439\n00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.428\nI think it's all the way at the top\nby default, but just double check.\n\n440\n00:23:17.428 --> 00:23:19.378\nYep, there it is at the top.\n\n441\n00:23:19.378 --> 00:23:21.398\nA lot of times,\nthat's where you're gonna find it.\n\n442\n00:23:21.398 --> 00:23:25.556\nBut if you've done this a couple of times,\nit's gonna just cycle it around and\n\n443\n00:23:25.556 --> 00:23:28.076\nit might be down in the list and\nyou can see here,\n\n444\n00:23:28.076 --> 00:23:31.498\nwe now have our Cypress Semiconductor\nkeyboard driver staged.\n\n445\n00:23:31.498 --> 00:23:34.810\nNow, there might be a certain point where\nmaybe you wanna delete this driver, and\n\n446\n00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.930\nthat's why the naming convention I wanted\nto tell you about is so important.\n\n447\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.624\nWith the naming convention, remember,\nI'm not gonna delete this driver from its\n\n448\n00:23:41.624 --> 00:23:44.594\noriginal name because that's gone,\nit doesn't exist anymore.\n\n449\n00:23:44.594 --> 00:23:49.793\nSo to do this, we'll go ahead and\nclear our screen right here,\n\n450\n00:23:49.793 --> 00:23:54.910\nand we'll type the pnputil -d,\nfor delete, imagine that.\n\n451\n00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:59.080\nAnd then oem14, and\nremember to put the .inf file at the end.\n\n452\n00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.543\nAnd notice it says that the driver\npackage has been successfully deleted.\n\n453\n00:24:05.543 --> 00:24:09.526\nAnd if you wanna just rerun and check that\none more time and it's good to do all\n\n454\n00:24:09.526 --> 00:24:13.696\nthese steps here with the pnputil just to\nmake sure that if you stage the driver,\n\n455\n00:24:13.696 --> 00:24:14.459\nit's there.\n\n456\n00:24:14.459 --> 00:24:16.898\nIf you wanna remove the driver,\nit's gone, and\n\n457\n00:24:16.898 --> 00:24:20.960\nwe can now see that at the top of the list\nhere, we shouldn't have a 14 anymore.\n\n458\n00:24:23.001 --> 00:24:25.190\n>> And we don't, so we're good to go.\n\n459\n00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.630\nSo driver staging is a good thing when it\ncomes to making sure that your end users\n\n460\n00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:35.800\ncan install devices when they're\nnot it administrators because,\n\n461\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.200\nby default, they can't do that.\n\n462\n00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.600\nAnd you can reduce maybe some\nof your help desk tickets and\n\n463\n00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.280\nincrease some of your productivity.\n\n464\n00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.128\nProductivity, excuse me.\n\n465\n00:24:42.128 --> 00:24:43.397\nSomething like that.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n466\n00:24:43.397 --> 00:24:44.601\n>> Very cool technology though,\n\n467\n00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:45.790\nto be able to do that.\n\n468\n00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:49.710\nNow another way in which Windows, and\nhas done this for quite some time it's no\n\n469\n00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:53.580\ndifferent here in Windows 10,\nthat they help us maintain that hardening.\n\n470\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.090\nTo let us know,\n\n471\n00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.050\nhey you know what, there might be some\nplaces that you need to check out.\n\n472\n00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.330\nSomething might be happening there.\n\n473\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.060\nIs the good old Old Action Center,\nright Wes?\n\n474\n00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.078\n>> Yeah the Action Center is also changed,\nwhere it is.\n\n475\n00:25:03.078 --> 00:25:06.805\nIt's actually in the lower right hand\ncorner of your screen on your desktop.\n\n476\n00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:10.719\nAnd it has been traditionally in\nthe Control Panel and it's gone and\n\n477\n00:25:10.719 --> 00:25:12.718\nI wanna show you the old way first.\n\n478\n00:25:12.718 --> 00:25:15.020\n>> Microsoft loves the recall\nthem on Windows 10.\n\n479\n00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.463\n>> Oh, that's right that's right so\nif we go to our Control Panel for\n\n480\n00:25:18.463 --> 00:25:20.009\nthe longest time if you went.\n\n481\n00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:23.777\nAnd by the way, Windows 7 Windows 8 and\n8.1 his is where you gonna find it so\n\n482\n00:25:23.777 --> 00:25:24.820\nyou got used to that.\n\n483\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.090\nWe're going to system it's security it\nwas typically right there at the top\n\n484\n00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.050\nof the list.\n\n485\n00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.310\nWell it's not there.\n\n486\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:35.330\nIt's actually in the bottom, lower right\nhand corner of my screen over here.\n\n487\n00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.701\nAnd this little button down here, and I\nlike this cuz, it's a quick heads up menu.\n\n488\n00:25:39.701 --> 00:25:43.236\nAnd if you got a touchscreen computer\nyou can actually swipe from the right\n\n489\n00:25:43.236 --> 00:25:43.977\nhand side you,\n\n490\n00:25:43.977 --> 00:25:47.923\nit'll come out and you can see some quick\nicons that we can get to VPN connections.\n\n491\n00:25:47.923 --> 00:25:53.541\nConnect if you've got WiFi display,\nquiet hours, tablet mode,\n\n492\n00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:58.070\nthere was one other the one\nthat was cool here to note.\n\n493\n00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.080\nNote just opens up one note.\n\n494\n00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.420\nBut then you get to get\nall your settings here.\n\n495\n00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.230\nNo different.\n\n496\n00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:09.190\nSo the Action Center typically in the past\nwould have things like security and\n\n497\n00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:13.370\nmaintenance level information but again,\nthey change that up a little bit.\n\n498\n00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.636\nBut it is good to get some\nheads up views of for\n\n499\n00:26:15.636 --> 00:26:17.731\ninstance if a driver is just installed.\n\n500\n00:26:17.731 --> 00:26:21.327\nIt's gonna let you know right there in the\nAction Center the top that, hey, you've\n\n501\n00:26:21.327 --> 00:26:24.888\ngot a driver installed or maybe the driver\ninstalled and it's waiting on a reboot.\n\n502\n00:26:24.888 --> 00:26:27.300\nIt's telling you to finish\ninstalling this driver.\n\n503\n00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.868\nHey, we've got to reboot the system.\n\n504\n00:26:28.868 --> 00:26:31.206\nWell, that's gonna show up in there and\nthen other things too,\n\n505\n00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:32.868\nlike get office cuz\neverybody needs office.\n\n506\n00:26:32.868 --> 00:26:34.556\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you might have some things in there\n\n507\n00:26:34.556 --> 00:26:37.983\nthat maybe are not as important as some of\nthe security and the driver updates, but\n\n508\n00:26:37.983 --> 00:26:40.118\nfor the most part gives you\na good heads up of what's\n\n509\n00:26:40.118 --> 00:26:41.945\ngoing on on your machine in real time.\n\n510\n00:26:41.945 --> 00:26:45.325\n>> Now, Wes, does it still do things like,\noh, your Windows Firewall is turned off or\n\n511\n00:26:45.325 --> 00:26:47.840\nyou don't have an anti-virus\nsolution installed.\n\n512\n00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.210\n>> No, actually, that's gone to\na completely different location now.\n\n513\n00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.302\nThat's actually in something known\nas security and maintenance today so\n\n514\n00:26:55.302 --> 00:26:57.356\nwith the security and maintenance.\n\n515\n00:26:57.356 --> 00:27:01.206\nIt's gonna be where Action Center used to\nreside so it's kinda interesting here so\n\n516\n00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:04.451\nif I open up the Control Panel,\nI could actually type of from the search\n\n517\n00:27:04.451 --> 00:27:07.650\nfeature but I've really gotten used\nto this quick links menu here.\n\n518\n00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.860\nI really like that.\n\n519\n00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.130\nAnd again System in Security.\n\n520\n00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.040\nAnd right here under security and\nmaintenance, so some of the things that we\n\n521\n00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.720\nused to see with Action Center\nhave actually been broken off,\n\n522\n00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.000\nwhere Action Center is more\nof just a heads up menu.\n\n523\n00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.220\nAnd if I get into Security and\nMaintenance,\n\n524\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:26.100\nthis is what those of you that are\nfamiliar with a traditional Action Center.\n\n525\n00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.313\nWould see all of this information.\n\n526\n00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:31.460\nHere we got the network firewall,\ntells me it's turned on virus protection.\n\n527\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.780\nAnd if your computer is in a state\nthat might leave it unsecure,\n\n528\n00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.360\nlet's see here, let's do that.\n\n529\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.910\nLet's find out if this is\nworth its weight in gold here.\n\n530\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.920\nI'm gonna go to my Windows firewall and\nI'm gonna turn it off.\n\n531\n00:27:49.057 --> 00:27:50.101\nAnd we'll see.\n\n532\n00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:51.100\n>> Living life on the edge there.\n\n533\n00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.155\n>> Oh, there we go look here.\n\n534\n00:27:52.155 --> 00:27:57.161\nSo, if I, oop, and I just turned it back\non because it says click this to fix it.\n\n535\n00:27:57.161 --> 00:28:00.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, let's do that one more time here.\n\n536\n00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.675\nCuz it be nice to show you the heads\nup menu in the action, so there we go,\n\n537\n00:28:03.675 --> 00:28:08.985\nso the action center still has some of\nthat capabilities that it had before.\n\n538\n00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:13.700\nBut it has been just slightly modified but\nif I go to Security and Maintenance,\n\n539\n00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.230\nnotice that it gave me\na heads up right away.\n\n540\n00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.300\nSo don't even expand anything out,\nwe're telling you something's wrong and\n\n541\n00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.620\nthis is the first thing that\nyou need to take care of.\n\n542\n00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.200\nAnd, again you could see that,\nit's telling you that the Firewall's off.\n\n543\n00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.040\nI get quick, one click access,\nturn the Firewall back on,\n\n544\n00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.750\nbring my operating system back into\nwhat more of a trusted or secure state.\n\n545\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.790\nEverybody's happy.\n\n546\n00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.569\nAction Center.\n\n547\n00:28:35.569 --> 00:28:37.480\nLet's see is Action Center\nstill barking at me?\n\n548\n00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.060\nNo!\n\n549\n00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.080\nSo again good real time\nnotification real time information.\n\n550\n00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.736\nAnd it can keep you aware of\nthe security implement, or\n\n551\n00:28:44.736 --> 00:28:46.603\nsecurity standpoint of your system.\n\n552\n00:28:46.603 --> 00:28:47.330\n>> Awesome.\n\n553\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.882\n>> Yeah.\n>> So,\n\n554\n00:28:47.882 --> 00:28:49.451\nI know we're running\na little short on time, but\n\n555\n00:28:49.451 --> 00:28:51.110\nI know you had one more topic\nthat you want to get to.\n\n556\n00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.960\nAnd that was the Network and\nSharing Center, right?\n\n557\n00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.730\nYeah, the Network and Sharing Center\nis a very good place to go to get\n\n558\n00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.330\na lot of heads up information on different\nthings within your operating system.\n\n559\n00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.279\nAnd from a security standpoint too.\n\n560\n00:29:04.279 --> 00:29:08.697\nWe've got to talk a little bit about\nthings like file and printer sharing and\n\n561\n00:29:08.697 --> 00:29:11.880\na couple other technology so\nlet's go ahead and.\n\n562\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.320\nLet's go to the Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n563\n00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.090\nAnd you can do this through\nthe Control Panel, Network and\n\n564\n00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.020\nInternet and Network and Sharing Center.\n\n565\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.700\nAnother way that you could do this too,\n\n566\n00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.510\nis through the little monitor icon with\na tried and pitchfork notification area.\n\n567\n00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.570\nBut this is a common way to get to it.\n\n568\n00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:32.020\nNow you can see right here, that you can\nsee what network you're connected to.\n\n569\n00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.930\nYou can see if the home group is ready or\nnot.\n\n570\n00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.050\nI can go to the change\nadvanced sharing settings now.\n\n571\n00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:42.390\nI really would like people to be aware of\nthis one, there's a lot of configurations\n\n572\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:47.012\nthat can go into just this little quick\nlinks here so if we click on that.\n\n573\n00:29:47.012 --> 00:29:52.639\nAll right we can see, we can turn\non things like Network discovery.\n\n574\n00:29:52.639 --> 00:29:55.030\nTurn on or off file and printer sharing.\n\n575\n00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.220\nSo do you want people to be able to\nconnect to this machine over the network\n\n576\n00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.920\nand access some of the files or\nfolders on it.\n\n577\n00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.819\nWhether you want that on or\noff really up to you,\n\n578\n00:30:03.819 --> 00:30:07.162\nbut I'd also like to mention\nthis Network discovery.\n\n579\n00:30:07.162 --> 00:30:11.558\nSo the Network discovery is important and\nfrom a security standpoint you might turn\n\n580\n00:30:11.558 --> 00:30:16.015\nit off, because Network discovery works on\na couple of protocols that are built into\n\n581\n00:30:16.015 --> 00:30:19.700\nthe network adapter, or\nbound to the network adapter today.\n\n582\n00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:25.380\nAnd it's something known as LLTD,\nLink Local Topology Discovery.\n\n583\n00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.710\nAnd this is, it's not something\nthat's new to Windows 10.\n\n584\n00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.860\nBut if I bring up the properties.\n\n585\n00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.240\nI was right there if I bring up\nthe properties of the network adapter.\n\n586\n00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.580\nYou can see a couple of protocols in here.\n\n587\n00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.130\nLet me scroll down just a little bit.\n\n588\n00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.100\nSee if we can get both of those.\n\n589\n00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.240\nThere we go we get both of\nthose protocols in here.\n\n590\n00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:48.380\nThere we go, so we've got a couple here\nwe've got this link layer top ology\n\n591\n00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.220\ndiscovery mapper and responder and\nit's good to understand that\n\n592\n00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:58.300\nwhen you turn on network discovery,\nthese two protocols start to go to town.\n\n593\n00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.080\nAll right, the first one what it's going\nto do is it's going to send out and\n\n594\n00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.220\nit's going to call out to the rest of\nthe network it uses some of the is\n\n595\n00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.380\nthe standard protocols that we see today.\n\n596\n00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:11.127\nThings like the simplest service discovery\nprotocol calling out saying, hey,\n\n597\n00:31:11.127 --> 00:31:13.653\nis there a multicast D.N.S. out there?\n\n598\n00:31:13.653 --> 00:31:15.970\nAre there Universal P.N.P. devices?\n\n599\n00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.360\nSo it's gonna try to find\nother devices on the network.\n\n600\n00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.290\nAll right, now, that might from\na security standpoint not seem that\n\n601\n00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.160\nlike that big of a deal.\n\n602\n00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.480\nBut when you turn network discovery on,\nthis next one could be a big deal.\n\n603\n00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.830\nThat's the responder.\n\n604\n00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.630\nAll right, so\nthe responder is listening out for\n\n605\n00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:35.610\nother computers that are calling out\nthere saying hey, anybody out there?\n\n606\n00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.820\nAnybody out there?\n\n607\n00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.420\nAnd then this one response back so\nit could give you information now or\n\n608\n00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.090\ngive out information other computers and\nthis is one of the things that I think\n\n609\n00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.120\nthat's interesting you\ngotta be careful with it.\n\n610\n00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.168\nNot only about information about your PC,\nbut if your P.C.\n\n611\n00:31:49.168 --> 00:31:51.980\nhas been collecting information\nabout other devices,\n\n612\n00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.235\nit can also give that information\nover to another computer too.\n\n613\n00:31:55.235 --> 00:31:58.377\nSo, whether you want this turn on or\nnot, gonna be up to you might\n\n614\n00:31:58.377 --> 00:32:01.463\nbe up to your administrator or\nbut just understand that, yes,\n\n615\n00:32:01.463 --> 00:32:05.790\nit does make our life easier when it comes\nto finding other devices on the network.\n\n616\n00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.913\nBut it also could make it\na little bit less secure too.\n\n617\n00:32:08.913 --> 00:32:11.153\nOne of the last things in Network and\n\n618\n00:32:11.153 --> 00:32:14.587\nSharing Center that I want to\nlook at is how you manage,\n\n619\n00:32:14.587 --> 00:32:18.860\nif you do have a home group turned on,\nhow you manage the passwords.\n\n620\n00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.970\nNow Windows typically will do this for us.\n\n621\n00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.879\nAll right, this is not a default\nsetting this is been changed.\n\n622\n00:32:25.879 --> 00:32:29.680\nThe default setting is allow Windows\nto manage the home group connections.\n\n623\n00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.260\nNow with that the reason,\nit's easier and every time we\n\n624\n00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.920\nsay easier we also say that there could be\na little bit of a reduction of security.\n\n625\n00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:41.650\nIf Windows manages this,\n\n626\n00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:44.400\nthat's what you do is you give\na password out somebody else.\n\n627\n00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.093\nAll right well.\n\n628\n00:32:45.093 --> 00:32:46.455\nHow do we get passwords out?\n\n629\n00:32:46.455 --> 00:32:49.393\nLike we've got to write them down,\nhopefully or maybe tell them.\n\n630\n00:32:49.393 --> 00:32:53.134\nAnd then that can lead somebody into,\nhowever getting that password and\n\n631\n00:32:53.134 --> 00:32:56.460\nconnecting to your home group and\nmaybe you don't want them to.\n\n632\n00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.240\nOr, I could let the user account,\nso if you've got\n\n633\n00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.960\nthe caught the same user accounts across\nmaybe you're in your own home network and\n\n634\n00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.330\nyou've got all the devices.\n\n635\n00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:09.140\nAnd you've got the same user account\nacross all of your machines, well,\n\n636\n00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.070\nyou can just go ahead and use this option.\n\n637\n00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.110\nAnd then it's the local security authority\nthat's doing the authentication and\n\n638\n00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.670\nit's not you writing down a password and\nsharing it with you.\n\n639\n00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.545\nYou know everybody are putting it on\nthe monitor or under the keyboard where we\n\n640\n00:33:21.545 --> 00:33:26.045\nkeep all of our password, so whether\nhow you do that is up to you remember\n\n641\n00:33:26.045 --> 00:33:31.012\nit's ease of use, versus maybe a little\nbit of a reduction in security there.\n\n642\n00:33:31.012 --> 00:33:33.433\nSo it is important to now but\nthe Network and\n\n643\n00:33:33.433 --> 00:33:37.469\nSharing Center good place to configure\nyour file and printer sharing,\n\n644\n00:33:37.469 --> 00:33:40.830\nnetwork discovery,\nas well as those home group centers.\n\n645\n00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:41.870\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n646\n00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.090\nNow, Wes,\nI did tell you were low on time but\n\n647\n00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.710\nguess what we got a ton of more topics\nto talk about a lot of good stuff.\n\n648\n00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.095\nWe're gonna have to do a part two.\n\n649\n00:33:49.095 --> 00:33:52.920\nThanks for joining us today, Wes, and\nI look forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n650\n00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.540\nI look forward to seeing everybody\nout there are part two, as well.\n\n651\n00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.960\nAs for this episode then we're going\nto go ahead and close it down.\n\n652\n00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.880\nSigning off for I.T.V. pro T.V.\nI've been your host Daniel Maury.\n\n653\n00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.760\n>> and I'm West Brian.\n\n654\n00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.323\nWe'll see you next time.\n\n655\n00:34:04.323 --> 00:34:05.070\n[SOUND]\n\n",

to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.910\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode we're\n\n5\n00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.750\ntalking about Windows 10 security\nspecifically continuing on the part two on\n\n6\n00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.850\nour talk about our topic of host\nsecurity through system hardening.\n\n7\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.540\nAnd joining us today to help\nlend his expertise on said topic\n\n8\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.280\nis none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.120\nHow's it going today Wes?\n\n10\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.810\n>> Man, it's going great.\n\n11\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.620\nIt's good to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.910\nAnd we've got more security\nstuff to talk about.\n\n13\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.335\nSo what are we gonna move into today,\n\n14\n00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:44.575\nwe're going to move into\nthe old Windows Firewall.\n\n15\n00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:47.655\nNow I say old Windows firewall\nbecause it first made its appearance\n\n16\n00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:51.955\nin the operating system going all\nthe way back to XP Service Pack 2.\n\n17\n00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:56.140\nBut we've had a built in\nhost based firewall for\n\n18\n00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.910\na long time now what does it mean\nwhen we say a host based firewall.\n\n19\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.780\nWell that means that whatever\nthe host is the system is running on.\n\n20\n00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.640\nIt is going to be\nprotecting that system and\n\n21\n00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.220\nnot every system within the network\none of the things that differentiates\n\n22\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.530\na network based firewall from\nthe host based firewall.\n\n23\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.140\nAnytime you got software running\non your operating system.\n\n24\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.910\nThat's what you're talking\nabout a host based firewall,\n\n25\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.940\nnow let's go jump right in here because I\nwant to talk more about some of the things\n\n26\n00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.860\nthat you could see inside of the windows\nfirewall so we're going to go ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.370\nnavigate down into the Control Panel and\nSystem and Security.\n\n28\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.110\nAnd the Windows Firewall.\n\n29\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.600\nAll right now, with the basic firewall,\none of the things that you get the ability\n\n30\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950\nto do is allow a program or\napplication through the firewall.\n\n31\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.970\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\n32\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.290\nWell, most firewalls, Windows Firewall\nis no exception to the rule here,\n\n33\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.950\nis the fact that all inbound traffic,\n\n34\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.850\neverything that's coming into my\ncomputer is going to be blocked and\n\n35\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.580\nthat's a good thing,\nunless we make an exception of the rule.\n\n36\n00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.150\nYou know, it's kind of funny that I just\nsay that and sometimes we don't even think\n\n37\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.700\nabout that but that's what the rule,\nthat's what exception is, right?\n\n38\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.310\nThe rule says anything that comes through\nthe firewall just discard it, block it.\n\n39\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.170\nExcept what we want to come to\nthe firewall, so let's go ahead and\n\n40\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.600\nshow you that too.\n\n41\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.430\nOver here on the left hand side you'll\nsee this allow an application through\n\n42\n00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.960\nthe firewall and\none of the first things you might see.\n\n43\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.730\nWhen you open the Windows Firewall is the\nfact that all the settings are grayed out.\n\n44\n00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.600\nAll right,\nnow to be able to change the settings and\n\n45\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.180\nallow those applications to the firewall,\nyou'd have to choose change settings.\n\n46\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.480\nI want to show you kind of how this works.\n\n47\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.080\nSo let's go ahead,\n\n48\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.245\nwe're gonna switch over to another\ncomputer that I have setup here.\n\n49\n00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:46.320\nAll right.\n\n50\n00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.210\nMaybe I don't have that computer set up\nthere we'll go ahead let that boot up.\n\n51\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.870\nAnd while it's booting up I want to show\nyou kind of how the firewall is going to\n\n52\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.140\nblock different communications\n\n53\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.590\nunless you specifically allow\nit to go through the firewall.\n\n54\n00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.920\nSo, one of the things that we have\nis our remote desktop connection and\n\n55\n00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.140\nthat's built into the majority of\nyour Windows operating systems.\n\n56\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.440\nIt does have some of its limitations,\nnotice that some of the features are only\n\n57\n00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.250\navailable on the Pro and the Enterprise\neditions, but we'll go ahead and\n\n58\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.080\nlaunch it up here and we're going to\nconnect back to that other machine.\n\n59\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.750\nAll right, so let me go ahead and\nput the IP address of that machine here.\n\n60\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.800\nAnd we're going to connect, and\n\n61\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.790\nnotice that it's sitting there\nthinking about it right.\n\n62\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.570\nWith the remote desktop connection,\n\n63\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.040\none of the things that you can tell\nthat it's not being allowed to\n\n64\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.380\ncommunicate is when it never goes\npast this initiate remote connection.\n\n65\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.890\nSo we've got something\nthat's being blocked,\n\n66\n00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.350\nand it is a specific\nWindows technology here.\n\n67\n00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.550\nA piece of software that we know and\nthat we trust.\n\n68\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.190\nSo let's go and\nswitch over to the next machine here.\n\n69\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.820\nAnd we'll go ahead and get logged in real\nquick, and we'll see what's going on here.\n\n70\n00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.750\nWhat's blocking this.\n\n71\n00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.810\nSo we'll do the same thing\nhere on the next machine.\n\n72\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.540\nWell get into the Windows Firewall.\n\n73\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.990\nAll right, we're gonna to go\nback to that same location,\n\n74\n00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.940\nallow an app through the firewall.\n\n75\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.140\nAnd I'm gonna click on that here.\n\n76\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.950\nAll right and change the settings and\nwe're going to look through the list here.\n\n77\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.940\nAll right and we're going to see if\nRemote Desktop is in the list and\n\n78\n00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.010\nwe'll see how it's configured.\n\n79\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.350\nAll right and well one of the things I\nsee right here, if I look in to this,\n\n80\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.980\nis the fact that this firewall doesn't\nseem to be blocking Remote Desktop right.\n\n81\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.230\nNotice it says Remote Desktop.\n\n82\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.760\nAnd we got a check mark there.\n\n83\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.200\nAll right so why is it being blocked?\n\n84\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.460\nWell this is something that's\nbuilt into Windows too, and\n\n85\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.620\nthat's something known as\nnetwork location awareness.\n\n86\n00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.300\nWhen you first connect to a network you\nmake a choice as to whether you want your\n\n87\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.620\ncomputers to be viewable by\nother computers or not, or\n\n88\n00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.770\nif you trust the network.\n\n89\n00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.410\nNow, that network location\nawareness is important, because\n\n90\n00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.110\neven though I see Remote Desktop is,\nthere's an exception the the rule there\n\n91\n00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.620\nthat says hey, allow it to I do notice\na check mark that's missing over here.\n\n92\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.030\nNotice that the public.\n\n93\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.380\nWhat does that mean public?\n\n94\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.530\nWell let's see how that relates\nto our network communications.\n\n95\n00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.120\nIf I go to my network and\nsharing center and open that up,\n\n96\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.210\none of the first things we're going\nto see here is public network.\n\n97\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.300\nAll right.\n\n98\n00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.750\nNetwork location awareness, guys,\nis a technology that works kind of\n\n99\n00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.760\nunder the hood and you might not even know\nthat it's there and it's doing anything.\n\n100\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.990\nBased on the choice that you make,\n\n101\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.220\nthe type of network that you connect\nto network location awareness.\n\n102\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.500\nConfigure software.\n\n103\n00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.140\nTake the jargon out of it\nthat's what it boils down to.\n\n104\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.320\nSo when I choose the public\nnetwork location.\n\n105\n00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.000\nWell guess what?\n\n106\n00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.680\nThe firewall is gonna set me up\nwith the same type of profile.\n\n107\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.200\nNotice that since I am connected\nto the public network,\n\n108\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.350\nRemote Desktop might be turned on.\n\n109\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.650\nBut it's turned on on the private network.\n\n110\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.540\nNotice that it's not turned\non on the public network.\n\n111\n00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.900\nSo you have to pay attention to that,\nbecause these things work hand in hand.\n\n112\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.930\nIf I put a check mark here and I turn\non that exception that says go ahead,\n\n113\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.560\nand allow remote desktop to\nconnect through the firewall,\n\n114\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.280\neven though we are connected\nto the public network.\n\n115\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.670\nAnd you can see that here\nin the basic firewall.\n\n116\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.270\nWhen you first look you might\nbe saying well wait a second.\n\n117\n00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.020\nWhat it what do you mean networks,\nwell these are profiles.\n\n118\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.410\nAll right the profiles within\nthe Windows firewall allow\n\n119\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.630\ncertain things to be turned on by\ndefault certain things to be turned off.\n\n120\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.260\nIf it's a public network this is what\nyou're going to want to use if you're\n\n121\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.720\nconnected to a wi-fi by hotspot.\n\n122\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.810\nIf Windows connects to a network and\nit can identify it.\n\n123\n00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.350\nIt has a setting way built down into\na GPO that says any unidentified network,\n\n124\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.210\nautomatically assign it\nthe public network location.\n\n125\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.800\nSo you have to be careful.\n\n126\n00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.330\nEven though you maybe know that you've\nset the firewall up appropriately.\n\n127\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.170\nIf your computer changes\nnetwork locations,\n\n128\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.550\nall of us on your software doesn't work.\n\n129\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.820\nSo let's see now that\nwe've got this set up.\n\n130\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.120\nIf we switch back to the next\ncomputer we're going to\n\n131\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.740\nrelaunch our remote desktop.\n\n132\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.820\n>> And what's interesting about public and\nprivate networks,\n\n133\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.310\nit's always kind of been,\nit can be confusing.\n\n134\n00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.920\nYou think, well if I'm on a public\nnetwork, I want to have access.\n\n135\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.790\nI want people have access,\nI'm making myself public.\n\n136\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.920\nBut it's really the opposite of that,\nwhere the private network you think oh,\n\n137\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.450\nit's private.\n\n138\n00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.530\nI wanna keep things private.\n\n139\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.210\nIt should be more stern.\n\n140\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.180\nIt's how Windows sees\nthe network that you're on.\n\n141\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.350\nIf you're saying that I'm\non a private network,\n\n142\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.820\nwhat you're telling the operating system\nis that this is a very trustable network.\n\n143\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.820\nIt's private.\n\n144\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.720\nFrom everybody else and their brother.\n\n145\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.204\nI'm keeping it kind of segregated and\nI have checks and\n\n146\n00:07:45.204 --> 00:07:46.939\nbalances in place to keep it that way.\n\n147\n00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:48.504\nSo I can allow some lax,\n\n148\n00:07:48.504 --> 00:07:53.684\nmake it a little more lax when it comes\nto my rules on how things are connecting.\n\n149\n00:07:53.684 --> 00:07:56.337\nPublic is, again,\nthe opposite of what you would think,\n\n150\n00:07:56.337 --> 00:07:58.029\nnot dominating everything public.\n\n151\n00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:01.779\nBut I need to harden it down because\neverybody and their brother,\n\n152\n00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:05.270\nI don't know who they might be,\ncan be accessing my system.\n\n153\n00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.810\nSo don't get confused.\n\n154\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.700\nI've seen that before where\nthe terminology can be a little confusing.\n\n155\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.320\nYou think the other or the opposite\nwhen the opposite is obviously true.\n\n156\n00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.955\n>> Yeah and that couldn't be more correct.\n\n157\n00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:20.230\n>> There you've got to be careful\nbecause in the first part of this,\n\n158\n00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.450\nif you haven't watched that,\ngo back and check the first part,\n\n159\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.790\nwe talked about network discovery, right?\n\n160\n00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.600\nFile and printer sharing.\n\n161\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.290\nIf you want these to be enabled and\nyou're connected to the public network,\n\n162\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.850\nwell guess what?\n\n163\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.510\nBy default they're turned off, so\nkeep in mind that network location\n\n164\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.810\nreally does effect the overall\nfunctionality of Windows and\n\n165\n00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.740\neven some technologies that\nare built in to help assist us.\n\n166\n00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.940\nSo let's go ahead and see if we've\nadded that rule, if you will or\n\n167\n00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.800\nallow that exception\non the public network.\n\n168\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.450\nNow all of a sudden, hopefully this\nis going to work we can connect,\n\n169\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.620\nIf I remember how to type my password.\n\n170\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.240\nYou know, one two three four five six.\n\n171\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.195\n>> RGP is set correctly.\n\n172\n00:08:58.195 --> 00:08:59.380\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n173\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.250\n>> A little hope as well.\n\n174\n00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.070\n>> Yeah that's right and\n\n175\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.410\nnotice right now it's telling us hey,\nwe're going to connect.\n\n176\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.960\nNow here's another little\nsecurity warning all right.\n\n177\n00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.160\nYou have to trust the computer\nthat you're connecting to.\n\n178\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.690\nAll right if you're in a corporate\nenvironment they might be using\n\n179\n00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.470\ncertificate based authentication and\n\n180\n00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.720\nyour administrators have that set\nup you might not even see it.\n\n181\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.700\nHere in Windows if you're\njust talking about a worker,\n\n182\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.230\nwhat it's doing is it's\nconnecting to this other machine.\n\n183\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.680\nAnd the machine generates\na self sign certificate.\n\n184\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.810\nRight?\nWell,\n\n185\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.320\nhow do you know that\nyour computer trust that?\n\n186\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.470\nWell it doesn't.\n\n187\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.560\nAnd that's what it's letting you warn and\n\n188\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.340\nsay hey I can't verify the identity\nof this computer here.\n\n189\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.640\nSo are you sure you want to connect to it?\n\n190\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.200\nAnd if you need to.\n\n191\n00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.000\nYou can always view the certificate,\n\n192\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.030\nbut either way your computer's\nnot going to trust it because,\n\n193\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.040\nwell, the other computer said well why\nshould you trust me because I said so.\n\n194\n00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.050\nAnd now you can see that we're logging\nin here and sure enough we're on CL2.\n\n195\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.736\nSo the exception of the firewalls,\nthe configuration of\n\n196\n00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:59.286\nthe firewalls are important and\nmaking sure that you have them set up.\n\n197\n00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:03.770\nNow some of the other things that you can\nsee inside of the basic firewall here.\n\n198\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.860\nAnd I love some of these task links here,\n\n199\n00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:13.480\nnotice it says change notification\nsettings and then turn firewall on or off.\n\n200\n00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.570\nWell, let's go to the first one\nhere turn firewall on or off.\n\n201\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.740\n>> All right or something here.\n\n202\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.340\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n203\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.890\nSo if your software is not not\nrunning right just don't do that, but\n\n204\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.840\nif we jump back over to turn\noff change notifications.\n\n205\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.340\nWait for it.\n\n206\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.100\nIt takes you to the same location so two\nlinks that mention completely different\n\n207\n00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.910\nconcepts that take you to\nthe exact same interface, so\n\n208\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.600\ndon't let some of those task\nlinks confuse you here.\n\n209\n00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.540\n>> Some programmer's\ngetting paid by the hour.\n\n210\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.670\nThat's right poorly coded.\n\n211\n00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.310\n>> That's right.\n\n212\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.920\nNever trust the code that's\ndone on Monday or Friday.\n\n213\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.430\nSo the other thing that you can do is, if\nlet's say that you've done something like\n\n214\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.510\nWes is doing here,\nyou're troubleshooting a program and\n\n215\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.110\nyou've set exceptions and\nnone of those exceptions are working,\n\n216\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.370\nyou can always restore the default\nas a pretty obvious here.\n\n217\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.930\nWhat they'll do is it'll just\nrevert them back to the original\n\n218\n00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.180\nstate that they were in\na factory reset here.\n\n219\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.240\nSo when it comes down to it lot of stuff\nthat you can do with the Windows basic\n\n220\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.960\nfirewall.\n\n221\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.080\nIt is just a basic\nfirewall interface here.\n\n222\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.540\nIt allows you to set incoming\ncommunications those exceptions.\n\n223\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.540\nPay attention to the application\nthat you're using.\n\n224\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.380\nIf you have any other customized\napplications you might say well what if\n\n225\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.960\nit's not built into Windows?\n\n226\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.258\nAll right, cuz all of these are.\n\n227\n00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:36.355\nThese are services and applications\nprograms if you will, that Windows is\n\n228\n00:11:36.355 --> 00:11:39.365\naware of, and a lot of them are built\nright into the operating system.\n\n229\n00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:44.685\nBut if you do have a third party software\nthat you need to allow to communicate.\n\n230\n00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:48.685\nAnd you very well could and a lot of\npeople do, you can browse to the location\n\n231\n00:11:48.685 --> 00:11:50.855\nof the executable and\nyou could tell the Windows Firewall,\n\n232\n00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:55.730\nwhen you see communications coming\nfrom this .EXE or the application.\n\n233\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.420\nGo ahead and\nallow it through the firewall and\n\n234\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.130\nthen you don't have any hopefully\ndon't have any problems.\n\n235\n00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.560\nThe other thing that you can do is you\ncan say how do I want this to apply.\n\n236\n00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.710\nDo I want this to a private network or\na public network.\n\n237\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:14.390\nAgain try to just limited you might not\nwant to open this up to everything.\n\n238\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.670\nBut there again,\nin a situation where you can see on R.C.L.\n\n239\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.570\nto our second client there that\nit's connected to a public network.\n\n240\n00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.110\nIf I forgot to change\nthis setting in here,\n\n241\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:27.450\neven though I told the application,\nyeah, go and communicate on through.\n\n242\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.590\nNow we're connected to a public\nnetwork in the application break.\n\n243\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.650\nSo it's a pretty\nstraightforward interface.\n\n244\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.230\nLike I said very basic.\n\n245\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.590\nNot a lot to it when it\ncomes to configurations.\n\n246\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.760\nYou just have to make sure that you're\naware of some of those things that you\n\n247\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.120\nmight think you can figure it right.\n\n248\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.660\nYou come back here and\nunfortunately applications are failing and\n\n249\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.360\nyou're seeing those help desk\ntickets just kind of a stack up.\n\n250\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:49.980\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n251\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.740\nthis is a really handy feature\non the operating system because\n\n252\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.690\na lot of businesses they purchase\nthird party applications.\n\n253\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.205\nTo to do business or they develop their\nown in-house and then they do to be able\n\n254\n00:12:59.205 --> 00:13:03.265\nto make exceptions for those, they could\nbe doing network calls across whatever and\n\n255\n00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.905\ntrying to make those connections and\na firewall's blocking it.\n\n256\n00:13:05.905 --> 00:13:08.515\nOf course an easy way to figure\nout whether that's happening or\n\n257\n00:13:08.515 --> 00:13:12.600\nnot is to turn the firewall off or\non and then see if it is working.\n\n258\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.850\nBut once you've figured that out, oh yes\nmy firewall is having an issue here,\n\n259\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.800\nit's blocking this\napplication we've developed.\n\n260\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.110\nThen you can go into that area and\nsay, well you know what,\n\n261\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.010\nwe'll just make an exception for\nit and now we're off to the races..\n\n262\n00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.490\n>> Yeah that's right and\n\n263\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.429\ndon't forget to turn that firewall\nback on after you've figured that out.\n\n264\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.500\nYou always see those.\n\n265\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.450\n>> Think the big exception.\n\n266\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.270\nEveryone's allowed to do everything.\n\n267\n00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.140\n>> That's exactly it because you always\nsee in those forums where they're\n\n268\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.330\nlike yeah we had a problem.\n\n269\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.430\nOur application was broken so we turned\na firewall off everything's fixed.\n\n270\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.410\nAnd then you'll see a follow\nup post two months later and\n\n271\n00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.720\nsays no we just kept the firewall off and\nnow everything's working fine and\n\n272\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.350\nwe can't figure out why half of our\ncompany's data is being stolen.\n\n273\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.680\n>> Not good security at all.\n\n274\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.770\n>> Yeah and so this basic interface\ndoes have some limitations,\n\n275\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:03.035\nall right and notice one of the things\nthat we could do is set inbound rules,\n\n276\n00:14:03.035 --> 00:14:04.970\nright and not to specific.\n\n277\n00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:05.880\nIt's based on a program.\n\n278\n00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.030\nAnd that's really all you get.\n\n279\n00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.700\nIdentify the program.\n\n280\n00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.910\nIf the firewall can do that it\neither allows it or blocks it.\n\n281\n00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.420\nNow you might want more granular control.\n\n282\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.010\nRight?\nMore I would say advanced control but\n\n283\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.820\nI'm going to set myself up for\na bad pun so we won't go there.\n\n284\n00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.330\nYou might want more granular control over\nwhat you're doing with Windows Firewall.\n\n285\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.660\nAnd that's where another technology it's\nanother administrative tool comes in, and\n\n286\n00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.060\nthat's called the Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n287\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.870\nThere's a few different ways that you can\nget to this and if you really want to be\n\n288\n00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.810\nfamiliar with the operating system,\nit's good to know those ways.\n\n289\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.550\nSo let's go ahead and demonstrate that.\n\n290\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:47.820\nIf you get back into the basic firewall,\nyou have a task link\n\n291\n00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.940\nthat it actually takes you to\nthe location that you're looking for.\n\n292\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.080\nAnd notice it says Advanced Settings here\nand when I choose Advanced Settings it\n\n293\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.290\nbrings up the Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n294\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.260\nNow that's the easier way.\n\n295\n00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.920\nYou also have the scenic approach too,\nright.\n\n296\n00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.380\nI could go back into the control panel and\ndown into administrative tools.\n\n297\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:10.230\nLikewise, system and security,\nadmin tools down here at the bottom and\n\n298\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.370\nyou'll see Windows Firewall\nwith its bad security there.\n\n299\n00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.600\nSo a couple different ways.\n\n300\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.230\nMy favorite though is\nthe smallest run line.\n\n301\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.790\nRemember those traditional run line\ncommands that you would run like\n\n302\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.320\nthe .mse's?\n\n303\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.590\nThis is the smallest run line\ncommand inside of Windows and\n\n304\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.670\nthe search functionalities\nmade it even shorter today.\n\n305\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.690\nSo if I type WF (Whiskey\nFoxtrot) all right,\n\n306\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.720\ntraditionally you would type wf.mse,\nMike here or Charlie here at the end.\n\n307\n00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.900\nAnd you could see right there it would\nlaunch the Windows Firewall with\n\n308\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.670\nadvanced security but the search\nfunctionality is made it even easier.\n\n309\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.114\nAll I have to do is type WF and\nyou'll see it's right here at the top.\n\n310\n00:15:46.114 --> 00:15:50.537\nSo few different ways to get to\nWindows Firewall with Advance Security,\n\n311\n00:15:50.537 --> 00:15:53.083\nyou can choose the method that suits you.\n\n312\n00:15:53.083 --> 00:15:56.920\nThat one I really like very easy\nto get to, a couple of letters and\n\n313\n00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.712\nanybody seen my typing skills out there,\nit only benefits me.\n\n314\n00:16:00.712 --> 00:16:03.540\n[LAUGH] One of the first\nthings you might notice here\n\n315\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.440\nis we don't get any of those quick\neasy breezy task links anymore.\n\n316\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:08.940\nRight.\n\n317\n00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.570\nWhen you start working with the Windows\nFirewall with advance security,\n\n318\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.060\nmake sure you understand what\nit is that you're setting.\n\n319\n00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.090\n>> It's big boy pants as you noticed.\n\n320\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.450\n>> Yes, definitely.\n\n321\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:25.970\nNotice that you can set in bound rules for\nthe basic firewall security.\n\n322\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.900\nThey had one of the things that\ndifferentiates this right away is the fact\n\n323\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.520\nthat you can set outbound rules.\n\n324\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.180\nNow, we demonstrated that remote desktop\nfrom this machine was connecting\n\n325\n00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.120\nto the other one.\n\n326\n00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.990\nWell let's go ahead and\nlet's break Windows on purpose.\n\n327\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.960\nI'm on CO1 here, right?\n\n328\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.290\nAnd let's see if we can make it stop\nthis from communicating to CL2 and\n\n329\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:51.450\ndemonstrate the fact the outbound\nrules can take effect here.\n\n330\n00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.149\nSo we'll bring up the Windows\nfirewall with advance security.\n\n331\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.400\nWe're gonna set an outbound rule.\n\n332\n00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.880\nNow when you click this,\nright-click on it and choose new rule.\n\n333\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.780\nFairly easy,\nuntil you get to this interface.\n\n334\n00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.030\nAll right, we've got a whole bunch\nof criteria that we can set.\n\n335\n00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.510\nAnd you have to be careful with it.\n\n336\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.900\nNot all of your applications\nare gonna show up in this interface.\n\n337\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.150\nLet me give you an example of that.\n\n338\n00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.800\nSo predefined.\n\n339\n00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.670\nRemember, we had predefined services in\nthe basic firewall interface, that it said\n\n340\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.450\nallow this app, and you just put a check\nmark in the different network locations.\n\n341\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.340\nAll right?\n\n342\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.400\nBut if I look down here, there might\nbe something that we see missing.\n\n343\n00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.320\nThey're all alphabetical, right?\n\n344\n00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.170\nBut notice remote desktop\nisn't in the list.\n\n345\n00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.840\nSo, if how are we gonna do this?\n\n346\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.290\nHow are we gonna block an application\nif it's not predefined and\n\n347\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.900\nwe can't find it in the list like we\ncan find it in the basic firewall?\n\n348\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.410\nWell that doesn't seem like\nit's really intuitive and\n\n349\n00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.250\nit certainly doesn't seem\nlike it's helping you out.\n\n350\n00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.090\nYou've got an option here\nthat you can use, all right.\n\n351\n00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.850\nI can use custom, or I can use port,\nor I can use program.\n\n352\n00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.860\nIn this case it just so happens,\n\n353\n00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.520\nI know what the program is\nthat runs the remote desktop.\n\n354\n00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.830\nSome of you guys might be familiar.\n\n355\n00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.350\nHasn't changed its name since\nit was called Terminal Services.\n\n356\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.010\nSo if I choose a program and\n\n357\n00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:13.360\nI walk through this wizard here,\nI can browse to the location.\n\n358\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.650\nBe careful with this one right here.\n\n359\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.820\nIf I'm going to block this, all programs,\njust break your entire operating system.\n\n360\n00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.650\nDon't do that.\n\n361\n00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.700\nWe'll choose browse.\n\n362\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.500\nAnd in this list in the system 32 folder,\nthere should be your MSTSC.\n\n363\n00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.320\nIt goes back to the days when it was still\ncalled Microsoft Terminal Services Client.\n\n364\n00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.939\nThey've never changed the executable here.\n\n365\n00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.740\nBut I could put that in the list.\n\n366\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.280\nAll right.\n\n367\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.440\nAnd the program path puts\na variable in there, and says, hey,\n\n368\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.620\nwherever the system root is,\nblock this program.\n\n369\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.110\nAnd notice we have\nan allow the connection,\n\n370\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.320\nallow the connection if it's secure.\n\n371\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.860\nWell talk about what that means,\nthat security coming up here.\n\n372\n00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.850\nSo we're gonna block the connection.\n\n373\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:50.670\nAll right.\n\n374\n00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.182\nNow, remember we've talked\nabout network location, right,\n\n375\n00:18:54.182 --> 00:18:57.870\nand how it relates to\nthe Windows Firewall profiles, all right.\n\n376\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.830\nThis is another thing that\nyou have to keep in mind.\n\n377\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.050\nBut one of the things that you\nmight see is there is in addition,\n\n378\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.890\nanother one in the list here.\n\n379\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.400\nWell what does that mean for us?\n\n380\n00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.726\nWhat does this one here mean?\n\n381\n00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:14.750\nOkay, when your computer joins\n\n382\n00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.620\na Windows Active Directory domain, it\nknows that obviously it has to set it up.\n\n383\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.790\nThe domain controller knows it,\nso they communicate.\n\n384\n00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.670\nAnd it can sense that.\n\n385\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.600\nEven though we don't have a domain profile\nset, the moment I join this computer\n\n386\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.210\nto the domain, it's gonna switch\na private network from private to domain.\n\n387\n00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.460\nAnd in that case, you're gonna wanna\nhave this check mark here, too.\n\n388\n00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.210\nEven if you don't see it ahead of time\nthat you've been connected to the domain\n\n389\n00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.630\nnetworks.\n\n390\n00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.880\nIf I choose next.\n\n391\n00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.320\nI might want to call this\nan easily identifiable name.\n\n392\n00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.860\nIt's arbitrary what you call it.\n\n393\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.750\nMake sure that you do you call it\nsomething that's easily identifiable.\n\n394\n00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.920\nWe were kind of talking before we started\nhere about some technologies that\n\n395\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.280\nare named one thing and they're called\nsomething completely different.\n\n396\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.020\nIf this is blocking outbound RDP,\nremote desktop,\n\n397\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.070\nI probably don't want to\ncall it cheeseburger.\n\n398\n00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.132\nRight?\nI would come back and\n\n399\n00:20:04.132 --> 00:20:05.723\nsay what was that\ncheeseburger I'm blocking.\n\n400\n00:20:05.723 --> 00:20:08.092\n[CROSSTALK] So\nhere's what I'm going to do.\n\n401\n00:20:08.092 --> 00:20:11.668\nAnd again remember the names arbitrary so\nwhatever naming convention you use.\n\n402\n00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:15.618\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n403\n00:20:15.618 --> 00:20:19.760\ncall it Block outbound RDP.\n\n404\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.490\nAnd you can use a description if you want.\n\n405\n00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:28.350\nWhen you first start out your user defined\nrules should be up here at the top.\n\n406\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.510\nAnd you can see the difference here.\n\n407\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.530\nSee the green checkmark versus\nthe you know the do not, if you will.\n\n408\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.400\nThe little circle with\na line drawn through it so\n\n409\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.190\nthat let's me know that it is in place.\n\n410\n00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.690\nNow I could go a little\nbit farther than this.\n\n411\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.580\nIf I want I can choose\nthe properties of the rule as well.\n\n412\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.720\nAnd I could scope this to\na specific computer, right?\n\n413\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.840\nMaybe I've got one computer that I know\nI don't want making a connection from.\n\n414\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.300\nWell, I can do that too.\n\n415\n00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.960\nBut we're gonna go ahead.\n\n416\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.100\nWe'll leave the defaults.\n\n417\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.520\nNow that it's blocked,\nlet's test our remote desktop and see\n\n418\n00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:04.900\nif this did what we want it to do.\n\n419\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.100\nAll right.\nAnd we'll hurry up and\n\n420\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.730\nwait, hurry up and wait.\n\n421\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.880\nWe got our Knight Rider screen going on,\nwaiting for a reboot, waiting for it.\n\n422\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.160\nNow-\n>> I'm sorry, Michael.\n\n423\n00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.770\n>> That's right.\n\n424\n00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:13.600\nWe're not gonna do this.\n\n425\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.930\n>> I cannot do that.\n\n426\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.140\nTelltale sign any time\nyou got a remote desktop.\n\n427\n00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.960\nI know this isn't an episode of remote\ndesktop, if it never gets past that\n\n428\n00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.680\ninitiating remote session,\nyou can tell there's a problem.\n\n429\n00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.280\nIt's up to you to figure\nout what the problem is.\n\n430\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.040\nWe know what the problem is in this\ncase because I created the problem so\n\n431\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.370\nI know that the firewall is blocking it.\n\n432\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.960\nBut notice that now we're not talking\nabout incoming communication.\n\n433\n00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.170\nWe're talking about\nan outbound communication.\n\n434\n00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.600\nThat's one of the things that\nthe firewall allows you to do.\n\n435\n00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.700\nIt allows you to set inbound rules,\nand your outbound rules, likewise.\n\n436\n00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.700\nBut we're not done there.\n\n437\n00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.758\nWe've got so much more.\n\n438\n00:21:47.758 --> 00:21:51.790\n[LAUGH] The next thing that we have, which\nis really cool about the Windows Firewall\n\n439\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.570\nwith advance security, is right here.\n\n440\n00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.490\nAnd these our connection security rules.\n\n441\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.190\nWhen we talk about connections security\nrules what we're talking about\n\n442\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.170\nis the information,\ndo we have to authenticate?\n\n443\n00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.010\nAll right, do we have to prove who we are,\nand I say, us,\n\n444\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.850\nit's really the computers that are doing\nthis, do they have to prove who they are?\n\n445\n00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.080\nNegotiate the communication and\n\n446\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.440\nthen secure it,\nbefore any data even gets traverses.\n\n447\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.570\nSo, let's see if we can do that here.\n\n448\n00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.480\nLet's set up an IP Sec\nconnection security role.\n\n449\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.120\nNow, it's a fairly\nstraightforward process and\n\n450\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.830\nwhen I click on it you're\ngonna see right away.\n\n451\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.380\nHey, well there's nothing here\nyou have to define these.\n\n452\n00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:34.890\nLet me go ahead and let you know had\nit ahead of time If you're gonna\n\n453\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:40.010\nuse connection security rules,\nall right, on both computers.\n\n454\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.510\nThe connection security\nrules have to be identical.\n\n455\n00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.950\nAll right.\nI can't say on this machine that I'm gonna\n\n456\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.850\nauthenticate with a pre-shared key and\nthen use a certificate for\n\n457\n00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.430\nauthentication on the other side.\n\n458\n00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.020\nThey have to match, right, they have to be\nin agreement, and we will see that here.\n\n459\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.900\nSo we're going to right-click\non Connection Security Rules,\n\n460\n00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.610\nwe're gonna choose New Rule, all right.\n\n461\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.800\nThis is going to be an Isolation rule.\n\n462\n00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.140\nAnd what we're going to do, and\nlet me define what that means too.\n\n463\n00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.890\nIsolation rule means we're gonna\nisolate the communication of the,\n\n464\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.330\nwhether it's a group or\ndomain membership more specifically here.\n\n465\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.960\nWe're gonna do an isolation rule\nbetween these two computers\n\n466\n00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.360\nbased on its authentication type.\n\n467\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.100\nWe'll choose next.\n\n468\n00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.240\nNotice we've got three options here,\nlet me kind of zoom in here.\n\n469\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.990\nRequest.\n\n470\n00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:24.290\nAuthentication for inbound communication.\n\n471\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:28.060\nSo if you're gonna talk to me,\nI want you to prove who you.\n\n472\n00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.830\nThat's the request.\n\n473\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.300\nActually this is the least\nof all the three security.\n\n474\n00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.900\nIt just says request it.\n\n475\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.675\nInbound.\nOutbound, if it doesn't happen,\n\n476\n00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:40.380\nwill still allow you to communicate so\nthat's actually the weakest security.\n\n477\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.656\nThis is the one that I was talking about.\n\n478\n00:23:41.656 --> 00:23:46.109\nNotice it says require inbound\nauthentication connections and\n\n479\n00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:48.670\nrequest for outbound connections.\n\n480\n00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.953\nAgain, that's saying if you talk to me,\n\n481\n00:23:50.953 --> 00:23:53.575\nyou prove who you are before\nyou even talk to me.\n\n482\n00:23:53.575 --> 00:23:55.328\nBut when I talk to you.\n\n483\n00:23:55.328 --> 00:23:57.440\nI'm not going to authenticate back to you.\n\n484\n00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.810\nThe last one which is the one we're\ngoing to use is the strongest.\n\n485\n00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.080\nNotice here it says Require.\n\n486\n00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.530\nThis is require for inbound-outbound.\n\n487\n00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.110\nDan and my computers are going to talk.\n\n488\n00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.840\nWell guess what, I've gotta prove to Dan\nwho I am before I could communicate.\n\n489\n00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.330\nRight no exceptions to the rule and before\nI allow the communication back to me,\n\n490\n00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.680\nDan's computer has to say,Hey,\nI'm Dan's computer.\n\n491\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.550\nProbably won't say it like that but\nwill have some negotiation of\n\n492\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.770\nauthentication and\nthat's what was what was said here.\n\n493\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:27.130\n>> Now Wes, if we're using this why would\nwe not choose the strongest option?\n\n494\n00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.180\n>> Well that's a good thing.\n\n495\n00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.430\nWhen it comes down to\nit if you don't choose.\n\n496\n00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:36.140\nYou know you might want to just make\nsure that inbound communications\n\n497\n00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.640\nare happening just so you know anything\ngoing through your firewall into your\n\n498\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.890\nmachine you verify the communications but\nsince it's already been verified,\n\n499\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.610\nyou might say okay,\nwell I'm talking back to another computer.\n\n500\n00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.780\nSo on your internal network\nyou might use not maybe so\n\n501\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.210\nstrict of a setting because\nyou trust the computers.\n\n502\n00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:57.560\nBut if you're in a situation where maybe\nyou don't know all the computers you might\n\n503\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.440\nwant them to verify inbound and outbound.\n\n504\n00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.080\nThis inbound and outbound this make sure\nthat there's not like for instance things\n\n505\n00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.500\nlike man in the middle attacks you know\nscraping that information and then\n\n506\n00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.590\nmodifying it and replaying so it prevents\nlike things from replay attacks too so\n\n507\n00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.080\nit's a very good thing to have.\n\n508\n00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.490\nWe'll choose Next.\n\n509\n00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.210\nIf you're in a domain environment,\nyou can use the default.\n\n510\n00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.960\nWell, if you're in a domain environment\ntypically the default setting is\n\n511\n00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.520\ngoing to be Kerberos\nauthentication method.\n\n512\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.190\nWe can ask.\n\n513\n00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.200\nWe can say, is it going to be the computer\nthat's going to authenticate?\n\n514\n00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.200\nIs it going to be the user\nthat's going to authenticate?\n\n515\n00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.770\nOr is it going to be both?\n\n516\n00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.210\nWe have more advanced authentication\nmethods too and that's what we're going to\n\n517\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.160\nuse I we're not going to use any\ndefaults here we'll live dangerously.\n\n518\n00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.870\nAll right when we use\nthe advance we can customize\n\n519\n00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.160\nwhat type of authentication\nwe're going to use.\n\n520\n00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.520\nIn this case I would say probably the best\nthing to use is you know if you're\n\n521\n00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.570\nan active directory makes it\neasier if you use Kerberos,\n\n522\n00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.170\nyou can use certificate mapping and\nthat's the strongest.\n\n523\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.300\nBut for our purposes here today we're\ngoing to add a first authentication.\n\n524\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.550\nAnd we're going to add typically one\nthat you really shouldn't use because\n\n525\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.830\nit's the weakest authentication but\nI can use Kerberos here you can see.\n\n526\n00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:11.910\nAnd certificate based if I want but\nwe're going to use the pre-shared key.\n\n527\n00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:12.970\nSo let's go ahead and do that and\n\n528\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.330\nwe're gonna use a super\nsecret password of pass1234.\n\n529\n00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.540\nAll right, we're going to choose OK, OK.\n\n530\n00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.700\nAnd we'll next do the wizard.\n\n531\n00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.410\nHere comes those locations again.\n\n532\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.690\nThey're not going to leave us.\n\n533\n00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:31.380\nWe'll choose next, and\nI might call this, let's say require,\n\n534\n00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:39.490\ninbound, outbound, authentication.\n\n535\n00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.650\nNow again keep in mind that\nwith these with these names.\n\n536\n00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.950\nAs long as you can spell authentication.\n\n537\n00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.320\nYou'll be able to identify it.\n\n538\n00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.610\nIt's really arbitrary.\n\n539\n00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.520\nSo that sets it up on one side.\n\n540\n00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.400\nKeep in mind that we still have to send\nset this up on the other side too.\n\n541\n00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.040\nAnd you have to make sure that\nthe authentication is exactly the same.\n\n542\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.560\nSo on this side when we set up our\nnew rule, we do the same thing,\n\n543\n00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.530\nwe do the isolation rule.\n\n544\n00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.910\nRequire for both, we'll do the Advanced.\n\n545\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:13.789\nAnd we're going to do the Customize.\n\n546\n00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:17.705\nAnd that's the pre-shared key.\n\n547\n00:27:17.705 --> 00:27:22.605\nNow one of the things that I want to\ndemonstrate is how this works and\n\n548\n00:27:22.605 --> 00:27:24.895\nhow it will also stop communications.\n\n549\n00:27:24.895 --> 00:27:27.360\nIf these aren't enforced on both sides.\n\n550\n00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.330\nSo now we've got, and\nwe'll just do require.\n\n551\n00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.810\nAnd I'll abbreviate this a little bit.\n\n552\n00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:39.480\nRequire, in, out, often,\nso I know what it is.\n\n553\n00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.220\nAll right, so now we've got it set up.\n\n554\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.780\nLet's test to see if it works.\n\n555\n00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.430\nWhat I'm going to do is,\nI'm gonna bring up.\n\n556\n00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:47.940\nWell, actually you know what.\n\n557\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.050\nLet's disable it first.\n\n558\n00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.760\nLet's see if we didn't have\nmatching security rules.\n\n559\n00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.140\nWe're just going to disable that rule.\n\n560\n00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.440\nIt's still there.\nWe're not gonna delete it.\n\n561\n00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.430\nBut I'm gonna bring up\nmy command prompt here.\n\n562\n00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.160\nAnd in the command prompt I'm gonna\ngo ahead and ping the other machine.\n\n563\n00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.570\nAnd we find out again with this\nIP addresses here real quick.\n\n564\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.640\nAll right, so\nwe're going to do a ping of 192.168.\n\n565\n00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.840\nAnd again just pinging the IP\naddress of the other machine.\n\n566\n00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.450\nAnd one of the things\nyou'll notice right here,\n\n567\n00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.360\nDan, is that it doesn't look like\nwe're getting much communication.\n\n568\n00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.820\nAnd that's on purpose.\n\n569\n00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.800\nWe did this on purpose.\n\n570\n00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.710\nWe broke it.\n\n571\n00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.600\nRemember that if you're going to use\nIP Sec communication with the connection\n\n572\n00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.380\nsecurity rules,\nrules gotta match on both sides or\n\n573\n00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.890\nthere's not going to be any communication.\n\n574\n00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.370\nSo let's just go back, simple fix.\n\n575\n00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.420\nWe're going to just enable that rule.\n\n576\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.190\nAll right.\n\n577\n00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.020\nAnd let's rerun that.\n\n578\n00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.150\nAnd now all of a sudden\nwe've got communications.\n\n579\n00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.140\nWe've got some negotiation\nthat's going and\n\n580\n00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.710\nthey verified they've\ncommunicated between each other.\n\n581\n00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.650\nThey've authenticated.\n\n582\n00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.080\nWe know that we can trust them.\n\n583\n00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.770\nSo how do we know that we can trust them?\n\n584\n00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.850\nWell, we've got a place\nthat we can monitor this.\n\n585\n00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:08.420\nAnd that's one good thing\nabout the advanced firewall.\n\n586\n00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.130\nThe first setting here,\nI'll just go ahead and\n\n587\n00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.600\nmention real quick, is all of\nthe active rules, inbound, outbound.\n\n588\n00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.460\nSo you'll see some grayed-out ones and\nwhen you look at inbound, outbound rules.\n\n589\n00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.750\nWe don't care about the grayed-out ones,\nright?\n\n590\n00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.590\nThey're not in not in play for us, they're\nnot something that we're concerned with so\n\n591\n00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.380\nif you're testing something, you're\nfiguring out why some things broke that\n\n592\n00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.410\nmight be the place that you go rather than\nlooking through all those other rules.\n\n593\n00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.490\nBut what I really care about with\nthe connection security rules,\n\n594\n00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.800\nis something known as\na Security Association.\n\n595\n00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.240\nSecurity Association is a trust\nrelationship the two computers go.\n\n596\n00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.720\nThat they had initiate before they\nstart sending communications.\n\n597\n00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.060\nThat's a main mode Security Association.\n\n598\n00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:49.160\nHandles that the negotiation of\nencryption and authentication.\n\n599\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.770\nAnd if I look at the properties of this,\nI can see the two end points.\n\n600\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.330\nThe local IP address and\nthe remote IP address.\n\n601\n00:29:56.330 --> 00:30:00.606\nI can see that they're using the AES\nadvanced encryption standard,\n\n602\n00:30:00.606 --> 00:30:02.978\ncipher block chaining, 128 bit.\n\n603\n00:30:02.978 --> 00:30:07.387\nAnd they're using Shaw one for\nintegrity and they're using the old\n\n604\n00:30:07.387 --> 00:30:11.950\nDiffie-Hellman internet key exchange for\nwell key exchange.\n\n605\n00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.683\nImagine that.\n\n606\n00:30:12.683 --> 00:30:16.700\n[LAUGH] Now when we actually\nstarted sending our information,\n\n607\n00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.960\nthat's a phase two or\nQuick Mode Security Association.\n\n608\n00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.750\nAnd this is where our data is actually\ngetting communicated back and forth.\n\n609\n00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.970\nWe've got integrity turned on through\nencapsulating security payload.\n\n610\n00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:33.220\nWe don't have it turned on,\nas far as encryption goes.\n\n611\n00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.410\nSo there is no encryption.\n\n612\n00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.920\nBut a lot of cool things that you can\ndo with the Windows Firewall with\n\n613\n00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.990\nAdvance Security but\none of the things I have to say is that\n\n614\n00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.570\nwhen you do set up these\nconnections security rules.\n\n615\n00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.030\nMake sure that they match on both sides.\n\n616\n00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:53.200\nOr like we see in communications not\ngonna happen, and your process of trying\n\n617\n00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.200\nto secure your communication can secure\nit so much that no communication happens.\n\n618\n00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.470\n>> Awesome.\nWell obviously the firewall's a very\n\n619\n00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.850\npowerful tool that we have at our\ndisposal, to make sure that our computers\n\n620\n00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.280\ncan be secure and\nharden exactly the way we like it.\n\n621\n00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.680\nNow if we want to do a more\n\n622\n00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.655\nlarger scale we can go with\njust the traditional firewall.\n\n623\n00:31:11.655 --> 00:31:13.485\nBut when we go into\nthat fine tune control,\n\n624\n00:31:13.485 --> 00:31:16.415\nwe going to the advanced firewall settings\nand that's where the magic happens.\n\n625\n00:31:16.415 --> 00:31:16.935\n>> That's right.\n\n626\n00:31:16.935 --> 00:31:20.005\n>> Now Wes, I know we have just\na few more topics to cover.\n\n627\n00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:23.032\nBut we are completely out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n628\n00:31:23.032 --> 00:31:25.592\nSo we'll have to come back and\nmake a short part three.\n\n629\n00:31:25.592 --> 00:31:26.482\nHopefully we'll see you there.\n\n630\n00:31:26.482 --> 00:31:27.762\nThanks for joining us today Wes.\n\n631\n00:31:27.762 --> 00:31:28.332\n>> It's been fun man.\n\n632\n00:31:28.332 --> 00:31:29.872\n>> And thank you guys for watching.\n\n633\n00:31:29.872 --> 00:31:31.702\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign for for ITProTV.\n\n634\n00:31:31.702 --> 00:31:33.442\nI've been your

Here they explain what local group policy is, how to configure it, and some of the ways that you can secure your PC, like restricting access to the registry. They also show you how to create multiple policies for applying different levels of access depending on user roles (admins vs. standard users).",

to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:17.911\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:22.102\nAnd in today's episode, we are moving\ninto more Windows 10 security content.\n\n6\n00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:26.142\nSpecifically, here, we're gonna address\nthe topic of group policy management.\n\n7\n00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:27.930\nIt's a good topic for us to know.\n\n8\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.667\nAnd joining me to help us navigate said\ntopic is none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.080\nHow's it going today, Wes?\n\n10\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.730\n>> It's going good.\n\n11\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.650\nIt's good to be here again.\n\n12\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.314\nAnd when we dive into how we can\ncontrol the computing environment for\n\n13\n00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:43.482\nour users and computers and keep some of\nthose settings the way we want, well,\n\n14\n00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:47.366\nthat's one of the reasons we wanna\nuse something known as group policy.\n\n15\n00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.185\nNow, the group policy that we're\nreally gonna be focusing on is what\n\n16\n00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:53.103\nyou can do with a workstation,\nwhether you have a domain environment or\n\n17\n00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:54.726\nyou don't have a domain environment.\n\n18\n00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:59.703\nWe've got plenty of other episodes that\nreally talk about domain environments,\n\n19\n00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:01.947\nso definitely check those out here.\n\n20\n00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:05.819\nBut one of the great things is, if you\ndon't have that extra infrastructure,\n\n21\n00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:09.869\nyou've still got some components within\nthe operating system that will allow you\n\n22\n00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.002\nto manage it locally.\n\n23\n00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:14.879\nAnd that's something known\nas the local group policy.\n\n24\n00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:18.681\nWhen we talk about local group policy,\nwe're talking about a whole,\n\n25\n00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:21.066\nentire range or\nsuite of configurations and\n\n26\n00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.289\nsettings that we can apply to\nour machine to make sure that we\n\n27\n00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.607\nlock down the environment, or at least,\nwhen I say lock down the environment,\n\n28\n00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:32.559\nthat that computing environment is\ngoing to be in the realm that we want.\n\n29\n00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.140\n>> Yes.\n\n30\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.176\nNow, obviously, if you've ever worked\nwith Active Directory or anything,\n\n31\n00:01:36.176 --> 00:01:39.258\nwhere you're kind of familiar with group\npolicy, what it is, what it does, so\n\n32\n00:01:39.258 --> 00:01:42.404\nsome of you might not be familiar with the\nfact that there is a local group policy.\n\n33\n00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:43.681\nThat's a good thing to know.\n\n34\n00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:47.820\nNow, my question is, Wes, how much\ndifference is there between the local\n\n35\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.320\ngroup policy settings and\nthe active directory group policy?\n\n36\n00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.561\n>> Well,\nwhen it comes down to the settings,\n\n37\n00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:57.486\nabout one of the biggest things that\ndiffers is, in the domain based GPOs,\n\n38\n00:01:57.486 --> 00:02:02.186\nyou get what are known as preferences, so,\nadditional options that aren't enforced.\n\n39\n00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:05.870\nAnd that's something that you\ndon't get inside of the local GPO.\n\n40\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.400\nBut if we go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.170\ntake a look at the local GPO, a couple\ndifferent ways that we can launch this up.\n\n42\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.918\nOne of the most common ways that we launch\nthis up is through a little program\n\n43\n00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:15.760\ncalled gpedit.\n\n44\n00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.831\nYou'll see here, gpedit.msc brings\nup this command console here.\n\n45\n00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:25.106\nAnother thing that you can do with this\nsearch functionality I really like, it's\n\n46\n00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:28.480\nrelatively new, just type the word group,\nand it comes up with edit group policy.\n\n47\n00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.840\nBut one of the common ways we do\nthis is to just type gpedit.msc, and\n\n48\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.688\nthat launches your group policy console.\n\n49\n00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:41.100\nNow in here, one of the things\nthat you're gonna notice is,\n\n50\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.860\nwe've got a couple of different\nareas that we can configure.\n\n51\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.600\nHere at the top, we've got what's\nknown as computer configuration.\n\n52\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.160\nInside of your domain environments,\nyou would have two\n\n53\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.490\ndifferent drop down lists that would\nall be collapsed on each other.\n\n54\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.650\nThere would be policies, and\nthere would be preferences.\n\n55\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.880\nAgain, policies are enforced.\n\n56\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.750\nPreferences are something\nthat are optional.\n\n57\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.680\nYour end users can change them, but\nwe don't have these in the local GPO.\n\n58\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.781\nSo, all we have are policy settings,\nand that's why it's just a little bit\n\n59\n00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:12.935\ndifferent than what you'll\nsee in the domain based GPOs.\n\n60\n00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:16.022\nNow, when it comes into\nthe computer configurations,\n\n61\n00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:20.094\none of the things that we wanna know\nis that, a computer configuration for\n\n62\n00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:23.657\nlocal GPOs typically go into\neffect the moment you change them.\n\n63\n00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:28.482\nThe computer configuration, or\nexcuse me, the user configurations,\n\n64\n00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:31.566\ndepending on what setting you configure,\nfor\n\n65\n00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:35.219\nthe most part,\nthey should go into effect right away.\n\n66\n00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.238\nSometimes, there might be a setting\nthat maybe applies to a display or\n\n67\n00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:42.858\nsomething that, it'll require\nthe user to log off and log on.\n\n68\n00:03:42.858 --> 00:03:48.420\nSo, let's look at a couple of\nthe settings that we can configure.\n\n69\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.810\nI'm gonna start by, maybe,\nwe don't want end users, for instance,\n\n70\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.870\nmodifying things like the registry.\n\n71\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.102\nSo when we put this GPO into place, maybe\nwe wanna lock them out of that ability.\n\n72\n00:04:01.102 --> 00:04:03.877\nAnd you can see right here,\nif I was to type regedit.\n\n73\n00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:05.128\nIf I could type reg.\n\n74\n00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:08.283\n[LAUGH] edit.\n\n75\n00:04:08.283 --> 00:04:10.942\nYou can see, I have no problem.\n\n76\n00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:12.660\nI can launch the registry editor.\n\n77\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.519\nEverything's fine.\n\n78\n00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.690\nBut again, for the most part,\nmaybe you wanna lock that down, and\n\n79\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.999\nyou don't wanna give anybody the ability\nto locally bring that registry editor up.\n\n80\n00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:27.596\nSo we can actually go in here,\nunder Computer Configuration, and\n\n81\n00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:29.906\nthen we can go to the System here.\n\n82\n00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:32.240\nAnd when we expand out System.\n\n83\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.729\nOh, this is actually user configuration,\nand\n\n84\n00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.027\nthat's another thing, too,\nthat you gotta be careful with,\n\n85\n00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:41.283\nis making sure you know where\nsome of the settings that apply.\n\n86\n00:04:41.283 --> 00:04:42.898\nWhen a computer setting applies,\n\n87\n00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:46.136\nunderstand that it applies to\neverybody that logs into the machine.\n\n88\n00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:50.819\nWhen you apply a user based setting,\nespecially in a domain environment,\n\n89\n00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.659\nit applies to the specific\nuser that logs in.\n\n90\n00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.223\nNow, under Administrators and System,\n\n91\n00:04:56.223 --> 00:04:59.600\nthis is the one that we're\nactually looking for here.\n\n92\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.930\nThere's a setting right here that says,\ndisable,\n\n93\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.750\nor Prevent access to the registry\nediting tools, and I can modify this.\n\n94\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.470\nAnd we gotta be careful.\n\n95\n00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.193\n[LAUGH] In some of these settings,\nif you enable them,\n\n96\n00:05:11.193 --> 00:05:13.730\nyou actually disable the functionality.\n\n97\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.963\nIn other settings, when you enable\nsomething or disable something,\n\n98\n00:05:16.963 --> 00:05:19.772\nyou might actually enable it,\nso you gotta be very careful.\n\n99\n00:05:19.772 --> 00:05:23.236\nAnd one of the great things that you\nhave in most of your group policies,\n\n100\n00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:27.051\nand this honestly isn't anything that's\nunique to just local group policy,\n\n101\n00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:30.921\nyou can also see this in your domain based\ngroup policies, where it'll give you\n\n102\n00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:34.838\na full explanation as to, hey, if you do\nthis, if you enable it, it does this.\n\n103\n00:05:34.838 --> 00:05:36.533\nIf you disable it, it does this.\n\n104\n00:05:36.533 --> 00:05:41.118\nOr if you leave it not configured, so\nyou have to be careful, because sometimes,\n\n105\n00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:42.921\nnot configured get confusing.\n\n106\n00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:46.497\n>> This can be extremely confusing,\nI know.\n\n107\n00:05:46.497 --> 00:05:51.294\nAnd especially the words and the verbiage\nthat they use to try to convey what it is\n\n108\n00:05:51.294 --> 00:05:54.739\nthis thing actually does,\nagain can be extremely, hm.\n\n109\n00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:55.819\nWell, do they mean?\n\n110\n00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.954\nYou have to really take a look at what\nthey mean, cuz Wes is exactly right.\n\n111\n00:05:58.954 --> 00:06:03.052\nSometimes, you're enabling something\nwhich is meaning to disable something.\n\n112\n00:06:03.052 --> 00:06:06.755\nSo, it's like, okay, do I disable this,\nor do I enable this?\n\n113\n00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:10.079\nObviously, if it's not enabled or\nit's not configured at all,\n\n114\n00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:13.040\nit's not doing anything,\nand that's where it's like,\n\n115\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.891\nwhat's the difference between that and\ndisabling it?\n\n116\n00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:16.855\n>> Yeah, and you know what?\n\n117\n00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:20.958\nThat's sets us up to show exactly\nwhat he's talking about here, so,\n\n118\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.636\nremember the setting here.\n\n119\n00:06:22.636 --> 00:06:27.558\nIt says, Prevent the users from running\nregedit, or your registry editor.\n\n120\n00:06:27.558 --> 00:06:31.238\nI'm just so used to abbreviating that,\nand I'm gonna actually disable this.\n\n121\n00:06:31.238 --> 00:06:32.411\nAnd we'll choose Ok.\n\n122\n00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:36.679\nAnd so, when I disable this, now,\nI'm an administrative user, so\n\n123\n00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:41.536\nwe have to make sure that this isn't just\nan administrative user still allowed\n\n124\n00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:45.020\nto open the registry editor here,\nbut let's go ahead.\n\n125\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.310\nLet's find out.\n\n126\n00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.393\nWe'll type regedit, again,\nand see if I can launch it.\n\n127\n00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:53.842\nNow, a tell tale sign that I can launch it\nis the user account control is blocking\n\n128\n00:06:53.842 --> 00:06:57.705\nme, so it's saying, you're about to make\na modification to system functionality, so\n\n129\n00:06:57.705 --> 00:06:59.472\nyou notice that I can still launch it up.\n\n130\n00:06:59.472 --> 00:07:02.251\nAnd apparently that didn't do what\nwe wanted it to do, so again,\n\n131\n00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:03.221\nbe careful with that.\n\n132\n00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:05.620\nWe type gpedit.\n\n133\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.240\nWe'll get back to that setting real\nquick and modify it a little bit.\n\n134\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.980\nWe'll change it from disabled to enabled.\n\n135\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.550\nAnd again, pay attention to what side of\nthe river you're on here, because some of\n\n136\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.814\nthese settings aren't available under\nthe computer versus user settings.\n\n137\n00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:23.113\nWe'll go back to, where is that?\n\n138\n00:07:23.113 --> 00:07:27.571\nThat's the Administrative Template\n> System.\n\n139\n00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:30.960\nAnd we'll go ahead and now enable this.\n\n140\n00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.544\nNow, when you enable this setting\nspecifically, you have to figure out,\n\n141\n00:07:35.544 --> 00:07:40.565\ndo you want end users to know that you as\nan administrator have blocked the registry\n\n142\n00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:46.060\neditor, or you wanna disable it, you don't\nwanna let anybody know that it's running.\n\n143\n00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.941\nI'm not gonna do it silently.\n\n144\n00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:50.774\nI wanna know so that we can see this\nout here, we can see what's going on.\n\n145\n00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:52.898\nSo, I'm gonna choose OK here.\n\n146\n00:07:52.898 --> 00:07:56.892\nAnd close the policy down.\n\n147\n00:07:56.892 --> 00:08:03.614\nAnd I'm gonna type R-E-G-E-D-I-T,\nand here's our registry editor.\n\n148\n00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:04.399\nWe choose Yes.\n\n149\n00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:07.893\nAnd now you'll notice it's a little\nbit different, right, now,\n\n150\n00:08:07.893 --> 00:08:11.782\nit plainly says Registry editor has\nbeen disabled by your administrator.\n\n151\n00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:14.430\n>> That's right.\n\n152\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.060\nNow that registry can not be edited\nby anybody, unless you specifically\n\n153\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.610\nput them in a group, or make a group\npolicy object to put them in that,\n\n154\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.840\nor apply that to them,\nto be able to change that registry.\n\n155\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.480\nCuz you got to remember, basically\neverything that you do inside of your\n\n156\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.630\nWindows operating system is\ncontrolled by the registry.\n\n157\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.150\nSo it's a really good place for\npeople to start making changes and\n\n158\n00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.222\nstart maybe doing things that\nyou don't want them to do.\n\n159\n00:08:39.222 --> 00:08:42.689\nAnd it can even potentially hurt\nthe operating system to the point\n\n160\n00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:47.244\nwhere it becomes unusable, so it's a good\nreason that we would wanna lock that down.\n\n161\n00:08:47.244 --> 00:08:49.764\nPeople that aren't administrators,\nthat aren't tech savvy,\n\n162\n00:08:49.764 --> 00:08:51.747\nthey don't really need to\nbe going in here anyway.\n\n163\n00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:52.536\nThat's for us.\n\n164\n00:08:52.536 --> 00:08:56.366\nIt's our job as the support staff,\nas IT staff.\n\n165\n00:08:56.366 --> 00:08:57.259\nThat's what we do.\n\n166\n00:08:57.259 --> 00:09:01.298\nSo, again, it goes back to that\nprinciple of least access.\n\n167\n00:09:01.298 --> 00:09:02.810\nThey don't need access to it?\n\n168\n00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.946\nRemove it from them.\n\n169\n00:09:03.946 --> 00:09:05.640\nThat way they can't get in there.\n\n170\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.693\nEven accidentally and cause havoc on\ntheir system, generating a ticket,\n\n171\n00:09:08.693 --> 00:09:12.045\nnow I've got to go to work and Wes' phone\nrings and I'm gonna say, Wes go do that.\n\n172\n00:09:12.045 --> 00:09:13.790\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat's right go take care of that.\n\n173\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.207\n>> [LAUGH] I've got some\ncheeseburgers to eat or something.\n\n174\n00:09:17.207 --> 00:09:17.745\n>> That's right,\n\n175\n00:09:17.745 --> 00:09:20.320\nnow one of the limitations to the local\nGPO is notice that we've applied this GPO\n\n176\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:20.865\nto the setting.\n\n177\n00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:24.105\nLet's go ahead and\nswitch over to our other machine and\n\n178\n00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.605\nsee how that effects the other machine.\n\n179\n00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:31.622\nI'm just gonna log in here\nto the second computer here.\n\n180\n00:09:31.622 --> 00:09:35.581\nI'm gonna type R-E-G-E-D-I-T and\nwe'll run our Regedit here.\n\n181\n00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:40.466\nAnd I've got this setup\na little bit different,\n\n182\n00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:44.835\nlet's go ahead and see if we can run this.\n\n183\n00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:47.655\nGo ahead and get logged in here.\n\n184\n00:09:47.655 --> 00:09:51.955\nAnd notice that\nthe Registry Editor launches.\n\n185\n00:09:51.955 --> 00:09:52.581\nWhy is that?\n\n186\n00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:57.455\nWell, that's one of the first\nlimitations to local GPOs.\n\n187\n00:09:57.455 --> 00:10:03.595\nSee the local GPO only affects\nthe machine that you configure it on.\n\n188\n00:10:03.595 --> 00:10:06.085\nAll right, and that being said,\nbut if you have five computers,\n\n189\n00:10:06.085 --> 00:10:09.565\nif you have ten computers that\nare inside of your network, well,\n\n190\n00:10:09.565 --> 00:10:11.355\nyou're gonna have to do\nthe old sneaker net.\n\n191\n00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:15.694\nYou're gonna have to get up from each\ncomputer, go to computer to computer to\n\n192\n00:10:15.694 --> 00:10:18.970\ncomputer, configuring those\nresources individually so\n\n193\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.539\nlocal GPOs only affect the machine\nthat that is configured on.\n\n194\n00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:26.202\nNow, that being said, the other problem or\n\n195\n00:10:26.202 --> 00:10:31.456\nlimitation if you will to local\nGPOs is I'm an Administrator.\n\n196\n00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:34.111\nRight, we've applied this GPO but\n\n197\n00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:39.789\nthe problem is this GPO is now affecting\neverybody that logs in the machine.\n\n198\n00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:42.687\nAnd back in days of XP this\nis really all you had,\n\n199\n00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:47.034\nyou had one local root policy that\nyou could set, different settings,\n\n200\n00:10:47.034 --> 00:10:50.657\ndefine those settings and\nwhen you apply it to the machine,\n\n201\n00:10:50.657 --> 00:10:55.665\nthe problem is it would affect everybody\nthat is logging in to that machine.\n\n202\n00:10:55.665 --> 00:10:58.995\nAnd that's again, maybe not what you want.\n\n203\n00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:01.984\nSo, that's one of those\nlimitations to the local GPOs or\n\n204\n00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:05.715\nlocal group policy when it comes\nto how you implement them.\n\n205\n00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:08.505\nSo, Microsoft kinda reinvented the wheel.\n\n206\n00:11:08.505 --> 00:11:12.965\nNow, when I say reinvented the wheel, what\ndo you mean, well they decided to bring\n\n207\n00:11:12.965 --> 00:11:17.855\nout in the days of Vista, it's been in\nWindows 7, Windows 8, 8.1, and also here\n\n208\n00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:21.575\nin Windows 10, something known as\nthe Multiple Local Group Policy Objects.\n\n209\n00:11:21.575 --> 00:11:25.555\nNow when we talk about\nMultiple Group Policy Objects,\n\n210\n00:11:25.555 --> 00:11:31.635\nthis is where the concept of more than\none policy applies to your end users.\n\n211\n00:11:31.635 --> 00:11:35.603\nAnd you can define different levels of\nGPOs instead of just applying it to\n\n212\n00:11:35.603 --> 00:11:39.830\neverybody, you can apply it to multiple\nusers and that makes it maybe a little\n\n213\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.578\nmore efficient if you want to, let's say,\nmaybe you don't want your administrators\n\n214\n00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:48.122\nbeing blocked and we can actually\ndemonstrate that right here.\n\n215\n00:11:48.122 --> 00:11:52.137\nSo, here on this machine,\nwhen you do multiple local GPOs,\n\n216\n00:11:52.137 --> 00:11:57.605\nyou have to do this a little bit different\nthan just running your standard gpedit.\n\n217\n00:11:57.605 --> 00:12:01.015\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nlaunch a blank Microsoft management\n\n218\n00:12:01.015 --> 00:12:03.965\nconsole And you can do this by typing\nmmc.exe, mike mike charlie dot exe.\n\n219\n00:12:03.965 --> 00:12:07.175\nThere and we'll run this,\nwe should get a trigger of the UAC here,\n\n220\n00:12:07.175 --> 00:12:10.855\nkeep in mind the User Account Control\nis gonna let us know,\n\n221\n00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:14.635\nhey you're about to launch\na console that can make changes\n\n222\n00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:19.205\nto the core functionality of the operating\nsystem or key security settings.\n\n223\n00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:22.675\nSo, it is something that requires\nto be an Administrative End User.\n\n224\n00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:27.210\nAnd I always use my keyboard shortcut,\nCTRL M, and that brings in your\n\n225\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.595\nSnap-In Console, and each one of these\nare their own individual utilities.\n\n226\n00:12:31.595 --> 00:12:35.135\nIf you need to use it, you don't have\nto use keyboard shortcuts, you can\n\n227\n00:12:35.135 --> 00:12:39.885\nalso go up to, what's the File here yeah,\nand Snap-In will be right there.\n\n228\n00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:45.365\nNow, within this list you'll find one that\njust starts with Group Policy Object and\n\n229\n00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:47.035\nit's actually\nthe Group Policy Object Editor.\n\n230\n00:12:47.035 --> 00:12:51.395\nNow, the difference here is,\nnotice there's a browse button.\n\n231\n00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:54.905\nThat Browse button is very important for\n\n232\n00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:59.635\nus when it comes to setting\nup more than one GPO.\n\n233\n00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:04.435\nNotice, that what we had in the just\nstandard local GPO is we said everybody\n\n234\n00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:05.985\nthat gets this machine, or\n\n235\n00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:09.045\nlogs into this machine,\nisn't gonna be able to view the registry.\n\n236\n00:13:09.045 --> 00:13:09.775\nSo I tell you what.\n\n237\n00:13:09.775 --> 00:13:13.445\nWhat we're gonna do right\nbefore we do our multiple GPO.\n\n238\n00:13:13.445 --> 00:13:15.985\nLet's undo the changes\nthat made real quick,\n\n239\n00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:17.995\nso that we don't get\na conflict on interest here.\n\n240\n00:13:17.995 --> 00:13:21.395\nAnd that really is important, so\nlet me go ahead real quick and\n\n241\n00:13:21.395 --> 00:13:23.175\nwe're gonna undo that change.\n\n242\n00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:26.485\nRemember, we were preventing\naccess to the Registry.\n\n243\n00:13:26.485 --> 00:13:31.075\nAnd, oh that's the Command Prompt\njust a bit outside.\n\n244\n00:13:32.225 --> 00:13:36.765\nIt might help if I maximize the screen so\nI can see what I'm looking at, there.\n\n245\n00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:38.575\nAnd we'll choose Not Configured here.\n\n246\n00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:41.495\nSo we're just, basically guys what we're\ndoing is just undoing that setting cuz I\n\n247\n00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:43.785\ndon't want a conflicting policy here.\n\n248\n00:13:43.785 --> 00:13:46.055\nAnd when I hit the Browse option,\n\n249\n00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:48.575\nnotice it gives me the ability\nto choose this computer.\n\n250\n00:13:48.575 --> 00:13:51.675\nIf you're in a work group environment,\nyou can also perform\n\n251\n00:13:51.675 --> 00:13:54.355\nremoting with this which means\njust management over the network.\n\n252\n00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:57.915\nSo, you could point this to another\ncomputer, as long as you're the local\n\n253\n00:13:57.915 --> 00:14:01.635\nadmin on that computer as well and\nyou can manage it from a single location.\n\n254\n00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:03.995\nSo, it's not completely decentralized, but\n\n255\n00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:06.214\nauthentication becomes\na hassle at that point.\n\n256\n00:14:08.005 --> 00:14:10.625\nBut what I really care\nabout is this User tab.\n\n257\n00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:14.456\nNotice the Users tab,\nwe've got all these different accounts.\n\n258\n00:14:14.456 --> 00:14:15.966\nAnd more specifically for\n\n259\n00:14:15.966 --> 00:14:20.225\nus, notice we have an administrator and\na non-administrator account.\n\n260\n00:14:20.225 --> 00:14:24.695\nSo, just think of non-administrators\nas your standard users and\n\n261\n00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:28.115\nadministrators obviously\nis what the name implies.\n\n262\n00:14:28.115 --> 00:14:31.505\nSo, I can choose a non-administrator\nGPO here and I can choose Finish and\n\n263\n00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:32.295\nit's in the console.\n\n264\n00:14:32.295 --> 00:14:35.355\nNow, we don't wanna stop there\nbecause if I stop right there,\n\n265\n00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:37.205\nthen I've only done\nbasically what I did before.\n\n266\n00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:37.865\nI've got a single GPO.\n\n267\n00:14:37.865 --> 00:14:41.455\nSo, we also wanna create one for\nadministrative users too.\n\n268\n00:14:41.455 --> 00:14:43.075\nAnd it's kinda interesting\nthat we would have to do that.\n\n269\n00:14:43.075 --> 00:14:44.825\nSame thing, we're gonna find that Snap-In.\n\n270\n00:14:44.825 --> 00:14:46.375\nWe're gonna add it to the console.\n\n271\n00:14:46.375 --> 00:14:47.445\nWe're gonna choose Browse.\n\n272\n00:14:47.445 --> 00:14:50.945\nIt's gonna ask us if we want this\ncomputer or another computer.\n\n273\n00:14:50.945 --> 00:14:52.465\nIn this case, we want this computer.\n\n274\n00:14:52.465 --> 00:14:57.354\nWe'll choose Users and we're gonna put\nour administrators in there this time.\n\n275\n00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:59.210\nAnd we'll choose Finish.\n\n276\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.713\nNow we've got, once we choose OK,\nnotice that over here,\n\n277\n00:15:03.713 --> 00:15:08.418\nleft hand side at the top,\nwe have more than one GPO involved.\n\n278\n00:15:08.418 --> 00:15:12.145\nAnd what I can do, let me go ahead and\nsave, you wanna save the console too.\n\n279\n00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:15.155\nThe MMC, one of the good things\nabout is that you can save them and\n\n280\n00:15:15.155 --> 00:15:16.195\nyou can use them for later.\n\n281\n00:15:16.195 --> 00:15:19.755\nSo, if I know that if I'm gonna be using\nmultiple GPOs, I'd actually export this to\n\n282\n00:15:19.755 --> 00:15:23.015\na thumbdrive and I can walk in and\nplug it to the different machines.\n\n283\n00:15:23.015 --> 00:15:23.855\nAnd it makes it easier.\n\n284\n00:15:23.855 --> 00:15:27.915\nSo, I don't have to keep opening\nup this MMC, on each machine.\n\n285\n00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:29.885\nSo, a little bit easier there.\n\n286\n00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:32.285\nI don't wanna open another one here.\n\n287\n00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:34.645\nLet's go ahead and just save this.\n\n288\n00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:37.785\nI'll save it to the desktop,\njust so I can find it.\n\n289\n00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:41.175\nMLGPO.\nAnd now we're ready to do some\n\n290\n00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:41.875\nconfiguration.\n\n291\n00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:44.615\nAnd I don't have to worry\nabout losing these Snap-Ins or\n\n292\n00:15:44.615 --> 00:15:48.185\nthe settings that I've\ndefined prior to this.\n\n293\n00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:49.575\nNotice the difference, though.\n\n294\n00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:50.695\nNotice that, this time,\n\n295\n00:15:50.695 --> 00:15:55.505\nif we expand both of these settings out,\nwe only have user configuration.\n\n296\n00:15:55.505 --> 00:15:58.045\nAnd that's because they apply to\nthe users or groups themselves,\n\n297\n00:15:58.045 --> 00:16:01.395\nso there's no reason to define\na computer setting here.\n\n298\n00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:04.755\nSo, what we can do now is,\non our non-administrator policies, right?\n\n299\n00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:07.005\nWe'll go back to those same locations,\nsystem,\n\n300\n00:16:07.005 --> 00:16:10.045\nprevent access to the registry tool.\n\n301\n00:16:10.045 --> 00:16:11.665\nNow, careful on this one.\n\n302\n00:16:11.665 --> 00:16:13.185\nThis is where it gets a little tricky,\nright?\n\n303\n00:16:14.905 --> 00:16:17.675\nFor your non-administrators,\nlet's just call them standard users.\n\n304\n00:16:17.675 --> 00:16:19.245\nThat's what they are, standard users.\n\n305\n00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:23.725\nWe can choose enable and I'm not\ngonna disable it silently running for\n\n306\n00:16:23.725 --> 00:16:27.635\nthe purposes of the demonstration, so\nyou can see whether it worked or not.\n\n307\n00:16:27.635 --> 00:16:29.225\nAnd I'm gonna choose OK.\n\n308\n00:16:29.225 --> 00:16:31.105\nNow, you might not remember\nwhat Dan said earlier.\n\n309\n00:16:31.105 --> 00:16:33.505\nHe said, well,\nyou gotta be very careful, it's tricky.\n\n310\n00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:36.215\nWhen you disable something,\nwhat are you doing?\n\n311\n00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:37.615\nWell, remember what the setting says.\n\n312\n00:16:37.615 --> 00:16:42.872\nIt says,\nprevent access to registry editing tools.\n\n313\n00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:47.088\nSo, it just goes to show you that,\nby association, preventing it,\n\n314\n00:16:47.088 --> 00:16:52.195\nif I disable the preventing of it, I'm\nbasically saying, go ahead you can run it.\n\n315\n00:16:52.195 --> 00:16:57.872\nAnd this is applying to the administrative\naccounts on this machine.\n\n316\n00:16:57.872 --> 00:17:01.581\nIf you remember earlier,\nsince I am logged in as an administrator.\n\n317\n00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:05.247\nAt this point, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust minimize this for now.\n\n318\n00:17:05.247 --> 00:17:09.805\nI wasn't able to run the registry editor\nbecause of the fact that we had one GPO\n\n319\n00:17:09.805 --> 00:17:11.290\napplying to everybody.\n\n320\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.166\nNow, let's see if it's\naccomplished what we want.\n\n321\n00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.256\nHere's that registry editor, or the UAC,\n\n322\n00:17:16.256 --> 00:17:19.715\nexcuse me and there's our registry editor,\nfor administrative user.\n\n323\n00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:24.255\nNow, to make sure it's not smoke and\nmirrors and a whole bunch of magic tricks\n\n324\n00:17:24.255 --> 00:17:27.575\nover here, we've got a local\nnon-administrative account.\n\n325\n00:17:27.575 --> 00:17:31.295\nLet's test that out real quick.\n\n326\n00:17:31.295 --> 00:17:35.748\nAnd I'll go up here and\njust do a switch user real quick.\n\n327\n00:17:37.998 --> 00:17:39.831\nAnd we'll do other user here.\n\n328\n00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:43.581\nAnd let me make sure\nI'm logging in locally.\n\n329\n00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:44.081\nBilly.\n\n330\n00:17:45.917 --> 00:17:48.410\nAnd we'll type in the password.\n\n331\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.400\n>> Yeah, poor Billy.\n\n332\n00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.660\n>> Oh, yeah, here we go again with Billy.\n\n333\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.220\nBilly just doesn't get a break.\n\n334\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:54.958\nAnd now we're gonna make sure.\n\n335\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.380\nHopefully, I don't have him in\nthe administrative account,\n\n336\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.312\nbecause this would look\nthe same as the other one.\n\n337\n00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.010\n[LAUGH] So, we'll go ahead.\n\n338\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.711\n>> That's because it applies\nto the administrator's group.\n\n339\n00:18:03.711 --> 00:18:07.872\nIf you're there, and you're an\nadministrator, you're gonna get that set\n\n340\n00:18:07.872 --> 00:18:11.660\nof GPO's, and if you're not, then,\nyou're gonna use the others.\n\n341\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.400\n>> That's exactly it, and so\nit's going by the group here.\n\n342\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.340\nIt's not going by a user specific GPO,\n\n343\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.860\nso what you see here is,\nBilly is a non administrator.\n\n344\n00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.940\nAgain, standard user,\ndoesn't have access to the registry.\n\n345\n00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.460\nSo, when it comes to this setting,\n\n346\n00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.370\nthe settings themselves are in\nplace the way we want them.\n\n347\n00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.480\n>> That's right.\nNow, Wes, when it comes to, obviously,\n\n348\n00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.050\nwe can create quite a few group\npolicy objects in there, and\n\n349\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.890\nthat seems to me like it\nmight get a little confusing.\n\n350\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.180\nIt could get a little, well,\nis this in the right order?\n\n351\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.580\nHow do I make sure this is going to get\napplied, and this doesn't trump that.\n\n352\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.730\nIs there some sort of way in which the\ngroup policy management system itself can\n\n353\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.190\ntell, and it has an order of operations?\n\n354\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.740\n>> Certainly is.\n\n355\n00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.320\nFor you guys out there that are familiar\nwith domain policies, right?\n\n356\n00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.980\nWe talked about the local policy,\nthe site policy, domain,\n\n357\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.910\nand the organization unit,\nas being the processing order, and\n\n358\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.890\nobviously, the OU being the last one,\nor even a nested OU.\n\n359\n00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.030\nThe last one that processes has\nthe highest precedence, which means,\n\n360\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:12.790\nif there's conflicting settings, that\nlast one that applied is gonna be the one\n\n361\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.960\nthat trumps, and gonna be what we call the\nresultant set of policy, the GP result,\n\n362\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.030\ngroup policy result.\n\n363\n00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.890\nNow, it really,\nisn't different here in the local GPOs,\n\n364\n00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.589\neven though we're not talking\nabout a domain environment.\n\n365\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.750\nWe have three different types of policies,\nand there's also a processing order here.\n\n366\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.590\nThe first one is that very first\npolicy that we configured,\n\n367\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.980\nthe Local Group Policy.\n\n368\n00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.530\nJust one where we don't have\nmultiple GPO's, and we've got users,\n\n369\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.060\nand computers defined\nall in the same policy.\n\n370\n00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.410\nThat's technically,\ncalled the Local Group Policy.\n\n371\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.450\nAnd it's going to apply first.\n\n372\n00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.520\nSo, you can say that it has the lowest\nprecedence value, because then,\n\n373\n00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.140\nthe administrator, and non administrator\nGPOs' are gonna apply after that.\n\n374\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.920\nSo, if I happen to have defined the same\nsetting in a conflicting manner between\n\n375\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.390\nthe local GPO, and the administrator,\nor non administrator GPO,\n\n376\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.540\nbecause those non, and administrator GPO's\napply second in the processing order,\n\n377\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.390\nthey're gonna be the ones\nthat trump out over all.\n\n378\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:13.750\nThe last one,\nthis is where we're really rifling down\n\n379\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:18.470\nto single entity, or identity, and that's\nsomething called user specific local GPO.\n\n380\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.000\nSo, we have three different types\nof GPO's, we've got the local GPO,\n\n381\n00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.040\ngroup based GPO's which is again, standard\nadministrators, and we have user specific.\n\n382\n00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:31.410\nSo now, let's say that maybe I\nwasn't configuring this GPO's,\n\n383\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:36.260\nand I didn't having my spectacles\non that day, and I've got\n\n384\n00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.550\na conflicting setting somewhere in\nthe administrators, or non-administrators.\n\n385\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.935\nLet's say that would be more\nof a valid point there.\n\n386\n00:20:42.935 --> 00:20:46.076\nNon-administrators, and the,n a\nuser-specific one that's applying to this\n\n387\n00:20:46.076 --> 00:20:47.770\nuser account, and they're conflicting.\n\n388\n00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.490\nBecause the user-specific account applies\nthe last, it has the highest precedence.\n\n389\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.990\nAnd it's going to be\nthe one that wins out.\n\n390\n00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.190\n>> Okay.\n>> Alright.\n\n391\n00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.390\nSo, the next thing that you have to\nreally look at is, when settings.\n\n392\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.860\nIf you want to figure out what settings\nare currently applying to the user\n\n393\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.070\nthat's logged in,\nwe've got a pretty good utility.\n\n394\n00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.050\nThis utility is something\nknown as GPResult.\n\n395\n00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:17.480\nNow, a couple of things that I wanna\nshow you on this, and kinda define here.\n\n396\n00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.504\nIf I was to run a command prompt,\nand I'm gonna start by running\n\n397\n00:21:21.504 --> 00:21:26.766\na non-administrative command prompt first.\n\n398\n00:21:26.766 --> 00:21:30.020\nAlright, if I wanna know what\nsetting is currently applying.\n\n399\n00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.550\nI can type GPResult.\n\n400\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.280\nAnd that is plural,\ncuz we're thinking of results.\n\n401\n00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.460\nThere could be multiple results,\nbut it is singular, gpresult.\n\n402\n00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:44.120\nAnd I can do a space, /r, and\nthat's short for something known.\n\n403\n00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.055\nHere's another acronym, RSoP,\nresultant set of policies.\n\n404\n00:21:48.055 --> 00:21:48.815\nWhat does it mean?\n\n405\n00:21:48.815 --> 00:21:52.215\nIt means, we wanna find out, when you turn\nall the cards up, and show everybody,\n\n406\n00:21:52.215 --> 00:21:54.255\nwe wanna find out what is applying,\nGPResult says,\n\n407\n00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:57.275\nyou're gonna get\nthe resultant set of policy.\n\n408\n00:21:57.275 --> 00:22:01.205\n>> And when I run this, it's gonna\nget the security identifiers, and\n\n409\n00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:05.475\nall the groups that I might be a part of,\nand it's gonna sit here,\n\n410\n00:22:05.475 --> 00:22:08.820\nand it's gonna output the results,\nso this will be very helpful,\n\n411\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.670\nlike if you make a setting change,\nand it applies to a group policy,\n\n412\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.430\nit doesn't seem to be working the way\nyou think that it should work.\n\n413\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:19.080\nYou can check this resultant set of policy\nand see where, maybe, it's going wrong.\n\n414\n00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.630\n>> Most definitely, most definitely.\n\n415\n00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.040\nIf you look at some of\nthe information that's in here,\n\n416\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.880\nnotice there's that term, RSoP.\n\n417\n00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.440\nAgain, don't let that term confuse you.\n\n418\n00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.560\nit's Resultant Set of Policy.\n\n419\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.750\nIt just means, I wanna know,\nwhat's applying to the machine.\n\n420\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.100\nAt the end of the day,\nwhat are we left with?\n\n421\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.220\nAnd then, I can see information\nabout the OS here, which for\n\n422\n00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.610\nnow, we don't really worry about that.\n\n423\n00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.100\nAnd notice that it says\napplied group policy objects.\n\n424\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.290\nAlrght?\n\n425\n00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:48.400\nAnd it also shows you that you have\na local group policy\\administrators.\n\n426\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.330\nThis right here, is a tell tale sign\nthat you've got a multiple GPO applying.\n\n427\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.270\nWhy?\n\n428\n00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.110\nBecause it doesn't say local\ngroup policy object, by itself.\n\n429\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.370\nItself, alright?\n\n430\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:05.340\nSo, this is a multi GPO, and notice that\nit does say, well, it's right there.\n\n431\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.230\nYou can see what it would look\nlike if it was just a local GPO.\n\n432\n00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:14.090\nNow, it also takes and gathers all the\nsecurity identifiers, and just basically,\n\n433\n00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:15.800\nidentifying all of them,\nmyself, first, and then,\n\n434\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.840\nall the groups that I'm a part of,\nbecause again, remember,\n\n435\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.150\nwe could have applied this to more than\none group, standard, non standard users.\n\n436\n00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.670\nAlright.\n\n437\n00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.870\nNow, there is something\nthat's missing in this list.\n\n438\n00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:31.620\nNotice that one of the things that\nwe have here is user settings.\n\n439\n00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.350\nThat's because a non-administrative\ncommand prompt doesn't show you what\n\n440\n00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.910\nthe computer configuration is.\n\n441\n00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:42.289\nSo, if we turn around, and we run this\nfrom an administrative command prompt.\n\n442\n00:23:44.482 --> 00:23:46.026\nDo our Ctrl-Shift-Enter here.\n\n443\n00:23:46.026 --> 00:23:48.140\nThat'll elevate it without\nhaving to right click.\n\n444\n00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.420\nClick on it.\n\n445\n00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.820\nAnd I do a gpresult /r,\nso do the same thing.\n\n446\n00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.350\nIt doesn't look any different.\n\n447\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:59.390\nAnd you might see a lot\nmore output on that one.\n\n448\n00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:06.110\nTook a little while to get to\nthe bottom for that one, huh?\n\n449\n00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:11.050\nAnd if I scroll back up,\nnotice that we've got some, oh, man,\n\n450\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.340\nall kinds of information, right?\n\n451\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.870\nRight?\nAnd it talks about services\n\n452\n00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.300\nthat are running on this machine,\nand this one's interesting, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.800\nI want you guys to pay attention to this.\n\n454\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.380\nWe got a default domain policy applying.\n\n455\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.490\nI don't want you to worry\nabout that right now,\n\n456\n00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.130\nbecause I've logged in as a local user,\nbut it still affects the computer.\n\n457\n00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.850\nAlright?\nAnd we'll talk\n\n458\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.100\nabout that domain based GPO here and\nsome of the benefits to that, but\n\n459\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.750\nnotice that there isn't\nany user specifics.\n\n460\n00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.790\nOr there aren't, excuse me,\nany user specifics.\n\n461\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.740\nIt just says there's local group policy,\nand I can see,\n\n462\n00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.310\nwhat is being applied\nto this machine here.\n\n463\n00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.680\nNow, this information\nmight look a little basic.\n\n464\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.910\nIt might not be as easy to read,\nbut if you're\n\n465\n00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.770\nrunning an administrative command prompt,\nhere's another cool thing that you can do.\n\n466\n00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.540\nThis is available in your server\noperating system, but what's cool is,\n\n467\n00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.460\nit's kinda tucked away in even\nthe client operating systems.\n\n468\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.560\nThey just, by default,\ndon't give you a web interface.\n\n469\n00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.150\nSpace to see this with.\n\n470\n00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.780\nAnd you're gonna have to be a local\nadmin to do this type of GPResult.\n\n471\n00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.000\nI can do a gpresult /h and then,\nI can name a document here.\n\n472\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.930\nAnd I call it results, if I wanted, .htm.\n\n473\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.830\nNotice the htm extension there.\n\n474\n00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.700\nThat's hypertext markup language.\n\n475\n00:25:23.964 --> 00:25:25.438\nOh, the file already exists, okay.\n\n476\n00:25:25.438 --> 00:25:27.805\nLooks like I've done that before,\ncuz I've checked it out.\n\n477\n00:25:27.805 --> 00:25:30.700\nSo.\nThat's right so we'll call it very good.\n\n478\n00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.070\nWe'll do exactly what Dan said.\n\n479\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:36.230\nWe'll call that results2, and now, it's\ngoing to output this, now what it's doing,\n\n480\n00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.960\nand I really love this feature.\n\n481\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.950\nIs it says,\nyou want an easier way to see that?\n\n482\n00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:44.960\nWe'll take all this information, we'll\nconvert it into html, and we'll put it\n\n483\n00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.980\nright in a document of your choosing\nwherever you've chosen to store this.\n\n484\n00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.700\nAnd now, if I open my file explorer.\n\n485\n00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.920\nYou go to this PC...\nThe local disk so you can\n\n486\n00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.430\nsee a couple of them I must of run this\nearlier testing it out too, and lets see.\n\n487\n00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.760\nThere we go.\n\n488\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.560\nAnd it's interesting I got\nan error detected, and\n\n489\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.150\nI would bet you that its probably,\nthat domain GPO processing, but\n\n490\n00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:13.520\nif you want to look, one of the things I\nlike here is that you can hide all this.\n\n491\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.010\nSo, maybe I'm not looking for\n\n492\n00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.080\ncomputer details, I don't really\ncare about computer details.\n\n493\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.300\nBut you'd still have to be\nthe administrative user, so\n\n494\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.620\nif you are an administrative user,\n\n495\n00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.400\nit's still gonna give you the computer\ndetails whether you want them or not.\n\n496\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.810\nThe good thing about this is,\nif that's not what you're worried about,\n\n497\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.290\nyou can always hide that stuff, or if I'm\nnot, just by the opposites, that, too.\n\n498\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.170\nIf I'm only worried about user settings,\n\n499\n00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.090\nI might choose to hide the user settings,\nand then, show the computer details,\n\n500\n00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.680\nand it shows you,\nright exactly what polices are applying.\n\n501\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.090\nIf I look all the way down\nhere to Security Settings,\n\n502\n00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:51.170\nI can see in the background that even\nthough it's not applying to this account,\n\n503\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.630\nwhich is the local account, that next time\nat domain user logs, and to this machine,\n\n504\n00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.270\nit's gonna apply their domain based GPO.\n\n505\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.500\nAnd that's one of the things, one of the\nthings I also wanna mention is that, yes,\n\n506\n00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.600\nyou do benefit from a domain based GPO.\n\n507\n00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.030\nAnd I like to switch over in\nmy server here real quick.\n\n508\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:13.926\nAnd with the server, when you issue\nthese in a domain environment,\n\n509\n00:27:13.926 --> 00:27:16.400\nlittle bit different.\n\n510\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.440\nOne of the benefits I get is that I could\ncome in here, I can go to my group policy\n\n511\n00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.090\nmanagement console, and we've got plenty\nof episodes on exactly how to run this.\n\n512\n00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:30.590\nBut I can set a GPO right here, and\nnow, it affects multiple machines,\n\n513\n00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.180\nand that's one of the big differences.\n\n514\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.690\nThe flexibility of a group policy\nwithin a domain is that Dan,\n\n515\n00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.770\nmyself, we can set a single GPO, and\nwe can apply it to every computer or user,\n\n516\n00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.950\nif we choose to, in the entire domain.\n\n517\n00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.990\nAnd we set it once.\n\n518\n00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.690\nWe don't have to sneaker net from\ncomputer to computer to computer,\n\n519\n00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:53.090\nmaking sure that those are set right,\nbecause the more times you configure\n\n520\n00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:58.280\nsomething, the greater the chance\nyou have for a misconfiguration.\n\n521\n00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.230\nInformation.\n\n522\n00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.560\nSo, in a workgroup, decentralized\nenvironment, your sneaker net,\n\n523\n00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.530\nyour domain environment makes it a little\nbit easier to implement one GPO,\n\n524\n00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.610\npush it out, and\nit affects multiple end users.\n\n525\n00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.070\n>> Yeah, and the good news is, if you're\nhaving to do that sneaker net, cuz you're\n\n526\n00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:14.370\na smaller network, it's probably small\nenough that it's not that big of a deal.\n\n527\n00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.020\nYou've probably, got five computers\non your network or something.\n\n528\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.280\nIt's not the hundreds, and or thousands\nthat could be in a large corporate\n\n529\n00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.220\nenvironment, which makes\nthat completely impractical.\n\n530\n00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.630\nYou would, by necessity, need to go\nto an active directory domain, and\n\n531\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.220\ndo it that way.\n\n532\n00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.750\nIt just would be impossible task.\n\n533\n00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.880\n>> Yeah, and\nyou get the centralized database too,\n\n534\n00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.000\nbecause every computer, or\nworkgroup maintains its own resources, so\n\n535\n00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.640\nthe decentralization can\nstart to become a nightmare.\n\n536\n00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.950\nBut if you don't have\nthat big infrastructure,\n\n537\n00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.410\nat least you got your local group policy,\nand you'll be good to go.\n\n538\n00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.030\n>> Awesome stuff, Wes.\n\n539\n00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.500\nThank you so much for\nthese demonstrations,\n\n540\n00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:52.310\nhow we can use The local group policy to\nsecure up our operating system, our local\n\n541\n00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.700\nmachines, make sure we keep it on lock\ndown, tightened up as it's suppose to be.\n\n542\n00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.890\nIs there anything else we need to\ngo over before we close the show?\n\n543\n00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.900\n>> No, I think that's got it.\n\n544\n00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.980\nJust be careful you don't have\nconflicting settings, and\n\n545\n00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.640\nremember your processing orders.\n\n546\n00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.312\nAnd you'll be good.\n\n547\n00:29:04.312 --> 00:29:07.609\n>> Alright, wise words, and hopefully,\nwe'll see you in the next episode.\n\n548\n00:29:07.609 --> 00:29:09.409\nAs for this one, we're gonna go ahead,\nand close it down.\n\n549\n00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:10.349\nThanks for watching.\n\n550\n00:29:10.349 --> 00:29:11.730\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n551\n00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:12.903\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n552\n00:29:12.903 --> 00:29:13.902\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n553\n00:29:13.902 --> 00:29:19.140\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

everyone.\n\n4\n00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:16.481\nWelcome to an other exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:20.883\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\ntoday's topic is Windows 10 security.\n\n6\n00:00:20.883 --> 00:00:24.542\nThis time we're moving into\nthe Internet browser security, and\n\n7\n00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:28.416\nprobably gonna be talking about some\nIE if that doesn't [INAUDIBLE].\n\n8\n00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.988\nAnd Windows 10 also has\nthat new Edge browser.\n\n9\n00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:34.549\nLending his skills with us today\nis none other than Mr. Wes Bryant.\n\n10\n00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:35.651\nHow's it going today, Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:40.302\n>> Man it's going great it's good to be\nhere, great to see everybody out there and\n\n12\n00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:44.190\nI tell you, one of the things we're\ngonna be talking about today,\n\n13\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.497\nwell good old Internet Explorer, IE.\n\n14\n00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:50.329\nNow one of the reasons that we're talking\nabout the Internet Explorer browser,\n\n15\n00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.385\nyou might have your favorite out there,\nmaybe you don't use Internet Explorer, but\n\n16\n00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:58.157\nit is gonna be something that you might\nfind commonly supported in an enterprise\n\n17\n00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.650\nenvironment or\nmaybe in your Soho environments.\n\n18\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.610\nIt's just due to the fact\nthat it's built into Windows.\n\n19\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.704\nBecause of that fact we have\nto know a little bit about it.\n\n20\n00:01:06.704 --> 00:01:09.257\nSo we're gonna talk about some\nof the configurations and\n\n21\n00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:12.928\nthen some of the settings that you'll find\nand just where to find those settings so\n\n22\n00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:16.384\nthat you can become a little bit more\nfamiliar when it comes to keeping these,\n\n23\n00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:17.901\nthe browsing a little bit safer.\n\n24\n00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:23.001\nNow, in Internet Explorer today we've\ngot a couple of good features that can\n\n25\n00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:28.652\nhelp really just make sure that programs\nand malicious applications don't just take\n\n26\n00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:33.923\noff running with your computer and pretty\nmuch do whatever it is that they want.\n\n27\n00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:38.851\nSo here on my Windows 10 machine I've\nactually got Internet Explorer loaded up\n\n28\n00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:43.633\nhere, and one of the first things that\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna go over to\n\n29\n00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:47.993\nthis little gear icon, and\nwe're gonna look at the Internet Options.\n\n30\n00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:50.620\nSo we're gonna bring these\nInternet Options up.\n\n31\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.903\nI would get, if you're gonna\nsupport this type of browser\n\n32\n00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:58.529\nI would definitely know these settings\nhere, and know just some of the settings.\n\n33\n00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:03.415\nFirst one here, the General tab is\nwhere you can go to set things like for\n\n34\n00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:09.088\ninstance your homepage, whatever your\nhomepage is that you might want here.\n\n35\n00:02:09.088 --> 00:02:14.780\nI'm constantly browsing the Google search\nengine here, so I just set it to Google.\n\n36\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.184\nSome of the other things that you can do.\n\n37\n00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:22.171\nWell, I can setup how the tabs\nare displayed within the browser.\n\n38\n00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:27.874\nOne of the things that we can also do\nhere is delete our browsing history.\n\n39\n00:02:27.874 --> 00:02:31.417\nNow, when it comes to the browsing\nhistory keep in mind that you'll by\n\n40\n00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.782\ndefault there are certain things\nthat are gonna be stored inside of\n\n41\n00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:38.206\nthe browser that maybe might be\ninformation that can be exploited,\n\n42\n00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:42.600\nmight be information that maybe if\nyou're visiting a company intranet site.\n\n43\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.496\nMaybe the web browser's storing\nsome of that information, and\n\n44\n00:02:45.496 --> 00:02:47.747\nwhen it comes to your\nbrowsing history it's not so\n\n45\n00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:51.390\nmuch about covering your tracks or your\nbrowsing, it's more of making sure that\n\n46\n00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.581\nsomebody isn't gathering your data and\nscraping that information.\n\n47\n00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:56.836\n>> Yeah, Wes,\nthis is definitely one of the more,\n\n48\n00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:59.538\npeople understand they have\na browsing history usually.\n\n49\n00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:02.963\nBut they don't understand what goes\ninto the browsing history area of\n\n50\n00:03:02.963 --> 00:03:04.364\nInternet Explorer itself.\n\n51\n00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:07.123\nSo they don't know, should I delete this,\n\n52\n00:03:07.123 --> 00:03:11.973\nobviously there are reasons that people\ndelete their browsing history, and\n\n53\n00:03:11.973 --> 00:03:15.192\nwe will not broach that\ntopic at this point in time.\n\n54\n00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:19.021\nBut there are, you might need to actually\ndelete your browsing history for\n\n55\n00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:22.606\nlegitimate reasons, and one of these\nthings is because of the way they\n\n56\n00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:24.827\ntrack you as you follow through websites.\n\n57\n00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:27.476\nAnd this can become a real security risk,\nright?\n\n58\n00:03:27.476 --> 00:03:28.840\n>> It really is too.\n\n59\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.014\nAs you browse through different websites\nthat you store things like session data.\n\n60\n00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:38.435\nWe call them cookies a lot, because\nremember, when it comes to HTTP and\n\n61\n00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:43.076\ntalking to a web server, web servers\nsuffer from some pretty bad amnesia,\n\n62\n00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:43.610\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.663\nIf I've spent the last two hours\non this web server and it doesn't\n\n64\n00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:50.324\nuse session cookies then when I log off of\nthis server then I log back on it says,\n\n65\n00:03:50.324 --> 00:03:53.239\nwell who are you, even though\nyou just spent two hours there.\n\n66\n00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.352\nSo, there's pros to this,\nand there's constant,\n\n67\n00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:59.270\nit's one of the pros is\nthat it makes it easier.\n\n68\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.219\nYou don't have to log back in.\n\n69\n00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.130\nThe problem is that information is being\nstored there through those cookies and\n\n70\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.804\nstuff, and then they can turn around and\nthey can track that information,\n\n71\n00:04:08.804 --> 00:04:10.280\nthey can track as you browse.\n\n72\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.823\nSo let's go ahead and check out\ndeleting the browsing history here.\n\n73\n00:04:13.823 --> 00:04:16.930\nAgain, these are the defaults\nthat you see.\n\n74\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.641\nI haven't modified anything yet, and\nit's good just to see what's being\n\n75\n00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.943\nkept by default and\nseeing if you wanna change that.\n\n76\n00:04:24.943 --> 00:04:26.906\nYou'll notice right up here at the top,\n\n77\n00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:30.545\nif I've got any favorites that are within\nthis browser by default it says,\n\n78\n00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:34.451\nwell these are your favorites, let's\ngo ahead and save all that information.\n\n79\n00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:38.961\nSo there again maybe you've bookmarked for\ninstance the company intranet site, right?\n\n80\n00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:42.312\nAnd the company intranet site is gonna be\njust available to the internal employees.\n\n81\n00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:46.227\nYou don't want that information\npotentially being exposed to the world.\n\n82\n00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:50.427\nSo you also have to keep that in mind too,\ntemporary Internet files too and\n\n83\n00:04:50.427 --> 00:04:51.727\nvarious other files.\n\n84\n00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:54.385\nNotice the temporary Internet files and\nwebsite files.\n\n85\n00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:58.777\nNotice that when we say, preserve their\nfavorite website data it's also saying,\n\n86\n00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:01.725\nwell not only the things that\nare in your favorites, but\n\n87\n00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:05.993\npretty much every website you browse we're\ngonna put a little container here and\n\n88\n00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:07.769\nwe're just gonna hold all that.\n\n89\n00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:11.740\nYou can see those cookies,\nwebsite data, and the history.\n\n90\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.164\nSome of the other things here that\nare not deleted by default, and\n\n91\n00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:16.794\nthis is a big one is passwords.\n\n92\n00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:20.937\nPasswords you wanna make sure that,\nbe careful, a lot of us,\n\n93\n00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:24.858\nand I can't say anything,\nI do this too from time to time.\n\n94\n00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:29.192\nYou have that remember me option,\nor keep me logged in.\n\n95\n00:05:29.192 --> 00:05:33.646\nWell guess what, if you put that check\nmark in there then your credential\n\n96\n00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:37.373\ninformation is now being stored\ninside of this browser, and\n\n97\n00:05:37.373 --> 00:05:40.535\nthat could be potentially exploited or\nattacked.\n\n98\n00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:44.568\nYou know, a hacker can do a man in the\nmiddle attack and potentially grab that\n\n99\n00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:48.492\ninformation and do a replay attack,\nmaybe replay it to the server later.\n\n100\n00:05:48.492 --> 00:05:51.488\nAnd unfortunately now\nthey've got your information,\n\n101\n00:05:51.488 --> 00:05:55.247\nthey've logged in as you and\nthere's really no way for the end point or\n\n102\n00:05:55.247 --> 00:05:58.707\nthe server that you're logging\nonto to tell that it's not you.\n\n103\n00:05:58.707 --> 00:06:02.287\nRemember that if I've got your\ncredentials, I don't need to be you.\n\n104\n00:06:02.287 --> 00:06:06.140\nCuz the authenticating body doesn't\neven know that that's happening.\n\n105\n00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.318\n>> That's why it's a very\npopular form of attack, right?\n\n106\n00:06:08.318 --> 00:06:12.140\nI can just get your credentials\nfrom some of these means.\n\n107\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.051\nYou gotta remember,\n\n108\n00:06:13.051 --> 00:06:15.793\na lot of this stuff is meant to\nmake our lives a little bit easier.\n\n109\n00:06:15.793 --> 00:06:20.028\nWe don't have to remember so\nmany passwords, and that's where it starts\n\n110\n00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:24.537\ngetting, the security goes down because\nthey're trying to make it easier for\n\n111\n00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:28.670\nyou to get inside of these websites\nthat you're commonly perusing to.\n\n112\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.991\nBut, if they're storing in a file that's\nnot using the encryption type that is\n\n113\n00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:34.868\na strong [INAUDIBLE] things like\nauthentication methods through like\n\n114\n00:06:34.868 --> 00:06:36.372\n[INAUDIBLE] or something like that.\n\n115\n00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:38.542\nThese are authentication servers.\n\n116\n00:06:38.542 --> 00:06:41.160\nYour browser's just gonna go,\nwell I'm just gonna store this and\n\n117\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.913\nkeep it over here.\n\n118\n00:06:41.913 --> 00:06:43.752\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You might wanna see,\n\n119\n00:06:43.752 --> 00:06:45.820\nyou could probably see the danger in that.\n\n120\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.922\n>> Yeah, for sure.\n\n121\n00:06:46.922 --> 00:06:49.920\nYou know, there's some of the other\nsettings that you see here are, for\n\n122\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.060\ninstance, notice Tracking protection and\nActiveX filtering.\n\n123\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.316\nKeep in mind any of that information,\n\n124\n00:06:55.316 --> 00:06:59.405\nit could be collecting data not just\nmaybe from that one web site, but\n\n125\n00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:02.945\nas you go to another website\nit collects that information.\n\n126\n00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:07.254\nAnd then whoever's got that tracking\ncookie on your machine can now share that\n\n127\n00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:10.779\ninformation with other parties\nthat are collecting it maybe for\n\n128\n00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:12.164\ntheir own advertising.\n\n129\n00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:16.312\nAnd then the next thing you know you're\ngetting emails in your inbox And stuff.\n\n130\n00:07:16.312 --> 00:07:20.763\nAnd you're like well, I've never\npurchased something or other, and\n\n131\n00:07:20.763 --> 00:07:23.593\nnow you get all these\nspam in your inbox here.\n\n132\n00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:27.451\nForm data is here as well too, so if we\nwanted to modify this a little bit and\n\n133\n00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:30.377\nwe wanted to let's say make\nit a little bit more secure,\n\n134\n00:07:30.377 --> 00:07:32.389\nI can actually say clear everything.\n\n135\n00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:36.467\nNow I say that, they call it PC for\na reason, they call it personal computing\n\n136\n00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:39.235\nfor a reason,\nthis might not be what you want to do.\n\n137\n00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:44.465\nTypically when I configure this, I uncheck\nthat preserve the favorites website data.\n\n138\n00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:48.195\nNow I put check marks down here on the\nwhole thing or every single check mark.\n\n139\n00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:51.018\nNow I turn around and\nI use like password manage, so\n\n140\n00:07:51.018 --> 00:07:53.852\nI don't really need this\nbrowser to do that for me.\n\n141\n00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:57.378\nAnd that might be an option for you out\nthere if you use some kind of centralized\n\n142\n00:07:57.378 --> 00:08:01.408\npassword manager where you don't need that\ninformation stored in the browser itself.\n\n143\n00:08:01.408 --> 00:08:02.920\n>> I use a password manage.\n\n144\n00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.894\n>> Yeah, I do too.\n\n145\n00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:04.686\n>> It's called my brain.\n\n146\n00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:05.868\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, I was gonna say I use\n\n147\n00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:09.750\na password manager because I'd forget my\nhead if it wasn't attached to my neck.\n\n148\n00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.867\n[LAUGH] A little different concept.\n\n149\n00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:12.077\n>> I totally get it, right?\n\n150\n00:08:12.077 --> 00:08:14.470\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's a lot of websites that don't\n\n151\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.160\nhave a common, right, with this password\non this website they require it to be 16\n\n152\n00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.701\ncharacters long, right?\n\n153\n00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:21.616\nThey're super secure.\n\n154\n00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:23.534\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then you go to this website and\n\n155\n00:08:23.534 --> 00:08:27.655\nthey won't let you do anymore than 12, so\nyou end up having multiple passwords and\n\n156\n00:08:27.655 --> 00:08:28.980\nthat can be difficult.\n\n157\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:34.100\nPassword managers have been kind of the\nsavior as it were when it comes to that,\n\n158\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.580\nthey are a good thing.\n\n159\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.701\nI just try to create a password\nthat works with everything.\n\n160\n00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:39.117\n>> [LAUGH] There you go, there you go.\n\n161\n00:08:39.117 --> 00:08:41.409\n>> I try to out think the problem.\n\n162\n00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.784\n>> And now Dan has to go change\nthe password on his luggage.\n\n163\n00:08:43.784 --> 00:08:47.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] 12345 isn't secure?\n\n164\n00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.810\n>> That's not secure, that's for sure.\n\n165\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.320\nThe other thing that you can do too with\nthis same setting is just a little check\n\n166\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.770\nmark, and it's easy to configure, but\nit's also easy to well, overlook as well.\n\n167\n00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.280\nThat is the delete browsing\nhistory on exit, and\n\n168\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.880\nI also go that far to do this too.\n\n169\n00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.580\nI say, I don't wanna have to come in here\nand manually delete this every time,\n\n170\n00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.190\nif I'm using Internet Explorer I can say\ndelete here, and let me go ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.060\napply these settings too so\nthat I don't have to reset them again.\n\n172\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.601\n>> Now Wes, does this mess with things,\n\n173\n00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:17.409\nbecause this is where they keep\nthe session cookies as well, right?\n\n174\n00:09:17.409 --> 00:09:18.713\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So if you're logged\n\n175\n00:09:18.713 --> 00:09:22.405\ninto some website that requires\nauthentication, it creates a cookie and\n\n176\n00:09:22.405 --> 00:09:25.797\nputs all that information and\nsays, okay, you're logged in, and\n\n177\n00:09:25.797 --> 00:09:30.200\nthat session should be encrypted\nhopefully, that's how it should work.\n\n178\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.450\nBut if you delete it and\nthe next time you open your browser,\n\n179\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.076\nyou're gonna have to log back in, right?\n\n180\n00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:34.701\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n181\n00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:38.600\n>> It's a little annoying,\nbut it's more secure.\n\n182\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.577\n>> It can be, it can be.\n\n183\n00:09:40.577 --> 00:09:44.324\nSomebody mentioned in our chat room how\none of the major security gurus out\n\n184\n00:09:44.324 --> 00:09:48.011\nthere mentioned that the ease of use\nis always the enemy of security, and\n\n185\n00:09:48.011 --> 00:09:51.951\nit certainly is cuz we wanna make things\navailable, it's part of security.\n\n186\n00:09:51.951 --> 00:09:54.926\nAgain, we wanna make things,\nlike authorized users,\n\n187\n00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:59.230\nwe wanna have availability to resources,\nand we wanna make it transparent, and\n\n188\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.525\nunfortunately [LAUGH] sometimes\nthat transparency also means\n\n189\n00:10:02.525 --> 00:10:06.180\ntransparent attacks as well,\nthings that you don't really see.\n\n190\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.390\nAnd so I went ahead and\nI deleted the browsing history, and\n\n191\n00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.430\nI go ahead and apply the settings though,\nand you can see\n\n192\n00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.160\nthat when it comes back up obviously it\nblinds settings, they don't go away here.\n\n193\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.781\nNow let me go ahead and\nclose this down here real quick,\n\n194\n00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:23.738\nand want to close the web browser down and\na lot of times what you'll see is,\n\n195\n00:10:23.738 --> 00:10:28.459\nI always call it the spinning cheerio\nthere, and when you open it back up\n\n196\n00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:33.367\nyou don't have to worry about that\ninformation still remaining behind.\n\n197\n00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:38.233\nBut like Dan said, yes unfortunately, ease\nof use, it's gonna lower the ease of use\n\n198\n00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:42.085\na little bit, but I would say how\nhard is it to type the password, but\n\n199\n00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:46.159\nif you guys have ever seen me type\nsometimes, I can't type a password.\n\n200\n00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:49.307\nSo, it might be very difficult for\nsomebody like me, [LAUGH] so\n\n201\n00:10:49.307 --> 00:10:50.284\nkeep that in mind.\n\n202\n00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:56.068\n[LAUGH] Now, we've got another tab here\nthat you should be familiar with as well,\n\n203\n00:10:56.068 --> 00:10:58.024\nand from the security tab,\n\n204\n00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:03.658\nInternet Explorer breaks up the different\nwebsites that you view into zones.\n\n205\n00:11:03.658 --> 00:11:07.658\nNow, If you don't modify these zones\nby default, most of your, all of your\n\n206\n00:11:07.658 --> 00:11:11.846\nInternet websites are gonna fall under\nwhat's known as the Internet Zone, and\n\n207\n00:11:11.846 --> 00:11:15.115\nit's got a global suite of\nconfigurations that it does here.\n\n208\n00:11:15.115 --> 00:11:18.755\nAnd you can see Medium-High,\nI've got a little slider bar,\n\n209\n00:11:18.755 --> 00:11:23.034\nif I wanted to slide that up there then\nthings like ActiveX might not run.\n\n210\n00:11:23.034 --> 00:11:25.266\nIt pays attention to keywords and stuff,\n\n211\n00:11:25.266 --> 00:11:28.966\nthings that are considered maybe\ninappropriate won't render, but\n\n212\n00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:33.301\nyou have to be careful cuz remember,\non availability, if you set these settings\n\n213\n00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:37.319\na little bit too strict then sometimes\nit can cause compatibility issues,\n\n214\n00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:40.670\nresource access problems, so\njust be careful with this one.\n\n215\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.000\nAnd if we look right here there's\nsomething known as Protected Mode.\n\n216\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000\nNow Protected Mode is something\nthat's set on a zone by zone, or\n\n217\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.170\nper zone setting as they call it if\nyou go out to TechNet you'll read it,\n\n218\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.452\nthey call it per zone setting.\n\n219\n00:11:53.452 --> 00:11:59.150\nThe Protected Mode, what this does is\nthis says that any kind of application\n\n220\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:04.867\nthat wants to run, wants to execute,\nyou're gonna get a warning about it.\n\n221\n00:12:04.867 --> 00:12:08.096\nIf it is one that tries to\nmake modifications to your, or\n\n222\n00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:11.878\nattempts to I should say,\nmake modifications to your computer,\n\n223\n00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:14.620\nthen it's gonna warn\nyou about that as well.\n\n224\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.230\nSo Protected Mode is something I think\nthis goes back as far as Internet Explorer\n\n225\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.100\n7, and back in the days of Vista, I think\nthat was the first time you'd seen it.\n\n226\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.343\nBut Protected Mode is\na good thing to have on,\n\n227\n00:12:25.343 --> 00:12:27.534\nyou can see here it's\nturned on by default.\n\n228\n00:12:27.534 --> 00:12:31.323\nIf you disable it you're gonna have to\nrestart your browser, but I can tell you I\n\n229\n00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:35.080\nwouldn't recommend disabling this\nbecause out of sight, out of mind.\n\n230\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.403\nYou're not aware of an attack, you're not\naware of an application trying to take\n\n231\n00:12:39.403 --> 00:12:42.349\nsome kind of administrative\naccess to the registry, or\n\n232\n00:12:42.349 --> 00:12:44.116\nmodifications to system files.\n\n233\n00:12:44.116 --> 00:12:48.346\nIf you're not aware that it's happening,\nthen again like we say, that proverbial\n\n234\n00:12:48.346 --> 00:12:51.992\nsaying, out of sight, out of mind,\nso I would definitely keep this on.\n\n235\n00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:56.642\nNow the other thing that you can do too\nis you can set custom zone settings,\n\n236\n00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:57.720\nall right?\n\n237\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.624\nAnd that is literally\ndefining on an individual and\n\n238\n00:13:01.624 --> 00:13:05.451\ngranular basis on what can\nhappen in the browser.\n\n239\n00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.684\nYou can see for instance,\nI believe about halfway down this,\n\n240\n00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:12.880\nyeah here's just a little bit under\nhalfway down you can see ActiveX controls.\n\n241\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.310\nRemember, your browsers,\n\n242\n00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.076\nall your browsers, you typically can\nhave some kind of add-on that runs.\n\n243\n00:13:18.076 --> 00:13:23.076\nFlash is one of them, ActiveX is another\none out there, Microsoft Silverlight.\n\n244\n00:13:23.076 --> 00:13:25.792\nThese are additional things that\ncan run inside of the browser, and\n\n245\n00:13:25.792 --> 00:13:27.510\nyou might not want that to happen.\n\n246\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.860\nAgain, scriptlets,\nJava scriptlets is another thing.\n\n247\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.150\nMaybe you don't want scriptlets running,\nso you can get very, very granular on\n\n248\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.950\nthere, and I believe your scriptlets\nyou'll see are in this list too.\n\n249\n00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.250\n>> Yeah, Flash and I believe Java as well\nare known for security vulnerabilities.\n\n250\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.970\nIt's been one of the main\nreasons people have become\n\n251\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.480\ninfected with malware of all\ndifferent stripes and varieties,\n\n252\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.870\nis simply because they had Flash installed\nand had a security vulnerability.\n\n253\n00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.780\nThis is a good way for us to say,\n\n254\n00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.595\nhey you know what, I can stop that\nvulnerability by just saying no thank you.\n\n255\n00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:00.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, definitely.\n\n256\n00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.440\nAnother good thing that's built into it\nis this little setting right here that\n\n257\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.340\nkinda goes unnoticed because if you're not\ncustomizing anything, you don't see it,\n\n258\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.390\nwhich is why sometimes the defaults are\nwhere they need to be for a good reason.\n\n259\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.366\nAnd that's the XSS filter.\n\n260\n00:14:15.366 --> 00:14:20.024\nNow guys that's really nothing more than\nan acronym for cross site scripting,\n\n261\n00:14:20.024 --> 00:14:23.847\nand it basically says if there's\na cross site scripting attack,\n\n262\n00:14:23.847 --> 00:14:28.590\nthis is filtering is enabled, it tries to\nneutralize it and stop it in its place.\n\n263\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.396\nThings like anonymous logons,\nyou notice that's the only way that\n\n264\n00:14:33.396 --> 00:14:37.034\nyou can do an automatic\nlogon is the intranet zone.\n\n265\n00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:41.251\nAnd in fact that's where we're going here\nin a second, so we'll talk about what that\n\n266\n00:14:41.251 --> 00:14:44.784\nmeans in your local intranet zone and\nwhy I might automatically log on.\n\n267\n00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:49.947\nAnd you can see the three default levels,\nyou can reset them, almost said\n\n268\n00:14:49.947 --> 00:14:55.201\nrecede them, resent them to the,\nwhatever the factory default might be.\n\n269\n00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:57.697\nWell that brings us into\nthe local intranet zone, and\n\n270\n00:14:57.697 --> 00:14:59.701\nyou'll notice that this is at medium low.\n\n271\n00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:04.294\nThe local intranet zone, understand when\nwe talk about the difference between\n\n272\n00:15:04.294 --> 00:15:07.723\nthe Internet and intranet,\nInternet publicly viewable,\n\n273\n00:15:07.723 --> 00:15:11.600\naccessed by everybody,\nyou guys are on it watching us right now.\n\n274\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.563\nIntranet is a little bit different,\nit's all the same web-based technologies,\n\n275\n00:15:15.563 --> 00:15:17.373\nit's a web server, it's a website,\n\n276\n00:15:17.373 --> 00:15:20.712\nit's a browser, but it's typically\nowned by the internal company,\n\n277\n00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.784\nand that being said, you will\ntypically as well [LAUGH] trust it.\n\n278\n00:15:23.784 --> 00:15:27.261\nSo you'll see that the settings\naren't completely disabled, right,\n\n279\n00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:30.576\nthey're not completely disabled,\nbut they are a little bit lower.\n\n280\n00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:34.373\nAnd like that setting goes back\nwith automatically logging in,\n\n281\n00:15:34.373 --> 00:15:37.888\none of the things that'll happen\nby default is if you don't\n\n282\n00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:40.630\nput a fully qualified\nname in the web browser,\n\n283\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:45.765\nlet's say instead of your web server just\nhappens to be webserve.yourdomain.com,\n\n284\n00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:50.159\nand you just put in HTTP://webserver,\nagain, an unqualified name.\n\n285\n00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:53.663\nIt says, oh,\nwell this isn't a fully qualified URL, so\n\n286\n00:15:53.663 --> 00:15:56.367\nyou must be talking\nabout an intranet site.\n\n287\n00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:58.889\nIf you're in a company domain\nit takes your credentials and\n\n288\n00:15:58.889 --> 00:16:02.167\npasses it right to the web server,\nagain cuz it's a domain based resource and\n\n289\n00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:03.491\nyou don't have to re-login.\n\n290\n00:16:03.491 --> 00:16:06.361\nSo, doesn't have happen\non the intranet zone, but\n\n291\n00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:09.430\ndoes happen in the local intranet zone.\n\n292\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.209\nNow the next thing that we want to\ntalk about is the trusted sites, and\n\n293\n00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:15.243\nyou have to be careful with this one.\n\n294\n00:16:15.243 --> 00:16:18.708\nWith the trusted sites,\njust like the name implies,\n\n295\n00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:21.326\nnotice the level is medium, all right?\n\n296\n00:16:21.326 --> 00:16:24.791\nAnd you might say, well wait a second,\nif I look at the local intranet zone,\n\n297\n00:16:24.791 --> 00:16:28.540\nit's Medium-Low, and this is Medium,\nwell what's going on with that?\n\n298\n00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.701\nWell that's because trusted sites,\nthey're not your local intranet sites.\n\n299\n00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.138\nThese are still sites that\nare out there across the web, and\n\n300\n00:16:35.138 --> 00:16:40.088\nif it's a website that you know you trust,\nand maybe something in the intranet zone,\n\n301\n00:16:40.088 --> 00:16:42.243\nor excuse me, let me get that right.\n\n302\n00:16:42.243 --> 00:16:46.485\nInternet zone is blocking it,\nmaybe you've got some kind of ad and\n\n303\n00:16:46.485 --> 00:16:51.791\nit's not working right, not allowing\nthe website itself to function correctly,\n\n304\n00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:56.787\nthen what you can do is you can add this\nif you trust it to the trusted sites here,\n\n305\n00:16:56.787 --> 00:16:59.440\nand it'll allow the ActiveX controls and\n\n306\n00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.270\nsome of the add-ins to\nwork maybe appropriately.\n\n307\n00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:08.350\nWhen you add something to this website\nby default it requires HTTPS, so\n\n308\n00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.416\nit requires secure web traffic, but-\n>> So this is good for things like your\n\n309\n00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:16.897\nbank, and just other websites that require\nsecure authentication that might have\n\n310\n00:17:16.897 --> 00:17:21.058\nsensitive information on it where if\nyou're blocking this type of traffic or\n\n311\n00:17:21.058 --> 00:17:24.534\ntrying to be more secure,\nit would kinda get caught in that net.\n\n312\n00:17:24.534 --> 00:17:27.743\nAnd we're saying, oh, no, no, we want to\nmake an exception to those as a rule.\n\n313\n00:17:27.743 --> 00:17:29.050\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n314\n00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.344\nNow there's another thing that you've\ngotta keep in mind too is that you\n\n315\n00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:35.534\nmight go to a website that doesn't\nuse HTTPS, but you still trust it.\n\n316\n00:17:35.534 --> 00:17:40.579\nLike for instance maybe going out to a\ngovernment website that you want to go to,\n\n317\n00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:41.370\nmil.gov.\n\n318\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.261\nMaybe even educational sites,\n.edu and stuff like this, and\n\n319\n00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:47.695\nthey're not running HTTPS, but\nyou trust them, you know you trust them,\n\n320\n00:17:47.695 --> 00:17:49.241\nand you wanna enter them in here.\n\n321\n00:17:49.241 --> 00:17:54.170\nSo let's go ahead and let's enter, let's\njust say, and I don't think you can do\n\n322\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.180\nthis anymore, I think all Google\nsites are gonna be HTTPS, yeah.\n\n323\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.480\nBut if we try to enter this,\nit's gonna give us, and\n\n324\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.330\nI'm generating this on purpose here.\n\n325\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.408\nNotice that it says the HTTPS\nprefix has to be there, and\n\n326\n00:18:05.408 --> 00:18:07.451\nthat's only due to this check mark.\n\n327\n00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:10.585\nOnce that's check mark's gone I can\nturn around and I can add this and\n\n328\n00:18:10.585 --> 00:18:11.350\nI'm just fine.\n\n329\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.820\nNow, here's the thing to keep in mind too.\n\n330\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.430\nYou might have an entire domain\nthat you wanna add, all right?\n\n331\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.542\nMaybe I just say theoretically for\neverything here from Google,\n\n332\n00:18:20.542 --> 00:18:21.284\nI wanna trust.\n\n333\n00:18:21.284 --> 00:18:23.591\nI'm not saying you should or\nyou shouldn't do that,\n\n334\n00:18:23.591 --> 00:18:25.701\nbut there's ways that you\ncan do wildcards too.\n\n335\n00:18:25.701 --> 00:18:29.544\nAnd let's see if I can remember how\nto do that, I think that's just * and\n\n336\n00:18:29.544 --> 00:18:30.741\nthen it's .google.\n\n337\n00:18:30.741 --> 00:18:35.326\n>> Oh, right,\nthat will add every child to that domain.\n\n338\n00:18:35.326 --> 00:18:38.913\n>> That's exactly it,\nbecause one thing that'll happen,\n\n339\n00:18:38.913 --> 00:18:42.060\nespecially if you're going\nto a government site,\n\n340\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.370\nyou'll cross multiple different URLs and\nthey might all end with yourschool.edu.\n\n341\n00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.537\nBut [LAUGH] if you don't add them\nindividually, and here it's gonna keep\n\n342\n00:18:51.537 --> 00:18:55.567\nblocking and keep prompting him,\nyou put the parent domain in here and\n\n343\n00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:59.409\nit just says anything under the parent\ndomain is gonna be trusted.\n\n344\n00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:01.586\nBut there again,\nbe very careful with this,\n\n345\n00:19:01.586 --> 00:19:05.139\nmake sure that you do trust the websites\nthat you are going to because if not\n\n346\n00:19:05.139 --> 00:19:08.130\nthis can cause a security\nvulnerability for sure.\n\n347\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.534\nLast but not least, restricted sites.\n\n348\n00:19:11.534 --> 00:19:14.972\n[LAUGH] I've always said that if you've\ngot a site that needs to go in here to\n\n349\n00:19:14.972 --> 00:19:18.533\nthis location, chances are you shouldn't\nbe browsing to it to begin with.\n\n350\n00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:21.671\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Because you can see that all\n\n351\n00:19:21.671 --> 00:19:27.139\nthe less secure maximum safeguards like\nit says, it's pretty much like it says,\n\n352\n00:19:27.139 --> 00:19:31.034\nthe most restricted zone of all,\nI mean, hence the name.\n\n353\n00:19:31.034 --> 00:19:35.495\n>> So this is more like a blacklist,\ndon't go here no matter what.\n\n354\n00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:36.370\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah,\n\n355\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:42.070\nand one of the differences between\nthis and for instance if a website\n\n356\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.775\nis considered fraudulent,\nthat's based on a certificate, all right?\n\n357\n00:19:46.775 --> 00:19:50.805\nNot every site that could potentially\ncause harm necessarily is going to have\n\n358\n00:19:50.805 --> 00:19:54.350\na bogus certificate, but\nthe web browser itself is gonna warn you.\n\n359\n00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.254\nA lot of the major web browsers throw\na red bar there and say hey, stand back,\n\n360\n00:19:58.254 --> 00:20:00.655\nthe whole web browser's gonna blow up.\n\n361\n00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:03.758\nNot really, but it's gonna let you know,\nhey, we need to go somewhere else,\n\n362\n00:20:03.758 --> 00:20:05.371\ndon't continue Give you this website.\n\n363\n00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:08.854\nWell, if it doesn't do that, let's say,\nit does have a valid certificate, and\n\n364\n00:20:08.854 --> 00:20:10.530\nthe web browser's not gonna catch it.\n\n365\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.530\nAnd this is a good way, that you can\nrestrict some of that added content that\n\n366\n00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.466\nyou might not want to [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah,\n\n367\n00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.660\nI don't mean to say they won't\nlet you go to the website.\n\n368\n00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.901\nWhat I'm saying is you\nprobably shouldn't be going.\n\n369\n00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:26.244\n[INAUDIBLE] Basically, Wes alluding to, it\nwill restrict the mess out of it though.\n\n370\n00:20:26.244 --> 00:20:29.847\nIt will try to block everything from\nrunning, it will allow no third party,\n\n371\n00:20:29.847 --> 00:20:32.886\nthis, that, the other,\njust basically, here's some HTML,\n\n372\n00:20:32.886 --> 00:20:34.324\nI hope it gets through to you.\n\n373\n00:20:34.324 --> 00:20:36.211\n>> [LAUGH] That's exactly it.\n\n374\n00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:39.750\nNow, the next tab that we\nhave is the Privacy tab,\n\n375\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.404\nand the Privacy tab, again,\nhas been updated just a little bit.\n\n376\n00:20:44.404 --> 00:20:48.660\nIt might not look like the way it's looked\nin [INAUDIBLE] past revisions here.\n\n377\n00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.593\nOne of the things that I like about\nthe Privacy tab is this location,\n\n378\n00:20:52.593 --> 00:20:55.146\nis the location awareness this type thing,\n\n379\n00:20:55.146 --> 00:20:59.020\nnever allowing your websites to\nrequest your physical location.\n\n380\n00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.240\nKeep in mind, the security standpoint,\n\n381\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.610\nmaybe you don't want people to\nknow exactly where you're located.\n\n382\n00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:10.320\nAnd I just mean for business purposes,\nso you can configure that right here.\n\n383\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.870\nThe other thing that you\nhave is the pop-up blocker.\n\n384\n00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.890\nMost of your web browsers have\npop-up blockers today, and\n\n385\n00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.020\nthis is no exception to the rule.\n\n386\n00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:24.850\nThis is also one that has\na pop-up blocker in it as well.\n\n387\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.600\nWe also have the ability inside\nof the Privacy tab to when\n\n388\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.790\nyou move to an InPrivate browsing,\nwhich we'll get to here in a second,\n\n389\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.465\nis to disable toolbars and extensions\nwhen you move to the InPrivate browsing.\n\n390\n00:21:35.465 --> 00:21:38.820\nAnd I guess, this is a good place to talk\nabout it, since it's a good segue into it.\n\n391\n00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.520\nThe InPrivate browsing is\nsomething that you can set, so\n\n392\n00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.279\nthat you don't have to remember\nto delete information.\n\n393\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.710\nYou don't have to worry about tracking\ninformation being stored in the web\n\n394\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:54.376\nbrowser, but the problem is the toolbars\nand extensions that can potentially run\n\n395\n00:21:54.376 --> 00:21:58.095\nin the InPrivate browsing are still\nstoring your information and\n\n396\n00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:01.879\nlocation information, so\nwhat this is saying that when you go into\n\n397\n00:22:01.879 --> 00:22:05.762\nthe InPrivate browsing mode let's\nkeep all that stuff turned off.\n\n398\n00:22:05.762 --> 00:22:07.163\nSo, it's a good thing to have.\n\n399\n00:22:07.163 --> 00:22:10.570\nNow, Content is another\ntab that I would know too.\n\n400\n00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:15.030\nThere is a way that you can, through\na group policy, you can turn on things\n\n401\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.030\nlike content filtering here, look at\nyour certificates if you have them.\n\n402\n00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:24.130\nWe look at certificates, the personal\ncertificates issued to the user.\n\n403\n00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.290\nAnd you can see all different\nkinds of certificates.\n\n404\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.880\nYou can even import them here.\n\n405\n00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.990\nConnections tab, this one allows you\nthe ability if you wanna setup things like\n\n406\n00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.110\nVPNs if you will, proxies, programs or\nhow the programs will interact inside of\n\n407\n00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:44.740\nthe web browser,\neven managing your add-ons here as well.\n\n408\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.320\nAnd then, one of the last ones is a very,\nvery handy tab to know.\n\n409\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.540\nIf you have, you can always tell this too.\n\n410\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.900\nWhen somebody opens a web browser and\nthey got 15 toolbars\n\n411\n00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.460\nthat are all waiting to load up,\nall the Ask.com and stuff like that.\n\n412\n00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.760\nWell, what happens if you get,\nI call it a runaway browser, right?\n\n413\n00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.140\n>> I call that an infection.\n\n414\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.862\n>> That's exactly what it is.\n\n415\n00:23:06.862 --> 00:23:08.812\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> You have malware most likely.\n\n416\n00:23:08.812 --> 00:23:09.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's exactly what it is,\n\n417\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.790\na runaway browser that just doesn't do,\nit does everything else but\n\n418\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.860\nallow you to browse.\n\n419\n00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.520\nWell, this setting right here I really\nlike, and that's the reset browser.\n\n420\n00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:24.620\nIt allows you to do a full browser\nreset and set it back to its defaults.\n\n421\n00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.510\nI would try the least\ninvasive method first.\n\n422\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.840\nNotice, it says delete personal settings,\nyou don't have to go that far at first.\n\n423\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.100\nI would do the restart or the reset.\n\n424\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.110\nSets everything back to the factory\ndefaults, and it's gonna require a restart\n\n425\n00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:42.150\nof the browser, but\nif that doesn't help the problem,\n\n426\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.350\nthen we'll go a little bit more invasive\non this, put that check mark in there.\n\n427\n00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.212\nIt's gonna delete, like it says, and\nyou can see search providers, and\n\n428\n00:23:49.212 --> 00:23:52.150\nall the settings there that are just\nspecific to the user themselves.\n\n429\n00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.640\n>> That's a kinda cool thing about having,\nand we're getting ready to talk about\n\n430\n00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.710\nthis, is that in private browsing kind\nof like, allows you to test whether or\n\n431\n00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:03.323\nnot this is actually going to work\nwith but I've worked with help desks.\n\n432\n00:24:03.323 --> 00:24:06.438\nThey'll say, oh, so and so's called,\nhaving trouble with their browser.\n\n433\n00:24:06.438 --> 00:24:08.265\nI've reset it, and it still doesn't work.\n\n434\n00:24:08.265 --> 00:24:12.170\nI say, well did you make sure to\ndelete that personal user data?\n\n435\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.580\nWell no, I didn't do that.\n\n436\n00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.111\nOnce, you give that a shot and\nsee if it works out for that.\n\n437\n00:24:16.111 --> 00:24:20.835\nThat does affect some things, so if you\ndo that like what Wes was talking about\n\n438\n00:24:20.835 --> 00:24:24.687\nalways start with the least invasive,\nif that doesn't work,\n\n439\n00:24:24.687 --> 00:24:28.850\nthen yes make a jump and check that\nbox off and delete that user data.\n\n440\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.818\n>> Sure, [LAUGH] least invasive method,\ndisable the firewall.\n\n441\n00:24:32.818 --> 00:24:34.320\n>> [LAUGH] Disable the firewall.\n\n442\n00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.790\n>> No, don't do that, but yeah,\n\n443\n00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:41.320\nI would always start with simple fixes\nfirst First, see if that fixes it.\n\n444\n00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.660\nIf it doesn't you can go\na little bit farther than that.\n\n445\n00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.660\nWhen it comes to the InPrivate browsing,\n\n446\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.780\nInPrivate browsing is\nfairly easy to setup here.\n\n447\n00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.075\nAnd in Internet Explorer there's\na couple of ways that you can do this.\n\n448\n00:24:51.075 --> 00:24:53.863\nOne of the easiest ways is to\njust hit New Tab option up here.\n\n449\n00:24:53.863 --> 00:24:56.900\nYou can do a Ctrl+T if\nyou want a shortcut.\n\n450\n00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.440\nAnd if you scroll down,\nshould be all the way,\n\n451\n00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.530\nit's kinda hard to see all\nthe way down on the bottom.\n\n452\n00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.300\nBut you can do this as well,\nif you go to the gear icon.\n\n453\n00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.120\nAnd you go to safety.\n\n454\n00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.920\nI really like the options\nthat you have here in safety.\n\n455\n00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.710\nWe've already talked about some of them,\ndelete browsing history, and\n\n456\n00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.530\nyou can see the in private browsing.\n\n457\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.580\nNow, with in private browsing, it just\ndoesn't store the information locally.\n\n458\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.520\nI heard a good saying by somebody\nout there on the Internet that\n\n459\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.690\nsaid if you think browsing\nthe Internet is private,\n\n460\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:29.110\nimagine going to the food court, your\nnearest mall, standing on the table and\n\n461\n00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.920\nscreaming at the top of your lungs and\nexpecting nobody to hear you.\n\n462\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.520\nSo, keep in mind that just because\nit's not stored locally, your ISPs,\n\n463\n00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.420\nthe web servers you visit,\nthey know you're there.\n\n464\n00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.450\nSo, this is more for not keeping any\nof that confidential information\n\n465\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.670\nthat's stored within the computer,\n\n466\n00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:52.780\nnot making it available to\nthe rest of the world if you will.\n\n467\n00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.550\nCouple other things here from the safety,\n\n468\n00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.040\nthe safety location that\nI'd like you to see.\n\n469\n00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.360\nTurning on tracking protection,\n\n470\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.040\nif you have a do not track\nrequest you can turn that on.\n\n471\n00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.540\nTurn on do not track request,\nActiveX filtering is something there too.\n\n472\n00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.965\nRemember, the ActiveX add-ons,\nthey can cause potential and\n\n473\n00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:13.565\nthese little security vulnerabilities\nthat could make their way in there,\n\n474\n00:26:13.565 --> 00:26:16.675\nso if you wanna turn that on,\nyou can do that.\n\n475\n00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:20.685\nAnother big one here too\nis the Smart Screen filter.\n\n476\n00:26:20.685 --> 00:26:23.821\nNow, I really like the Smart Screen\nfilter, it's been around for\n\n477\n00:26:23.821 --> 00:26:25.846\na little bit and\nit uses a couple of things.\n\n478\n00:26:25.846 --> 00:26:29.909\nMicrosoft maintains what What's\nknown as a reputation database and\n\n479\n00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:31.666\nit's for a couple of things.\n\n480\n00:26:31.666 --> 00:26:33.245\nOne of it is for websites.\n\n481\n00:26:33.245 --> 00:26:36.954\nURL's that are known to propagate things\nlike phishing scams, stealing your\n\n482\n00:26:36.954 --> 00:26:41.114\nidentity, promote malware or distribute\nmalware, we're not promoting anything but\n\n483\n00:26:41.114 --> 00:26:43.890\ndistributing malware,\ndrive-by downloads and stuff.\n\n484\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.890\nWhen these websites are found, a lot\nof times the information within the web\n\n485\n00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:53.320\nbrowser will be reported out to Microsoft\nand Microsoft will maintain a database.\n\n486\n00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.410\nWell if the SmartScreen Filter goes,\n\n487\n00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.650\nyou'll notice that it's turned off right\nhere and that's not a good thing here.\n\n488\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.064\nSo I'm actually gonna go ahead and\nturn it on, practice what I preach here.\n\n489\n00:27:02.064 --> 00:27:06.110\nSmart Screen Filter, every time you browse\nto a URL the Smart Screen Filter looks\n\n490\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.504\nat that URL and it connects to\nMicrosoft's reputation database and\n\n491\n00:27:09.504 --> 00:27:12.230\nit says hey, is this URL in that database?\n\n492\n00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.290\nIf it finds it in that database it's\ngonna throw a warning here, and\n\n493\n00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.160\nit's gonna,\nall red lights are on, you know?\n\n494\n00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.726\nIt's gonna let you know you need to verify\nyou actually wanna go to the website\n\n495\n00:27:21.726 --> 00:27:23.985\nthat's typically not recommended.\n\n496\n00:27:23.985 --> 00:27:27.638\nThe other feature that I like\nabout Smart Screen Filter isn't so\n\n497\n00:27:27.638 --> 00:27:32.238\nmuch about the browsing habits as, well I\nguess it would be browsing habits cuz if\n\n498\n00:27:32.238 --> 00:27:36.590\nyou're gonna download software,\nyou've gotta be browsing to a website.\n\n499\n00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.660\nIs that it also checks applications too,\napplications for that reputation.\n\n500\n00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.200\nAnd more so what Smart Screen Filter\nis doing is looking at that certificate\n\n501\n00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.290\nthat digitally signs\nthe code on the application.\n\n502\n00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.095\nAnd if it is a Trusted application, then\nSmart Screen Filter doesn't even warn you.\n\n503\n00:27:50.095 --> 00:27:51.900\nYou don't even know.\n\n504\n00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.660\nThe UAC will still kick in,\ncuz you're installing software.\n\n505\n00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.881\nBut if the Smart Screen Filter\ndoesn't trust the certificate,\n\n506\n00:27:58.881 --> 00:28:02.232\nit's also gonna warn you about\nthe applications themselves too.\n\n507\n00:28:02.232 --> 00:28:06.163\nSo, very good thing to have there,\nand I would certainly turn that on,\n\n508\n00:28:06.163 --> 00:28:08.404\nand don't do like I have and turn it off.\n\n509\n00:28:08.404 --> 00:28:10.029\nI wanted to show you guys.\n\n510\n00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:12.120\nSo Smart Screen Filter,\nvery good thing to have.\n\n511\n00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.329\nIt's something one thing that I would\nmake sure you keep on inside of your\n\n512\n00:28:16.329 --> 00:28:17.234\nweb browsers.\n\n513\n00:28:17.234 --> 00:28:22.033\nIf it's turned off, you're not going to be\naware when you hit a URL that is in that\n\n514\n00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:25.856\nreputation database and\ndoesn't have a very good reputation.\n\n515\n00:28:25.856 --> 00:28:27.737\n>> No, no, no.\n\n516\n00:28:27.737 --> 00:28:31.949\nNow we are talking Windows 10 here,\nright Wes, and Windows 10 means new stuff,\n\n517\n00:28:31.949 --> 00:28:35.984\nthe new hotness, it comes out from\nMicrosoft, specifically the Edge browser,\n\n518\n00:28:35.984 --> 00:28:39.036\nthey're going to try to make it\nmake a big push for Edge here.\n\n519\n00:28:39.036 --> 00:28:42.855\nSo, the question lies is,\nare we gonna see some of the same features\n\n520\n00:28:42.855 --> 00:28:45.815\nthat we're used to in\nInternet Explorer with Edge?\n\n521\n00:28:45.815 --> 00:28:46.629\nWes?\n>> Yeah,\n\n522\n00:28:46.629 --> 00:28:50.015\nwe've got a few of those settings too,\nand it's something that you can,\n\n523\n00:28:50.015 --> 00:28:53.686\nthe configurations here are pretty\nstraightforward once you know where to go.\n\n524\n00:28:53.686 --> 00:28:57.970\nSo, here in the Edge browser you\nhave your little settings or\n\n525\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.680\nmore actions button in\nthe upper right hand corner.\n\n526\n00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.910\nAnd then you've got the Settings\noption down here at the bottom.\n\n527\n00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.780\nAnd when you choose Settings, what you\nshould have over here from the right hand\n\n528\n00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.520\nside, you should see the Settings\noption load up here.\n\n529\n00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.340\nAnd if you scroll down, a little difficult\nto see here, you've got the advanced, or\n\n530\n00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.700\nView Advanced Settings.\n\n531\n00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.470\nThey really try to make this\nas simplistic as possible,\n\n532\n00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.640\nthey don't want you\nmodifying anything anymore.\n\n533\n00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.550\nBut you can scroll down here,\nyou can see Send Do Not Track requests.\n\n534\n00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.243\nSo like some of the things that\nwe've seen in Internet Explorer.\n\n535\n00:29:31.243 --> 00:29:34.030\nProtected license media.\n\n536\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:39.398\nThere was another one in here\nthat I wanted to show too,\n\n537\n00:29:39.398 --> 00:29:42.560\nand that's the Clear History.\n\n538\n00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.340\nSo, blocking cookies is another\none that you have here too.\n\n539\n00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:50.546\nAnd then just general retention of those\nsettings inside of the browser here.\n\n540\n00:29:50.546 --> 00:29:51.970\nThere we go.\n\n541\n00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:52.650\nThe what to clear.\n\n542\n00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.850\nSo, deleting your browsing\nhistory is fairly easy too.\n\n543\n00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.946\nIt doesn't even take\nthe advanced settings.\n\n544\n00:29:58.946 --> 00:30:00.385\nSo you can do this right here.\n\n545\n00:30:00.385 --> 00:30:03.466\nAgain, if you've got passwords that are\nbeing stored you can say, you know what,\n\n546\n00:30:03.466 --> 00:30:05.310\nI don't want those passwords being stored.\n\n547\n00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:08.580\nAnd if you've got additional\noptions like your media license,\n\n548\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.300\ncompatibility permissions,\nyou are good to go.\n\n549\n00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.820\nAnd one of the good things\ntoo here is that the pop-up\n\n550\n00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.050\nblocker within the browser\nis turned on by default.\n\n551\n00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:22.995\nAnd again like I've said, with\nthe Advance Settings they really don't\n\n552\n00:30:22.995 --> 00:30:27.550\nwant you to modify, you can see\nyour Pop-up blocker right there.\n\n553\n00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.546\nAnd even offer to save password,\njust turn them on, I can turn them off.\n\n554\n00:30:30.546 --> 00:30:33.367\nSo, couple of little things that you\ncan do just to add to a little bit more\n\n555\n00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:34.582\nsecurity in the Edge browser.\n\n556\n00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:37.467\nIt's still really new,\nso again, support for\n\n557\n00:30:37.467 --> 00:30:40.352\nit, compatibility is also an option,\ntoo, so\n\n558\n00:30:40.352 --> 00:30:44.772\nwe should see as it matures a little\nbit as little bit more support for it.\n\n559\n00:30:44.772 --> 00:30:49.570\nBut at least know how to secure it now,\nif you're gonna start using it now.\n\n560\n00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.136\n>> Awesome, now, this is one of\nthe most practical ways in which we can\n\n561\n00:30:52.136 --> 00:30:54.262\nsecure ourselves,\nespecially in a home environment.\n\n562\n00:30:54.262 --> 00:30:56.790\nBusiness environments are usually,\n\n563\n00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:00.270\nthey are administrated by\nthe IT staff themselves.\n\n564\n00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.800\nBut, you might be an IT administrator,\nso you should know a lot about that.\n\n565\n00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.410\nIf you don't, that's not a big deal.\n\n566\n00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.010\nThese are the clues that are gonna\nkeep you out of the weeds\n\n567\n00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:09.710\nwhen it when it comes\nto things like malware.\n\n568\n00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.940\nTrust me,\nbrowsing the Internet is probably\n\n569\n00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.200\nthe most dangerous thing\nyou can do with a computer.\n\n570\n00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.957\nThat is the majority of the way\nthat people get viruses, and\n\n571\n00:31:17.957 --> 00:31:21.543\nemail as well, obviously those two walk\nhand in hand when it comes to the being\n\n572\n00:31:21.543 --> 00:31:22.610\na threat to yourself.\n\n573\n00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.202\nAnd yet the two things that we\nwant most out of our computers.\n\n574\n00:31:26.202 --> 00:31:29.992\nNow Wes' tricks here,\nthat is what you wanna do.\n\n575\n00:31:29.992 --> 00:31:33.524\nGo through those settings, figure out\nwhat's gonna help you keep secure and\n\n576\n00:31:33.524 --> 00:31:35.329\nstill give you a modicum of ease of use.\n\n577\n00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:37.150\nYou don't wanna lose that completely.\n\n578\n00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.090\nBut Wes, is there anything else we need to\ncover when it comes to securing a browser?\n\n579\n00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.460\n>> No, I think we've pretty much got it.\n\n580\n00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.230\nDon't be afraid to click around in there,\nand find the settings, and\n\n581\n00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.440\nagain, learn the settings,\nbe aware of the options that you have.\n\n582\n00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.080\nAnd what's the worst that's gonna happen?\n\n583\n00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.810\nYou're gonna have to do the full\nbrowser reset from that Advanced tab.\n\n584\n00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.850\nRestores everything to the defaults and\nthen you can try again.\n\n585\n00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.260\nAnd so, don't be scared, don't matter what\nyour level is or whether you're like Dan\n\n586\n00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.060\nsaid, the IT Administrator or maybe you've\nopened the browser and you've only been\n\n587\n00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.750\nusing the browser in the next couple\nof weeks or the last couple of weeks.\n\n588\n00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.983\nGet in there, look at those Settings,\nbe aware of the options you have,\n\n589\n00:32:11.983 --> 00:32:14.793\nworst case scenario,\n[LAUGH] you make a configuration change,\n\n590\n00:32:14.793 --> 00:32:18.200\ngo the the Advance Tab, reset it and\nthen you can start over from square one.\n\n591\n00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.566\nAnd that's one of the things\nI love about reset button but\n\n592\n00:32:21.566 --> 00:32:23.680\nother than I think we've got that.\n\n593\n00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.885\n>> Safe browsing everyone.\n\n594\n00:32:24.885 --> 00:32:25.385\n[LAUGH]\n>> Safe browsing.\n\n595\n00:32:25.385 --> 00:32:26.983\nAll right, thank you so much Wes,\n\n596\n00:32:26.983 --> 00:32:30.457\nwe appreciate you being here, all the cool\ntricks that you gave us today and\n\n597\n00:32:30.457 --> 00:32:32.844\nthe knowledge is imparted,\nhopefully out there.\n\n598\n00:32:32.844 --> 00:32:34.105\nAnd you don't have to worry so\n\n599\n00:32:34.105 --> 00:32:36.685\nmuch about the wilds on the Internet.\nAs for the show though,\n\n600\n00:32:36.685 --> 00:32:39.539\nwe're gonna go ahead and shut her down.\nSigning off for ITProTV,\n\n601\n00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:42.440\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant, and\n\n602\n00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:49.029\nwe'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:21.048\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nshow, we're gonna be moving on with some\n\n4\n00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:24.540\nmore Windows 10 security,\nspecifically account management.\n\n5\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.780\nAnd joining me in the studio today\nto help lend his expertise on\n\n6\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.780\nthat subject is none\nother than Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.670\nHow's it going today, Wes?\n\n8\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.370\n>> Man, it's going great.\n\n9\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.680\nIt's great to be here today.\n\n10\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.020\nAnd in fact, we've got some\nvery cool stuff to talk about.\n\n11\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.720\nThe different types of accounts that you\ncan see in your Windows 10 environment.\n\n12\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.920\nAnd we're gonna start out by maybe\ndistinguishing the difference between\n\n13\n00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.180\nwhat's known as a standard account and\n\n14\n00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.470\nwhat is known as\nan administrative account.\n\n15\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.600\nNow you might see that in\nother operating systems,\n\n16\n00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.620\nthey might not call it\na standard user account.\n\n17\n00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.009\nWindows does tend to name some things\ndifferent than the rest of the world.\n\n18\n00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.710\nYou might hear it called\nnon admin account.\n\n19\n00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.380\nIn other operating systems,\n\n20\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.970\nthey might talk about an administrative\naccount being a root user.\n\n21\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.146\nIn Windows, let's see if we\ncan distinguish the difference\n\n22\n00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:08.793\nbetween the two.\n\n23\n00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:12.652\nNow, a standard user is,\nfor the most part,\n\n24\n00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:17.760\nthey could do just about all\nof their daily basic tasks.\n\n25\n00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.922\nRun most of the software that\nis within the operating system.\n\n26\n00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:25.435\nThey can make changes to their\npersonal user accounts but past that,\n\n27\n00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:27.627\nthey really can't do much more than that.\n\n28\n00:01:27.627 --> 00:01:30.441\nNow the administrative\naccount on the other hand,\n\n29\n00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:34.893\nwe have to be careful with these accounts,\nlike a model, so many other operating\n\n30\n00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:39.082\nsystems follow the model ofthe most\npowerful account has to be protected and\n\n31\n00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:41.100\nfor most parts it usually is.\n\n32\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.568\nOne of the things that has differed.\n\n33\n00:01:43.568 --> 00:01:47.778\nFor a while in Windows is the fact that\nthe default administrative account is\n\n34\n00:01:47.778 --> 00:01:48.450\ndisabled.\n\n35\n00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.860\nAnd this is to better secure\nthe operating system,\n\n36\n00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.430\nyou never want somebody logging in as\nthe default administrative account because\n\n37\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.280\nnow they can do more than just run\ntheir basic day to day applications.\n\n38\n00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.570\nNow they can make changes to the core\nfunctionality of the operating system and\n\n39\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.630\nkey security settings.\n\n40\n00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.480\nSo let's go ahead and look at\na concept known as an access token.\n\n41\n00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.050\nIt's one of the things\nthat we have to see here.\n\n42\n00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.760\nSo here on my machine we have\na standard user account.\n\n43\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.460\nNow anytime a user logs in to a machine\nthey get what's known as a access token.\n\n44\n00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.960\nAnd that access token is\napplied to their account.\n\n45\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.640\nFrom then on any time they try to\nperform some kind of functionality\n\n46\n00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.528\nwithin the operating system,\nthat access token is gonna be checked.\n\n47\n00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:34.340\nAnd then the standard user token here, one\nof the things you will notice is that it\n\n48\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.430\nhas what is known as\na security identifier.\n\n49\n00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.360\nA few different security\nidentifiers in there.\n\n50\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.482\nWe call these SIDs.\n\n51\n00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:43.110\nNow understand we as humans,\nwe typically don't see this information.\n\n52\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.590\nWhat we see are group names,\nwe see user names.\n\n53\n00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.762\nBut the operating system underneath,\nwhat it does,\n\n54\n00:02:48.762 --> 00:02:51.517\nit sees this crazy long\nstring of characters.\n\n55\n00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:55.423\nAnd you might have seen them come up\nsometimes if you ever deleted an end user\n\n56\n00:02:55.423 --> 00:02:58.280\nand it doesn't remove every\naspect of their account.\n\n57\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.540\nSometimes when you look at a permissions\nlist, you'll see this long block\n\n58\n00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.430\nof numbers right after the letter S,\nthat's usually your security identifier.\n\n59\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.510\nOne of the things that I want you to\nnotice here is that the access tokens,\n\n60\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.020\nstandard access token, has the user's SID.\n\n61\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.460\nIt has every group security identifier and\n\n62\n00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.700\nthe different groups that\nthe user might be a part of.\n\n63\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.760\nNow that's a little bit different\nthan the administrative account.\n\n64\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.391\nWhen we look at the administrative\naccount when these accounts are created,\n\n65\n00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:31.096\nwhat we end up having here is two access\ntokens that are generated the moment you\n\n66\n00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:34.531\ncreated an administrative account and\nthe user logs on.\n\n67\n00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:38.447\nNow under something known as\nthe Standard User Security Architecture,\n\n68\n00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:39.800\nnow what does that mean?\n\n69\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.560\nWell in the days of Vista,\nthey completely redid the architecture.\n\n70\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.115\nSo what does it mean for us?\n\n71\n00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:52.580\nXP, typically, the first user by default\nwould be the administrative account.\n\n72\n00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.830\nAnd here's something that caused a problem\nback in those days is the fact that\n\n73\n00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.580\neverybody would log in as the\nadministrator, the default administrator.\n\n74\n00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.370\nEven standard users maybe didn't\neven know much about the computer,\n\n75\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.570\nthey didn't even realize\nthat this was happening.\n\n76\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.930\nSo when they would log on, what would\nhappen was they would launch a program.\n\n77\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.477\nWhen they launch this program,\n\n78\n00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:15.030\nit would also run in the context\nof their administrative account.\n\n79\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.060\nAnd they would have access to things\nlike the kernel, the lower portions,\n\n80\n00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.978\nthe operating system,\nthings like executive services and\n\n81\n00:04:20.978 --> 00:04:22.722\nDan I could tell you one thing.\n\n82\n00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:26.414\nIf a standard user that doesn't know much\nabout a computer has full administrative\n\n83\n00:04:26.414 --> 00:04:30.176\naccess to that computer, a lot of times\nthat's going to start cause some problems.\n\n84\n00:04:30.176 --> 00:04:34.061\n>> Oh yeah, unfortunately it's like\na child that's found its father's gun or\n\n85\n00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:37.050\nsomething like that that have\ngreat power in their hands and\n\n86\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.221\nnot a lot of maturity\nto handle that power.\n\n87\n00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:42.860\nSo they think,\nI'll just do whatever I want with it.\n\n88\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.240\nAnd therein lies the problem.\n\n89\n00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.700\nIf I have admin level privileges,\nwhat can't I do?\n\n90\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.870\nNothing.\nI can do anything I want.\n\n91\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.460\nI can install software.\n\n92\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.457\nI can make changes to\nthe operating system.\n\n93\n00:04:53.457 --> 00:04:57.351\nI can make changes to user accounts,\nanything that I feel like doing,\n\n94\n00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:01.578\nI have the rights to do, and the operating\nsystem does not care whatsoever.\n\n95\n00:05:01.578 --> 00:05:05.178\nIt says hey you're an admin,\nyou must know what you're doing, so\n\n96\n00:05:05.178 --> 00:05:07.380\ngo ahead and shoot yourself in the foot.\n\n97\n00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.100\n>> Yeah that's right and\nthat's typically usually what happens.\n\n98\n00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.409\nIf they can get access to something, even\nif they're not trying to intentionally.\n\n99\n00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:15.344\nYour standard users,\n\n100\n00:05:15.344 --> 00:05:18.742\nthat doesn't necessarily mean they come\nto work everyday and say, hey, how can I\n\n101\n00:05:18.742 --> 00:05:22.191\nfigure out how to bring the whole network\ndown and give Dan and the administrators,\n\n102\n00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:25.115\nmyself a hard time, and then they\nhave to figure out what's going on.\n\n103\n00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:28.618\nSo, one of the things that Windows\nhas done for a while now, and\n\n104\n00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:30.482\nit's included in Windows 10.\n\n105\n00:05:30.482 --> 00:05:33.030\nIt goes back all the way\nto the days of Vista.\n\n106\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.470\nIs they said, you know what?\n\n107\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.090\nWe've noticed that 90, and\nI'm just throwing a number out here,\n\n108\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.240\nI think it was like 80 to 90% of all\ntasks that an end user would do,\n\n109\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.140\nreally didn't involve any\nadministrative privileges.\n\n110\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.690\nSo we implement a concept that\nwe've talked about here in\n\n111\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.180\nWindows security quite a lot now called\nthe principal of least privilege.\n\n112\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.030\nIf you don't need that access, there's\nno reason for it to be granted to you.\n\n113\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.591\nSpecially if you install\na program in the background and\n\n114\n00:05:56.591 --> 00:06:00.134\nthe program doesn't have some kind of\nUI that's interactive that says hey,\n\n115\n00:06:00.134 --> 00:06:03.690\nI'm modifying this, I'm modifying,\nthis, this, this, this and this.\n\n116\n00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.896\nAnd before you know it,\neverything's going haywire.\n\n117\n00:06:05.896 --> 00:06:10.491\nSo it is good to have every\nuser log in as a standard user.\n\n118\n00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:12.487\nNow what do I mean by every user?\n\n119\n00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:16.701\nAdministrators also run as standard\nusers until they need those privileges.\n\n120\n00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:21.261\n>> I was about to say Wes,\nif I'm logging in as a standard user and\n\n121\n00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:24.614\nI'm an administrator, how does that work?\n\n122\n00:06:24.614 --> 00:06:27.603\nI don't have administrative privileges\non my standard user account,\n\n123\n00:06:27.603 --> 00:06:29.363\nobviously because I'm a standard user.\n\n124\n00:06:29.363 --> 00:06:31.732\nSo how do I do administrative tasks?\n\n125\n00:06:31.732 --> 00:06:33.740\n>> Well that's very good.\n\n126\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.290\nIf we go to our Windows machine here,\nI'm logged in as, well, myself.\n\n127\n00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.395\nI'm the first user here, and\n\n128\n00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:43.520\nwhat's kind of interesting is the first\nuser in Windows Is the administrative user\n\n129\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.900\nbut every time I log in I\nget those two access tokens.\n\n130\n00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.390\nSo that first standard user access token\n\n131\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.900\nallows me to do the majority\nof the stuff on the machine.\n\n132\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.760\nBut when I go to do things like for\n\n133\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.620\ninstance let's say install software that\nmight interact with the operating systems.\n\n134\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.530\nHere's a good one.\n\n135\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.800\nEverybody's got to have\na little Wireshark here.\n\n136\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.590\nNow notice this little\nshield that's going on.\n\n137\n00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.135\nNow here is the user account control and\nwe're going to get to this in a second.\n\n138\n00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:09.877\nWe'll talk more about that.\n\n139\n00:07:09.877 --> 00:07:13.220\nBut what is going on is there's\na privilege escalation.\n\n140\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.887\nI initiated this application\ninstaller here as the standard user.\n\n141\n00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:23.424\nAt that point, my access token\ndoesn't contain the SID for\n\n142\n00:07:23.424 --> 00:07:25.694\nan administrative account or\n\n143\n00:07:25.694 --> 00:07:31.155\nthe privileges that are associated\nwith the administrative account.\n\n144\n00:07:31.155 --> 00:07:34.685\nBut once I say yes to\nthe user account control.\n\n145\n00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:40.734\nNow it's gonna ask me if I wanna install\nthis information or this program here.\n\n146\n00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:45.899\nSo one of the things to keep in mind is\nthat when you do run as an administrator,\n\n147\n00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:51.220\nyou're gonna run as a standard user until\nyou need those level of privileges.\n\n148\n00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.530\nSo what does it do for us?\n\n149\n00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.224\nIt keeps us safe, even as administrators,\nwe don't want things running\n\n150\n00:07:56.224 --> 00:07:59.265\nin the background That could\npotentially cause problems and\n\n151\n00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:01.247\ncould potentially ruin our machines.\n\n152\n00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:04.480\nLet's go ahead and we're gonna log\nin as our standard user here and\n\n153\n00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.464\nwe'll see how the user account control of\nthis administrative program works with\n\n154\n00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:09.460\nthe standard user.\n\n155\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.130\nNow we've got our Wireshark\non the desktop here and\n\n156\n00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.680\nwe're logged back in as Old Billy.\n\n157\n00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.655\nWe'll see what Billy can do.\n\n158\n00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:19.101\nNotice what's happening here.\n\n159\n00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:23.160\nIt is blocking me from the ability\nto be able to run this program.\n\n160\n00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.626\nNow the reason is, this program,\nit's going to try to interact with\n\n161\n00:08:27.626 --> 00:08:32.179\nthe network protocol stack as\na Wireshark packet protocol analyzer.\n\n162\n00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.018\nSo it's gonna try to make some\nmodifications to the TCP/IP\n\n163\n00:08:35.018 --> 00:08:35.881\nprotocol stack.\n\n164\n00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:37.078\nWell, in order to do that,\n\n165\n00:08:37.078 --> 00:08:41.040\nyou have to interact with something\nknown as the Windows filtering platform.\n\n166\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.580\nAnd that's something only\nan administrator can do.\n\n167\n00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.170\nSo what it's doing here is\nchecking Billy's access token.\n\n168\n00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.628\nIt's looking into that token,\nlike we see, and it's looking for\n\n169\n00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:52.594\nan administrative SID,\nan administrative privilege,\n\n170\n00:08:52.594 --> 00:08:56.198\nand Windows is going you know what,\nI'm just not finding that here.\n\n171\n00:08:56.198 --> 00:08:58.690\nSo it is blocking this from happening.\n\n172\n00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.410\nAnd this is a good thing, because imagine\nif you did have a program that was running\n\n173\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.050\nin the background and\nyou didn't even see this going on,\n\n174\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.140\nyou wouldn't be aware that potentially\nan application you have here\n\n175\n00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.690\nis going to be making modifications\nto your operating system.\n\n176\n00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.660\nNow, the next thing I want to talk\nabout is that user account control that\n\n177\n00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.050\nwe've mentioned.\n\n178\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.606\nNow, with the user account control,\nI want you to keep in mind that what\n\n179\n00:09:21.606 --> 00:09:24.951\nit does here is, there is a privilege\nescalation that is going on.\n\n180\n00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:29.218\nAll right, with the privilege escalation,\nit is looking for\n\n181\n00:09:29.218 --> 00:09:32.750\nthose administrative level privileges.\n\n182\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.240\nEven if I am an administrator, it is still\nlooking at that standard access token and\n\n183\n00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.420\nsaying okay wait a second here,\nI am looking for your privileges and\n\n184\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.580\nI don't see them.\n\n185\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.325\nNow once the user account control,\nyou interact with it.\n\n186\n00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:50.060\nFor instance, in the last demonstration\nthere, if I had my user account that I\n\n187\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.080\njust type in my credentials,\nit would elevate Billy's account,\n\n188\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.746\nnot with his access token but it would\ngrab my Administrative Access Token and\n\n189\n00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:01.800\napply it to the process\nthat happening right now.\n\n190\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.080\nSo Billy wouldn't just get my credentials\nand be able to do whatever he wants.\n\n191\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.200\nHe would just be able to\ninstall that software.\n\n192\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.800\nObviously, that's not\nsomething that we want here.\n\n193\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.070\nNow that brings up\nthe User Account Control.\n\n194\n00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.269\nSo what is the User Account Control\nmean for us?\n\n195\n00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:20.490\nWell the User Account Control,\nit is a technology,\n\n196\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.280\nanother one that first\ncame around in Vista.\n\n197\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.960\nAnd kind of thinking back to\nthe User Account Control,\n\n198\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.606\nI know it was one of those things\nthat really everybody loved to hate.\n\n199\n00:10:31.606 --> 00:10:32.767\nWhy is that?\n\n200\n00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:36.897\nBecause in the days of XP, well,\neverybody was running as an administrator,\n\n201\n00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:39.662\nmost of the programs those\ndays were coded that way.\n\n202\n00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:43.697\nWhen the standard user security\narchitecture came out, it said uh-oh,\n\n203\n00:10:43.697 --> 00:10:46.230\nnow we're gonna change\naround a little bit.\n\n204\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.870\nAnytime an application runs, we're gonna\nbe looking for those credentials, and\n\n205\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.210\nif it doesn't find those it's gonna\nblock that application from running.\n\n206\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.390\nSo we did have some\ncompatibility issues early on.\n\n207\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.344\nThank goodness today it has matured a lot,\nso\n\n208\n00:10:58.344 --> 00:11:00.977\nwe don't have those application\ncompatibility problems.\n\n209\n00:11:00.977 --> 00:11:06.394\nBut there are a few different ways you\ncan configure the user account control.\n\n210\n00:11:06.394 --> 00:11:11.336\nNow you do have to be an administrative\nuser in order to configure\n\n211\n00:11:11.336 --> 00:11:13.510\nthe user account control.\n\n212\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:18.728\nSo, let me just go ahead real quick and\nwe'll switch accounts here.\n\n213\n00:11:18.728 --> 00:11:20.920\nNow there's a couple different\nways that you can do this.\n\n214\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.573\nOne of the basic ways that you can do\nthis is through the Control Panel.\n\n215\n00:11:24.573 --> 00:11:27.779\n>> One of my favorite ways\nis getting you to do it.\n\n216\n00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:28.348\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:11:28.348 --> 00:11:30.167\n>> Hey, can you do this for me, Wes?\n\n218\n00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:32.216\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n219\n00:11:32.216 --> 00:11:35.080\nHurry up and email me here.\n\n220\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.850\nYou can email me at dan@itpro.tv.\n\n221\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:44.890\nNow, the Control Panel is one\nof the ways that's fairly easy.\n\n222\n00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.780\nIt allows you a basic set\nof configurations, but\n\n223\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.940\nit is kinda limited here.\n\n224\n00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.450\nSo, if we go over to the quick access\nmenu and choose Control Panel.\n\n225\n00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.240\nWe can go over here to User Accounts,\nand then user accounts again.\n\n226\n00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.934\nI like this that you go to a door in\nfront of a door in front of a door here.\n\n227\n00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:10.196\nAnd notice that we've got this setting\nright here that says change user account\n\n228\n00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:10.769\ncontrol.\n\n229\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.600\nWhen we choose this, again, notice that\nit's gonna say, well wait a second here,\n\n230\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.980\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n231\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.359\nI just looked at that standard\naccess token, Wes, and\n\n232\n00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:22.803\nyou don't have any\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n233\n00:12:22.803 --> 00:12:24.243\nThe moment I say yes,\n\n234\n00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:28.408\nthe user account control lets\nme configure the user account.\n\n235\n00:12:28.408 --> 00:12:30.459\nNice, it even protects itself.\n\n236\n00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:35.550\nNow, notice that this setting is the most\nrestrictive, it's all the way to the top.\n\n237\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.064\nThis is the way it was in the days of\nVista, in fact if you had sneezed on your\n\n238\n00:12:39.064 --> 00:12:42.834\ncomputer the User Account Control would\nlock up and say did you mean to do that?\n\n239\n00:12:42.834 --> 00:12:45.552\nNow if you did that's okay,\njust click Yes to continue, but\n\n240\n00:12:45.552 --> 00:12:47.430\nif not click No and\nrun an anti virus scan.\n\n241\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.431\nThe default here and this is where\nthey usually keep the defaults,\n\n242\n00:12:52.431 --> 00:12:57.207\nI actually crank this up a little bit\nbecause I don't mind interacting with user\n\n243\n00:12:57.207 --> 00:13:00.075\naccount control,\nerr on the side of security.\n\n244\n00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:03.116\nThe other way here that we\nhave this third one here,\n\n245\n00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:06.540\nI want you to pay attention to\nthis Do Not Dim My Desktop.\n\n246\n00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.268\nWe gotta be careful with that.\n\n247\n00:13:08.268 --> 00:13:10.700\nThe dimming of the desktop,\nwhen that happens,\n\n248\n00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.857\nlet me see if I can retrigger this\nhere and you guys can see that.\n\n249\n00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:15.203\nAll right, there we go.\n\n250\n00:13:15.203 --> 00:13:17.477\nSo, notice how the screen is graying out.\n\n251\n00:13:17.477 --> 00:13:19.482\nThat's called secure desktop.\n\n252\n00:13:19.482 --> 00:13:22.416\nIt doesn't say it in the settings there,\nbut\n\n253\n00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:26.434\nsecure desktop puts your registry\ninto a read-only state and\n\n254\n00:13:26.434 --> 00:13:30.852\nit locks up the machine and\nno other programs can interact with you.\n\n255\n00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.196\nNow, why did they do this?\n\n256\n00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:35.362\nOkay, one of the reasons they\ndid this is imagine pop-ups.\n\n257\n00:13:35.362 --> 00:13:40.171\nIf I'm crafty at coding, there's no\nreason I couldn't just design what looks\n\n258\n00:13:40.171 --> 00:13:42.800\nlike a user account control box.\n\n259\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.940\nDialogue box, but really all it\nis is a piece of software, and\n\n260\n00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.300\nwhen it asks me for my user account,\nadministrative account,\n\n261\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.070\nI put in my username and\ncredentials, and what is it?\n\n262\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.240\nWell, maybe a keylogger that sends\nthose credentials to a third party, and\n\n263\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.190\nnow then have my credentials.\n\n264\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.470\nSo Microsoft locked it down.\n\n265\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.310\nOne of the things that Microsoft did is.\n\n266\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.610\nWe're gonna lock up the entire desktop and\nmake it so\n\n267\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.800\nthat the software here cannot be spoofed,\nif you will.\n\n268\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.100\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay Yes to this again.\n\n269\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.099\nAnd that's what you gotta\nbe careful with that.\n\n270\n00:14:16.099 --> 00:14:20.870\nWhen you say don't dim my desktop, you're\nturning off in the secure desktop and at\n\n271\n00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:25.643\nthat point there's really no way to tell\nif it's the actual user account control or\n\n272\n00:14:25.643 --> 00:14:28.490\nsome kind of malicious software.\n\n273\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.990\nThe last setting, we have here,\nis probably not one that you wanna do.\n\n274\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.640\nThat says turn off\nthe user account control.\n\n275\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.560\nNow I know there's a lot of people out\nthere that probably don't like this.\n\n276\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.710\nThey find it a little intrusive.\n\n277\n00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:41.970\nAre you sure you wanna do this?\n\n278\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.420\nWell, yeah, I clicked the button, and\nnow I have to click another button.\n\n279\n00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.880\nBut if you've ever gotten a virus on\nyour machine, if you've ever downloaded\n\n280\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.150\na program that said I'm gonna do what I\nwanna do whether you want me to or not.\n\n281\n00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.270\nAnd then you gotta take six hours\nto reinstall the operating system.\n\n282\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.050\nHopefully you've got a backup.\n\n283\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.488\nHopefully, the virus doesn't spread its\nway around the rest of your network,\n\n284\n00:15:02.488 --> 00:15:04.348\nand then all those machines get infected.\n\n285\n00:15:04.348 --> 00:15:08.842\nOnce something like that happens, you're\nreally not gonna have a problem, I think,\n\n286\n00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:12.677\nafter that making sure this setting\nis on and configured appropriately.\n\n287\n00:15:12.677 --> 00:15:17.580\nSo I personally leave it all the way up.\n\n288\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.010\nAlways notify me.\n\n289\n00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.490\nI don't mind clicking an extra button.\n\n290\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.176\nErr on the side of security rather\nthan erring on the side of, well,\n\n291\n00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:25.411\nI guess not so secure.\n\n292\n00:15:25.411 --> 00:15:28.234\nAnd then you end up having to\nreinstall all of your programs and\n\n293\n00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:30.050\nyour operating systems there, Dan.\n\n294\n00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.610\n>> Yeah.\n\n295\n00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.770\nIt goes back to that ease of\nuse versus more security.\n\n296\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.695\nAgain, that scale is always in flux.\n\n297\n00:15:36.695 --> 00:15:40.560\nYou gotta make that call on what\nyou're willing to live with.\n\n298\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.270\nIf you're willing to live with\nmaybe having to clean up a virus,\n\n299\n00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.530\nwell then crank that sucker down and\ngo berserk.\n\n300\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.904\nBut if you want to stay out of virus land,\nwell then do like Wes said.\n\n301\n00:15:49.904 --> 00:15:50.836\nPush it up to the highest level and\n\n302\n00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:53.190\njust click an extra button whenever\nyou want to install something.\n\n303\n00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.431\nOr run something that could be\npotentially harmful to your computer.\n\n304\n00:15:57.431 --> 00:15:58.366\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n305\n00:15:58.366 --> 00:16:00.275\nSo there are a couple of things,\n\n306\n00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:03.619\na handful of things that\nstandard users just can't do.\n\n307\n00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:07.400\nIt interacts with the protocol stack, if\nit interacts with security settings within\n\n308\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.564\nthe operating system,\nwell, standard users.\n\n309\n00:16:09.564 --> 00:16:12.189\nWe don't want them just being\nable to run through this.\n\n310\n00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:15.946\nNow, there is another way that you can\nconfigure the user account control, and\n\n311\n00:16:15.946 --> 00:16:19.272\none of the ways that you can do that\nis through the group policy editor.\n\n312\n00:16:19.272 --> 00:16:22.544\nWe talked a little bit through this\nseries about group policy objects, so\n\n313\n00:16:22.544 --> 00:16:25.313\ngo ahead and review those if\nyou're not familiar with those.\n\n314\n00:16:25.313 --> 00:16:28.160\nBut we're gonna go back to\nour local group policy.\n\n315\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.255\nWe're gonna see some of the settings\nthat you can modify for the user account\n\n316\n00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:39.397\ncontrol, now, I'm gonna go ahead to launch\nthis, just gonna type our gpedit.msc here.\n\n317\n00:16:39.397 --> 00:16:41.080\nAnd notice that user account control.\n\n318\n00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:47.815\nIt's going to challenge me here because\nwe can make modifications, all right.\n\n319\n00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:53.190\nNow the next place that we're gonna\ngo is this is computer configuration,\n\n320\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.647\nso keep in mind that we're the at\ntop of the group policy here.\n\n321\n00:16:57.647 --> 00:17:02.240\nAnd we're gonna be under window\nsettings and then security settings.\n\n322\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.960\nAnd then when you expand\nout local policies,\n\n323\n00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.040\nyou're gonna see that there\nis the security options here.\n\n324\n00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.470\nNow you can and expand out security\noptions if you just wanna make\n\n325\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:16.120\nthe triangle disappear, but there's not\nreally anything to expand out here.\n\n326\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.240\nNow, the other way that\nyou can rearrange this.\n\n327\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.144\nMost of your user account controls,\nthey're alphabetical so\n\n328\n00:17:22.144 --> 00:17:23.522\nthey're at the bottom here.\n\n329\n00:17:23.522 --> 00:17:25.975\nSo if I rearrange the way this looks here,\n\n330\n00:17:25.975 --> 00:17:28.637\nYou can see that I have about ten setting,\nand\n\n331\n00:17:28.637 --> 00:17:33.355\nI wanna kinda explain a couple of these\nsettings cuz you have to be very careful.\n\n332\n00:17:33.355 --> 00:17:36.920\nOne of the things by default you'll\nsee is that switch to secure\n\n333\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.349\ndesktop is enabled by default,\nwhen I change that setting,\n\n334\n00:17:40.349 --> 00:17:44.181\nthat slider bar that turns it down,\nthat says do not dim my desktop,\n\n335\n00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:48.439\nyou're gonna turn this setting off and\nyou have to be careful, cuz again.\n\n336\n00:17:48.439 --> 00:17:52.811\nYou're not gonna really know ahead of\ntime if that is an application that\n\n337\n00:17:52.811 --> 00:17:56.480\nmaybe has taken over your computer,\nand it's spoofing it.\n\n338\n00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.495\nThe other one that I want to talk about\nis the run all administrators in admin\n\n339\n00:18:00.495 --> 00:18:01.397\napproval mode.\n\n340\n00:18:01.397 --> 00:18:05.148\nNow you're talking about getting\nreally granular with the group policy,\n\n341\n00:18:05.148 --> 00:18:07.540\nreally being able to\nfine tune these settings.\n\n342\n00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.780\nThis is a setting you\ndo not want to disable.\n\n343\n00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.740\nAnd let me tell you why.\n\n344\n00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.390\nIf you look at the explanation,\nessentially turning off running\n\n345\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.110\nall your administrators in\nadministrative approval mode or\n\n346\n00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.400\nadmin approval mode as they\ncall it disables the UAC.\n\n347\n00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.350\nYou have to be very careful.\n\n348\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.767\nIf you disable this one,\n\n349\n00:18:24.767 --> 00:18:29.085\nit doesn't matter what you configure in\nthe rest of the other ten settings or\n\n350\n00:18:29.085 --> 00:18:33.689\nthat slider bar, It's gonna turn it off,\nso you gotta be careful with that one.\n\n351\n00:18:33.689 --> 00:18:36.481\nWe've talked about this before,\nDan and I in past episodes.\n\n352\n00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:40.080\nYou've gotta be careful with\nthe configuring of a policy.\n\n353\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.760\nDoes enable mean disable it?\n\n354\n00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.814\nNot configured, disable it?\n\n355\n00:18:43.814 --> 00:18:44.939\nDisabling it?\n\n356\n00:18:44.939 --> 00:18:48.231\nSo just pay attention here\nit can get a little tricky.\n\n357\n00:18:48.231 --> 00:18:49.761\nThere's another setting in here,\n\n358\n00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:52.970\na couple of other settings I\nreally want you guys to see too.\n\n359\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:57.607\nAnd that's the behavior of the prompt for\nstandard users,\n\n360\n00:18:57.607 --> 00:19:02.814\nnow the elevation prompt, by default,\nfor standard users is to.\n\n361\n00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:06.397\nPrompt for credentials.\n\n362\n00:19:06.397 --> 00:19:07.162\nNow, prompt for\n\n363\n00:19:07.162 --> 00:19:10.950\ncredentials on secure desktop is\nwhat you wanna save this one to.\n\n364\n00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.811\nAgain, you don't wanna have standard users\nprompting for consent because there again,\n\n365\n00:19:14.811 --> 00:19:17.603\nwhat you're doing,\nyou're not really turning off the UAC, but\n\n366\n00:19:17.603 --> 00:19:21.360\nyou're saying standard users, go ahead and\njust choose yes, and then now they've got\n\n367\n00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.439\nadministrative level privileges,\nso be careful with that one, too.\n\n368\n00:19:24.439 --> 00:19:25.856\nNow, here's another one.\n\n369\n00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:29.023\nThis one I really like.\n\n370\n00:19:29.023 --> 00:19:30.814\nBy default.\n\n371\n00:19:30.814 --> 00:19:35.020\nAn administrator, as you see,\nhas been required to just interact.\n\n372\n00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:40.003\nProper consent, I say yes, and I go ahead\nand do whatever it is I need to do,\n\n373\n00:19:40.003 --> 00:19:41.440\nor I can change that.\n\n374\n00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.761\nI can make that even more secure than just\nthe little slider bar that says always\n\n375\n00:19:45.761 --> 00:19:47.070\nnotify me.\n\n376\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.220\nI can go as far as saying prompt for\ncredentials.\n\n377\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.320\nEven more so than that, which is the\nsetting I'm gonna choose, is prompt for\n\n378\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.120\ncredentials on the secure desktop.\n\n379\n00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.630\nAnd let's see how this effects us.\n\n380\n00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.130\nI'm gonna go ahead and just minimize\nour group policy for now, and\n\n381\n00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.750\nwe'll go back to the control panel and see\nif we can get ourselves in trouble here,\n\n382\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.530\nfind something that's needs got the little\nshield, and that's a good thing.\n\n383\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.830\nJust take a second and let everybody know.\n\n384\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.000\nAnything that you see in the operating\nsystem that has a little shield in front\n\n385\n00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.657\nof it, typically means it's gonna be,\n\n386\n00:20:16.657 --> 00:20:19.313\nwell it does mean it's gonna\nneed administrative privileges.\n\n387\n00:20:19.313 --> 00:20:21.564\nSo let's go ahead and\nchange an account type.\n\n388\n00:20:21.564 --> 00:20:24.600\nNow Deanne, one of the things that your\ngonna notice here is that it's changed\n\n389\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.050\nthe way it's interacting with me.\n\n390\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:27.860\nI'm still an administrator, right.\n\n391\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.980\nNothing's changed, but\nit's not prompting me for consent anymore.\n\n392\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.720\nNow it's prompting me for a password.\n\n393\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.220\nThat is about the most secure that you\ncan run your user account control.\n\n394\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:41.060\nYou're saying, notify me every time,\nand then, even administrators,\n\n395\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.830\nwhen you do notify me,\nmake me put in a password, all right.\n\n396\n00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.960\nAnd that is one of the strongest ways.\n\n397\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.910\nThat you can ensure that even\nadministrators are prompted for\n\n398\n00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:53.620\ntheir credentials.\n\n399\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:59.240\nAnd again, be careful with some\nof these settings that you set.\n\n400\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.160\nBecause some of them, enabling or\ndisabling can turn the whole thing off.\n\n401\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.420\nFor instance, that very first setting.\n\n402\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.564\nIt wouldn't matter what\nI've set after the fact.\n\n403\n00:21:07.564 --> 00:21:12.325\nAfter I've set it, if I disable that run\nall administrators in that admin approval\n\n404\n00:21:12.325 --> 00:21:14.647\nmode, it essentially turns of the UAC.\n\n405\n00:21:14.647 --> 00:21:18.788\nSo those are a few different way that you\ncan control the user account control, boy,\n\n406\n00:21:18.788 --> 00:21:20.460\nthat's redundant there,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.520\n>> That you can configure the user account\n\n408\n00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.620\ncontrol, and you can set it up for\na more secure environment.\n\n409\n00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:30.066\nNow if you are one of those ones that\nbelieves that the user account control\n\n410\n00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:32.860\nisn't really,\nis a little bit too annoying,\n\n411\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.315\nyou can lower the settings a little bit.\n\n412\n00:21:35.315 --> 00:21:40.155\nKeep in mind, ease of use typically\nmeans an insecure computer,\n\n413\n00:21:40.155 --> 00:21:42.356\nand that's not what we want.\n\n414\n00:21:42.356 --> 00:21:42.897\nInsecure.\n\n415\n00:21:42.897 --> 00:21:43.730\nHow about unsecure?\n\n416\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.480\nAll right?\n\n417\n00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.105\nIt might be insecure, but\nunsecure computer, so keep that in mind.\n\n418\n00:21:48.105 --> 00:21:50.799\n>> That's right.\nNow we've been looking at this in the vein\n\n419\n00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:52.630\nof a local user account, right?\n\n420\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.480\nWe have built-in accounts that\nare on our system itself,\n\n421\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.040\nbut they're not the only type of\naccount that we might encounter.\n\n422\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.986\nThere are actually quite a few accounts.\n\n423\n00:22:01.986 --> 00:22:04.613\nThat will allow you to login\nto a Windows 10 device, and\n\n424\n00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:07.480\nWestern gonna help us walk through\nthose a little bit as well.\n\n425\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.522\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n426\n00:22:08.522 --> 00:22:13.003\nSo we've got typically today,\nif you've been around Windows for awhile,\n\n427\n00:22:13.003 --> 00:22:16.465\nyou've probably seen a few\ndifferent types of account.\n\n428\n00:22:16.465 --> 00:22:20.650\nNow, what I've been running in so\nfar is what's known as a local account.\n\n429\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.231\nThe local account is\nstored on this machine.\n\n430\n00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:24.900\nIt's authenticated by this machine.\n\n431\n00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.370\nMy credentials, if you will,\nthey're not stored anywhere else.\n\n432\n00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.632\nThey're stored right here.\n\n433\n00:22:30.632 --> 00:22:33.606\nNow,it has benefits, and\nit has some of its limitations.\n\n434\n00:22:33.606 --> 00:22:36.982\nOne of the benefits it has is privacy,\nall right, its first benefit.\n\n435\n00:22:36.982 --> 00:22:39.682\nThe other limitation that it\nhas is it doesn't allow you\n\n436\n00:22:39.682 --> 00:22:42.902\naccess to things like if your\ncomputer's in a corporate network,\n\n437\n00:22:42.902 --> 00:22:45.610\nyou don't get access to\nthe network based resources.\n\n438\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.450\nSo local accounts are good for\n\n439\n00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.500\nthings like small home,\nthe home environment if you will.\n\n440\n00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.390\nBut the domain accounts now,\n\n441\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.550\nwith the domain accounts\nthat's a little bit different.\n\n442\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.030\nWhen you login with a domain account,\n\n443\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:01.210\nwhat you're doing is your account\nis no longer stored locally.\n\n444\n00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.130\nIt's actually one that's gonna be stored\non a domain controller's centralized\n\n445\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.060\ndatabase.\n\n446\n00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.560\nNow when you use that domain account,\n\n447\n00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:14.110\nnow you have access to all of\nthe resources within the network.\n\n448\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:18.710\nSo what type of account you use is really\ncontingent on what kind of corporation or\n\n449\n00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.520\ncompany you work for.\n\n450\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.980\nIf you work for a smaller company,\nyou might still have a local account.\n\n451\n00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.200\nYou might not have a domain account.\n\n452\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.467\nBut as you scale up to\na larger environment,\n\n453\n00:23:27.467 --> 00:23:31.455\ntypically what you're gonna see is\na centralized networking model where all\n\n454\n00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:34.231\nof those accounts are stored\non a domain controller.\n\n455\n00:23:34.231 --> 00:23:39.320\nNow, what if you want to do\nthings like synchronize settings?\n\n456\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.777\nWhat if you want more of a single sign-on\ntype of implementation where you can enter\n\n457\n00:23:43.777 --> 00:23:48.440\ncredentials and you can login to a lot of,\nfor instance, the cloud-based services.\n\n458\n00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.251\nWell, Windows today supports\ncloud-based integration, but\n\n459\n00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:54.280\nit does require something.\n\n460\n00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.750\nIt requires something known\nas a Microsoft account,\n\n461\n00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.180\nand you actually have to sign\nin with your Microsoft account.\n\n462\n00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.268\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n463\n00:24:01.268 --> 00:24:05.125\nTo login with your\nMicrosoft account today,\n\n464\n00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:08.379\nyou can go over your settings option.\n\n465\n00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:13.152\nAll right, and\nthen we have this Accounts icon.\n\n466\n00:24:13.152 --> 00:24:16.955\nAnd notice that it says, your account,\nand it even tells me that hey,\n\n467\n00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:21.410\nyou're logged in as a local account, and\nnow and you're also an administrator.\n\n468\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.420\nBut notice this option\nright here that says sign\n\n469\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.220\nin with a Microsoft account instead.\n\n470\n00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.403\nLet's go ahead, and do that.\n\n471\n00:24:28.403 --> 00:24:30.029\nSo, I'm gonna sign in\nwith a Microsoft account.\n\n472\n00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:33.722\nSo what it's gonna do, it's gonna\nreach out to Microsoft servers, and\n\n473\n00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:36.264\nit's gonna challenge me for\nwhat you might've,\n\n474\n00:24:36.264 --> 00:24:39.227\nif you guys out there have had\nin the past Windows Live IDs,\n\n475\n00:24:39.227 --> 00:24:43.121\nit's still the same concept, they just\nrenamed it the Microsoft Account.\n\n476\n00:24:43.121 --> 00:24:50.716\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, and I'm going\nto login with my Microsoft account.\n\n477\n00:24:52.713 --> 00:24:57.125\nAnd of course our super\nsecret password here.\n\n478\n00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:58.902\nAnd hopefully I typed that password.\n\n479\n00:24:58.902 --> 00:25:01.288\nNow, it's gonna challenge me.\n\n480\n00:25:01.288 --> 00:25:03.977\nOne of the things that\nit's challenged me for\n\n481\n00:25:03.977 --> 00:25:06.679\nis the password of\nthe local administrator.\n\n482\n00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:08.823\nUnderstand, if you're a standard user,\n\n483\n00:25:08.823 --> 00:25:11.330\nyou're not gonna be able\nto set this up like this.\n\n484\n00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.446\nYou have to be an administrator.\n\n485\n00:25:13.446 --> 00:25:16.648\nSo, we'll go ahead and\ntype in our password here.\n\n486\n00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:24.207\nOh.\nTry again there.\n\n487\n00:25:24.207 --> 00:25:27.379\nApparently my password\nwas too hard to type.\n\n488\n00:25:27.379 --> 00:25:28.221\n>> You made it very secure.\n\n489\n00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:30.493\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n490\n00:25:30.493 --> 00:25:33.419\nOne of the things that they really\ntry to get you to do is set up a PIN.\n\n491\n00:25:33.419 --> 00:25:34.913\nIf you set up a PIN, that's up to you.\n\n492\n00:25:34.913 --> 00:25:36.752\nYou don't have to.\nSome people might consider the PIN\n\n493\n00:25:36.752 --> 00:25:39.577\na little bit less secure here, but\nI'm gonna go ahead and set it up for\n\n494\n00:25:39.577 --> 00:25:41.840\nease of use because you've\nseen my typing abilities.\n\n495\n00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.494\nWe've got that PIN set now.\n\n496\n00:25:44.494 --> 00:25:49.170\nAnd one of the things that you can see\nhere is that the Microsoft account is now\n\n497\n00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:54.141\nlogged in so we're ready to go with some\nof the technologies that we can integrate\n\n498\n00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:55.699\nour Microsoft account.\n\n499\n00:25:55.699 --> 00:25:58.439\nWe can now log in locally\nwith the Microsoft account.\n\n500\n00:25:58.439 --> 00:26:01.409\nAnd we can take advantages of\nsome of the cloud based services.\n\n501\n00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:02.020\n>> That's pretty awesome.\n\n502\n00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.811\nNow we know that there are some different\nways in which you might be logging in\n\n503\n00:26:05.811 --> 00:26:08.596\nusing the Microsoft account\nwhich gives you that nice,\n\n504\n00:26:08.596 --> 00:26:12.107\nalmost ubiquitous where I can sign\ninto any device and it's still me.\n\n505\n00:26:12.107 --> 00:26:13.571\nOr you can have a domain account or\n\n506\n00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:16.618\na local account depending on\nthe environment that you're set up in.\n\n507\n00:26:16.618 --> 00:26:20.265\nNow Wes I'm taking a look at the clock, I\nknow I know we have a few more items that\n\n508\n00:26:20.265 --> 00:26:23.414\nwe need to go over when it comes to\nthis lovely secure topic here, but\n\n509\n00:26:23.414 --> 00:26:25.163\nwe're gonna need to make a part two.\n\n510\n00:26:25.163 --> 00:26:27.010\n>> Yeah, I definitely talked\na lot in this one didn't I?\n\n511\n00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.869\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's a lot of good info, so\n\n512\n00:26:29.869 --> 00:26:31.252\nit's well said.\n\n513\n00:26:31.252 --> 00:26:33.535\nThat being said we're gonna go ahead and\nclose this show out.\n\n514\n00:26:33.535 --> 00:26:36.509\nHopefully we'll see you in part two,\nsigning off for ITpro.tv,\n\n515\n00:26:36.509 --> 00:26:38.272\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n516\n00:26:38.272 --> 00:26:38.837\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n517\n00:26:38.837 --> 00:26:40.191\n>> I'll see you next time.\n\n518\n00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:45.137\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:21.113\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're going back to Windows 10\n\n4\n00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:25.050\nsecurity, specifically talking\nabout account management.\n\n5\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.307\nNow, joining me in the studio today to\nhelp lend his expertise once again,\n\n6\n00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:29.712\nnone other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:30.792\nHow's it doing today Wes?\n\n8\n00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:31.992\n>> Man, it's going good.\n\n9\n00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:33.912\nIt's good to be here again Dan,\nI can tell you.\n\n10\n00:00:33.912 --> 00:00:37.767\nWe talked about in the first part,\nwe talked about things like the difference\n\n11\n00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:41.860\nbetween a standard user account and\nan administrative user account.\n\n12\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.556\nWe also talked about the user account\ncontrol and how those two different types\n\n13\n00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:48.748\nof accounts will interact,\nI'd probably say more specifically,\n\n14\n00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:51.941\nhow the user account control controls\nthose two types of accounts.\n\n15\n00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:56.071\nNow, if you haven't seen that episode, go\nback and watch it because one of the last\n\n16\n00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.671\nthings that we talked about was logging\nin with your Microsoft account.\n\n17\n00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:01.651\nNow, we're not logging\nin with a local account.\n\n18\n00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:04.271\nIt's not a domain account, but\nit's the somewhere in between.\n\n19\n00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:05.671\nIt's the Microsoft account.\n\n20\n00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:08.977\nSo let's go ahead and continue on with\nthat, cuz I really wanna show you some\n\n21\n00:01:08.977 --> 00:01:12.286\nof the cool features that you can\nsynchronize with the Microsoft account and\n\n22\n00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:13.280\none of the benefits.\n\n23\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.030\nSo here on our Windows machine,\n\n24\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.680\nI've already logged in with our\nMicrosoft account so we're ready to go.\n\n25\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.965\nAnd we have launched up our settings here,\nand more specifically,\n\n26\n00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:25.232\nwe're in the account option here.\n\n27\n00:01:25.232 --> 00:01:27.292\nLet me make sure everybody\nsees that out here.\n\n28\n00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:29.608\nWe're gonna go to accounts, and\nthen on the left-hand side,\n\n29\n00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:31.192\nscroll all the way down\nto the bottom here.\n\n30\n00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:32.892\nYou'll see synchronize your settings.\n\n31\n00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:36.570\nNow this is a little bit different than\nwhat it was in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n32\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.170\nThere was actually two columns of\nthings that you can synchronize.\n\n33\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.960\nAnd they didn't reduce any functionality,\nbut they're going for\n\n34\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.380\na more simplistic interface.\n\n35\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.670\nSo what they've done is\nthey've reduced it down.\n\n36\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.330\nI believe there's seven of them in here.\n\n37\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.061\nWhat is it?\nYeah, seven.\n\n38\n00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:51.041\nSeven total.\n\n39\n00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:52.281\nAnd the top one?\n\n40\n00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.261\nKinda self explanatory on this one.\n\n41\n00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:55.781\nThat's the light switch.\n\n42\n00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:56.857\nOn or off.\nYou turn this one off,\n\n43\n00:01:56.857 --> 00:02:00.441\nyou'll notice that it says, well,\nwe're not gonna synchronize anything.\n\n44\n00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.461\nSo that's basically whether\nyou synchronized or not.\n\n45\n00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:08.480\nBut then you can get a little bit more\ngranular and you can save synchronizing,\n\n46\n00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.210\nif you get some of the things here,\ntheme, web browser, app passwords.\n\n47\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.283\nNow be careful because as account\nmanagement one of the things that you\n\n48\n00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:19.577\ndon't wanna ever do is log into a public\nmachine with a Microsoft account.\n\n49\n00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:20.577\nWell why?\n\n50\n00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:24.254\nAnd that more specifically is that one\nlittle option right there that says\n\n51\n00:02:24.254 --> 00:02:27.987\npasswords, when you do that keep in\nmind that if it's like a public kiosk,\n\n52\n00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:32.282\nconference room, computer, if you just\ndon't think about it, well, guess what?\n\n53\n00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:34.627\nNow your passwords are on that machine and\n\n54\n00:02:34.627 --> 00:02:39.460\nanybody that has access to that machine\ncould potentially compromise your account.\n\n55\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.020\nSo, do have to warn that's a good\nfeature to have to be able to\n\n56\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.680\nsynchronize your settings\nacross the multiple devices.\n\n57\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.501\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you something kinda cool.\n\n58\n00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.122\nI really like this feature.\n\n59\n00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:50.522\nWhat does it help me do?\n\n60\n00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:55.822\nIt helps me to keep that unified\nexperience across multiple devices.\n\n61\n00:02:55.822 --> 00:02:59.932\nNow one of the features that I like to use\nhere, that I think it's really cool is\n\n62\n00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:03.543\nthe ability to be able to synchronize\nyour themes and you can do this,\n\n63\n00:03:03.543 --> 00:03:06.743\nprovided that the setting is\nturned on here by default it is.\n\n64\n00:03:06.743 --> 00:03:09.173\nSo let's go ahead [LAUGH] and\nshow you that,\n\n65\n00:03:09.173 --> 00:03:11.883\nnotice that I have my\nIT Pro TV background here.\n\n66\n00:03:11.883 --> 00:03:16.343\nI've got another machine over here and\nif we look at this machine too well.\n\n67\n00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:17.124\n>> It's just as lovely.\n\n68\n00:03:17.124 --> 00:03:18.644\n>> It's just the same, right?\n\n69\n00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:23.195\nWell let's see what happens with logging\nin with your Microsoft account when you do\n\n70\n00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:24.571\nmake a change like that.\n\n71\n00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.671\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we'll just\nright click on our desktop here.\n\n72\n00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:31.931\nWe're gonna choose personalize, and then\nthemes over here on the left-hand side.\n\n73\n00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.531\nRemember that's one of the things\nthat you can synchronize here.\n\n74\n00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:38.980\nAnd we'll go to theme settings and\nwe'll choose the Windows 10 themes.\n\n75\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.500\nAnd close these down.\n\n76\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.040\nAnd now we're running on the beach.\n\n77\n00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.145\nAnd let's go ahead and\nswitch back over to our other machine.\n\n78\n00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.290\nAnd if we give it a second, because\nremember, this is gonna communicate with\n\n79\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.570\nthe internet there, synchronizing up to\nthe cloud, and you'll notice that it also\n\n80\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.910\nchanges the background on the other\nmachine, so that's a very, very handy\n\n81\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.480\nthing to have if you want to synchronize\nthose setting across multiple devices.\n\n82\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.280\nBut just as one big warning, though,\nkeep in mind passwords go with it, so\n\n83\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.330\nif you're synchronizing passwords,\nyou do have to be careful with\n\n84\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.120\nthat because you could compromise\nyour system and your account.\n\n85\n00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.950\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's\n\n86\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.670\nkind of the anti of what we're\ntrying to teach you guys here today.\n\n87\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.630\nIt's all about security,\ntrying to stay secure.\n\n88\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.305\nSo that is one of the main caveats\nyou need to take away from using that\n\n89\n00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:21.791\nMicrosoft account.\n\n90\n00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:25.756\nNow Wes, we've kind of bounces around\nwith a term that we've thrown out here\n\n91\n00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:26.371\nand there.\n\n92\n00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:27.671\nSingle sign on, right?\n\n93\n00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.925\nI do think we should make sure that\neveryone's on the same page when we talk\n\n94\n00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:31.931\nabout single sign on.\n\n95\n00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:36.571\nWhat we mean by that, and how we encounter\nthat in our different environments.\n\n96\n00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:38.640\nSo, single sign on.\n\n97\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.200\n>> Yeah.\n\n98\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.713\n>> Take it away.\n\n99\n00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:40.393\n>> All right.\n\n100\n00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:43.318\nWell, you talk about single sign on,\nlet's go ahead and start with a Microsoft\n\n101\n00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:45.691\naccount, since we've got that\nloaded up and it's ready to go.\n\n102\n00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:49.509\nImagine the ability to log into your\nwindows machine, and when you browse\n\n103\n00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.697\nto things like Microsoft resources, maybe\nyou go out to your Xbox live account,\n\n104\n00:04:53.697 --> 00:04:57.947\nmaybe you're an administrator, maybe\nyou're gonna go to things like Microsoft\n\n105\n00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:00.070\nin tune or some of the other services.\n\n106\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.111\nOne drive is another one out there.\n\n107\n00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:05.381\nWell, I can sign in to the local\nmachine with my Microsoft account, and\n\n108\n00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:10.241\nnow I have access, and I don't have to\nre-sign in or re-enter my credentials.\n\n109\n00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:13.223\nAnd we can see that right here\nfrom our Windows 10 machine that\n\n110\n00:05:13.223 --> 00:05:14.241\nI'm logged in with.\n\n111\n00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:17.872\nIf I go to settings, and\nI go back to that account option,\n\n112\n00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:22.281\nnotice it tells me that I can manage\nmy Microsoft account right here.\n\n113\n00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:25.610\nI'm already signed in, let's see if\nit asks me to re-authenticate here.\n\n114\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.900\nOne of the things you're gonna notice\nis that right there it loads up here.\n\n115\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.740\nI didn't have to re-enter my credentials.\n\n116\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.450\nSo that's one of the examples that you can\n\n117\n00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.770\nuse when you do the single sign\non with your Microsoft account.\n\n118\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.260\nNow if you're in a domain environment,\nit's gonna be a little bit different.\n\n119\n00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.280\nYou're network will be\nrunning Active Directory and\n\n120\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.350\nit just means that all of\nyour information, all your\n\n121\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.590\nresources that you have permissions\nover are stored in that database.\n\n122\n00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.770\nThe other really cool thing about\nhaving the Microsoft account is\n\n123\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.590\nfrom the cloud you can also\nmanage a child account.\n\n124\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.870\nI've got children out there, I'm sure some\nof you guys might have children out there.\n\n125\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.450\nSo we could even set that up and one of\nthe good things about this that I really,\n\n126\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.820\nreally like is the ability\nto track their activities.\n\n127\n00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.910\nOur young ones we don't want them\nto browse to inappropriate sites,\n\n128\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.510\nwe want them to have safe\nbrowsing out there, so\n\n129\n00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.730\nyou can manage that all\nfrom this location too.\n\n130\n00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.280\nSo, once I manage my account,\nif I go to the family option here I can,\n\n131\n00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.460\nhere's My Kid.\n\n132\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.830\nAnd I've created a child account\nbeforehand, I've got the email and\n\n133\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.840\neverything set up so keep in mind that\nthere's a couple of things that you\n\n134\n00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.340\nhave to do before this is gonna show up\nhere, so I've created these beforehand.\n\n135\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.200\n>> A little prestaging going on there.\n\n136\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.170\n>> That's right, because there are a few\nsteps that you have to go through and\n\n137\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.520\nyou guys know how to fill out an online\nform and type out an email address so\n\n138\n00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.210\nyou guys can probably do that out there.\n\n139\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.089\nBut one the great things here,\nwhen I click on this,\n\n140\n00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:50.391\nI can see things like internet activity.\n\n141\n00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:54.772\nNow this hasn't been browsing,\nwe haven't been browsing here or\n\n142\n00:06:54.772 --> 00:06:58.293\nanything, but\nI can change these setting if I want for\n\n143\n00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:02.690\ninstance different locations to\nbe blocked I can also block that.\n\n144\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.020\nSo web browsing here if I want I can come\ndown here And notice that I've set for\n\n145\n00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.300\nthe kid, maybe I don't want them\nbrowsing the Internet, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.060\nMaybe I don't want unrestricted browsing.\n\n147\n00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.060\nSo I might put something like Bing in\nhere, or put something like Google.\n\n148\n00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.658\nNot because I have a problem with Google,\nI just have a problem with a child that\n\n149\n00:07:19.658 --> 00:07:22.621\nhas access to a machine and\nit's unrestricted on a web browser.\n\n150\n00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:26.800\nThe other thing I really like,\nyou have the ability to set a curfew.\n\n151\n00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.540\nYou tell them the time of day they can or\n\n152\n00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.510\ncannot even get on the computer\nwell that's screen time here.\n\n153\n00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.440\nIt's kind of like some of the time of\nday options that maybe you've seen and\n\n154\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.570\nyou'll notice here that\nI've kind of set a curfew.\n\n155\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.101\nNow the curfews that you set\nare going to be up to you.\n\n156\n00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:45.995\nI've set 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM\nmaybe through the week days and\n\n157\n00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:48.161\nI only want a maximum of an hour time.\n\n158\n00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:51.245\nThe great thing is,\nwhen you manage this from the interface,\n\n159\n00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:54.050\nit doesn't matter what\nthe local computer's doing.\n\n160\n00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.967\nWhen the child account logs on,\n\n161\n00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:59.171\nthey are going to be restricted\nby the settings here.\n\n162\n00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:01.351\nLet me show you something\nelse that's real cool too.\n\n163\n00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:04.913\nIn your settings here, you have the local\nsetting of family and other users.\n\n164\n00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:08.953\nAnd this is where you can do\na little bit more of a modification.\n\n165\n00:08:08.953 --> 00:08:13.517\nNotice the child account here, if I\nwant regardless of what the connections\n\n166\n00:08:13.517 --> 00:08:17.868\nare out to the internet, imagine you\nhaven't broken the internet, but\n\n167\n00:08:17.868 --> 00:08:22.882\nyour connection to the internet's broken,\nso you can't get out to that webpage.\n\n168\n00:08:22.882 --> 00:08:25.914\nWell, that's the beauty of being\nable to have stuff in the cloud,\n\n169\n00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:28.741\nbut that can also be a drawback,\na little detrimental, too.\n\n170\n00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:32.361\nWell if I know that I can't\ncontrol those settings,\n\n171\n00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:36.228\nI can come right here,\nchoose block, and now locally,\n\n172\n00:08:36.228 --> 00:08:40.360\nthe machine is going to restrict\nthe child from logging in.\n\n173\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.130\nSo we could even do this locally.\n\n174\n00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.570\nSo that's one of the benefits of\nthe Microsoft account is, yes,\n\n175\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.620\nyou do get the single\nsign on implementation.\n\n176\n00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.470\nAnd you don't have to have\nan Active Directory environment like\n\n177\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.630\nwe're talking about that you get there.\n\n178\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.854\nYou also get to synchronize\nthose settings, and\n\n179\n00:08:55.854 --> 00:08:58.901\neven more you get to manage\nadditional accounts on the computers.\n\n180\n00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:00.421\nAnd you can keep your kids safe.\n\n181\n00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.421\nYou control exactly what they're browsing.\n\n182\n00:09:02.421 --> 00:09:04.680\nYou can see their recent activity.\n\n183\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.870\nAnd if you need to make changes to it,\nyou can do that.\n\n184\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.670\nSo I really like that\nfeature as a parent myself.\n\n185\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.950\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, totally I'm totally a parent myself,\n\n186\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.450\nand thank goodness my children\naren't old enough yet\n\n187\n00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.640\nto have to worry about the Internet usage.\n\n188\n00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.571\nBut when that day comes,\nI will be controlling it.\n\n189\n00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:20.354\n>> That's right.\n>> Because they could get themselves\n\n190\n00:09:20.354 --> 00:09:21.451\nin trouble very quickly.\n\n191\n00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:22.501\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's definitely true.\n\n192\n00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:23.501\n>> We want to stop that.\n\n193\n00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:26.820\nThe single sign on obviously is a great\nfunction, it's a great feature.\n\n194\n00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.340\nWe see an active directory, we see it\nhere now with the Microsoft account,\n\n195\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.470\nit's able to go out to people that aren't\nusing an active directory environment.\n\n196\n00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.795\nThere is one kind of\ncaveat to that though, is,\n\n197\n00:09:37.795 --> 00:09:39.902\nyou gotta remember it's a single sign on.\n\n198\n00:09:39.902 --> 00:09:41.184\nMy one user name and\n\n199\n00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:45.282\npassword gets me access to\neverything that I need access to.\n\n200\n00:09:45.282 --> 00:09:48.100\nThat means that if my\ncredentials get compromised,\n\n201\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.823\nthat person gets not access to just\none thing, but to tons of things.\n\n202\n00:09:51.823 --> 00:09:52.563\nRight, Wes?\n\n203\n00:09:52.563 --> 00:09:54.810\n>> And that's well said.\n\n204\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.490\nAnd that's one of the reasons you never\nlog on on Microsoft account on a public\n\n205\n00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.640\nkiosk type computer.\n\n206\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.725\nJust like Dan says,\nit's gonna pull those passwords down and\n\n207\n00:10:03.725 --> 00:10:07.181\nif somebody can compromise that,\nthey can compromise everything.\n\n208\n00:10:07.181 --> 00:10:10.540\nBilling, your XBox account, so\njust be careful with that too,\n\n209\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.956\ncuz they could potentially get access to\neven things like credit card information,\n\n210\n00:10:14.956 --> 00:10:17.151\nso you really, really gotta be careful.\n\n211\n00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:17.871\nKeep it secure.\n\n212\n00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:20.260\n>> Gotta be safe out there,\nladies and gents.\n\n213\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:20.760\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n214\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.033\nNow Wes, we're talking security here and\n\n215\n00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:26.577\na lot of times we have basically\ntwo different environments.\n\n216\n00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:28.027\nOne is usually a domain environment, and\n\n217\n00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:32.250\nthe other is a work group environment.\nNow, some people might not be familiar\n\n218\n00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.690\nwith what the difference is and how\nsecurity might vary from one to the other.\n\n219\n00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.410\nSo, help us out with that as well.\n\n220\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.870\n>> The work group is\na little bit different.\n\n221\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.651\nWith the work group now,\nit's a decentralized environment.\n\n222\n00:10:42.651 --> 00:10:46.331\nRemember, every single\ncomputer is its own boss.\n\n223\n00:10:46.331 --> 00:10:47.922\nAnd, it says that another computer,\n\n224\n00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:50.370\nits not going to trust the users\nin the accounts there.\n\n225\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.741\nSo, it becomes more of a complexity\nto manage that kind of network here.\n\n226\n00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:56.801\nLet's go ahead and show that.\n\n227\n00:10:56.801 --> 00:11:01.832\nNow, on your workstations, if you wanna\nsee where the database is stored,\n\n228\n00:11:01.832 --> 00:11:07.255\nit's actually down in the registry, so\nyou have to make a slight modification and\n\n229\n00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:11.671\nyou have to change the way your file\nexplorer is going to be viewed.\n\n230\n00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.850\nSo, let me go ahead and\nmake sure we've got that.\n\n231\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.940\nNotice we are showing hidden files and\nfolders.\n\n232\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.890\nI could tell you, it's typically\na good thing that these files and\n\n233\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.280\nfolders are hidden.\n\n234\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.680\nSo if you're not familiar with the\nregistry and even those that are familiar\n\n235\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.230\nwith the registry know to stay away\nfrom it, be very careful here guys.\n\n236\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.590\nYou don't wanna make modifications.\n\n237\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.890\nBut if you go down to Local Disk C,\nyou go into the Windows and you look for\n\n238\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.660\nyour System 32 Directory and then there's\na directory in here called Config.\n\n239\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.690\nNow, one of the things you'll see right\naway you have to be an administrator to\n\n240\n00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.440\nbe able to get into here,\nbecause this is a protected location.\n\n241\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:52.320\nThe SAM file here is where your local\naccounts are gonna be stored so\n\n242\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.130\nnotice that every computer is gonna\nmanage and maintain its own SAM file.\n\n243\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.350\nAnd when you log on to a machine,\nthe local security authority\n\n244\n00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.130\nservice checks that your\ncredential is in that SAM file.\n\n245\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.150\nIt's a little bit different in\nthe domain environment because,\n\n246\n00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.240\nin the domain environment when you log\nonto a computer, it doesn't send it\n\n247\n00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.520\nto this local machine and say, hey, check\nout my username and credentials here.\n\n248\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.790\nIt sends it over to that\nother network machine and\n\n249\n00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.380\nit's that domain controller that\ndoes all the authentication.\n\n250\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.558\nSo as a recap, just remember, with a\ndomain environment you get the centralized\n\n251\n00:12:24.558 --> 00:12:28.244\nadministration, with the workgroup\nyou get a decentralized model and\n\n252\n00:12:28.244 --> 00:12:30.100\nit can increase the complexities.\n\n253\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.257\nBut it might be something that you don't\nworry about that because maybe you\n\n254\n00:12:33.257 --> 00:12:35.020\nare a small company so it has it's place.\n\n255\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.300\nIt's not like saying\ndon't use the work group,\n\n256\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.247\nbecause in certain circumstances\nyou don't have the money for\n\n257\n00:12:40.247 --> 00:12:44.040\nthe extra infrastructure, so you can use\na work group in a smaller environment.\n\n258\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.295\nBut it's just going to be a little bit,\nsometimes a little more tedious\n\n259\n00:12:47.295 --> 00:12:51.050\nto make sure that there's consistency in\nthe upkeep of that type of environment.\n\n260\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.979\n>> Yeah.\nIt is really nice to be able to use\n\n261\n00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:55.922\nthat centralized location\nwith the active directory,\n\n262\n00:12:55.922 --> 00:12:58.690\nit will use group policy\nthrough active directory.\n\n263\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.270\nMakes security a whole lot easier.\n\n264\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.006\nBut normally, if you are running\nin a work room environment,\n\n265\n00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:05.700\nyou don't have that many computers.\n\n266\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.195\nI think Microsoft recommends the user\nwork to up to about 10 computers.\n\n267\n00:13:09.195 --> 00:13:11.355\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, it's not that bad.\n\n268\n00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:14.306\nIt's just going to be a little\nmore an administrative task for\n\n269\n00:13:14.306 --> 00:13:16.930\nyou to go around and\nsecure all those work stations up.\n\n270\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.110\n>> Yeah, well sure, if you think about it,\nif you've got one user on ten computers,\n\n271\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.800\nthat's ten accounts that\nyou have to manage.\n\n272\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.840\nAnd then, I'm not going to get into math\nhere or I'll really embarrass myself.\n\n273\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.360\nBut then if you've got two users,\nnow you're up to 20 accounts.\n\n274\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.620\nYou might say, well, wait a second,\nit's the same two users.\n\n275\n00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.579\nBut remember,\n\n276\n00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:37.680\neach one of those individual computers\ndoesn't trust the next user's account.\n\n277\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.380\nSo two users now you're up to 20 accounts,\nthree, 30 and it just keeps going on.\n\n278\n00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.919\nIt's not a limitation of users,\nbut I'll tell you,\n\n279\n00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:48.150\nit is is limiting in your ability\nto manage it and maintain it.\n\n280\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.270\nEase of use,\nthat starts to go out the window.\n\n281\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.040\nSo they did set the limit and it's not\na bad limitation because once you start\n\n282\n00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.860\ngetting a little bit more complex it's\nalmost, for performance and consistency,\n\n283\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.240\nit's better to go to the client\nserver model anyways rather than that\n\n284\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.530\ndecentralized peer to peer environment,\nwhich is what your work group is.\n\n285\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.270\n>> That's right.\n\n286\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.944\nYou've probably end up spending\nthe money in people and\n\n287\n00:14:12.944 --> 00:14:18.575\nmanpower,on huge workgroup like that than\nyou would just buying a Server 2000,\n\n288\n00:14:18.575 --> 00:14:22.271\nwhatever, and\nsetting up an Active Directory domain.\n\n289\n00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:27.891\nEverything gets super, super easy when you\nhave one spot to manage everything from.\n\n290\n00:14:27.891 --> 00:14:28.451\nAll right, Wes.\n\n291\n00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:32.860\nSo is there anything else that we need\nto cover as far as security accounts?\n\n292\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.590\n>> No, I think we've got it all.\n\n293\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.536\nJust make sure that you're guarding your\naccounts with passwords no matter what\n\n294\n00:14:37.536 --> 00:14:38.200\nyour account is.\n\n295\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.804\nDoesn't matter if it's a Microsoft\naccount, if it's a local account,\n\n296\n00:14:40.804 --> 00:14:41.441\ndomain account.\n\n297\n00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:43.762\nKeep them secure,\nkeep the password secure,\n\n298\n00:14:43.762 --> 00:14:46.390\ndon't let people have\naccess to your information.\n\n299\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.126\nAnd regardless of the account you\nhave you'll maintain a little bit\n\n300\n00:14:49.126 --> 00:14:49.800\nmore security.\n\n301\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.910\nBut other than that,\nthat's about all I've got.\n\n302\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.010\n>> All right, well, thank you for\njoining us on the show today.\n\n303\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:54.630\n>> It's great, thank you.\n\n304\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.328\n>> And those great tips and advice that\nwe have as far as our accounts go.\n\n305\n00:14:58.328 --> 00:15:00.857\nHopefully, now you are a little\nmore schooled up than you were when\n\n306\n00:15:00.857 --> 00:15:01.409\nyou started.\n\n307\n00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:04.507\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n308\n00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:05.249\nDaniel Lowery.\n\n309\n00:15:05.249 --> 00:15:08.068\n>> And I'm West Bryan,

exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.015\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:21.414\nin this episode we're moving into\nmore Windows 10 security content.\n\n6\n00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:24.858\nThis time specifically talking\nabout application control and\n\n7\n00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.531\nmanagement to help keep\nthose desktops secure.\n\n8\n00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:28.830\nAnd here to join me in the studio and\n\n9\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.680\nhelp us lend his expertise on that's said\nsubject, is none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.690\nHow you doing today Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.283\n>> I'm doing good, it's good to be here\nand we're gonna be talking about how to\n\n12\n00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:42.042\ncontrol applications to make sure that\nthe applications that are running on your\n\n13\n00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.418\nmachine are the ones that\nyou expect them to be, and\n\n14\n00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:46.878\nwe've got many different\ntechnologies to do this.\n\n15\n00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:50.892\nOne of the technologies that we start\nout with is, one that's been around for\n\n16\n00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:51.400\na while.\n\n17\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.452\nIn fact, I think it started out back in\nWindows 7, and that's called AppLocker.\n\n18\n00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:01.144\nThe AppLocker features a good way that if\nyou you want to control what applications\n\n19\n00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:05.088\nyour users can or cannot use,\nyou can turn this on and it's a really,\n\n20\n00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:08.911\nreally good feature to implement\nonce you know how to get it set up.\n\n21\n00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.334\n>> Yeah, like you said AppLocker has\nbeen around for a little while and\n\n22\n00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:16.297\nis a fantastic way to keep our users from\ndoing things that they shouldn't do,\n\n23\n00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:17.940\nthey love to install software.\n\n24\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.190\nBut a lot of times,\nsome software can cause problems,\n\n25\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.928\nwhere not tested maybe it'll cause\nan issue, conflicts, those type of things.\n\n26\n00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:28.271\nNow Wes, AppLockers obviously,\nit's back here in Windows 10 but it is it\n\n27\n00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:31.685\nany different is it the same old same old\nor will can we expect from AppLocker?\n\n28\n00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:34.897\n>> Well, one of the things you can\nexpect from AppLocker is that,\n\n29\n00:01:34.897 --> 00:01:39.138\nit is an enterprise level technology, so\neven though it's available in Windows,\n\n30\n00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:41.275\nwe've got to be very careful when we say.\n\n31\n00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.643\nHow it or what edition of\nWindows is it available in?\n\n32\n00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:47.685\nKeep in mind, we have three different\neditions in Windows that are available.\n\n33\n00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:50.971\nOne of those is just the basic Windows 10.\n\n34\n00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.707\nIt's more of a home environment\ntype edition of Windows.\n\n35\n00:01:54.707 --> 00:01:57.405\nWe also have the Windows\n10 Professional or\n\n36\n00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:01.028\nPro, if you will, and\nAppLocker isn't available in that.\n\n37\n00:02:01.028 --> 00:02:04.361\nWith the home markets, they don't\nreally expect you to need some of\n\n38\n00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:08.399\nthese enterprise level technologies, so\nthat's why they don't build them in.\n\n39\n00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.773\nWhen you get to Professional,\nProfessional adds some additional security\n\n40\n00:02:11.773 --> 00:02:13.995\ntechnologies that's not\navailable in the home.\n\n41\n00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:17.839\nBut it doesn't give you the full\navailability of all the enterprise level\n\n42\n00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:18.710\ntechnologies.\n\n43\n00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.693\nSo, one of the things that you do want to\nkeep in mind is that AppLocker is only\n\n44\n00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:25.017\navailable in the Windows 10 enterprise.\n\n45\n00:02:25.017 --> 00:02:27.410\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you what that looks like here.\n\n46\n00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.225\nNow, when you're setting up the Windows 10\nAppLocker, turning it on and enabling it,\n\n47\n00:02:33.225 --> 00:02:38.519\nthere's a couple of things that you have\nto do inside of your domain environment.\n\n48\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.903\nAnd here on our server, I've already\ngot the group policy object open here.\n\n49\n00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:48.687\nNow group policy is where we're gonna\nmanage and maintain this, where we have to\n\n50\n00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:52.363\npush this out and implement it, and\nkeep in mind, it's not something that you\n\n51\n00:02:52.363 --> 00:02:56.059\ncan just configure with the local group\npolicy on the Windows 10 interface.\n\n52\n00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:00.589\nNow if we get into Policies,\nwe get into Windows Settings, and\n\n53\n00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.480\nthen Security Settings.\n\n54\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.400\nDown here at the bottom, you will see that\nthere's this application control policies.\n\n55\n00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.005\nRight under that is AppLocker.\n\n56\n00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.255\nNow I've gone ahead and\nset up a couple rules of here, and\n\n57\n00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:15.860\nyou can set up the rules that\nare relevant to your environment.\n\n58\n00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.310\nWhat I've done is gone ahead and\nset up a couple of executable rules.\n\n59\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.033\nWe're gonna make sure that certain members\ncan't execute a certain application here.\n\n60\n00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:29.351\nNow, one of the things you want to be\ncareful with is, when you do set up\n\n61\n00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.865\nAppLocker, you're gonna wanna make\nsure these default rules are here.\n\n62\n00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:37.365\nThe default rules are important because,\nyou need certain folders and\n\n63\n00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:40.800\ncertain groups to able to\nrun certain applications.\n\n64\n00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.740\nIf we block everything, then we can\nreally have a bad day at the office.\n\n65\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.035\nYou don't wanna block\neverything because if you do,\n\n66\n00:03:46.035 --> 00:03:47.876\nthen nothing's gonna run on the machine.\n\n67\n00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:52.374\nNow once that's set,\nwe can switch over to our client machine,\n\n68\n00:03:52.374 --> 00:03:55.552\nwe can see how AppLocker is gonna work for\nus.\n\n69\n00:03:55.552 --> 00:04:00.299\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nbrowse to the location,\n\n70\n00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.007\nwhere that executable is stored and\nwe'll go into admins here.\n\n71\n00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:08.707\nAnd I'm in an account that,\nif we've set this up right,\n\n72\n00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.384\nshouldn't be able to run BgInfo.\n\n73\n00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:15.170\nAnd if we double click on that,\nyou can see right here Dan,\n\n74\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.530\nthat it says, your systems administrator\nhas blocked this program and\n\n75\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.590\nthen it says, for more information\ncontact your systems administrator, so\n\n76\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.670\nthis is at the point where we\nstart to get help desk tickets and\n\n77\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.770\nwe're wondering, well, wait a second here.\n\n78\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.750\nI should be able to run this program,\nso you also might want to make sure that\n\n79\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.320\nyour users are aware of the fact that\nmaybe an application is blocked.\n\n80\n00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.680\nNow, why would you want to do this?\n\n81\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.275\nWhy might I want to block an application?\n\n82\n00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:43.230\nWell, this can be for\na couple different reasons.\n\n83\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.150\nIf you think about it,\none of the things that you can do is\n\n84\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.980\nblock an application because maybe\nyou have a license compliance,\n\n85\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.700\nyou don't want users bringing in,\nmaybe untested software or\n\n86\n00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.320\nmaybe even software that would run you\ninto some kind of license violation.\n\n87\n00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.540\nSo you can actually lock\nthis down to where you say.\n\n88\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.560\nRun this version of an application.\n\n89\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.830\nDon't run this version.\n\n90\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.000\nYou can see this a lot right, for\ninstance, if you have tried and\n\n91\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.950\ntrue tested applications, you don't have\nto worry about security vulnerabilities or\n\n92\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.270\nbugs or anything like that.\n\n93\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.394\nI mean, software has bugs,\neven the stuff that you've tested.\n\n94\n00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:18.727\nYou can ensure, and\nyou can lock it down and make sure that\n\n95\n00:05:18.727 --> 00:05:23.121\nyou have a consistency across\nthe workstations within your environment.\n\n96\n00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:27.153\nAnd that is good, because you wanna\nmake sure that you're aware of\n\n97\n00:05:27.153 --> 00:05:31.768\nthe applications that your end users\nare using on the workstations as well.\n\n98\n00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:34.709\nYou don't want the security\nvulnerabilities that can come in with\n\n99\n00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.967\nuntested software, so that's one of\nthe great things about AppLocker is\n\n100\n00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:41.140\nthe ability to say, all right,\nwe're gonna run these applications.\n\n101\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.731\nWe're gonna run this specific version of\nan application and again keep in mind,\n\n102\n00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:49.185\nI'm talking about blocking,\nyou can also do and allow too.\n\n103\n00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:53.841\nSo this is a allow or deny, you can base\nit on an individual user you could based\n\n104\n00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:57.852\non a group by default by the way,\ngenerically, it either allows or\n\n105\n00:05:57.852 --> 00:06:00.010\nblocks it for everybody.\n\n106\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.280\nSo be careful of that, when you don't\nwanna block all applications for\n\n107\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.680\neverybody because then you're gonna get\nmore help desk tickets probably in a day\n\n108\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.178\nthan you're really counted on.\n\n109\n00:06:09.178 --> 00:06:09.678\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n110\n00:06:09.678 --> 00:06:11.030\nSo this is really cool because it\n\n111\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.220\nbasically, that allows you to do a white\nlist and a black list in combination, so\n\n112\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.960\ndon't allow these to run but\nI definitely want these allowed to run.\n\n113\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.440\nSo you have to figure out what it is\nyou're gonna allow on your network.\n\n114\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.304\nAnd what you're gonna not allow, so\n\n115\n00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:28.021\na lot of times it can come\ndown to saying you know what.\n\n116\n00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:31.463\nI'm just gonna make these specific\napplications allowed, and\n\n117\n00:06:31.463 --> 00:06:33.670\neverything else is blocked, right?\n\n118\n00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.096\nThat's a good way to\ncontrol the environment.\n\n119\n00:06:35.096 --> 00:06:37.670\n>> It is and the other thing that\njust come to mind is dependencies.\n\n120\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.499\nIf you've got one piece of software\nthat's dependent on another one, and\n\n121\n00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:43.642\nyou block one application from running.\n\n122\n00:06:43.642 --> 00:06:46.220\nAnd that application's\nrunning in the background and\n\n123\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.740\nanother one is dependent on it.\n\n124\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.980\nSo do your testing and stuff.\n\n125\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.370\nYou might have to reconfigure\nyour AppLocker rules.\n\n126\n00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.460\nMake sure that you enforce them.\n\n127\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.140\nMake sure that you can configure them\nright, because while this could be a good\n\n128\n00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.073\nthing for you, if you don't configure them\nright, it might be a bad thing as well.\n\n129\n00:07:01.073 --> 00:07:03.075\n>> Yeah.\n\n130\n00:07:03.075 --> 00:07:06.906\nPlaces that people get software are not\njust the good old Internet with Windows\n\n131\n00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:08.356\nsince for a little while now,\n\n132\n00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:11.780\nthey have the Windows Store people\ncan grab applications from there,\n\n133\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.591\nlog into the Windows store,\nthat looks like a great app.\n\n134\n00:07:14.591 --> 00:07:16.613\nI gonna download that and install that.\n\n135\n00:07:16.613 --> 00:07:18.589\nBut, again it is software, and\n\n136\n00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:23.583\nwe're talking about controlling those\napplications, or we can and cannot do.\n\n137\n00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:26.300\nSo I guess that went the question Wes.\n\n138\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.569\nCan we control what gets downloaded and\ninstalled from the Windows?\n\n139\n00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:33.403\n>> Yeah, definitely,\nyou know in Windows 8, 8.1 they brought\n\n140\n00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:38.810\nin the Windows Store and in that operating\nsystem, it's something known as the.\n\n141\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.038\nWhat they run on they run a different\ncontext than your traditional\n\n142\n00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:47.493\napplications, they run in the context\nof your traditional full blown\n\n143\n00:07:47.493 --> 00:07:51.813\ndesktops run in the context of\nwhat's known as the the win32api.\n\n144\n00:07:51.813 --> 00:07:54.309\nWell today, they changed it a little bit.\n\n145\n00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:58.570\nAnd today,\nthey run in the context of what's known as\n\n146\n00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:04.740\nthe Windows Universal Application Platform\nand yes, you can control them.\n\n147\n00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.218\nThere's a couple different\nways that you can do this.\n\n148\n00:08:06.218 --> 00:08:10.983\nYou can do this inside of group policy,\nif you're in a domain environment.\n\n149\n00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:14.326\nYou can also do this through\nsomething known as assigned access,\n\n150\n00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:16.895\nif you're a local\nadministrator on the machine.\n\n151\n00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:19.956\nSo let's go ahead and\ncheck take a look at that there.\n\n152\n00:08:19.956 --> 00:08:23.067\nNow if you want to do assigned access,\n\n153\n00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:28.230\nmake sure that you log in as\na local administrator which I have.\n\n154\n00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.589\nI've logged In as a local administrator\nand then you can go to settings.\n\n155\n00:08:34.427 --> 00:08:37.360\nAnd then accounts.\n\n156\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.171\nAnd then, you have this family and\nother users.\n\n157\n00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:42.838\nNow, when you check family and\nother users here,\n\n158\n00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:46.160\nyou have the ability to\nset up signed access.\n\n159\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.332\nNow I've already gone ahead and\nI've assigned an account here.\n\n160\n00:08:48.332 --> 00:08:50.740\nLet's go ahead and show you exactly how.\n\n161\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.519\nWhen you first get in here,\nnotice that it says, choose an account.\n\n162\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.499\nChoose the account on the local\nmachine that you want to control, or\n\n163\n00:08:58.499 --> 00:09:02.721\na specific application, probably should\nstep back here a little bit it and say,\n\n164\n00:09:02.721 --> 00:09:04.670\nwhat does assigned access do for us?\n\n165\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:10.375\nWell, I can control this user\nby telling them when you log in,\n\n166\n00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:14.675\nyou only have this one\nWindows app available.\n\n167\n00:09:14.675 --> 00:09:16.086\nAnd you have nothing else.\n\n168\n00:09:16.086 --> 00:09:17.589\nSo that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n169\n00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:21.998\nLet's go ahead and we'll choose a local\naccount to set up Assigned Access.\n\n170\n00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:25.102\nThen we get to choose an app.\n\n171\n00:09:25.102 --> 00:09:29.160\nAll right, and with that app,\nI'll tell you what we'll do calculator.\n\n172\n00:09:31.661 --> 00:09:33.973\nThat's pretty that's pretty much it.\n\n173\n00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.638\nIt's fairly easy to set up.\n\n174\n00:09:35.638 --> 00:09:39.887\nNow, it's easy to set up, but one of\nthe things you have to keep in mind is,\n\n175\n00:09:39.887 --> 00:09:42.262\nthat when you lock Assigned Access down.\n\n176\n00:09:42.262 --> 00:09:43.415\nYou turn it on, you enable it.\n\n177\n00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:47.361\nYou say, this window store type app and\nonly this Windows app.\n\n178\n00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:49.630\nThat's all they're gonna get to use.\n\n179\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.840\nAnd we can demonstrate\nthat here real quick.\n\n180\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.060\nGo ahead and sign out, we'll sign out.\n\n181\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.860\nSign in as a standard user or\n\n182\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.640\nmore specifically the user that\nwe set up for Assigned Access.\n\n183\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.300\nKeep in mind, that you don't have to\nset this up for every standard user,\n\n184\n00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.190\nyou can do it on the user by user basis.\n\n185\n00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.980\nAll right.\n\n186\n00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.860\nAnd we'll log in here.\n\n187\n00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:14.200\nAll right, and\nnotice I seen the desktop just briefly and\n\n188\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.420\nthen all of a sudden, we got nothing.\n\n189\n00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.696\nAnd what I mean, well I can't say we\ngot nothing, we got the calculator but\n\n190\n00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:21.947\nthat's really all we have.\n\n191\n00:10:21.947 --> 00:10:25.048\nI've got some settings,\nI can change the different layouts and\n\n192\n00:10:25.048 --> 00:10:29.310\nscientific calculator, and\nwhat it is that you're calculating here.\n\n193\n00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.620\nBut past that,\nthat's the only thing I get access to.\n\n194\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.350\nAnd the only thing that I can do from\nhere is, I can do a Ctrl+Alt+Delete and\n\n195\n00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.810\nI can sign out as the end user.\n\n196\n00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.600\nAnd then I'll have to sign\nback in as a standard or\n\n197\n00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.690\nan administrative user, so it's good for\nus, if you think about a situation,\n\n198\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.490\nwhere maybe you've got some tablets\nthat are company based tablets and\n\n199\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:55.160\nthere's a specific application that\nyou want only those tablets to run.\n\n200\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.496\nAnd you pass them out your end users,\nwell this works very,\n\n201\n00:10:58.496 --> 00:11:02.368\nvery good because of the ability\nthat when they log into that tablet,\n\n202\n00:11:02.368 --> 00:11:05.264\nit's gonna be just\nthe application that you want.\n\n203\n00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:09.407\nAnd it's a good way for\ncompany based tablets if you want to.\n\n204\n00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:12.269\nYou can do this on\nthe workstation as well.\n\n205\n00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:15.698\nBut it's really gonna be up to what's\nrelevant for your environment,\n\n206\n00:11:15.698 --> 00:11:19.354\nbut if you wanna lock down the Windows\nStore, remember, GPOs, we can say,\n\n207\n00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:21.374\nno you don't even get access to the GPOs.\n\n208\n00:11:21.374 --> 00:11:23.199\nThe other thing I would say too is that,\n\n209\n00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:25.467\nyou can control this\nthrough AppLocker as well,\n\n210\n00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:29.448\nthat was one of the features that came in\nand Windows 8 and 8.1, it's continued in\n\n211\n00:11:29.448 --> 00:11:32.960\nWindows 10 is the ability to create\nwhat's known as a packaged app rule.\n\n212\n00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.240\nPackage app rules guys, just technical\njargon for a Windows Store app, so\n\n213\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.350\nif I wanna control this, I can say,\n\n214\n00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.458\nspecifically that I can go\na little bit more specific.\n\n215\n00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:44.227\nMaybe I don't wanna do like,\nwe see here assigned access and say,\n\n216\n00:11:44.227 --> 00:11:45.573\nthat's the only thing you get.\n\n217\n00:11:45.573 --> 00:11:46.574\nYou don't get anything else.\n\n218\n00:11:46.574 --> 00:11:49.853\nMaybe I just wanna say, okay,\nwell I'm gonna let you run this and this.\n\n219\n00:11:49.853 --> 00:11:51.419\nBut maybe not that one.\n\n220\n00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:56.434\nSo, it depends on how much of\nthe Window Store you wanna lock down.\n\n221\n00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:57.740\nDo you want to disable it altogether?\n\n222\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.954\nGo with the GPO.\n\n223\n00:11:58.954 --> 00:12:03.118\nYou wanna just make it to where it's only\none application that's gonna be available,\n\n224\n00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:04.384\ngo with assigned access.\n\n225\n00:12:04.384 --> 00:12:07.790\nYou want to pick and choose, use\nApp Locker and make a published app rule.\n\n226\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:12.127\n>> Yeah, very, very cool, it's a nice way\nto take some really fine tuned control\n\n227\n00:12:12.127 --> 00:12:15.429\nover your systems to make sure\nthat it is that mobile device,\n\n228\n00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:17.794\nmaybe it's a tablet they're taking out.\n\n229\n00:12:17.794 --> 00:12:19.511\nThey don't need every app in the world,\n\n230\n00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:21.532\nthey surely don't need\nto be installing apps,\n\n231\n00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:25.037\nespecially if it's something they check\nout and then return at the end of the day.\n\n232\n00:12:25.037 --> 00:12:28.645\nWhen we'd have to probably pay somebody\nand that'd be their whole job is to go\n\n233\n00:12:28.645 --> 00:12:31.100\nback through and clean off apps,\nthat'd be crazy.\n\n234\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.880\nNow we have that control to\nkeep that from happening and\n\n235\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.780\nif they do need a app we can go in,\nwe can allow it, whatever it is.\n\n236\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.000\nThey can petition for that and\nwe can make that happen.\n\n237\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.310\nSo it's a very nice thing to\nhave that level of control.\n\n238\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.140\nNow we're talking about software here and\nhow we can manage and\n\n239\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.640\ncontrol that software and we'd be remiss\nif we didn't bring up side loading, right?\n\n240\n00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.290\nSide loading is something\nthat we'd like to do.\n\n241\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.660\nA lot of businesses create their own day\nto day, they have a development team\n\n242\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.888\ncreate their own applications and\nthey wanna put that on their systems.\n\n243\n00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:03.563\nWell you're probably not just gonna\ngo into the Windows Store and go,\n\n244\n00:13:03.563 --> 00:13:04.943\noh well there's our app.\n\n245\n00:13:04.943 --> 00:13:07.511\nYou'd have to submit it,\nyou'd have to get it published there.\n\n246\n00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:10.967\nAnd that can cause some problems\nwhere side loading kinda\n\n247\n00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:12.840\ntakes away all that right now.\n\n248\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.590\nWe'll probably know another\ncompany that is very famous for\n\n249\n00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.070\ncontrolling what can and\ncannot be put on to their systems.\n\n250\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.130\nBut here we've relaxed\nthe rules little bit.\n\n251\n00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.826\n>> Side loading in Windows 10 has\nmade a big departure from the way it\n\n252\n00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:27.482\nwas in Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n253\n00:13:27.482 --> 00:13:31.894\nSee, in Windows 8 and 8.1 they were\nfollowing a model with a, like for\n\n254\n00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:36.451\ninstance Apple, Apple locks down their\nstore to only the apps that have been\n\n255\n00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:38.319\ndigitally signed and tested.\n\n256\n00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:41.622\nWell, that's the way Microsoft\nwent in Windows 8 and 8.1,\n\n257\n00:13:41.622 --> 00:13:45.372\nif you wanted to side load a,\nlet's say a line of business application.\n\n258\n00:13:45.372 --> 00:13:49.626\nYou'd have to go to Microsoft, and one of\nthe things that you would have to do is\n\n259\n00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:53.437\nget a side loading key, or\nyou'd have to get a developer's license.\n\n260\n00:13:53.437 --> 00:13:56.850\nIn Windows 8 and 8.1,\nthey've made it a lot easier.\n\n261\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.020\nToday, they've gone with more models\nthat you've seen in other operating\n\n262\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.660\nsystems where, if you do want\nto bypass the Windows Store.\n\n263\n00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.408\nAnd you want to download your application,\nyou can and\n\n264\n00:14:07.408 --> 00:14:08.553\nthey've made it fairly easy to do.\n\n265\n00:14:08.553 --> 00:14:15.746\nSo a big shift in the way Microsoft\ncontrols it from Windows 8.1 and today.\n\n266\n00:14:15.746 --> 00:14:17.450\nLet's go ahead and show you that.\n\n267\n00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.970\nIf you get in your Windows machine and\nyou go to your settings option,\n\n268\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:26.420\nyou can go to Update & Security,\nwhich I think it's kind of interesting.\n\n269\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.990\nUpdate & Security for side loading.\n\n270\n00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.370\nYou can turn around and\ngo to For developers now,\n\n271\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.440\ndon't let that confuse you, don't let\nthe For developers get in the way here.\n\n272\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.390\nIt's really for anybody who just doesn't\nwant to have to go to the Windows Store to\n\n273\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.640\nload these applications.\n\n274\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:47.440\nYou can turn the side loading on here,\nand it's gonna give you a warning.\n\n275\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.590\nRunning these applications outside\nof the Windows Store it's gonna\n\n276\n00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:57.230\nmaybe introduce some potential security\nrisks, maybe some systems instabilities.\n\n277\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.550\nBut at least today they do open it up but\nI could choose yes to this.\n\n278\n00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:04.076\n>> So this kind of starts off as\nthe default of being more secure than not.\n\n279\n00:15:04.076 --> 00:15:06.500\n>> Yeah, yep, that's exactly it.\n\n280\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.501\nLike I said, they've gone to more\ndifferent models today where if you want\n\n281\n00:15:10.501 --> 00:15:14.960\nto sideload an application if you want to\ndownload it outside of the Windows Store.\n\n282\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.151\nYou'll want to install it,\n\n283\n00:15:16.151 --> 00:15:18.689\nyou're more than welcome to do\nthat when it comes down to it.\n\n284\n00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:22.340\nJust keep in mind that you do run run\nthe risk of untested applications.\n\n285\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.180\nYou could cause problems and you could\nrun into some security vulnerabilities.\n\n286\n00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.755\nBut I tell you, Dan, today they've made\nit a lot easier to side load if you\n\n287\n00:15:29.755 --> 00:15:32.583\nneed to without going and\ngetting that side loading key and\n\n288\n00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:35.775\nall the other stuff that Windows 8 and\n8.1 restricted you to.\n\n289\n00:15:35.775 --> 00:15:39.646\n>> Yeah, now obviously, maybe we're\nhaving a line of business sample or\n\n290\n00:15:39.646 --> 00:15:41.960\njust wanna install something.\n\n291\n00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.500\nBut again,\nwe're talking about safety here.\n\n292\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.880\nObviously, it's warning us\nabout these these apps.\n\n293\n00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.552\nYou're saying you could just\ndownload it from anywhere.\n\n294\n00:15:49.552 --> 00:15:54.206\nWe're gonna allow you to do that, but\nbe warned, if you don't know who they are,\n\n295\n00:15:54.206 --> 00:15:56.917\nyou open yourself to\na possible security risk.\n\n296\n00:15:56.917 --> 00:15:59.501\nAnd that brings us into\ntrusted applications, right?\n\n297\n00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:03.997\nHow do we know this is a good app or\nthat's a good app other than just knowing?\n\n298\n00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:08.230\n>> Yeah, yeah, so\none of the things that you gotta know.\n\n299\n00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.360\nI'm thinking of the old Johnny Carson hat.\n\n300\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.780\nYou know, knowing what's in the envelope.\n\n301\n00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.380\n>> Yeah.\n\n302\n00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.922\n>> And that's why we've got a technology\nbuilt into Windows today that'll help us\n\n303\n00:16:16.922 --> 00:16:19.740\nout to recognize if\nan application is untrusted.\n\n304\n00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.775\nAnd it's a good thing to have because\nin context of, you know side loading,\n\n305\n00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:28.690\nat least make sure that you have what\nare known as trusted installation sources.\n\n306\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.700\nTrusted Installation Source means\nthat you know who the company is and\n\n307\n00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.630\nthat you trust the company.\n\n308\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.750\nAnd this is something\nthat works hand in hand.\n\n309\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:41.035\nYou know with side loading it also works\non all your other applications that\n\n310\n00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:43.085\nare downloaded over the Internet.\n\n311\n00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.120\nAnd let's go ahead and see that.\n\n312\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.890\nThat isn't something known\nas the smart screen filter.\n\n313\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.420\nAnd if we go to Start,\nand then Control Panel.\n\n314\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:57.670\nAnd then System and Security here,\nand then Security and Maintenance.\n\n315\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.180\nUnder the security option,\ndown towards the bottom.\n\n316\n00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.160\nYou'll see this window smart screen.\n\n317\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.020\nNow the Windows smart screen filter is\na very good way to keep your PC safe.\n\n318\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:14.110\nIt works with Internet Explorer,\nit works on a reputation database.\n\n319\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.400\nAnd it also will check that reputation\ndatabase that Microsoft maintains and\n\n320\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.720\nif there's an application that's on\nthat list that's known as untrusted.\n\n321\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.290\nSmart screen filter is going\nto make you aware of it and\n\n322\n00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.630\nit's going to give you a warning\nbefore you install an application\n\n323\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.060\nthat isn't known or doesn't come\nfrom a trusted installation source.\n\n324\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.850\n>> Yeah,\nit really seems a lot like the UAC, right?\n\n325\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.670\nIt's saying, hey,\nyou're trying to install some software.\n\n326\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.280\nDo you really want to do this kind of\nthing, right, it's giving you a warning.\n\n327\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.128\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n328\n00:17:40.128 --> 00:17:45.097\nFor instance, one of the things that it\nwill do right away is if the application\n\n329\n00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:47.072\ncomes from an unknown source.\n\n330\n00:17:47.072 --> 00:17:50.304\nIn fact, we cannot demonstrate that here.\n\n331\n00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:54.426\nif it comes from a source that isn't\nknown, it will warn you the UAC,\n\n332\n00:17:54.426 --> 00:17:58.778\nlike you were saying there, Dan,\nwill warn you and it will tell you hey.\n\n333\n00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:02.333\nYou might want to be careful installing\nthis application because it could cause\n\n334\n00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:05.010\nproblems, and\nwe'll see that here in a second.\n\n335\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.810\nNotice that the User Account Control\nis coming up and\n\n336\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.690\nit's warning me it's saying, hey,\nthere's an unknown publisher here.\n\n337\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:15.200\nSo the smart screen filter and the User\nAccount Control are working together to\n\n338\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.760\nto ensure that if an application\nisn't digitally signed, and\n\n339\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.190\nit isn't recognized by the publisher, that\nit's gonna warn you before you install it.\n\n340\n00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.733\nNow there are a couple of other\noptions that you can do in the smart\n\n341\n00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:32.110\nscreen filter, but\nbe very careful because of the fact that,\n\n342\n00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.247\nif you do disable\nthe warning ahead of time.\n\n343\n00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:39.729\nNotice it says get administrator approval\nbefore running unrecognized apps, and\n\n344\n00:18:39.729 --> 00:18:42.674\nthen it says warn before\nrunning unrecognized apps but\n\n345\n00:18:42.674 --> 00:18:45.730\ndon't require administrator\nlevel approval.\n\n346\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.250\nThe last one just shuts it off,\nwe know that's not good.\n\n347\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.620\nSo what this is gonna do is it's\ngonna say if you don't understand,\n\n348\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.980\nif you don't recognize the application,\nthat second setting.\n\n349\n00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.810\nGo ahead and just warn you but\n\n350\n00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:00.790\nagain it's not gonna require the\nadministrative level elevation to install.\n\n351\n00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.698\nIt's not something that's\nrecommended honestly,\n\n352\n00:19:02.698 --> 00:19:05.631\nI would tell you if you want this one to\nwork and function function appropriately.\n\n353\n00:19:05.631 --> 00:19:10.610\nI would keep it at the default, and\nset it and forget it because again.\n\n354\n00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.913\nErr on the side of security rather\nthan reduce the level of security, but\n\n355\n00:19:13.913 --> 00:19:17.286\nsmart spring filter does work hand in\nhand with the User Account Control.\n\n356\n00:19:17.286 --> 00:19:20.303\nTrying to keep the applications as\nyou download on your PC a little bit\n\n357\n00:19:20.303 --> 00:19:20.830\nmore safe.\n\n358\n00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.866\n>> Very good, thank you, Microsoft for\nlooking out for our best interests when\n\n359\n00:19:24.866 --> 00:19:28.680\nit comes to our foolishness when\ndownloading and installing programs.\n\n360\n00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.240\nAs, we are that way, unfortunately.\n\n361\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.896\nNow talking about the ultimate\nin control and yet\n\n362\n00:19:33.896 --> 00:19:38.455\ncool when it comes to application\ncontrol is the remote app.\n\n363\n00:19:38.455 --> 00:19:42.665\nThis is by far one of the coolest things\nMicrosoft has done in a long time,\n\n364\n00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:43.916\nI really enjoy this.\n\n365\n00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:49.380\nAnd the security that's inherent to it\nin the just the way it works is very,\n\n366\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.527\nvery helpful.\n\n367\n00:19:50.527 --> 00:19:52.159\nKeeping our users out of out of trouble,\n\n368\n00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:54.180\nout of doing stuff that\nthey shouldn't be doing.\n\n369\n00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.507\nAnd Wes, you're going to show us\nactually how this actually works, right?\n\n370\n00:19:57.507 --> 00:20:03.567\n>> Yeah and this, I can agree with Dan,\nthis thing is an amazing program.\n\n371\n00:20:03.567 --> 00:20:07.813\nImagine the ability that if your local\nmachine doesn't have the resources to run\n\n372\n00:20:07.813 --> 00:20:11.508\na certain application or maybe you\ndon't want to install it locally.\n\n373\n00:20:11.508 --> 00:20:15.581\nImagine giving somebody the ability\nto connect to another environment,\n\n374\n00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:19.070\nrun that application, and\nit's not even installed locally.\n\n375\n00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.620\nLet's check out how that works.\n\n376\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.850\nSo I've got the application\nthis is running in Azure here.\n\n377\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.410\nAnd let me go ahead, and\nwe've got our website.\n\n378\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.097\nAnd you have to download a client\nahead of time for this to work and\n\n379\n00:20:35.097 --> 00:20:38.938\nif you scroll down at the bottom\nyou'll see this download client.\n\n380\n00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:42.564\nNow you might be asking yourself well\nwhy didn't you have this ready to go\n\n381\n00:20:42.564 --> 00:20:43.285\nbefore hand?\n\n382\n00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:46.650\nWell I want to show you that\nit's more of a click to run.\n\n383\n00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.234\nIt's available when you\nconnect to the cloud and\n\n384\n00:20:50.234 --> 00:20:53.650\nit installs the moment\nyou connect the Azure.\n\n385\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:59.166\nAnd as you can see it,\ndoesn't take too long.\n\n386\n00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:04.650\nAnd like I said the great thing about this\nis, this application is going to run and\n\n387\n00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.296\nyou'll see here in a second\nthe entire Office Suite.\n\n388\n00:21:08.296 --> 00:21:11.076\nAnd Office isn't even going\nto be installed locally and\n\n389\n00:21:11.076 --> 00:21:14.979\nthat's one of the things that I think is\nkind of fascinating that the ability to\n\n390\n00:21:14.979 --> 00:21:17.750\nhave access to,\nyou know a suite of applications.\n\n391\n00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.710\nEven when they're not installed\non your local machine.\n\n392\n00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.820\n>> So very cool that we're able to\nuse smart screen to give us a little\n\n393\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.060\nwarning let us know hey you're trying\nto sell some software and maybe it's\n\n394\n00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.970\na good idea maybe it's not, just\nanother level of security on that end.\n\n395\n00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.675\nAnd now another way in which we can\nprovide some security is by isolation,\n\n396\n00:21:34.675 --> 00:21:38.097\nto separate it out so that we don't\neven have to worry about things.\n\n397\n00:21:38.097 --> 00:21:40.633\nWe do this a lot in\na corporate environment.\n\n398\n00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:45.146\nAnd what we're gonna use to do\nthat is going to be Hyper-V,\n\n399\n00:21:45.146 --> 00:21:51.390\nthe virtualization software built inside\nof the Microsoft operating systems.\n\n400\n00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:54.950\nNow we can really go all\nout with this thing.\n\n401\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.068\nWe can create entire test beds,\nand start testing make sure that,\n\n402\n00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:01.640\nmaybe the software that runs slow and\nmaybe it's gonna cause some trouble.\n\n403\n00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.857\nMaybe we think there's a virus,\n\n404\n00:22:03.857 --> 00:22:08.940\nsegregating that out using the Hyper-V\nsoftware is a really nice feature.\n\n405\n00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.670\nWes, what else can we do with Hyper-V?\n\n406\n00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.660\n>> Yeah, well, one of the great\nthings you can do is imagine you have\n\n407\n00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.920\nan older operating system.\n\n408\n00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.640\nMaybe your company is considering moving,\nor maybe has moved, into Windows 10 but\n\n409\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.710\nyou need some backwards compatibility\nwith an earlier operating system.\n\n410\n00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.030\nTo run an Application that maybe\nisn't really tested yet fully or\n\n411\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.840\nmaybe not fully functional on Windows 10.\n\n412\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.710\nWell that's one of the great things that\nyou can do you can run multiple with\n\n413\n00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.410\nclient hyper-V.\n\n414\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.770\nYou get the ability to run multiple\nvirtual machines these isolated\n\n415\n00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.635\ninstances of operating systems\nhere on a single physical device.\n\n416\n00:22:42.635 --> 00:22:46.262\nNow for instance,\nI have on my Windows 10 machine here.\n\n417\n00:22:46.262 --> 00:22:50.671\nI'm actually running Windows 8.1 and maybe\nthere's an application here that I want to\n\n418\n00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:53.665\nbe able to run and\nI don't want it to interfere with the way.\n\n419\n00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:57.234\n>> Windows 10 machine that has been\ndeployed to maybe my workstation, so\n\n420\n00:22:57.234 --> 00:22:58.175\nI get the ability.\n\n421\n00:22:58.175 --> 00:22:59.015\nI could do that,\n\n422\n00:22:59.015 --> 00:23:02.445\nI can get backwards compatibility\nwith an older operating system.\n\n423\n00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:06.779\nI also get the ability that for\nthings like application coexistence.\n\n424\n00:23:06.779 --> 00:23:07.995\nMaybe I don't want to.\n\n425\n00:23:07.995 --> 00:23:13.182\nMaybe I wanna run Windows 10 and\nI want to test an application\n\n426\n00:23:13.182 --> 00:23:18.092\nthat we're not really sure if\nwe wanna move forward with.\n\n427\n00:23:18.092 --> 00:23:21.822\nWell, as you guys will probably know in\nand Dan, I'm sure you're aware of this.\n\n428\n00:23:21.822 --> 00:23:24.697\nIf I have an older application\nthat maybe is the tried and\n\n429\n00:23:24.697 --> 00:23:28.895\ntrue application that we've been using for\na while and it's ready to go.\n\n430\n00:23:28.895 --> 00:23:30.825\nWell, if I install, let's say, for\n\n431\n00:23:30.825 --> 00:23:35.645\ninstance, I run through this\ninstaller here and I want to trust or\n\n432\n00:23:35.645 --> 00:23:40.595\nI want to test this new\npiece of software here.\n\n433\n00:23:40.595 --> 00:23:42.829\nWell, as you guys know out there.\n\n434\n00:23:42.829 --> 00:23:46.875\nOnce this new installer runs,\nit'll typically do one of two things.\n\n435\n00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:52.246\nIt's gonna overwrite the earlier edition\nof this application I'm running or\n\n436\n00:23:52.246 --> 00:23:57.468\nit's gonna require you to remove it and\nI guess there would be a third thing.\n\n437\n00:23:57.468 --> 00:24:01.695\nIt might just upgrade it all together and\nnow you don't really have the ability\n\n438\n00:24:01.695 --> 00:24:04.718\nto run these applications\nside by side in testing them.\n\n439\n00:24:04.718 --> 00:24:08.668\nIf I do this in an in virtual\nenvironment like I have right here,\n\n440\n00:24:08.668 --> 00:24:11.067\nthen I can run the older potentially.\n\n441\n00:24:11.067 --> 00:24:15.697\nIf this is good for you guys like I could,\nrelevant for your environment,\n\n442\n00:24:15.697 --> 00:24:20.325\nthen what I can do is I can run the older\nversion inside of my host machine and\n\n443\n00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:25.573\nI can run the newer version, like we're\ndoing here inside of the virtual machine.\n\n444\n00:24:25.573 --> 00:24:30.532\nAnd one of the great things that this\ndoes is it isolates that application\n\n445\n00:24:30.532 --> 00:24:32.808\ninside of the virtual machine and\n\n446\n00:24:32.808 --> 00:24:38.437\nwe don't get that conflicting nature of\nwhen you are moving to a new application.\n\n447\n00:24:38.437 --> 00:24:41.840\nYou don't have to worry about\nit overwriting the older one and\n\n448\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.681\nI get the ability to test better.\n\n449\n00:24:43.681 --> 00:24:47.682\nNow one of the great things that\nyou also get inside the Hyper-V,\n\n450\n00:24:47.682 --> 00:24:52.656\nas well is you get the ability to isolate\ncommunications if you want to likewise.\n\n451\n00:24:52.656 --> 00:24:55.453\nSo if you have your Hyper-V console open,\n\n452\n00:24:55.453 --> 00:25:00.361\nthen one of the things that you can do\nhere is going to the Hyper-V console.\n\n453\n00:25:00.361 --> 00:25:03.081\nOh and you know I should mention this and\nI didn't mention this.\n\n454\n00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:05.512\nThis is a feature, by the way,\nthat needs to be turned on.\n\n455\n00:25:05.512 --> 00:25:08.137\nSo if you guys are looking for\nyour Hyper-V manager and\n\n456\n00:25:08.137 --> 00:25:09.630\nyou don't find it right away.\n\n457\n00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.640\nKeep in mind,\nit's available in the Pro edition,\n\n458\n00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.430\nit's available in the enterprise edition.\n\n459\n00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.168\nBut to turn this on to even\nstart using this functionality,\n\n460\n00:25:17.168 --> 00:25:22.176\nyou gotta go to programs and features and\nthen you turn features on or off and then\n\n461\n00:25:22.176 --> 00:25:27.448\nyou'll see an option right here that says,\nenable if you will or turn on Hyper-V.\n\n462\n00:25:27.448 --> 00:25:30.184\nSo that's probably one of\nthe things you should know,\n\n463\n00:25:30.184 --> 00:25:33.648\nif you want to use this software,\nyou've got to enable the feature.\n\n464\n00:25:33.648 --> 00:25:37.654\nNow, I also get the ability to\ncreate virtualized communications.\n\n465\n00:25:37.654 --> 00:25:39.530\nWe call them virtual switches and\n\n466\n00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.888\ndepending on the communication that\nyou want, you have three options here.\n\n467\n00:25:43.888 --> 00:25:47.874\nIf I want the virtual machines just\nto communicate between themselves,\n\n468\n00:25:47.874 --> 00:25:50.371\nmaybe there's a you know there's a reason.\n\n469\n00:25:50.371 --> 00:25:54.835\nI don't want this application\ncommunicating with the rest of the network\n\n470\n00:25:54.835 --> 00:25:59.299\nmaybe at all cause conflicts with\nthe current version of an application,\n\n471\n00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:03.918\nthen I can test that by just communicating\nwith just the internal machines.\n\n472\n00:26:03.918 --> 00:26:06.453\nAnd what we mean by that is just\nthe virtual machines like my\n\n473\n00:26:06.453 --> 00:26:09.166\nWindows eight point one machine and\nmy Windows 10 machine.\n\n474\n00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:10.611\nThey can communicate together, but\n\n475\n00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:13.603\nthey're not gonna interfere with\nthe rest of the network communications.\n\n476\n00:26:13.603 --> 00:26:15.713\nNow that might not be something you want,\n\n477\n00:26:15.713 --> 00:26:18.255\nyou might wanna go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n478\n00:26:18.255 --> 00:26:22.254\nMaybe you want, for instance, maybe I do\nwant the virtual machines to be able to\n\n479\n00:26:22.254 --> 00:26:24.776\ntalk with my host Windows\n10 operating system.\n\n480\n00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:28.461\nAnd I can tell you one of the things that\nI use this for is maybe if you wanna share\n\n481\n00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:32.433\na piece of software inside of the virtual\nmachine, we need a way to communicate with\n\n482\n00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:35.872\nthe host operating system that these\nvirtual machines are running on.\n\n483\n00:26:35.872 --> 00:26:39.265\nSo it does give you the ability\nto do that, likewise.\n\n484\n00:26:39.265 --> 00:26:41.714\nThe last one we have\nto be careful with and\n\n485\n00:26:41.714 --> 00:26:45.113\nthis one actually does what\nthey call as Nick Bridging.\n\n486\n00:26:45.113 --> 00:26:49.799\nThis is going to allow communications\njust like any other physical\n\n487\n00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:51.564\ndevice on your network.\n\n488\n00:26:51.564 --> 00:26:53.422\nSo you have to be careful with this one.\n\n489\n00:26:53.422 --> 00:26:57.976\nBecause when you enable this one her,\nyou're gonna allow these virtual machines\n\n490\n00:26:57.976 --> 00:27:01.146\nto communicate not only with\nthe host operating system,\n\n491\n00:27:01.146 --> 00:27:03.009\nbut with the rest of the network.\n\n492\n00:27:03.009 --> 00:27:06.771\nNow for testing purposes and application\ntesting, you might have to do that.\n\n493\n00:27:06.771 --> 00:27:08.308\nYou might wanna figure out,\n\n494\n00:27:08.308 --> 00:27:11.969\ncan this application communicate\nthe way I want it to communicate?\n\n495\n00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:15.001\nMaybe it is a network aware\napplication that you're testing and\n\n496\n00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:18.822\nyou can't just restricted to internal\ncommunications, because that doesn't\n\n497\n00:27:18.822 --> 00:27:22.416\naccurately test how the product is going\nto work with your environment, but\n\n498\n00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:23.785\nyou just have to be careful.\n\n499\n00:27:23.785 --> 00:27:28.069\nBecause when you implement one of these\nexternal switches as they call it,\n\n500\n00:27:28.069 --> 00:27:31.402\njust think of it as communications\nlike any other device.\n\n501\n00:27:31.402 --> 00:27:35.196\nIt is no different than reaching out and\nplugging in a physical cable to the wall.\n\n502\n00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:38.772\nAnd now you've got some network activity,\nyou've got some link lights.\n\n503\n00:27:38.772 --> 00:27:40.809\nSo you have to be careful with this and\n\n504\n00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:44.704\none of the other really cool features\nabout for application testing.\n\n505\n00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:48.218\nIn fact, we use this a lot here is\nthe ability to take what's known as\n\n506\n00:27:48.218 --> 00:27:49.029\na checkpoint.\n\n507\n00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:53.615\nIf I want to test a certain\napplication and I want to test it, but\n\n508\n00:27:53.615 --> 00:27:56.995\nI want to wait to roll back the changes.\n\n509\n00:27:56.995 --> 00:28:00.651\nMaybe we figured out that hey,\nthis application does exactly what\n\n510\n00:28:00.651 --> 00:28:03.733\nwe wanted to do or\nmaybe it doesn't do what we want to do.\n\n511\n00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:06.241\nMaybe I've just done and\nI can do this with the best of them,\n\n512\n00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:07.954\nI'm just completely ruin the machine.\n\n513\n00:28:07.954 --> 00:28:08.983\nHosed it all up.\n\n514\n00:28:08.983 --> 00:28:10.119\n>> Doing the opposite of what we wanna do.\n\n515\n00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:12.824\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right bringing the machine.\n\n516\n00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:16.725\nWell, you get the ability if you\nwant that to roll back the changes.\n\n517\n00:28:16.725 --> 00:28:18.025\nThey call them checkpoints.\n\n518\n00:28:18.025 --> 00:28:21.748\nIf you're familiar with Windows 8 and\n8.1 out there.\n\n519\n00:28:21.748 --> 00:28:23.884\nFor the longest time,\nthey called them snapshots, guys.\n\n520\n00:28:23.884 --> 00:28:26.576\nCheckpoint snapshots,\nthey just renamed it.\n\n521\n00:28:26.576 --> 00:28:29.617\nIt's a new coat of paint\nover the same technology,\n\n522\n00:28:29.617 --> 00:28:32.245\nso don't let the jargon confuse you there.\n\n523\n00:28:32.245 --> 00:28:34.251\nBut App-V is a or not App-V,\n\n524\n00:28:34.251 --> 00:28:39.229\n[LAUGH] Hyper-V is a very very good way\nthat you can test bed your software on\n\n525\n00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:43.583\nthe client without having to have\nthe server grade technology.\n\n526\n00:28:43.583 --> 00:28:47.745\nSee prior to Windows 8 and 8.1,\nthen continues in Windows 10 here.\n\n527\n00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:51.696\nIf we use App-V or\nI keep saying App-V, Hyper-V.\n\n528\n00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:52.677\nLet's get the right V right.\n\n529\n00:28:52.677 --> 00:28:55.011\n>> [LAUGH] That's right\n>> [LAUGH] If you were gonna use Hyper-V,\n\n530\n00:28:55.011 --> 00:28:57.255\nyou'd have to install\na server operating system and\n\n531\n00:28:57.255 --> 00:28:58.944\nthen you'd have to test it from there.\n\n532\n00:28:58.944 --> 00:29:03.041\nThis also gives you a good way too is\nmaybe you're testing an application that's\n\n533\n00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:04.135\nrunning on a server.\n\n534\n00:29:04.135 --> 00:29:07.556\nWe've been really just talking about\nthe client side aspect of this, but\n\n535\n00:29:07.556 --> 00:29:11.379\nmaybe I'm testing or I need to test an\napplication that's running on the server.\n\n536\n00:29:11.379 --> 00:29:12.745\nSo what can I do?\n\n537\n00:29:12.745 --> 00:29:16.222\nI can take and export that virtual\nmachine right off of the server,\n\n538\n00:29:16.222 --> 00:29:18.533\nimport it down here to the client Hyper-V.\n\n539\n00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:21.874\nTest it if I want,\nsee how the communication works.\n\n540\n00:29:21.874 --> 00:29:25.818\nAgain, be careful with you giving access\nto the network as it can ruin the network\n\n541\n00:29:25.818 --> 00:29:29.356\njust like [LAUGH] any other line of\nbusiness software might do if you don't\n\n542\n00:29:29.356 --> 00:29:30.403\nconfigure it right.\n\n543\n00:29:30.403 --> 00:29:31.837\nAnd then once I've tested it,\n\n544\n00:29:31.837 --> 00:29:35.366\nI can turn around and I can import it\nbackup to the production environment and\n\n545\n00:29:35.366 --> 00:29:38.972\nI don't have to worry, hopefully,\nof bringing down a production network.\n\n546\n00:29:38.972 --> 00:29:44.079\nSo very, very good and handy thing to\nhave built-in to the operating system.\n\n547\n00:29:44.079 --> 00:29:48.073\nThere's other virtualization technologies,\nbut one of the things that we've been\n\n548\n00:29:48.073 --> 00:29:51.678\nfocusing on a lot as we've gone through\nWindows 10 security is the fact that\n\n549\n00:29:51.678 --> 00:29:55.013\nwe've got on board management and\nwe don't have to go to a third party.\n\n550\n00:29:55.013 --> 00:29:57.797\nSome of the third party\ntechnologies might be a lot better.\n\n551\n00:29:57.797 --> 00:29:59.512\nBut if you don't have the money,\n\n552\n00:29:59.512 --> 00:30:02.888\nyou can always go with what's\nright here inside of Windows 10.\n\n553\n00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:05.756\n>> Yeah, that's right and\nI really like virtual environments for\n\n554\n00:30:05.756 --> 00:30:07.562\ntesting possible malicious software,\n\n555\n00:30:07.562 --> 00:30:10.658\ncuz I can isolate it from the rest of\nmy network and still work with it.\n\n556\n00:30:10.658 --> 00:30:14.362\nI just cut off all network\nties to my virtual machine,\n\n557\n00:30:14.362 --> 00:30:19.564\ninstall the software, maybe using a CD or\na USB key or something like that.\n\n558\n00:30:19.564 --> 00:30:21.466\nPut that in there,\nrun it and see what it does.\n\n559\n00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:23.004\nSee if I start getting problems.\n\n560\n00:30:23.004 --> 00:30:26.260\nIf everything checks out,\nthen I can allow that software to be used.\n\n561\n00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.913\nIf not, I know, hey,\nwe need to block this software.\n\n562\n00:30:28.913 --> 00:30:31.821\nUsing some of the techniques\nthat we talked about earlier and\n\n563\n00:30:31.821 --> 00:30:32.912\nkeep that bad guy off.\n\n564\n00:30:32.912 --> 00:30:36.838\nMy network, obviously, we're also running\nantivirus and things like that, but\n\n565\n00:30:36.838 --> 00:30:39.263\nit's nice to beat it to\nthe punch if you can do that.\n\n566\n00:30:39.263 --> 00:30:43.937\n>> Yeah and you when you said, security\none of the things I should mention here.\n\n567\n00:30:43.937 --> 00:30:46.756\nIf you're going to be using Hyper-V\nsecurity is a big thing that\n\n568\n00:30:46.756 --> 00:30:48.020\nyou've got to keep in mind.\n\n569\n00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.994\nYour virtual machines need the same level\nof security as any other operating system\n\n570\n00:30:52.994 --> 00:30:54.645\ndoes and even even more.\n\n571\n00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:58.228\nSo that's important if you're going to\nconnect them to the rest of your network.\n\n572\n00:30:58.228 --> 00:31:01.612\nSo keep in mind if you're gonna allow\nthese to communicate with the entire\n\n573\n00:31:01.612 --> 00:31:05.391\nnetwork, you're gonna wanna have make\nsure your windows defender is turned on.\n\n574\n00:31:05.391 --> 00:31:09.385\nIf you don't use Windows Defender,\ndownload something that you are gonna use.\n\n575\n00:31:09.385 --> 00:31:13.747\nMake sure that the firewall is turned on,\nbecause these virtual machines even though\n\n576\n00:31:13.747 --> 00:31:17.988\nwe know them as virtualized software, they\nrun like any other physical machine and\n\n577\n00:31:17.988 --> 00:31:22.255\nthey can open up security vulnerabilities\nand exploits if you don't secure them.\n\n578\n00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:24.954\n>> Yeah, I've even known a lot of\npeople that will help put it on.\n\n579\n00:31:24.954 --> 00:31:26.585\nSay, I have my own device, right.\n\n580\n00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:30.061\nI work for a company and I have my own\nlaptop and I don't see any reason to buy\n\n581\n00:31:30.061 --> 00:31:33.274\na separate laptop or have to get one\nfrom them or anything like that.\n\n582\n00:31:33.274 --> 00:31:37.372\nI can bring my laptop in,\nhave the IT department install Hyper-V.\n\n583\n00:31:37.372 --> 00:31:41.933\nGet the virtualization software running,\nbuild me a business virtual\n\n584\n00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:45.969\nmachine that's only able to\nconnect to our business network.\n\n585\n00:31:45.969 --> 00:31:47.548\nSo when I bring it in, I attach it.\n\n586\n00:31:47.548 --> 00:31:50.290\nIt sees those machines, but\nit doesn't see anything else.\n\n587\n00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.246\nSo when I take it home,\nit's not gonna attach to my local network.\n\n588\n00:31:52.246 --> 00:31:54.942\nCuz I'm a regular user,\nI don't know how to do that.\n\n589\n00:31:54.942 --> 00:31:56.898\nThat keeps those two things separate.\n\n590\n00:31:56.898 --> 00:32:01.683\nI can run all the home stuff, hose my\nmachine to high heaven if I feel like it.\n\n591\n00:32:01.683 --> 00:32:05.165\nBut I never touch the business side\nof that virtualization software,\n\n592\n00:32:05.165 --> 00:32:07.535\nbecause they're separated and\nisolated out.\n\n593\n00:32:07.535 --> 00:32:09.717\nIt's a really, really smart way to go.\n\n594\n00:32:09.717 --> 00:32:11.761\nIt is very helpful when\nit comes to security.\n\n595\n00:32:11.761 --> 00:32:13.115\n>> Yeah and I'm the same way.\n\n596\n00:32:13.115 --> 00:32:15.836\nI just like being able to\nundo the changes there, so\n\n597\n00:32:15.836 --> 00:32:19.019\nthat if Wes is configuring\nsomething without his glasses.\n\n598\n00:32:19.019 --> 00:32:23.995\n[LAUGH] We can always undo those changes\nand I tell you that has helped save me\n\n599\n00:32:23.995 --> 00:32:29.373\nmore times than I can tell you, especially\nwhen you make that one configuration\n\n600\n00:32:29.373 --> 00:32:34.845\nchange that everything goes as unexpected\nI should say and not in a the good way.\n\n601\n00:32:34.845 --> 00:32:39.106\nAnd [LAUGH] you need to get back online to\nget back testing again rather than having\n\n602\n00:32:39.106 --> 00:32:42.745\nto wait to reinstall an operating system,\nconfigure everything.\n\n603\n00:32:42.745 --> 00:32:45.747\nAll we do is revert to that checkpoint\nto an earlier place and time,\n\n604\n00:32:45.747 --> 00:32:48.715\nyou're backup and running again and\nbefore you know it you can.\n\n605\n00:32:48.715 --> 00:32:49.835\nWell, break it again if you need to.\n\n606\n00:32:49.835 --> 00:32:51.011\n>> That's right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n607\n00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:52.271\n>> Well, everyone now.\n\n608\n00:32:52.271 --> 00:32:55.559\nWes is there anything else we need to\ncover when it comes to application\n\n609\n00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:56.737\nsafety and management?\n\n610\n00:32:56.737 --> 00:32:59.143\n>> Just pay attention\nto the configurations,\n\n611\n00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:02.594\nmake sure that you can figure\nout a blocker rules effectively.\n\n612\n00:33:02.594 --> 00:33:07.476\nBe aware of how it affects other\napps within your network in the.\n\n613\n00:33:07.476 --> 00:33:10.500\nSame thing goes with the client Hyper V.\n\n614\n00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.744\nIf you're going to use client Hyper-V,\nyou're gonna give access to the network.\n\n615\n00:33:13.744 --> 00:33:16.306\nRemember, those virtual machines\nalso have to be secure and\n\n616\n00:33:16.306 --> 00:33:19.623\nit is important to make sure that you\nimplement any other the host security that\n\n617\n00:33:19.623 --> 00:33:22.556\nwe've been talking about as we've\nbeen going through this series.\n\n618\n00:33:22.556 --> 00:33:25.209\nYou're gonna wanna implement it\ninside of the virtual machines.\n\n619\n00:33:25.209 --> 00:33:26.564\nBut other than that, I think we're good.\n\n620\n00:33:26.564 --> 00:33:28.476\n>> Excellent suggestions, everyone, so\n\n621\n00:33:28.476 --> 00:33:30.790\nfollow the wise words of\nmy good friend Wes here.\n\n622\n00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.284\nThanks for joining us today, Wes.\n\n623\n00:33:32.284 --> 00:33:34.240\n>> Thank you.\n>> Thank you guys for watching.\n\n624\n00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.336\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.218\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:22.134\nin this episode we're coming at you\nwith some more Windows 10 security.\n\n6\n00:00:22.134 --> 00:00:25.530\nSpecifically here we're gonna\ntalk about certificates.\n\n7\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.870\nHow can you use those to\nstay a little more secure?\n\n8\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.114\nAnd joining me in the studio today\nto help us go over that topic,\n\n9\n00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.251\nlend his expertise on it,\nis none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:34.959\nHow you doing today, Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:35.794\n>> I'm doing good, man.\n\n12\n00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:36.723\nIt's great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:38.001\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.661\nAnd this is a good episode.\n\n15\n00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:43.847\nI tell you guys maybe you connected\nto Internet sites out there, and\n\n16\n00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:48.590\nmaybe you've got warnings before that say,\nhey don't go to this website.\n\n17\n00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.190\nOr maybe you've seen before\nwhen you browse to a website,\n\n18\n00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.130\nyou've seen a little green hue come\nacross the top of that address bar.\n\n19\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.590\nWell what is that all about,\nwhat does that mean for us?\n\n20\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.029\nWell, believe it or not, in the background\nsomething that we as end users sometimes\n\n21\n00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:07.293\ndon't see is the concept of a certificate\nthat's being used to prove identity.\n\n22\n00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:12.523\nNow this is a really world wide model\nof trust that we talk about because if\n\n23\n00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:18.643\nyou think about it there are hundreds of\nthousands, right, of websites out there.\n\n24\n00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:21.780\nSo how do we know which ones we can and\ncan't trust?\n\n25\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.153\nAnd how do we know that when we do\nvisit a website that when it presents\n\n26\n00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:29.087\na certificate to us,\nthat it is valid or not?\n\n27\n00:01:29.087 --> 00:01:32.309\nWell, that's some of the things\nthat we're gonna dive in today.\n\n28\n00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:35.691\nAnd one of the things that we\nhave to kinda set the stage for\n\n29\n00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:40.064\nis knowing the difference of where\ncertificates can be be applied to, and\n\n30\n00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:43.180\nreally even what a digital certificate is.\n\n31\n00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.041\nSee a digital certificate for us very\nbasically is the way we can encrypt\n\n32\n00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.177\ninformation, we can prove identity.\n\n33\n00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:52.577\nIt typically is assigned to an entity.\n\n34\n00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:57.395\nNow that entity can be a user,\nit could be you know like you and I,\n\n35\n00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:00.353\nit could be a physical machine as well.\n\n36\n00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:03.730\nWe do this a lot when we\nvisit web servers out there.\n\n37\n00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.190\nWe go to that website like\nyour banking website.\n\n38\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.560\nAnd it says, hey, this is a secure\nwebsite, it's been trusted and\n\n39\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.873\nverified, well what is\nit that's been verified?\n\n40\n00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:15.545\nWhat's even going on?\n\n41\n00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:19.110\nYou say, well, I didn't verify anything,\nall I did was browse the website.\n\n42\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.739\nOr maybe I didn't even browse to the\nwebsite, I typed it in the search engine\n\n43\n00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.480\nand I clicked the link and the moment my\ncomputer goes there it can tell me it, or\n\n44\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.000\nit tells me well, hey,\nyou can trust this website.\n\n45\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.760\nWell, that's based off of something\nknown as a machine certificate.\n\n46\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.554\nSee, you can apply these\ncertificates to users so\n\n47\n00:02:37.554 --> 00:02:40.361\nthat they can prove their identity.\n\n48\n00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:43.284\nYou can also apply these\ncertificates to machines.\n\n49\n00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:46.270\nIn the case of a web browser,\nwhen you connect to,\n\n50\n00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.266\nlet's say maybe your bank account out\nthere, you're doing some online banking.\n\n51\n00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.850\nYou want to verify that the machine\nthat's hosting that website,\n\n52\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.898\nbefore you put in your credentials and\n\n53\n00:02:56.898 --> 00:03:00.621\nyou start typing your sensitive\ninformation into that web browser.\n\n54\n00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:05.494\nYou want to make sure that that machine\nbehind that web browser is who it\n\n55\n00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:06.330\nsays it is.\n\n56\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.619\nSo that's one of the good things about\nthe certificate or certificates in\n\n57\n00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:15.255\nthemselves is that when you connect to\nthe web browser, the machine that server\n\n58\n00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:20.000\npresents this digital, consider it like\na digital driver's license, right?\n\n59\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.180\nMost of us have a driver's license or\nsome kind of identification, right?\n\n60\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.878\nWell, why is it that we\ntrust the certificate or\n\n61\n00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:31.583\nthe web browser that's\nbeing presented to us?\n\n62\n00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:35.418\nWell, that's because we trust the\nauthority that issued that certificate.\n\n63\n00:03:35.418 --> 00:03:39.604\nSo users can use them for identity to\nprove their identity without having to\n\n64\n00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:41.537\ntype in user names and passwords.\n\n65\n00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:45.184\nAnd that's another good thing\nabout using user certificates\n\n66\n00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:47.707\nis the goal is to strengthen the security,\n\n67\n00:03:47.707 --> 00:03:52.290\ncuz we talk about password management,\npassword options, right?\n\n68\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.790\nWhy is a password one of\nthe most exploitable targets,\n\n69\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.780\nwhen it comes to things\nlike phishing scams?\n\n70\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.595\nWell, that's because it's\none of the most common uses,\n\n71\n00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:02.960\ncommonly utilized methods\nof authentication.\n\n72\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.985\nAny time you have to remember\na user name and password,\n\n73\n00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:12.951\nyou put it in the user's lap, it's going\nto introduce human vulnerabilities.\n\n74\n00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:16.102\nSo when you apply these to a user account,\nthat's one of the great things.\n\n75\n00:04:16.102 --> 00:04:18.390\nThey can be used for identification.\n\n76\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.668\nNow there's other purposes, too, for\nyour user based certificates as well.\n\n77\n00:04:21.668 --> 00:04:24.410\nIn another episode,\nwe talked about data security.\n\n78\n00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.146\nAnd one of the things that we\nmentioned in data security,\n\n79\n00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:29.146\nwe mentioned the encrypted file system.\n\n80\n00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:31.343\nWhat's interesting,\n\n81\n00:04:31.343 --> 00:04:37.390\nwhen you enable the encrypted file\nsystem in NTFS, it warns you.\n\n82\n00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.606\nIt says, hey, you're gonna\nwanna back up this private key.\n\n83\n00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:42.788\nWell, what do they mean\nwhen they say private key?\n\n84\n00:04:42.788 --> 00:04:45.667\nThere again,\nthat's just another certificate.\n\n85\n00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:50.437\nUnderstand, that's being issued to the\nuser, and it's a series of asymmetric key\n\n86\n00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:54.351\nencryption that we talk about in some\nof the other shows that we have.\n\n87\n00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:58.763\nWhere it's a key pair that's going\nto be associated with the end user.\n\n88\n00:04:58.763 --> 00:05:03.354\nNow, when it comes to the certificates,\ntoo, we don't just issue them to users.\n\n89\n00:05:03.354 --> 00:05:05.839\nWe don't just issue them to machines.\n\n90\n00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.851\nIt's definitely two of the most common\nones, but another thing that we also have\n\n91\n00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.450\nto have, well, we have to have\ncode-signing certificates, right?\n\n92\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.839\nWhen I install a piece of software, Dan\njust said, here's this thumb drive, Wes,\n\n93\n00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.058\ngo ahead and\nput in that line of business application.\n\n94\n00:05:19.058 --> 00:05:21.556\nLet's get these machines provisioned and\nready to go.\n\n95\n00:05:21.556 --> 00:05:25.744\nWell, how is it that Dan and I can trust\nthat piece of software when we plug in\n\n96\n00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:28.418\nthat thumb drive, and\nwe hit that executable?\n\n97\n00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:32.390\nWell, that's where your digital\ncertificates also come into play as well.\n\n98\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.685\nSo your digital certificates could sign\nthe application that you're installing.\n\n99\n00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:39.669\nSo you can verify who the publisher is.\n\n100\n00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.978\nNow, there's all kinds of things,\ncode signing, too,\n\n101\n00:05:41.978 --> 00:05:43.214\nwe could do this with drivers.\n\n102\n00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:45.569\nWe need to make sure that our\ndrivers are digitally signed.\n\n103\n00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.433\nSo, believe it or not, certificates,\nwhether they're issued to the users or\n\n104\n00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:52.549\njust the machines, comes down to it,\ncertificates really help\n\n105\n00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:56.190\nus to secure a lot of technologies\nthat are under the hood.\n\n106\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.557\nWe might not even be aware\nthat they even exist.\n\n107\n00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:01.377\n>> Yeah, now, Wesley, we've been\ntalking about these certificates.\n\n108\n00:06:01.377 --> 00:06:02.422\nYou can apply them to users.\n\n109\n00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:03.433\nYou can apply them to machines.\n\n110\n00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:05.616\nYou can code signing certificates.\n\n111\n00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:10.550\nNow it sounds like from what\nyou're saying is one user might\n\n112\n00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.518\nhave multiple user certificates.\n\n113\n00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:14.539\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n114\n00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.817\nFor instance, if you have somebody\nthat is proving their identity,\n\n115\n00:06:19.817 --> 00:06:25.191\nit might just be a certificate used\njust for that, just for identity.\n\n116\n00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.070\nIt might be a certificate that\nthe user's using for EFS.\n\n117\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.822\nSo, you could have multiple\ncertificates that are tied to the user.\n\n118\n00:06:30.822 --> 00:06:33.669\nBut, how is it that you actually\nsee those certificates?\n\n119\n00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.221\nIf I've got a certificate\nthat's issued to me,\n\n120\n00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:39.721\nI want to see if it's actually\nthere within the operating system.\n\n121\n00:06:39.721 --> 00:06:43.877\nIf I've got a certificate that's being\npresented to me by a web server and\n\n122\n00:06:43.877 --> 00:06:45.964\nmy browser says hey, you know what?\n\n123\n00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:47.241\nYou should trust that.\n\n124\n00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.370\nOh, really?\n\n125\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.360\nWell, how do I know I should trust that?\n\n126\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.310\nAnd that's one of the things,\none of the utilities,\n\n127\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.180\nthat we have built into the Windows\nenvironment is a protected\n\n128\n00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.680\ncertificate storage they call it, a\ntrusted protected location within Windows.\n\n129\n00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.049\nAnd for the most part it doesn't\nallow any modifications,\n\n130\n00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:08.650\nand if you do make some modifications,\nwhich we'll see here\n\n131\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.500\ncoming up you have to be an administrative\nuser because of the important nature.\n\n132\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.040\nNow I'm going to go ahead and I'm going\nto launch one of these utilities up, but\n\n133\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.310\nI have to let you guys\nknow if you are just\n\n134\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.655\nviewing the information it'll be okay,\nall right?\n\n135\n00:07:22.655 --> 00:07:26.770\nIt's not like registry modifications and\nstuff where we have to worry about ruining\n\n136\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.280\nanything, but I tell you what when it\ncomes to managing the certificates,\n\n137\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.090\nwhen you start interacted with this store,\nthis database.\n\n138\n00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.774\nThat's where it starts to get a little\ntricky, and you really have to be careful.\n\n139\n00:07:37.774 --> 00:07:41.935\nSo, let's go ahead, on our Windows machine\nwe're gonna launch up what is known as our\n\n140\n00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:43.083\ncertificate manager.\n\n141\n00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:49.486\nAnd it's a fairly easy consult to launch\nup just search MGR typical Microsoft\n\n142\n00:07:49.486 --> 00:07:55.810\nmanagement console extension there\n.msc and you'll see it right up here.\n\n143\n00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:01.438\nNow notice that the user account control\ndidn't trigger on me on this one, it's\n\n144\n00:08:01.438 --> 00:08:07.505\nbecause I'm in an administrative account\nso it's not requiring me to authenticate.\n\n145\n00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:13.409\nMake sure that we understand that\nstandard users can't open this up.\n\n146\n00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.629\nNow you're gonna see here, Dan,\nwe've got a lot of different areas here.\n\n147\n00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:21.818\nNow if a user happened to have, let's say\nfor instance you turn on the encrypted\n\n148\n00:08:21.818 --> 00:08:26.400\nfile system, and it tells you,\nyou have to back up your certificate.\n\n149\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.390\nWell, where's that going to be stored?\n\n150\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.859\nIt's actually going to be\nstored right here in personal.\n\n151\n00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:31.531\nAnd, I haven't turned on EFS.\n\n152\n00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:35.339\nSo, I don't have a certificate\nin this store right now.\n\n153\n00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:36.952\nNow, we've got some other ones here.\n\n154\n00:08:36.952 --> 00:08:43.440\nAnd, these are very, very interesting and\nvery important for us.\n\n155\n00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.360\nWhen we look at the trusted\nroot certification authorities,\n\n156\n00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.980\nand I can tell you,\nI am gonna mess that up,\n\n157\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.090\nI always say trusted root certification\nauthority, no trusted root authority,\n\n158\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.940\nI did it right, now, trying to say it\nwrong, and I actually got it right.\n\n159\n00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.977\nI usually say trusted root CA.\n\n160\n00:09:00.977 --> 00:09:02.550\nWell, what does that mean for us?\n\n161\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.150\nThat's a certificate of authority.\n\n162\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.390\nRemember, one of the things that\nI told you is that when you\n\n163\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.050\ngo to a Bank of America,\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead.\n\n164\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.695\nGo ahead and do this.\n\n165\n00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:13.398\nWe are going to do some\nonline banking here, and\n\n166\n00:09:13.398 --> 00:09:16.109\nI'm going to show you\nmy banking information.\n\n167\n00:09:16.109 --> 00:09:17.676\nJust kidding, maybe not.\n\n168\n00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:23.301\nSo we'll go ahead and browse to Bank\nof America, let's see, there we go.\n\n169\n00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:24.520\n>> Overdraft fees.\n\n170\n00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.723\n[LAUGH]\n>> There we go, there we go and\n\n171\n00:09:26.723 --> 00:09:28.988\nit looks like the ad there\ndidn't work with us.\n\n172\n00:09:28.988 --> 00:09:30.326\nThat's what I wanted to see.\n\n173\n00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:35.020\nNotice that up here at the top, the edge\nbrowser, it's got this little lock here,\n\n174\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.520\nand it's got this little green lettering.\n\n175\n00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.324\nWell what is that letting me know?\n\n176\n00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:44.550\nThat's letting me know that when this\nserver presented back to my web browser,\n\n177\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:50.030\nthat little digital driver's license\nif you will, it says you can trust it.\n\n178\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.754\nHow do we know if we can trust it?\n\n179\n00:09:51.754 --> 00:09:54.565\nWell I can view the certificate,\nand guys you can do this step,\n\n180\n00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:56.120\nany website that you go out there.\n\n181\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.850\nIt's actually kind of cool\nto see the information and\n\n182\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.000\nsee where these certificates\nare once you're aware of them.\n\n183\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.710\nYou can sit there and you can look and\nview the information in the certificate.\n\n184\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.794\nRight, just like if you had\nto prove your identity.\n\n185\n00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:10.896\nIt's funny we're talking about banking,\nand if I was to physically to walk\n\n186\n00:10:10.896 --> 00:10:13.431\ninto the bank, right,\nI want to have access to my resources.\n\n187\n00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:15.869\nWell how is it that I gain\naccess to my resources?\n\n188\n00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:17.930\nWell, we usually use two\nfactor identification.\n\n189\n00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.070\nI've got my driver's license, and\nI've got my debit card, right?\n\n190\n00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:27.480\nWhy is it that the bank trusts my\ndriver's license when I hand it to them?\n\n191\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.640\nIt's because they trust the authority\nthat issued the driver's license.\n\n192\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.833\nNow they're gonna look at\nsome of the data in here,\n\n193\n00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.995\nwhich we'll talk about coming up as well,\nwe're gonna see here in a bit,\n\n194\n00:10:35.995 --> 00:10:39.626\nthey're gonna look at some of the data to\nmake sure that it hasn't expired, right?\n\n195\n00:10:39.626 --> 00:10:41.985\nIt wasn't written in Crayola or\nsomething right there,\n\n196\n00:10:41.985 --> 00:10:43.420\nwe make sure it's not a forged ID.\n\n197\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.417\n>> On the back of a Denny's placement or\nsomething.\n\n198\n00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:46.363\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:47.397\n>> I swear.\n\n200\n00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.522\n>> This is me, this is me.\n\n201\n00:10:49.522 --> 00:10:51.240\nThey trust the authority.\n\n202\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.460\nLet's go ahead and look at this,\nlet's see if we can view the certificate.\n\n203\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.680\nIt should be fairly easy.\n\n204\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.063\nShould I trust this site?\n\n205\n00:10:59.063 --> 00:11:02.618\nOh, it's gonna go to [INAUDIBLE],\nI tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n206\n00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:04.319\nopen this in Internet Explorer.\n\n207\n00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:07.477\nInternet Explorer lets us see\nthis a little bit easier, and\n\n208\n00:11:07.477 --> 00:11:09.699\nwe'll just go back to that same website.\n\n209\n00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:13.823\nIt's interesting, it actually showed up\nwhen we went to the Bing website or MSN.\n\n210\n00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:15.040\nNotice that it's no different.\n\n211\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.881\nNotice the green hue here, guys?\n\n212\n00:11:16.881 --> 00:11:18.913\nIt doesn't matter what web\nbrowser you're in, too.\n\n213\n00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:21.637\nWhich is good because\nregardless of the web browser,\n\n214\n00:11:21.637 --> 00:11:25.815\nthese platforms are still looking back\ndown to that certificate store that we're\n\n215\n00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:27.345\ngonna get back to in a second.\n\n216\n00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:30.260\nBut I really would like to\nshow you this information.\n\n217\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.790\nThere we go,\nthat's what I was looking for.\n\n218\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.080\nIt doesn't look like end chat went\nin there, is the view certificate.\n\n219\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.356\nSo we can see this information, rather\nthen just saying should I trust this site?\n\n220\n00:11:40.356 --> 00:11:45.536\nNow let's talk this back to the analogy\nif you will of a drive's license.\n\n221\n00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:48.052\nRight, again,\na driver's license can't be expired, so\n\n222\n00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:50.380\nit's a got a validity date\nfrom this time to this time.\n\n223\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.554\nAfter it expires, well hopefully not after\nexpires you don't wanna wait till after\n\n224\n00:11:54.554 --> 00:11:58.213\nexpires to renew it, but at a certain\ntime you have to renew that license.\n\n225\n00:11:58.213 --> 00:12:00.255\nWell, guess what,\nit's no different with certificates.\n\n226\n00:12:00.255 --> 00:12:02.296\nCertificates.\nNotice that is said it's valid.\n\n227\n00:12:02.296 --> 00:12:05.050\nNotice it says from 2015\ngenerically here to 2016, and\n\n228\n00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.380\nthat is very important for us.\n\n229\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.237\nWe wanna know that if we\ncan trust this information,\n\n230\n00:12:10.237 --> 00:12:14.711\nthat the information,\nthat driver's license certificate\n\n231\n00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:19.090\nthat's being handed to us is\nwithin its validity period.\n\n232\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.320\nNow what I really wanna show\nyou back to our certificate\n\n233\n00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.990\nstore is why we trust this.\n\n234\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.163\nWhy is it that two different web browsers,\n\n235\n00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:31.670\nregardless of which one I opened,\nboth said the same thing.\n\n236\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.950\nBoth gave me that green hue here.\n\n237\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.250\nAnd, that's due to what's\nknown as a certificate chain.\n\n238\n00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:39.910\nAll right?\n\n239\n00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:45.161\nThe certificate chain, when the web\nserver presents that digital certificate,\n\n240\n00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:50.486\nit's been issued to Bank of America, now\nit's been issued by the subordinate CA,\n\n241\n00:12:50.486 --> 00:12:54.360\nwhich is there's a hierarchy out there,\nall right.\n\n242\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.020\nAnd then above this CA is\nwhat's known as the root CA.\n\n243\n00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.360\nSo take it back to trusted root\ncertification authorities.\n\n244\n00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.990\nIf I take this information,\nand let's go ahead and\n\n245\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.660\nbring back up that certificate store here.\n\n246\n00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.200\nAnd let's look at trusted certificates.\n\n247\n00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:18.243\nAll right, now I would venture\nto say that if we look somewhere\n\n248\n00:13:18.243 --> 00:13:24.420\nin our certificate store under trusted\nroot certification authorities.\n\n249\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.160\nThere I go root CA's.\n\n250\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.850\nWe're going to find a root CA for\nVerisign.\n\n251\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.880\nLet's find out if that's the case.\n\n252\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:37.670\nThe good thing is it should be all\nthe way down at the bottom here.\n\n253\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.780\n>> Alphabeticalized.\n\n254\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.587\n>> There we go.\nSo now I see that I've got some\n\n255\n00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:43.340\ncertificates here, root CAs from VeriSign.\n\n256\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.262\nSo what is going on here is\nthe Bank of America server's\n\n257\n00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:52.550\npresenting to me its\ndigital drivers license.\n\n258\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.650\nAnd then what my web browser does is\nit goes through the process and says,\n\n259\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:01.240\nwell, first of all, let's inspect\nthe information within the certificate.\n\n260\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.610\nHas it been suspended or not?\n\n261\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.030\nIs it still valid?\n\n262\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.720\nBecause if it's not valid it doesn't\nmatter if we have a trust root CA.\n\n263\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.440\nIf that certificate expires you\nare going to get a warning and\n\n264\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.470\nyou need to keep that in mind because\nthat warning could be, it could be that\n\n265\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.130\nthey let it expire and they have no,\nI would say intentions on renewing it.\n\n266\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.900\nNow not with a banking\ninstitution like this,\n\n267\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.690\nyou typically don't have\nto worry about that.\n\n268\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.490\nBut then the next thing\nthat we are going to\n\n269\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.930\ndo is we are going to say do\nI trust Symantec Class 3?\n\n270\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.490\nAll right, and\n\n271\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:38.470\nI bet you we can find a certificate\nauthority in there with that as well.\n\n272\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.460\nAnd then it goes back up the chain\nall the way to the hierarchy and\n\n273\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.700\nsays do we trust Verisign?\n\n274\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.270\nWell we can see that Verisign is in the\nlist here so we definitely trust Verisign.\n\n275\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.250\nNow that's a machine certificate.\n\n276\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:54.740\nRemember that the user certificates can\nget assigned to the user by an internal\n\n277\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.740\ncertificate authority or\nan external certificate authority as well.\n\n278\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.140\nWe also have some intermediate\ncertificate authorities.\n\n279\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.469\nThese intermediate certificate\nauthorities, you can see here,\n\n280\n00:15:06.469 --> 00:15:08.140\nthese are some of Microsoft's.\n\n281\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.290\nMicrosoft when you install\ncertain pieces of software why\n\n282\n00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.420\ndoes it say trusted publisher,\nand it says Microsoft on it?\n\n283\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.410\nBecause it's endorsed by them.\n\n284\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.978\nAnd the certificate is stored down\nhere in the certificate store.\n\n285\n00:15:18.978 --> 00:15:22.432\nSo, very good thing to have here.\n\n286\n00:15:22.432 --> 00:15:27.010\nAll right, so that's how we take\na look at the certificates, and\n\n287\n00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.850\nwhat the certificates are doing for us.\n\n288\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.936\nKeep in mind that with your certificates,\nand your certificate manager you can do\n\n289\n00:15:34.936 --> 00:15:39.962\nthings like, for instance, import\ncertificates into the certificate store.\n\n290\n00:15:39.962 --> 00:15:42.772\nIt's important to understand that,\n\n291\n00:15:42.772 --> 00:15:47.879\nthat is something that could cause\nsome security vulnerabilities.\n\n292\n00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:52.430\nAnd that's when we say importing\na certificate, if you import a CA\n\n293\n00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.467\ncertificate, whether it is valid or\nfraudulent or not, your browser and\n\n294\n00:15:57.467 --> 00:16:02.770\nyour machine from then on, they're\ngonna start to trust that certificate.\n\n295\n00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:08.740\nSo we do have to make sure that if we\nimport certificates into the certificate\n\n296\n00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.010\nstore whether it be from an internal CA or\na public CA that you trust them.\n\n297\n00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.750\n>> That really does bring up\na good topic of fraudulence.\n\n298\n00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.890\nYou made that statement.\n\n299\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.740\nHow do I know that someone didn't\njust get really clever and\n\n300\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.560\nlike they do with the driver's license,\nright?\n\n301\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.890\nA lot of high school kids out there\nhave fake driver's licenses so\n\n302\n00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.440\nthey can get into bars and\ndo things maybe they shouldn't be doing.\n\n303\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.580\nWho's to stop a really good hacker from\ncreating a fake digital certificate and\n\n304\n00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.880\nit starts showing it to you and\nyou start trusting it.\n\n305\n00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.750\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that can happen.\n\n306\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.150\nThat's when we import certificates,\nif you are going to import certificates,\n\n307\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.320\nlet me give you a scenario\nwhere you might do this.\n\n308\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.250\nIn other episodes,\nwe've talked about, for instance,\n\n309\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.250\nside loading applications inside\nof the Windows operating system.\n\n310\n00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.570\nSo, a legitimate non fraudulent medium\nwould be the fact that although\n\n311\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:01.070\nwe can side load a app inside\nthe Windows operating system,\n\n312\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.900\nit still has to be trusted.\n\n313\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.350\nStill has to be digitally signed,\nwe need to verify the publisher.\n\n314\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.310\nSo as an internal CA,\nmaybe within my company,\n\n315\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.900\nwe can bring up a certificate authority,\n\n316\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.710\nwe can issue a certificate that signs\nthat line of business application, but\n\n317\n00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:23.038\nthen we have to make sure that we take the\nroot certification authority certificate,\n\n318\n00:17:23.038 --> 00:17:27.480\nand import it into that trusted root\ncertification storage location.\n\n319\n00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.570\nNow one of the things that the hacker,\nlike Dan said,\n\n320\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.740\nthey could issue out their\nown certificates, right?\n\n321\n00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.030\nThere's nothing that stops me right\nhere with one of these virtual machines\n\n322\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.130\nfrom bringing up like a Windows\n2012 server, 2012 R2 server,\n\n323\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.420\ninstalling Active Directory Certificate\nServices, issuing a certificate.\n\n324\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.640\nNow we can pass this off even though\nit's maybe used for malicious means.\n\n325\n00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.830\nHere's where that certificate is not\ngoing to benefit the hacker at all.\n\n326\n00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.980\nWhen that certificate is presented to the\noperating system I have to find down there\n\n327\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.310\nin that certificate store\na root CA that matches that.\n\n328\n00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.750\nAll right, or\nthat endorsed that certificate.\n\n329\n00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:15.490\nSo from a hacker's standpoint,\nunless the hacker can import his CA,\n\n330\n00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.980\nhis or her CA certificates,\ncertificate of authorities root CA.\n\n331\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.120\nThe moment that web server, let's say\nfraudulent web server passed that\n\n332\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.660\ncertificate to me the web browsers\ngoing to pick up on that.\n\n333\n00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.145\nWhat they're going to do Dan is\nthey're going to look down in that\n\n334\n00:18:28.145 --> 00:18:29.770\ncertificate store.\n\n335\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.560\nThey're going to say, wait a second.\n\n336\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.390\nWait a second.\nI don't trust this certificate that\n\n337\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:38.480\nhas been presented to me from\nwww.youjusthacked.com because I've looked\n\n338\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.369\ndown here and I don't know what you're\npassing me the bogus drivers, if you will.\n\n339\n00:18:44.369 --> 00:18:48.200\nSo the good thing is if you do with that,\n\n340\n00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.240\noh by the way they call\nthose private CA's.\n\n341\n00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.238\nThe private CA's are the ones that\nthey don't cost your company the money\n\n342\n00:18:55.238 --> 00:19:00.238\nto get the certificates outside\nthe infrastructure that it takes to bring\n\n343\n00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:02.995\nup public infrastructure internally.\n\n344\n00:19:02.995 --> 00:19:06.777\nBut that one of the things you have to\nkeep in mind is that if you are going to\n\n345\n00:19:06.777 --> 00:19:10.807\nuse those privates CA's beforehand your\ndevices have to be provisioned with\n\n346\n00:19:10.807 --> 00:19:14.465\na certificate ahead of time so\nthat you don't get all these warnings.\n\n347\n00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:17.705\nYou don't get things like the smart screen\nfilter you know coming up and saying,\n\n348\n00:19:17.705 --> 00:19:19.385\nhey this is a unrecognized application.\n\n349\n00:19:19.385 --> 00:19:20.796\nWe don't recommend that you using it.\n\n350\n00:19:20.796 --> 00:19:23.425\nIf you have things like certain\nsecurity class software.\n\n351\n00:19:23.425 --> 00:19:24.587\nMight see it.\n\n352\n00:19:24.587 --> 00:19:27.946\nMight stop it from running the software so\nkeep in mind that it An internal CA,\n\n353\n00:19:27.946 --> 00:19:31.098\nprivate CA you have to provision all\nof the devices that you're gonna use\n\n354\n00:19:31.098 --> 00:19:34.838\nthose certificates on so that they trust\nthe authority that issued the certificate.\n\n355\n00:19:34.838 --> 00:19:40.925\n>> So, there's no real way to actually\nimitate the root CAs themselves?\n\n356\n00:19:40.925 --> 00:19:43.715\nYou could create a certificate.\n\n357\n00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:46.005\n>> Yes.\n>> But not the root CA that issues it.\n\n358\n00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:48.435\n>> Now that's funny that you say that,\n\n359\n00:19:48.435 --> 00:19:53.245\na few years ago there was an instance\nwhere that was happening and that's why\n\n360\n00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:58.155\nwe say one of the things about this is\nthat worldwide model of trust, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.115\nSo, far I've been talking\nabout your company's CA,\n\n362\n00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:04.845\nthat's called a private CA, internal CA\ncuz it's internal to your company, and\n\n363\n00:20:04.845 --> 00:20:07.045\nthey say private because, well guess what?\n\n364\n00:20:07.045 --> 00:20:10.775\nIf my company issues a certificate to this\nmachine and I go over to Dan's network and\n\n365\n00:20:10.775 --> 00:20:13.135\nI say here install my line\nof business application.\n\n366\n00:20:13.135 --> 00:20:15.885\nWell guess what?\n\n367\n00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:18.141\nDan's network doesn't\nunderstand what my CA is.\n\n368\n00:20:18.141 --> 00:20:22.075\nIt says whose's this CA that\nyou're talking about and\n\n369\n00:20:22.075 --> 00:20:25.475\nit is not going to install, all right?\n\n370\n00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:29.305\nBut outside of your company,\nacross the internet.\n\n371\n00:20:29.305 --> 00:20:31.245\nVerisign, Thorpe,\nGoDaddy are some of them, GTE,\n\n372\n00:20:31.245 --> 00:20:34.935\nto mention just a few of them, Symantec.\n\n373\n00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:37.605\nThese are public CAs,\nCertificate Authorities and\n\n374\n00:20:37.605 --> 00:20:41.245\nlet me be careful with the acronyms here,\nCertificate Authority.\n\n375\n00:20:41.245 --> 00:20:45.845\nThese are companies that you go to,\nand they charge you a service.\n\n376\n00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:50.465\nThey say okay, how much protection do you\nneed and depending on what kind of company\n\n377\n00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:54.295\nyou are, you can be something just as\nsimple as maybe a cheap certificate.\n\n378\n00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:57.495\nYou just want to be able to connect\nto your own web server within\n\n379\n00:20:57.495 --> 00:20:58.165\nyour house, right?\n\n380\n00:20:58.165 --> 00:21:00.005\nMaybe you're hosting a web\nserver in your house, and\n\n381\n00:21:00.005 --> 00:21:04.525\nyou want when browsers browse to it,\nyou don't want to get all these warnings.\n\n382\n00:21:04.525 --> 00:21:08.595\nOkay, well that's a fairly\ncheap implementation and\n\n383\n00:21:08.595 --> 00:21:13.475\nagain it's going to be\nissued to you by a CA that\n\n384\n00:21:13.475 --> 00:21:18.595\nhas their certificate stored\nin that certificate store.\n\n385\n00:21:18.595 --> 00:21:22.075\nNow you can get more advanced by this too\nwhere they, you know companies I'm sure\n\n386\n00:21:22.075 --> 00:21:26.505\nlike Bank of America, has got some kind of\ninsurance policy that is millions if not\n\n387\n00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:30.645\nbillions of dollars they protect and it's\nbecause they maintain the infrastructure.\n\n388\n00:21:32.345 --> 00:21:33.795\nNow let's be careful on this one.\n\n389\n00:21:33.795 --> 00:21:37.085\nA couple years back what I was\ngonna mention is that a root\n\n390\n00:21:37.085 --> 00:21:38.355\ncertificate authority.\n\n391\n00:21:38.355 --> 00:21:40.325\nI'm not gonna mention its name here but\n\n392\n00:21:40.325 --> 00:21:45.485\nthere was a root certificate authority\nout there that did get compromised.\n\n393\n00:21:45.485 --> 00:21:48.711\nThe hacker hacked in to the company,\nI don't know how they did this,\n\n394\n00:21:48.711 --> 00:21:54.045\nhacked into the company,\nstole the private key of the root C.A. and\n\n395\n00:21:54.045 --> 00:21:57.715\nthe private key is one of the things that\nendorses all the certificates below it.\n\n396\n00:21:57.715 --> 00:22:00.545\nNotice we had that chain validation there.\n\n397\n00:22:00.545 --> 00:22:04.975\nWell if I steal the root CA certificate,\nI can issue out bogus certificates but\n\n398\n00:22:05.995 --> 00:22:09.485\nthe problem is, before anyone\nelse catches them as fraudulent,\n\n399\n00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:12.965\nthey're gonna be passed\nto the browsers and\n\n400\n00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:17.685\nthe reason they're gonna be trusted\nis cuz the root CA's trusted.\n\n401\n00:22:17.685 --> 00:22:20.955\nWell, it did come to light\nthat that is what happened and\n\n402\n00:22:20.955 --> 00:22:23.375\nwhen it did all the major web\nbrowsers found out of the hack,\n\n403\n00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:28.735\nif you will, or\nthe security vulnerability and\n\n404\n00:22:28.735 --> 00:22:33.965\nthey instantly marked them in\nthe web browsers as fraudulent.\n\n405\n00:22:33.965 --> 00:22:37.185\nThen what usually follows is your\noperating systems will have some\n\n406\n00:22:37.185 --> 00:22:42.065\nkind of a security hot fix or a security\npatch that'll update the certificate store\n\n407\n00:22:42.065 --> 00:22:46.815\ninside of your operating system\nto delete that certificate\n\n408\n00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:51.075\nauthority as a trusted\ncertificate of authority.\n\n409\n00:22:51.075 --> 00:22:55.795\nSo, please keep in mind, public CA's, this\nis where you company can outsource that to\n\n410\n00:22:55.795 --> 00:22:59.975\nsomebody else if they don't want to\nimplement the infrastructure to bring\n\n411\n00:22:59.975 --> 00:23:02.195\nin additional servers,\nmanage a public infrastructure.\n\n412\n00:23:03.285 --> 00:23:08.075\nYou can do that also if you want\npublic facing websites, right?\n\n413\n00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:11.565\nWebsites that are connected to\nthe internet, you want Dan and\n\n414\n00:23:11.565 --> 00:23:14.505\nI to be able to visit them and\nthey're legitimate websites and\n\n415\n00:23:14.505 --> 00:23:17.885\nwe don't want to see all those warnings\nthat say hey there's a security problem.\n\n416\n00:23:17.885 --> 00:23:20.145\nYou need to steer away from this website.\n\n417\n00:23:20.145 --> 00:23:23.919\nThat's not a good day for business.\n\n418\n00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.165\nThe public CAs, usually you're\noutsourcing and you're paying the price.\n\n419\n00:23:26.165 --> 00:23:29.284\nPrivate CAs you still pay a price\nbecause you gotta [LAUGH] bring up\n\n420\n00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:33.043\nthe infrastructure and you gotta manage\nand maintain the infrastructure but\n\n421\n00:23:33.043 --> 00:23:35.699\nit might be an alternative for\nyou if you don't wanna,\n\n422\n00:23:35.699 --> 00:23:38.325\nmaybe you don't have a public\n[INAUDIBLE] interest.\n\n423\n00:23:38.325 --> 00:23:43.835\nMaybe you're just browsing to an intranet\nbased site and you wanna do it over HTTPS,\n\n424\n00:23:43.835 --> 00:23:48.125\nwell your certificate authority,\nprivate certificate authority,\n\n425\n00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:50.875\ncan issue that website a certificate but\nthen you have to go through\n\n426\n00:23:50.875 --> 00:23:54.305\na little bit more certificate management\nand you have to make sure that you import\n\n427\n00:23:54.305 --> 00:23:58.185\nthem to all browsers on every device\nwithin your network, so that, of course,\n\n428\n00:23:58.185 --> 00:24:01.690\nyou can visit the company website and\nmaybe look at the employee handbook.\n\n429\n00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.548\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A lot of effort.\n\n430\n00:24:02.548 --> 00:24:03.338\nFor the employee handbook but\nyou never know.\n\n431\n00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:06.982\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's right you do never know.\n\n432\n00:24:06.982 --> 00:24:12.052\nIt's good to keep those as private\ncertificates, those private keys as\n\n433\n00:24:12.052 --> 00:24:17.965\nprivate as possible because you don't want\nwhat happened to this unnamed persons.\n\n434\n00:24:17.965 --> 00:24:18.639\n>> Yeah.\n\n435\n00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:19.661\n>> You don't want that happening to you.\n\n436\n00:24:19.661 --> 00:24:21.773\nYou want to be able to\nkeep that on lockdown.\n\n437\n00:24:21.773 --> 00:24:24.987\nThat your computers internally,\neven though it's only an internal system,\n\n438\n00:24:24.987 --> 00:24:28.152\nyou still don't want people maybe\ninstalling software that they don't need\n\n439\n00:24:28.152 --> 00:24:31.510\nto be installing or putting up websites\nthat they don't need to be putting up, and\n\n440\n00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.776\npeople trusting them and\ndownloading like root kits.\n\n441\n00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:34.655\nThings like that.\n\n442\n00:24:34.655 --> 00:24:37.815\nIf you can get on the inside,\nyou can still glean\n\n443\n00:24:37.815 --> 00:24:42.025\na lot of information that way\n>> Yeah, mentioning that certificate\n\n444\n00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:45.335\nauthority, it's not a good day at the\noffice because it was later found out that\n\n445\n00:24:45.335 --> 00:24:48.785\nthey tried to hide it so\nthey could figure out what was going on.\n\n446\n00:24:48.785 --> 00:24:50.095\nWell they're no longer in business.\n\n447\n00:24:50.095 --> 00:24:53.615\nThere was another company too that had\nbeen exploited and they did due diligence.\n\n448\n00:24:53.615 --> 00:24:56.595\nThe moment they found out about it they\nsaid hey we don't even know what's going\n\n449\n00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:57.585\non this point.\n\n450\n00:24:57.585 --> 00:25:00.195\nWe just know we've been hacked.\n\n451\n00:25:00.195 --> 00:25:02.385\n>> Hm.\n>> They talked to all the major browsers\n\n452\n00:25:02.385 --> 00:25:04.513\ncompanies out there and said revoke them.\n\n453\n00:25:04.513 --> 00:25:08.045\nThey're fraudulent because we don't\nknow whats going on at this point and\n\n454\n00:25:08.045 --> 00:25:10.914\nbecause of their due diligence on that,\nthey're still around.\n\n455\n00:25:10.914 --> 00:25:12.295\nThey're still in business.\n\n456\n00:25:12.295 --> 00:25:14.885\nSo, you definitely have\nto be careful with it.\n\n457\n00:25:14.885 --> 00:25:16.385\nIt works on a model of trust and\n\n458\n00:25:16.385 --> 00:25:20.605\nthat once that model of trust is violated,\nthen the whole entire system crumbles.\n\n459\n00:25:20.605 --> 00:25:23.538\nSo, it's something that you\nhave to take very seriously and\n\n460\n00:25:23.538 --> 00:25:26.715\nyou don't wanna just modify\ncertificates just because you can.\n\n461\n00:25:26.715 --> 00:25:30.250\nIf you are an administrator on your local\nmachine you don't wanna start just messing\n\n462\n00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.061\naround with these certificates\nbecause they can cause problems.\n\n463\n00:25:33.061 --> 00:25:33.734\n>> Awesome.\n\n464\n00:25:33.734 --> 00:25:37.964\nWell Wes is there any way else that\nwe need to worry about, you know,\n\n465\n00:25:37.964 --> 00:25:42.285\ncontrolling or managing certificates\nwhen it comes on our systems?\n\n466\n00:25:42.285 --> 00:25:45.545\n>> No, no.\nJust be aware that when your user account\n\n467\n00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:49.005\ncontrols one of them that might pop up and\nsays unknown publisher.\n\n468\n00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:52.615\nThat very basically just means\nwhatever the application is\n\n469\n00:25:52.615 --> 00:25:55.225\nthat you're trying to install\nthey can't verify it against any\n\n470\n00:25:55.225 --> 00:25:57.785\ncertificates that are in\nthe certificate store.\n\n471\n00:25:57.785 --> 00:25:59.225\nSo, if you go ahead and\n\n472\n00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:02.445\nyou install that software you're\ndoing it at you're own risk.\n\n473\n00:26:02.445 --> 00:26:05.915\nThe other thing too with Smart Screen\nFilter it does work on unrecognized\n\n474\n00:26:05.915 --> 00:26:10.425\napps and remember the way it recognizes\nit is through digital certificates, so\n\n475\n00:26:10.425 --> 00:26:13.835\nif you've enabled smart screen filter,\nyou've got it set to the highest level\n\n476\n00:26:13.835 --> 00:26:16.435\nsettings, the most secure settings,\nand it catches something and\n\n477\n00:26:16.435 --> 00:26:20.485\nit throws it over the the UAC, and says\nwe don't know who this application is.\n\n478\n00:26:20.485 --> 00:26:23.129\nYou're going to have\na bad day at the office.\n\n479\n00:26:23.129 --> 00:26:26.213\nSo, just make sure that\nif you can't identify it,\n\n480\n00:26:26.213 --> 00:26:29.536\nyou're running the risk of\nmaybe a security problem.\n\n481\n00:26:29.536 --> 00:26:31.581\n>> Awesome.\nWell thanks so much for joining us.\n\n482\n00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:34.413\nFor giving us those great security\ntips when it comes to certificates.\n\n483\n00:26:34.413 --> 00:26:37.935\nObviously, it's something we\nneed to pay attention to but\n\n484\n00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:41.115\nwe now know what to look for\nand how to recognize that.\n\n485\n00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:42.175\nThanks to everybody for watching.\n\n486\n00:26:42.175 --> 00:26:44.575\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nclose this episode down.\n\n487\n00:26:44.575 --> 00:26:46.874\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n488\n00:26:46.874 --> 00:26:47.803\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n489\n00:26:47.803 --> 00:26:49.916\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n490\n00:26:49.916 -->

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:21.236\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, we're going over some\n\n5\n00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:25.394\nmore Windows 10 security content for you,\nspecifically talking about auditing,\n\n6\n00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:27.759\nhow we can use auditing\nto check out our systems,\n\n7\n00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.400\nmake sure that we're being\nas safe as possible.\n\n8\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.272\nHere to help me out with that topic\ntoday is none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:35.085\nHow's it going today, Wes?\n\n10\n00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.613\n>> Man, it's going great,\nit's good to be here guys,\n\n11\n00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:41.399\nand we've got a lot of stuff to look at,\na lot of little details to look at today.\n\n12\n00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.386\nWe're gonna be talking about some of the\nplaces that you can find that information\n\n13\n00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:48.935\nbecause when it comes to security,\nthe devil is in the details for sure.\n\n14\n00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:52.853\nSo one of the things that we're gonna be\nlooking at today is something known as\n\n15\n00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:53.647\nevent viewer.\n\n16\n00:00:53.647 --> 00:00:56.319\nAn event viewer, you might be thinking\nright off the top of your head,\n\n17\n00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:57.873\nif you're familiar with event viewer.\n\n18\n00:00:57.873 --> 00:01:01.856\nWell, maybe you're not thinking that event\nviewer can be used in the context of\n\n19\n00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:02.459\nsecurity.\n\n20\n00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:05.464\nWell, let's go ahead and\nif that is the case,\n\n21\n00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:10.259\nlet's show you that you can use event\nviewer for your security auditing.\n\n22\n00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.209\nSo one of the first things we can do here,\nhere on my Windows 10 machine,\n\n23\n00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.568\nI've got event viewer brought up here, and\n\n24\n00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:19.339\nwe've got a few different\nlogs that we can look at.\n\n25\n00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:23.300\nWe've got some administrative logs that we\ncan look at, and that's under the custom\n\n26\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.999\nview but what we're really going to be\nfocused at is in these Windows logs here.\n\n27\n00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:31.625\nWe'll mention a little bit about the\napplications and services law coming up,\n\n28\n00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:35.850\nbut we're really gonna be diving into\nthe logs that you have right here.\n\n29\n00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.720\nNow, one of the first places\nthat we have is what is\n\n30\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.910\nknown as the application log and\nyou might think of\n\n31\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.480\nthe application log as really having\nto do anything with a security context.\n\n32\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.400\nNow before we jump into event viewer,\none of the things that I wanna\n\n33\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.360\nmake it a little bit easier for\nyou to find what you're looking for\n\n34\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.290\nis to show you how to filter these logs,\nand it's relatively easy.\n\n35\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.270\nYou got a lot of information in here.\n\n36\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.710\nSometimes it's good information.\n\n37\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.752\nSometimes it's not useful or\nrelevant to what your search is, so\n\n38\n00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:07.499\nif you can narrow down these\nevents as they, as we call them,\n\n39\n00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.115\ninside of event viewer,\nit might make it a little easier.\n\n40\n00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:15.418\nHere on the right hand side there is\na filter current log, and that's a good\n\n41\n00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:19.949\nplace if you wanna make sure that you\ndon't get all this verbose information.\n\n42\n00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.372\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nfilter this log out.\n\n43\n00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:26.986\nNow, different types of logs come with\ndifferent event levels as they would\n\n44\n00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:27.715\ncall them.\n\n45\n00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:31.227\nThe event levels typically that we\nsee inside of here most commonly\n\n46\n00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:32.426\nare gonna be warning.\n\n47\n00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:34.771\nThey're gonna be error and\nthey're gonna be information.\n\n48\n00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.635\nNow the informational logs, sometimes\nit just gives us a general level of\n\n49\n00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:42.202\ninformation about whatever\nthe context is that we're looking at.\n\n50\n00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:45.348\nSometimes it could be information\nthat you're looking for, but\n\n51\n00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:46.728\nmaybe sometimes it won't.\n\n52\n00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:50.860\n>> Yeah, it really seems like we're gonna\nkinda be our own organic IDS intrusion\n\n53\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.006\ndetection system, where we're looking\nat the logs to see what has happened.\n\n54\n00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.718\nAnd if we see anything that\nraises the old eyebrow,\n\n55\n00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:01.391\nthen we know we might be on the right\ntrack for some security problem.\n\n56\n00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.212\n>> Most definitely, and in fact,\nto kind of zoom in here a little bit,\n\n57\n00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:07.706\nyou can see how we can\nfilter these logs out.\n\n58\n00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:11.109\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna select Warning, Error, and\n\n59\n00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.768\nI'm gonna leave information\nevents off of here.\n\n60\n00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:17.495\nNow, with the information events,\nif we search through these,\n\n61\n00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:20.154\nat first you might think,\nwell, guess what?\n\n62\n00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:21.152\nApplications.\n\n63\n00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:23.114\nWhy do I really care about an application?\n\n64\n00:03:23.114 --> 00:03:27.880\nWell, if I double click any one of\nthese events, I can go in here and\n\n65\n00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.788\nI can see that, hey, what's going on.\n\n66\n00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:36.332\nNow the other thing that we can also do,\nis we can find out what the user was,\n\n67\n00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:39.865\nthe event level,\nwe can also find the event id.\n\n68\n00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:42.556\nNow on this one,\nmaybe you research these or\n\n69\n00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.552\nmaybe you don't know how\nto use these event ids.\n\n70\n00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:47.434\nLet's go ahead and show you that too.\n\n71\n00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:51.496\nIf you launch up any web browser and we're\ngonna take this event that I'm looking at\n\n72\n00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:53.714\nright now,\nyou might have seen this before.\n\n73\n00:03:53.714 --> 00:03:57.861\nAnd this might be how you search for\n\n74\n00:03:57.861 --> 00:04:02.014\nevents out there on the Internet.\n\n75\n00:04:02.014 --> 00:04:05.114\nHere, let me go ahead and see if I\ncan close this browser down there.\n\n76\n00:04:05.114 --> 00:04:10.081\nAnd what I'm gonna do is, I am looking\nfor, move that out of the way so\n\n77\n00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:12.578\nyou can see, a specific event id.\n\n78\n00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:15.969\nNow the event id that I'm looking for\nis right here.\n\n79\n00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:21.221\nAnd this information can be very,\nvery handy in trying to find out\n\n80\n00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:27.253\nmaybe a service or an application,\nin this case, that has caused this id.\n\n81\n00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:29.818\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's just type in the web browser here.\n\n82\n00:04:29.818 --> 00:04:34.328\nWe'll type event id 3036, and like I said,\n\n83\n00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:38.514\nyou guys might be used\nto searching this way.\n\n84\n00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:43.215\nNow I could see right here just by doing\na little, just a quick research there,\n\n85\n00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:45.653\nthat's socialnet.microsoft.com.\n\n86\n00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:50.176\nSo there's people that have trouble with\na certain component within their operating\n\n87\n00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:52.015\nsystem they look like right here.\n\n88\n00:04:52.015 --> 00:04:55.915\nNow I can see that this is\na gather error event, all right.\n\n89\n00:04:55.915 --> 00:04:59.015\nSo, does that really\nhelp me with security?\n\n90\n00:04:59.015 --> 00:04:59.909\nNot really.\n\n91\n00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.393\nI don't really care about the fact\nthat a service isn't working, but\n\n92\n00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:09.181\nmaybe we can show you how the application\nthat logs themselves can also give\n\n93\n00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.294\nyou an idea that maybe some kinda\nsecurity breach is happening.\n\n94\n00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:14.827\nLet me go ahead and show you that.\n\n95\n00:05:14.827 --> 00:05:20.053\nIn event viewer here, if I close down\nthese extra logs here, we're gonna look\n\n96\n00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:25.449\nfor a different, well, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll keep our filter the way it is.\n\n97\n00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.046\nWe're gonna stay in the application and\nsee if that filter stayed.\n\n98\n00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:32.449\nNope, it didn't,\nI should have saved it there.\n\n99\n00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.144\nAnd refilter this out.\n\n100\n00:05:34.144 --> 00:05:36.861\nNow notice that there's an error\nright up here at the top.\n\n101\n00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:39.740\nAnd it says security SPP.\n\n102\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.594\nNow that might lead me to believe that\nmaybe this has something to do with\n\n103\n00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:45.405\nsecurity, but let's find out.\n\n104\n00:05:45.405 --> 00:05:46.682\nLet's find out here.\n\n105\n00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:47.344\nAll right.\n\n106\n00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:52.150\nNow notice that it talks about\nthe license activation and\n\n107\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.363\nit uses this executable here, SLUI.\n\n108\n00:05:55.363 --> 00:05:59.287\nWell Dan and I were actually talking\nabout this application off camera.\n\n109\n00:05:59.287 --> 00:06:01.656\nAnd this is\nthe Software Licensing Manager, and\n\n110\n00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:03.629\nit's trying to perform an activation.\n\n111\n00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.120\nNow you'll notice that I can see the\nsource of this is from the security that\n\n112\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.626\nSPP is the Security Protection Platform,\nI believe is what it stands for.\n\n113\n00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:16.608\nAnd more importantly is\nthe details behind this.\n\n114\n00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:19.424\nIf I go into system,\nI can tell that this is\n\n115\n00:06:19.424 --> 00:06:24.269\nthe Software Protection Platform Service\nthat initiated this error.\n\n116\n00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:27.660\nNow, how do I know that this\nisn't a security problem?\n\n117\n00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.525\nWell because I can see the event\nsource in the name that it came from.\n\n118\n00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:37.213\nIt tells me that this program is operating\nthe way it should be, and even more so,\n\n119\n00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:42.498\nI could take this information and\nI can go down into local disk C, Windows.\n\n120\n00:06:42.498 --> 00:06:45.642\nAnd then find our System32 folder.\n\n121\n00:06:45.642 --> 00:06:49.742\nAnd if I search System32,\nI should see slui.\n\n122\n00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:52.072\nAnd there,\nit's right there at the top, and\n\n123\n00:06:52.072 --> 00:06:56.439\nI can tell that this executable is running\nfrom inside of the System32 directory.\n\n124\n00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.933\nNow believe it or not, malware gets\nin here and it can actually modify.\n\n125\n00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:04.840\nAnd it doesn't really modify, it creates\nits own file that's called slui.exe,\n\n126\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.626\nand malware's really,\nreally good at using a program like this\n\n127\n00:07:08.626 --> 00:07:12.993\nbecause it masquerades itself as\nthough it's a legitimate system file.\n\n128\n00:07:12.993 --> 00:07:17.073\nSo if I come in here and\nI find an error, and in that error,\n\n129\n00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:23.363\nI notice that this file isn't operating\nfrom C:\\windows\\system32, maybe it's\n\n130\n00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:29.061\nfrom the user profile in that app data\nwhere a lot of temporary files are stored.\n\n131\n00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:33.101\nAnd I can tell probably right away\nthat I've got some kind of virus.\n\n132\n00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:35.201\nAnd that all came out\nof the application log.\n\n133\n00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:39.170\nSo even though we might not think about\napplication logs as being a way to do\n\n134\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.324\nsecurity auditing,\n\n135\n00:07:40.324 --> 00:07:44.117\nyou can see right here that that\ncouldn't be furthest from the truth.\n\n136\n00:07:44.117 --> 00:07:47.750\nYou can use the application logs, and\nthey're in a way that makes it, that\n\n137\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.802\nyou can find out if these applications are\nrunning in the context that they should.\n\n138\n00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:55.969\n>> Yeah, you never know where\nan audit log might take you, right?\n\n139\n00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:59.656\nYou just gotta follow those breadcrumbs,\nand you'll see that some of these things\n\n140\n00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:03.095\nactually do lead down to security,\neven though they're application logs.\n\n141\n00:08:03.095 --> 00:08:04.583\nSo you just gotta be careful and\n\n142\n00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.914\ntake a look at all the different logs\nthat you have available for you.\n\n143\n00:08:07.914 --> 00:08:12.082\nThat being said, another one that we could\ntalk about is the system logs themselves.\n\n144\n00:08:12.082 --> 00:08:16.524\nThe system is logging things that occur\nto it, not just the applications,\n\n145\n00:08:16.524 --> 00:08:17.735\nthe actual system.\n\n146\n00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:20.309\nAnd if something is\nhappening to your system,\n\n147\n00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:24.213\nit will alert you to that so you have\nto be looking at those logs as well.\n\n148\n00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:27.196\nSo Wes, you're gonna show us how\nto look at these system logs.\n\n149\n00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:28.078\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n150\n00:08:28.078 --> 00:08:29.855\nThe system logs, again.\n\n151\n00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:34.231\nNow we're talking about things that\ncould be directly affecting the kernel.\n\n152\n00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:38.454\nYou have system files in there and thank\ngoodness, we have technologies built into\n\n153\n00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:42.318\nWindows called the Windows Resource\nProtection because it helps to monitor\n\n154\n00:08:42.318 --> 00:08:45.480\nthose system files and\nmake sure that there aren't changes.\n\n155\n00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.393\nBut you never know when something might\nget, especially with like root kits.\n\n156\n00:08:49.393 --> 00:08:53.151\nRoot kits get down under, the lowest\nportion's the operating system and\n\n157\n00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:55.999\nthey can intercept calls that\nwe're not even aware of so\n\n158\n00:08:55.999 --> 00:08:57.949\nthe system logs are relatively easy.\n\n159\n00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:01.316\nSo if I come in here into the system logs,\nagain, remember,\n\n160\n00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:03.637\nkeep in mind that you can filter the logs.\n\n161\n00:09:03.637 --> 00:09:06.432\nI can't stress that enough because\nyou might not be looking for\n\n162\n00:09:06.432 --> 00:09:07.654\ninformation level event.\n\n163\n00:09:07.654 --> 00:09:12.289\nSo if I filter this log out here and\nI choose my error and warning, all right,\n\n164\n00:09:12.289 --> 00:09:16.563\nI might come in here and see things\nthat are related to, for instance,\n\n165\n00:09:16.563 --> 00:09:18.102\nthe hard drive, right?\n\n166\n00:09:18.102 --> 00:09:20.949\nRemember, viruses might\nmanifest themselves.\n\n167\n00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:25.406\nThey might manifest symptoms that we don't\nknow what is actually causing the problem.\n\n168\n00:09:25.406 --> 00:09:30.196\nSo if I come in here and I see things like\nhard drives, if I see things related to\n\n169\n00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:35.062\nthe file system NTFS here in Windows, it\nmight let me know that maybe a virus has\n\n170\n00:09:35.062 --> 00:09:40.104\ngot on that drive and it's causing more\ndrive activity that maybe I really want.\n\n171\n00:09:40.104 --> 00:09:42.864\nI might come in here and\nfind out that there's things and\n\n172\n00:09:42.864 --> 00:09:44.342\nerrors going on with the CPU.\n\n173\n00:09:44.342 --> 00:09:47.188\nIf that happens, again, CPU,\nor even the network adapter,\n\n174\n00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:50.166\nthat's one thing that can happen too,\nespecially with worms.\n\n175\n00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:54.844\nWorms just replicates itself and\ntries to consume all the resources it can.\n\n176\n00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:58.966\nBut not just on your computer,\non every computer within your network.\n\n177\n00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:02.391\nAnd it's got to go out bound, so\nI might come in here and even find\n\n178\n00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:06.779\nthings related to the network adapter that\nmight tell me, hey I've got an issue.\n\n179\n00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:10.286\nAnd I need to get involved here.\n\n180\n00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:15.111\nAnd that's where we might lead ourselves\ninto some additional technologies,\n\n181\n00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:17.134\nDan, to kind of track this down.\n\n182\n00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:20.015\nWe're kind of going on that little\nbreadcrumb trail to see if we can find out\n\n183\n00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:20.988\nwhat's going on there.\n\n184\n00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:25.290\n>> Yeah, if you have high utilization\nsystem resources, that's almost\n\n185\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.951\na surefire sign that you have some sort\nof malware installed on your system and\n\n186\n00:10:29.951 --> 00:10:34.322\ngoing to these system logs to see what\nkind of read-writes are going on,\n\n187\n00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:36.997\nwhat kind of CPU utilization is happening.\n\n188\n00:10:36.997 --> 00:10:38.310\nAm I my hitting thresholds?\n\n189\n00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.076\nIs this occurring?\n\n190\n00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:40.156\nIs that occurring?\n\n191\n00:10:40.156 --> 00:10:41.479\nThat's going to be what you need to do.\n\n192\n00:10:41.479 --> 00:10:44.032\nYou need to find that out,\nand then if it is,\n\n193\n00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:47.758\nnow it's time to kind of take\na little more proactive measure and\n\n194\n00:10:47.758 --> 00:10:51.219\nstart monitoring actively, so\nyou can see it in real time.\n\n195\n00:10:51.219 --> 00:10:52.519\nAnd Wes,\nyou're going to show us how to do that.\n\n196\n00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:53.529\n>> Yeah, yeah, definitely.\n\n197\n00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:55.259\nSo we've got a lot of things you know,\nand again.\n\n198\n00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:58.401\nFrom the context of security,\nyou might think in one of these\n\n199\n00:10:58.401 --> 00:11:02.851\napplications I'm gonna launch out now,\nWes, come on now, that's not a security.\n\n200\n00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:06.401\nThat's not a security functionality,\nthat's not a security app, well again,\n\n201\n00:11:06.401 --> 00:11:09.950\nif you've got viruses, worms, malware\nthat's consuming all your resources,\n\n202\n00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.407\nyou might wanna be aware of that.\n\n203\n00:11:11.407 --> 00:11:14.551\nSo one of the things that we can\nuse if we come into system logs,\n\n204\n00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:16.793\nwe maybe identify that there's a problem.\n\n205\n00:11:16.793 --> 00:11:20.172\nWe've seen that the system's\na little sluggish.\n\n206\n00:11:20.172 --> 00:11:23.494\nWell one of the basic ones we can\ndo here on our Windows 10 machine,\n\n207\n00:11:23.494 --> 00:11:27.226\nI can just right click on the taskbar,\nand when I right click on the taskbar,\n\n208\n00:11:27.226 --> 00:11:28.473\nI can show task manager.\n\n209\n00:11:28.473 --> 00:11:31.399\nNow I do wanna make sure I've\nmodified the defaults here,\n\n210\n00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.966\nso if you haven't been into\ntask manager before and\n\n211\n00:11:33.966 --> 00:11:37.806\nWindows 10, maybe you're used to it\ngoing all the way back to Windows 7.\n\n212\n00:11:37.806 --> 00:11:40.947\nCuz Windows 7 is still very popular,\nand in Windows 8, 8.1,\n\n213\n00:11:40.947 --> 00:11:42.473\nyou got a really good facelift.\n\n214\n00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:45.175\nAnd it starts out here with\nsome very basic information,\n\n215\n00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:46.816\nwhich isn't gonna show you much.\n\n216\n00:11:46.816 --> 00:11:50.394\nSo you have to choose more details.\n\n217\n00:11:50.394 --> 00:11:55.028\nAnd then when you choose more details,\nI might go to the performance tab, right?\n\n218\n00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:57.547\nAnd when I go to the performance tab,\nI can see well,\n\n219\n00:11:57.547 --> 00:12:00.252\nI can see the memory that's\ncurrently being utilized.\n\n220\n00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:02.881\nAs I might look at CPU spikes and\nagain in real time,\n\n221\n00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:06.797\nreal time monitoring might come in here\nand see the disk activity as well, or\n\n222\n00:12:06.797 --> 00:12:11.390\nmaybe even your you know your ethernet if\nyou've got Wi-Fi there Wi-Fi will show up.\n\n223\n00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.580\nSo you can see if these resource\nutilizations are spiking there.\n\n224\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.450\nand again it might be some kind\nof virus calling outbound,\n\n225\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.930\nmaybe got some key logger on there.\n\n226\n00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.340\nSo you might be generating\nsome network traffic here, but\n\n227\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.150\none of the great things here is\nthis is real time information.\n\n228\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.950\nNow if you want to get\na little bit more granular,\n\n229\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.920\nyou can open the resource\nmonitor down here.\n\n230\n00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.880\nWhen you open the resource monitor,\nthink about it as being\n\n231\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.960\nthe utility that takes the performance\ntab out of the Task Manager, and\n\n232\n00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.370\nputs every single CPU memory, network\nadapter, see if I get all this right and\n\n233\n00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.965\nhard drive activity all\nin a Single location.\n\n234\n00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:56.640\nAnd one of the really good things about\nthis is, if you do find, just let's say,\n\n235\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.330\nbasically in Task Manager\nhere that I've got a process\n\n236\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.060\nthat's consuming a lot of resources.\n\n237\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:06.390\nSee, for instance, you can switch this to\nfind out what is using at this point its\n\n238\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.499\nTask Manager [LAUGH] considering\nthat most of your resources here.\n\n239\n00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:13.491\nWell, with Resource Monitor I\ncan take that process.\n\n240\n00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:17.370\nI could come over here and I can for\ninstance the search UI hear.\n\n241\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.150\nIf I wanted I could just\nselect that in the overview.\n\n242\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.800\nAnd then if I expand out and\nsee the disk activity spiking there.\n\n243\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.620\nThis one actually is not\nshowing me any information.\n\n244\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.080\nLet me see if we can find another one,\nPerformance Monitor there we go.\n\n245\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.890\nSo one of the things that I like about\nthe Resource Monitor is the fact that when\n\n246\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.580\nyou find a process that might be causing\nthe problem, you can see and isolate down.\n\n247\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.950\nLook here on the right hand side.\n\n248\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:50.320\nAll the orange activity, it shows me in\nall of this, in this case, disk activity.\n\n249\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.060\nHow much is that process itself using?\n\n250\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.480\nIf I really need to identify\nas we're asking questions,\n\n251\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.760\nfollowing that breadcrumb trail I find\na process that I might consider a virus.\n\n252\n00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.480\nI can see exactly how much it's using and\none of the great things too,\n\n253\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.730\nis as I move through CPU,\nit keeps that check mark there.\n\n254\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.610\nAnd I can see it on an individual\nbasis if I want to.\n\n255\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.550\nNotice performance monitor\nis still checked there.\n\n256\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.120\nSo I really like the resource monitor and\n\n257\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.840\nthe fact that it shows you a lot of\nstatistical information, and it can really\n\n258\n00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.670\nisolate down a specific process that\nmight be consuming the resources.\n\n259\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.750\nAnd I tell you Dan that is a really\ngood thing to have just to\n\n260\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.500\nrifle down in there kind of\nlike a like a sniper, and\n\n261\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.500\nfind the specific process that\nmight be causing the problem.\n\n262\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.510\n>> Oh yeah I've used this so\n\n263\n00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.370\nmany times to figure out where\nthe problem is coming from.\n\n264\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.860\nUsers call me up,\nmy computer's acting a little weird.\n\n265\n00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.820\nIt's a little little slow.\n\n266\n00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.070\nNot as speedy as I'm used to.\n\n267\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.500\nFirst thing I run to is Task Manager,\nresource monitor to look and\n\n268\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.640\nsee what is actually\nusing these resources.\n\n269\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.130\nWhere is this going?\n\n270\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.150\nAnd then to say, hey this is the program.\n\n271\n00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.700\nAre you familiar with it?\n\n272\n00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.330\nMaybe I Google search that and see,\noh that's a known piece of malware.\n\n273\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.390\nOh I don't know how that got\npast our antivirus system, and\n\n274\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.150\nwhat you've been doing, but that's\nprobably where the issue is coming from.\n\n275\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.850\nAnd to be able to see that that is\nworking right then and there right.\n\n276\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:13.510\nI know that's it.\n\n277\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.360\nOkay it's up and running and that is\nnot something we want on that computer.\n\n278\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.080\nNow I can go in and\nuse my tools to remove it, get it to stop.\n\n279\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.525\nwas doing maybe clean up a little bit and\nthen protect them better.\n\n280\n00:15:24.525 --> 00:15:25.100\nBetter believe it and\n\n281\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.860\nlike I said that focus on that one\nspecific process is amazing, and\n\n282\n00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.360\nthere are other third party utilities\nout there like Sysinternals got one.\n\n283\n00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.030\nI think it's still called process kill.\n\n284\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.330\nAnd again it's kind of like a task\nmanager with weightlifting if you will,\n\n285\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.810\nbecause it could show you information,\nit can show you all the sub freeze and\n\n286\n00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.880\neverything but\nit's good to have this built right in.\n\n287\n00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.810\nNow the other thing that we have too,\nis our security logs.\n\n288\n00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.890\nNow we've got to be careful\nwith the security logs.\n\n289\n00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.320\nBecause with the security logs,\nthey can generate, well a lot of, or\n\n290\n00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.480\naccrue a lot of hard drive space.\n\n291\n00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.420\nWhich we should say probably any\nauditing that you do, any time you\n\n292\n00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.140\nincrease what you're watching,\nyou also increase the potential for\n\n293\n00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.410\nthere to be a performance\ndegradation on the hard drive.\n\n294\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.250\nJust because it's going to go accrue\nsome hard drive space for these logs.\n\n295\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.880\nNow with the security logs there\nare some that are set by default.\n\n296\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.230\nLike for instance I can see over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n297\n00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.860\nIn this category, I could see login,\nspecial login, user account management.\n\n298\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.430\nWe could go a little\nbit farther than this.\n\n299\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:29.530\nIf you really want to audit what\nis going on in your system,\n\n300\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.400\nit's not so much that you're going\nto do this inside of the event.\n\n301\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.900\nYou're now we're going to go\nto the group policy object.\n\n302\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.200\nNow I've mentioned this,\nI want you to keep in mind that this is on\n\n303\n00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.060\nthe local group policy,\nyou could do this in a domain environment.\n\n304\n00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.220\nWe will save that for another time but\n\n305\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:51.004\nyou can also do this on the local\nmachine just using your local GPO.\n\n306\n00:16:51.004 --> 00:16:54.460\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ngo to our local group policy editor, and\n\n307\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.400\nthat's just if you've never\nlaunched that up before,\n\n308\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.840\nthat's just that the old gpedit dot\nMike Sierra Charlie or .msc there.\n\n309\n00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.080\nAnd when we launch that,\nor make it disappear.\n\n310\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.340\nThere we go.\n\n311\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.130\nWe can get in here and\nwe can modify some settings.\n\n312\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.310\nAnd more specifically, auditing settings.\n\n313\n00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.020\nNow, we do this under\nthe Window settings that\n\n314\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.510\nwere under the computer portion\nof the policy at the top.\n\n315\n00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.430\nAnd we can expand out Window settings.\n\n316\n00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.370\nAnd then imagine this,\nthis is under security settings, so\n\n317\n00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.650\nit makes it a little easier for us.\n\n318\n00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.580\nAll right.\nAnd what I'm really looking here looking\n\n319\n00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.830\nfor here is the advanced audit policy\nconfiguration down at the bottom.\n\n320\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.770\nNow, this is one that\nwhen you expand it out,\n\n321\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:39.890\nyou'll see system audit policies and\nthen you can expand these out.\n\n322\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.470\nNow this is where you can get really\ngranular at what you are auditing.\n\n323\n00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:48.300\nLike for instance and you can see\nsome of them here account log in,\n\n324\n00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.810\nthere might be a few that you're,\nthat are relevant for your environment.\n\n325\n00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.580\nMight be a bunch of them.\n\n326\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.130\nMight only be one.\n\n327\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.860\nSo be careful on what you're gonna\naudit cuz it's easy to say let's audit\n\n328\n00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.470\neverything.\n\n329\n00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.050\nAnd then the problem is\nall of that information\n\n330\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.540\nin the logs you can't really tell what\nexactly it is that you're trying to see.\n\n331\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.180\nSo let's go ahead we'll\nset a couple of them.\n\n332\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.910\nSo for instance I can audit\ndifferent log on and log off events.\n\n333\n00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.670\nNow some of you might be\nfamiliar with group policy.\n\n334\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.060\nYou might say well Wes wait a second.\n\n335\n00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.370\nJust a second here.\n\n336\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:21.020\nIf I go under Local Policies and\nthen I select Audit Policies here.\n\n337\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.230\nWell, wait a second.\n\n338\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.500\nWhat do you mean I've\ngot log in events here?\n\n339\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.300\nBut it's very basic.\n\n340\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.000\nIt just says audit log in events, right.\n\n341\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.040\nIf I go down to the Advanced Policies,\nI could do so much more with this, right.\n\n342\n00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.440\nI can audit log on to log off.\n\n343\n00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.230\nThings like device claims, if you are\nusing claims aware applications, IP IPsec.\n\n344\n00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.940\nLet's go ahead and just, tell you what,\nwe'll audit a log on event.\n\n345\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.570\nNow you can do success or failure and\nwhich one do you thinks more important?\n\n346\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.974\nTrick question, hint hint.\n\n347\n00:18:48.974 --> 00:18:52.280\n>> [LAUGH] I don't think there\nis a more important one.\n\n348\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.659\nIt's all about what you're trying to do.\n\n349\n00:18:54.659 --> 00:18:59.250\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, I was trying to\nset him up for failure on that one, but\n\n350\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.530\nyou know some people have said well don't\nyou wanna see a failed log in attempt.\n\n351\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.250\nWell yeah I do, but I also wanna\nsee the successful log in attempts.\n\n352\n00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:10.150\nYou might say well wait a second\nwhy do I care about success?\n\n353\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.000\nWell Dan and I [LAUGH] we're just talking\nabout brute force attacks right before we\n\n354\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.750\nstarted this episode and\nimagine if I see a fail, fail, fail, fail,\n\n355\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.210\nI know that's redundant, success.\n\n356\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.680\nWell depending on what time it is if it's\nthree AM it could be a network attack, or\n\n357\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.300\nit could be some kind of software\nattack that's producing a brute force.\n\n358\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.430\nSo just like Dan said both of\nthem are just as important.\n\n359\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.030\nAnd I could come in here and I.\n\n360\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.280\nI could do other things\ntoo like object access.\n\n361\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.620\nMaybe I want to figure out when\npeople are accessing resources,\n\n362\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.880\nmaybe a file share making\npermission changes.\n\n363\n00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.800\nWell I can come in here and\nI can do audit file system.\n\n364\n00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.970\nProperties of that one.\n\n365\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.000\nWe can enable that.\n\n366\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.250\nWe can do success and\nmaybe failures on that one.\n\n367\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:56.710\nNow, the other thing that we might\ndo is let say policy changes.\n\n368\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.460\nMaybe I want to find out if somebody\nwho has administrative rights on this\n\n369\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.130\ncomputer, if they make a change\nto a policy just like I did.\n\n370\n00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.190\nWell guess what we can do that is well.\n\n371\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.210\nI can do an audit policy change here.\n\n372\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.450\nAnd I can configure that.\n\n373\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.550\nAnd we might do success\nfailure on that one.\n\n374\n00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.880\nChoose OK.\n\n375\n00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.120\nAnd then once that's set.\n\n376\n00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.480\nAnytime somebody logs into this\nmachine I'm going to see success.\n\n377\n00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.690\nI'm going to see failure.\n\n378\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.730\nAny time somebody,\neven an administrator including myself,\n\n379\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.610\nlogs into this machine and\nmakes a policy change, we should see that.\n\n380\n00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.600\nNow let's go ahead and\nlet's see if that's the case here.\n\n381\n00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.450\nThen I made a policy change.\n\n382\n00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.940\nAnd if what I've said is right.\n\n383\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.650\nHere we go back to those system logs.\n\n384\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.800\nI might see,\nright there we go right at the top.\n\n385\n00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.925\nNow keep in mind this is\nan informational log.\n\n386\n00:20:39.925 --> 00:20:41.345\nRemember what I told you.\n\n387\n00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:44.227\nNot all the times are informational\nlogs important, but\n\n388\n00:20:44.227 --> 00:20:46.214\nI would say probably in this one, Dan.\n\n389\n00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:50.072\nThat policy setting has changed, it's in\na system log, it's an informational event,\n\n390\n00:20:50.072 --> 00:20:51.110\nit might be important.\n\n391\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.013\n>> Yeah.\nIt very well could be important,\n\n392\n00:20:53.013 --> 00:20:56.571\nespecially if some sort of security breach\nhas occurred or some security Pretty\n\n393\n00:20:56.571 --> 00:20:59.720\nchanges occurred that no one is\nunderstanding why this is happening.\n\n394\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.600\nYou come to these logs,\nyou check them out.\n\n395\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.850\nYou can see,\nwell somebody has changed group policy.\n\n396\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.219\nIt says this is the user and, of course,\nthat user is going to be now having a nice\n\n397\n00:21:08.219 --> 00:21:11.759\ntalk with someone that has the ability\nto cut them a final check.\n\n398\n00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:14.018\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or cut them loose and say, okay,\n\n399\n00:21:14.018 --> 00:21:15.218\nyou didn't do this.\n\n400\n00:21:15.218 --> 00:21:16.595\nWe've obviously had a breach of security.\n\n401\n00:21:16.595 --> 00:21:17.490\nBut that's what you have got to find out.\n\n402\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.930\nThat's the whole purpose of these logs is,\nif Wes made the change and\n\n403\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.650\nI haul him into the office, I'm like,\nWes, we're having security issues.\n\n404\n00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.196\nI see right here,\nat 3 o'clock this morning,\n\n405\n00:21:29.196 --> 00:21:32.452\nyour account made a change to\nthe group policy in our system.\n\n406\n00:21:32.452 --> 00:21:35.586\nAnd you can say,\nI was sleeping like a baby at that time,\n\n407\n00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.408\nI made no movement whatsoever.\n\n408\n00:21:37.408 --> 00:21:42.062\nWell, now we know we've got an issue, so\nWes's account has been compromised and\n\n409\n00:21:42.062 --> 00:21:44.969\nwe now have to take steps\nto mitigate that problem.\n\n410\n00:21:44.969 --> 00:21:47.942\n>> Yeah, well, Dan, you've talk about\nthis, because I know you've worked in\n\n411\n00:21:47.942 --> 00:21:51.049\nthe industry before, we've talked about\nthis where you were saying that changed\n\n412\n00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:53.190\nmanagement\n>> We don't just make changes to policies.\n\n413\n00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.443\nIt goes through a systematic approach and\nif somebody doesn't apply a,\n\n414\n00:21:56.443 --> 00:21:59.801\nwell what if I am allowed, and I'm\nauthorized and it's during the time and\n\n415\n00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:01.632\nI say I don't know who made that change.\n\n416\n00:22:01.632 --> 00:22:05.553\nIt broke the whole entire network,\nit didn't follow your change management.\n\n417\n00:22:05.553 --> 00:22:09.660\nWell there again your audit\ntrail can show you that.\n\n418\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.800\nNow one of the other things that you\ncan do is something known as quotas.\n\n419\n00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.715\nNow quotas are very, very good but\nit's one of those things that if you're\n\n420\n00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:21.319\ngonna enable it,\nyou want to make sure that you use it.\n\n421\n00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:26.211\nBecause if you have a large drive,\nyou might wanna proactively control\n\n422\n00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:30.542\nwho can save data and how much\ndata they can save within a drive.\n\n423\n00:22:30.542 --> 00:22:33.270\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's see that in action here.\n\n424\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.222\nI'm gonna navigate.\n\n425\n00:22:34.222 --> 00:22:35.549\nI've got an E drive over here.\n\n426\n00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:38.300\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\ncreate a couple of files here.\n\n427\n00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.482\nSo we'll use our good old fsutil.\n\n428\n00:22:41.482 --> 00:22:49.041\nAnd we'll do a file createnew and we're\ngonna make just a couple of 2MB files.\n\n429\n00:22:49.041 --> 00:22:52.615\nNow your drives will probably\nbe a lot larger than this, but\n\n430\n00:22:52.615 --> 00:22:55.810\nwe're just doing this for\nour demonstration.\n\n431\n00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:01.410\nAnd it is good to have this because\nyou might wanna proactively track who\n\n432\n00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:06.468\nis consuming the most amount of\ninformation on your hard drive.\n\n433\n00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:08.806\nAnd you might want to restrict that and\n\n434\n00:23:08.806 --> 00:23:12.473\nat the same time you might want\nthe ability to control that.\n\n435\n00:23:12.473 --> 00:23:16.766\nAnd it's good to have, like I said,\nauditing involved on this.\n\n436\n00:23:16.766 --> 00:23:18.396\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nmake a couple of files here.\n\n437\n00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:22.704\nWe're gonna prep our drive beforehand and\nwe'll show you how to enable a quota.\n\n438\n00:23:22.704 --> 00:23:26.019\nIf you go into File Explorer\nit's fairly easy to do this.\n\n439\n00:23:26.019 --> 00:23:28.250\nYou can go to the drive\nthat's in question.\n\n440\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.930\nLet me go ahead and\nget down to the data drive here and\n\n441\n00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.990\nif you right-click on this drive and\nchoose properties,\n\n442\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:40.150\nyour properties option, we're gonna see\nthat there should be at the top here this\n\n443\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.030\nquota tab and this is where we\ngonna be dealing with the quotas.\n\n444\n00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:48.818\nNow by default keep in mind to turn on\na quota, you have to be an administrator.\n\n445\n00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:52.925\nSo when we first show these settings,\nthe very first thing that we have to do\n\n446\n00:23:52.925 --> 00:23:56.838\nis enable quota management and\nthen we have to if you will, if you want,\n\n447\n00:23:56.838 --> 00:24:00.254\ndeny disk space to users that\nare exceeding that quota limit.\n\n448\n00:24:00.254 --> 00:24:01.699\nNow we're going to go ahead and\nset this up.\n\n449\n00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:05.618\nHow you set this up in your environment is\nreally going to be contingent on what's\n\n450\n00:24:05.618 --> 00:24:06.500\nrelevant to you.\n\n451\n00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.410\nLike I said,\nthese are relatively small quotas.\n\n452\n00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.541\nYou probably wouldn't want to\nlimit somebody to six MB there.\n\n453\n00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:16.293\nBut for auditing purposes which\nis really what we're focused on,\n\n454\n00:24:16.293 --> 00:24:18.102\nI also want to log an event here.\n\n455\n00:24:18.102 --> 00:24:20.006\nLet me zoom down in there so\nyou can see that.\n\n456\n00:24:20.006 --> 00:24:23.496\nI want to log an event when\nthe user exceeds their quota.\n\n457\n00:24:23.496 --> 00:24:27.444\nBut I also want to set\na warning level that says,\n\n458\n00:24:27.444 --> 00:24:32.975\nlet's let you know beforehand\nthat you're gonna hit that level,\n\n459\n00:24:32.975 --> 00:24:39.520\nso that you can proactively not store\nyour iTunes or your mp4 videos up there.\n\n460\n00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.980\nAlright, now,\nit's gonna give you a warning that says,\n\n461\n00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.465\nuse this only if you intend\nto follow up with it.\n\n462\n00:24:46.465 --> 00:24:48.961\nBecause if this is a 1TB, 2TB, 3TB drive,\n\n463\n00:24:48.961 --> 00:24:51.532\nit's gonna go through\nthe whole entire drive.\n\n464\n00:24:51.532 --> 00:24:56.451\nIt's gonna calculate statistics and\nthen it could take a while.\n\n465\n00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:58.010\nSo I'll go ahead and say okay to this.\n\n466\n00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.860\nAlright, and then we're gonna go ahead and\nshow quota settings to\n\n467\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.790\nensure that we do have quotas turned on\nand let's test this out on a user here.\n\n468\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.760\nSo we're gonna pick on.\n\n469\n00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.590\nLet's see.\nLet's pick on user 01 here.\n\n470\n00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.088\nSo let me just sign out.\n\n471\n00:25:11.088 --> 00:25:15.408\nWe'll sign right back in as our User01,\n\n472\n00:25:15.408 --> 00:25:19.009\nif I could remember 1, 2 3, 4.\n\n473\n00:25:19.009 --> 00:25:21.341\nThe perfect PIN.\n\n474\n00:25:21.341 --> 00:25:24.536\nWhen it gets logged in,\nwhat we're going to do guys,\n\n475\n00:25:24.536 --> 00:25:29.011\nis we're going to navigate over to that\ndrive that I've enabled quotas and\n\n476\n00:25:29.011 --> 00:25:31.800\nwe're going to see if\nour quotas are working.\n\n477\n00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:38.315\nSo the first thing we'll do is we'll\ncreate a folder on behalf of User01 here.\n\n478\n00:25:38.315 --> 00:25:41.402\nAnd close down all of our heads up there.\n\n479\n00:25:41.402 --> 00:25:45.490\nLet me go ahead and\nrename that folder, so we know.\n\n480\n00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.692\nThe User01.\n\n481\n00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:54.480\nAll right, now all I'm gonna do is I'm\ngoing to copy one file and paste it in.\n\n482\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:01.030\nAll right, now Dan, do you remember\nwhat I set the warning level at?\n\n483\n00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.270\n>> I wanna say it was 4 MB?\n\n484\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.020\n>> All right so these are 2 MB files.\n\n485\n00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.603\nThat's exactly right.\n\n486\n00:26:05.603 --> 00:26:09.533\nThese are 2 MB files so\nif we've got this set up right,\n\n487\n00:26:09.533 --> 00:26:14.150\nat this point, hopefully we should\nbe logging, in Event View or\n\n488\n00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.867\nsome kind of log that says,\nsomebody has almost met their limit.\n\n489\n00:26:18.867 --> 00:26:24.032\nNow that we've got our quota setup,\nwe've logged in as our end user.\n\n490\n00:26:24.032 --> 00:26:25.970\nLet's see if we've done\nsome restrictions here.\n\n491\n00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:31.184\nSo we're gonna go to that data drive\nthat we enabled the quotas on.\n\n492\n00:26:31.184 --> 00:26:35.561\nRemember those files that we created,\nand what we're gonna do here is,\n\n493\n00:26:35.561 --> 00:26:40.227\nwe're gonna go ahead and I'm just gonna\ncopy these files over to User01's\n\n494\n00:26:40.227 --> 00:26:45.033\nfolder and we're gonna paste, and one of\nthe things that we should see here is it\n\n495\n00:26:45.033 --> 00:26:47.804\nsays there's not enough space on User01.\n\n496\n00:26:47.804 --> 00:26:51.297\nNotice it says 6 MB is\nneeded to copy this item.\n\n497\n00:26:51.297 --> 00:26:55.702\nSo it does proactively restrict\nthe end user from storing more\n\n498\n00:26:55.702 --> 00:26:58.081\ninformation than what you said.\n\n499\n00:26:58.081 --> 00:26:59.970\nBut we also want to\nlook at the quotas too.\n\n500\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.524\nWe want to make sure that the statistics\nthere, cuz remember it's about auditing\n\n501\n00:27:04.524 --> 00:27:08.880\nthis information and if we set quotas up\nand then turn around and can't find out\n\n502\n00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.380\nwho's actually causing the problem,\nwell then it would be just about useless.\n\n503\n00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.280\nSo let's go ahead and\ncheck out those entries here.\n\n504\n00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.480\nWe're going back to the same location,\nthe property of whatever drive you're on.\n\n505\n00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.160\nWe're going to choose the quota tab,\nand again,\n\n506\n00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.340\nthis information is not there by default,\nwe'll choose to show that information.\n\n507\n00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.640\nAnd then you've got this button down here\nat the bottom that says Quota Entries, and\n\n508\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.140\nthat's where we want to be.\n\n509\n00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.450\nNow, choosing Quota Entries, I can\nsee that it was User01 that hit their\n\n510\n00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.600\nquota limit, I could see that and\nit restricted them.\n\n511\n00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.327\nOne final location that you can go\nis going back to your event viewer.\n\n512\n00:27:44.327 --> 00:27:46.301\nSince we've been talking\nabout event viewer,\n\n513\n00:27:46.301 --> 00:27:49.357\nlet's go ahead and show you what that\nlooks like here in event viewer, and\n\n514\n00:27:49.357 --> 00:27:51.204\nthat's going to be down\nin the system logs.\n\n515\n00:27:51.204 --> 00:27:53.491\nAnd I can tell you I've\nactually seen this one before,\n\n516\n00:27:53.491 --> 00:27:54.892\nso I've kind of got a heads-up.\n\n517\n00:27:54.892 --> 00:27:58.470\nWe should see some NTFS warnings at the\ntop, and I don't know if you see that at\n\n518\n00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:02.012\nthe end, but boy, right there at the top\nwe've got two of them that came up.\n\n519\n00:28:02.012 --> 00:28:07.740\nSo, more specifically, event ID 37,\nand NTFS is the source.\n\n520\n00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.070\nYou'll notice it says right there,\nthey hit their quota limit.\n\n521\n00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.640\nWe can track it.\n\n522\n00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.230\nWe know exactly who did it.\n\n523\n00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.633\nWe know what time they did it and\nwe're in business.\n\n524\n00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:17.712\nWe can see what's going\non on our computers.\n\n525\n00:28:17.712 --> 00:28:18.303\n>> That's right.\n>> And\n\n526\n00:28:18.303 --> 00:28:22.676\nthis has the double benefit of saying,\na lot of malicious software will actually\n\n527\n00:28:22.676 --> 00:28:26.681\nstart to fill up your hard drive\nbecause it's eating up those resources.\n\n528\n00:28:26.681 --> 00:28:29.157\nIt's kind of what it's intended\nto do is crash systems.\n\n529\n00:28:29.157 --> 00:28:33.465\nIt's a very popular method of\nmaliciousness, as it were.\n\n530\n00:28:33.465 --> 00:28:37.783\nIf we have quotas in place, then we know\nthat they may have access to a drive,\n\n531\n00:28:37.783 --> 00:28:40.426\nbut they only have so\nmuch that they can eat up.\n\n532\n00:28:40.426 --> 00:28:42.175\nThe entire drive won't be destroyed.\n\n533\n00:28:42.175 --> 00:28:45.947\nYou can spare your system volume,\nthose things like that.\n\n534\n00:28:45.947 --> 00:28:48.992\nIf they had a network drive and\nthat had quotas on it, same kind of idea.\n\n535\n00:28:48.992 --> 00:28:53.646\nJust trying to limit the amount of fallout\nthat we have when it comes to having bad\n\n536\n00:28:53.646 --> 00:28:54.900\nguys on our systems.\n\n537\n00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.520\n>> That's right.\nThat's right.\n\n538\n00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.113\nNow you know it's great to, cuz you\ndon't want somebody coming in there and\n\n539\n00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:03.372\nuploading their whole entire music\ncollection to what should be used\n\n540\n00:29:03.372 --> 00:29:05.245\nin a production environment, right?\n\n541\n00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:07.232\nNow you can always couple too,\n\n542\n00:29:07.232 --> 00:29:11.680\nthis is just basic technology to\ngive you something on Windows 10.\n\n543\n00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.180\nIf you couple this with some of\nthe server grade technologies\n\n544\n00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.300\nyou can even go as far as doing\nfile classification saying,\n\n545\n00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.500\nwhat type of files can be stored in\na location, on top of the quotas too.\n\n546\n00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.060\nAt least we've got something built\ninto the Windows 10 operating system.\n\n547\n00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.330\nYou don't have to have\na server to implement this and\n\n548\n00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.070\nit can help you proactively track\nwho's using the space on your drives.\n\n549\n00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.610\n>> Awesome stuff Wes.\n\n550\n00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.930\nThanks for those demonstrations and\nthose tips for our users.\n\n551\n00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.182\nUse them, live by them,\nand keep yourself secure.\n\n552\n00:29:37.182 --> 00:29:40.329\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT ProTV.\n\n553\n00:29:40.329 --> 00:29:41.779\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n554\n00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:42.762\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n555\n00:29:42.762 --> 00:29:44.853\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n556\n00:29:44.853 --> 00:29:52.600\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",

welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.356 --> 00:00:21.078\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're gonna be coming at you with\n\n5\n00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:23.660\nsome more Windows 10 security content.\n\n6\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.740\nToday we're specifically talking\nabout backup, recovery and\n\n7\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.070\ntrying to make sure that we have something\nto go to in case the worst does happen.\n\n8\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.020\nNow joining me in the studio today\nto help lend his expertise on\n\n9\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.649\nthis very subject is none other than mr.\n\n10\n00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.090\nWes Bryan.\nHow's it going today, Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.760\n>> Man, it's going great.\n\n12\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.000\nIt's good to be here, guys.\n\n13\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.680\nI tell you, we got a lot of cool\nconcepts to talk about today.\n\n14\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.681\nAnd one of the first things you\nmight be thinking is, well.\n\n15\n00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:46.578\nWait a second.\nThis is a security episode.\n\n16\n00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:49.643\nWhy are you talking about back up and\nrecovery?.\n\n17\n00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:52.243\nWell, if you think about it, some of\nthe other topics that we've talked about.\n\n18\n00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:54.623\nSome of these viruses and malware.\n\n19\n00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:56.280\nIf your systems aren't too secure,\n\n20\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.279\nyou might get some kind of corruption\ndown there in the hard drive.\n\n21\n00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:04.050\nYou might cuz the operating\nsystem to go absolutely haywire.\n\n22\n00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.890\nSo backup and recovery, understand,\nit's a valid point in security, and\n\n23\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.040\nit's something that we need\nto take very seriously.\n\n24\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670\nIt also should be a part of your\ndaily system maintenance, too.\n\n25\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.362\nCuz remember, availability of\nauthorized users to their data,\n\n26\n00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:21.995\nIf it's not available,\nthen we've got a bad day at the office.\n\n27\n00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:25.820\nSo, Dan, I tell you, when it comes to back\nup and recovery, a very cool concept and\n\n28\n00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.169\ndefinitely something that we need to\nthink of when it comes to security.\n\n29\n00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.749\n>> That's right.\n\n30\n00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.246\nit's not just being preventative.\n\n31\n00:01:32.246 --> 00:01:34.150\nIt's also having to be reactionary.\n\n32\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.520\nRight?\nSometimes things happen.\n\n33\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.750\nThey get through our defense shields, and\n\n34\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.160\nwe have to take steps to\nrectify the situation.\n\n35\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.930\nBackups are really one of our first\nlines of defence, they're very,\n\n36\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.730\nvery important because somebody\ndrops a virus on my machine and\n\n37\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.410\nnow it's hosed up, it's eaten up\na bunch of data, it's corrupted it.\n\n38\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.454\nI no longer have access to it, that whole\nCIA triad in security availability right?.\n\n39\n00:01:58.454 --> 00:02:02.248\nWell we gotta make sure that data is\navailable by keeping a backup and\n\n40\n00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:06.523\nbeing able to restore that backup,\nI restore the availability of the data.\n\n41\n00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:09.843\nSo it does have some security\nimplementations that we need to concern\n\n42\n00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:10.709\nourselves with.\n\n43\n00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.776\nAnd it is just an easy, best practice to\nmake sure you have that data no matter\n\n44\n00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:20.940\nwhat happens whether it be malicious\nintent or just accidental deletion.\n\n45\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.400\n>> For sure, for sure and\n\n46\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.940\nthere's a lot of stuff that's\nbuilt into the operating system.\n\n47\n00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.430\nAs we move into this episode keep in\nmind guys, you probably have some,\n\n48\n00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.260\nmaybe some third party software out\nthere that you use and that's just fine.\n\n49\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.700\nBut we're coming at you from\nthe standpoint that you're just going\n\n50\n00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.870\nto use what maybe might be built into\nthe operating system and I can tell you.\n\n51\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.930\nSome of that has changed over the years,\nso if you go back to the days of XP and\n\n52\n00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.240\nyou're familiar with that,\n\n53\n00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.220\nyou know the way you back up personal\ndata has changed a little bit.\n\n54\n00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.310\nAnd let's show you one of those major\nchanges right here in the operating system\n\n55\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.470\non my Windows 10 machine.\n\n56\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.590\nOne of the first things is\nsomething known as file history.\n\n57\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.620\nThis goes back to the earliest days\nwhen we talk about, for instance,\n\n58\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.050\nsomething called volume shadow copy.\n\n59\n00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.070\nAnd file history is a really,\nreally good utility to have set up.\n\n60\n00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.025\nBut keep in mind, you have to set it\nup first, because it's just not gonna\n\n61\n00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.805\nimplement itself and\nfairly straight forward process here.\n\n62\n00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:19.883\nSo in our settings, down in the lower\nright hand corner, you're gonna see Update\n\n63\n00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:23.663\nand Security and you'll see that when\nwe get into here there is more security\n\n64\n00:03:23.663 --> 00:03:27.683\nproducts that we already talked about\nin some other episodes, Windows Update,\n\n65\n00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:28.720\nWindows Defender.\n\n66\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.288\nBut what I'm really looking for is the\nbackup option right here in the middle.\n\n67\n00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:36.558\nNow when you load up the backup option,\nyou're gonna see here backup files using,\n\n68\n00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:38.156\nor backup using file history.\n\n69\n00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:43.020\nAnd again, this is something that\ncame out for in Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n70\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.400\nSo it's a big departure\nfrom the days of Windows 7.\n\n71\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.751\nAnd I know some of you guys are probably\nvery familiar with that platform and\n\n72\n00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:50.410\nthat operating system, so.\n\n73\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.248\nYou definitely have to be used to this\nas you move into new operating systems.\n\n74\n00:03:54.248 --> 00:03:57.757\nIf your company decides that,\nhey we're going to move to Windows 10,\n\n75\n00:03:57.757 --> 00:04:00.817\nwell guess what you're going to\nneed to be familiar with this.\n\n76\n00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:03.127\nNow it's fairly easy to set up.\n\n77\n00:04:03.127 --> 00:04:08.060\nOne of the first things that you do\nis quite literally just turn it on.\n\n78\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.640\nRight?.\n\n79\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.880\nSo if we turn this on and\ngo to more options\n\n80\n00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.240\nIt's going to look through and\nsee if there's any available drive.\n\n81\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.690\nSo it does a little bit of, a kind of,\n\n82\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.530\nlike a pre system check to see if you have\nexternal drives or maybe even a map share.\n\n83\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.830\nSo what file history does is it takes\npoint and time snapshots of your files\n\n84\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.740\nthat are stored in certain locations,\nand you can see that by default.\n\n85\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.250\nA bunch of these locations\nare already included.\n\n86\n00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.740\nNow what does that mean with\nthese locations these folders?.\n\n87\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.890\nThat means that once, I've turned on file\nhistory and, I've got it set up every one\n\n88\n00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.620\nof the files or sub folders directories\nif you will that are in these locations\n\n89\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.060\nare going to be backed up to whatever\ndrive it is that you set up here.\n\n90\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.880\nNow when you set this up we\ncan choose a backup here.\n\n91\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.200\nYou can choose to remove\nsome of these directories.\n\n92\n00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.170\nMaybe I don't have any games on here,\nmaybe I don't wanna save my favorites.\n\n93\n00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.870\nMaybe I wanna save something like,\nfor instance, to documents and\n\n94\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.880\nwhat's great is it'll show you exactly\nwhat the size of the backup is.\n\n95\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.430\nAnd I can almost tell you that I would\n\n96\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.510\nventure to guess that you can\nsee it's like catching my VM.\n\n97\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.470\nSo it's very good and\nit's fairly intuitive in the fact that it\n\n98\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.480\ncan find what are the common locations.\n\n99\n00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.620\nTypically call them libraries but\n\n100\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.960\nthere's one in here that I can tell you\nis generating a lot of backup data.\n\n101\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.750\nI would almost be willing to bet if\nI had to guess that'd probably be my\n\n102\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.370\nDropbox account.\n\n103\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.140\nSo notice that the size of\nthe backup on the drive here.\n\n104\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.780\nAnd we can run this and it's fairly easy.\n\n105\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.910\nYou run it now,\nfile history it goes a little bit farther.\n\n106\n00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.070\nWhen you backup your information,\nif you've picked your location,\n\n107\n00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.580\nif you've picked your drive, for instance\nI'm backing up to, you can see a removable\n\n108\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.300\ndrive that I've got plugged into the\nmachine right here, this removable disc.\n\n109\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.280\nOne of the things to keep in mind is it'll\ncreate a folder called file history there\n\n110\n00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.000\nand inside of that folder is where\nyour information is going to be.\n\n111\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.970\nNow, once this gets done running you have\nthe ability to recover your data, so for\n\n112\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.650\ninstance, in the more options here,\nif we scroll down I believe,\n\n113\n00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.720\nyeah there we go,\nwe've got some advanced settings here.\n\n114\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.440\nAnd in the advanced settings,\nI can select the drive.\n\n115\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.641\nIf I have multiple drives in a computer,\nI can select which drive,\n\n116\n00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.459\nI want to save this information and\nyou can see right here.\n\n117\n00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.907\nThat I've got the ability that\nif I've got a network share,\n\n118\n00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:35.683\nwhich might be common\nin a company you know,\n\n119\n00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:38.533\nmaybe you're in a corporate\nenvironment where you're saving it to.\n\n120\n00:06:38.533 --> 00:06:41.870\nMaybe you're doing implement folder\nredirection or something, you've got\n\n121\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.203\na centralized file store, probably be\none of the best bets, but you can also,\n\n122\n00:06:45.203 --> 00:06:48.308\nyou don't have to be in that corporate\nenvironment in order to use this.\n\n123\n00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:53.193\nAs you can see, I'm using a little\n64 gig USB drive, and if I want,\n\n124\n00:06:53.193 --> 00:06:56.190\nI can always change this, too.\n\n125\n00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.730\nI do wanna mention,\na couple of the advanced settings here.\n\n126\n00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.020\nAnd you can see that it'll keep copies.\n\n127\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.350\nIt'll take a copy hour by hour of all\nthe files that are in this location.\n\n128\n00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.590\nAnd it'll store it on that drive.\n\n129\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.860\nIf you store this on a removable drive,\nit is not gonna sit.\n\n130\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.760\nIt is not gonna implement file history or\nturn it on until you plug in the drive and\n\n131\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.150\nyou come here say back up the data now.\n\n132\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.250\nGreat thing to have you can integrate\nit with your home group too.\n\n133\n00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.180\nIf you are in a home group situation and\nthis is one thing that I think is great,\n\n134\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.630\nyou don't have to have enterprise,\nyou don't have to have pro.\n\n135\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.460\nSome of the topics that we've talked about\nin the other episodes within this series\n\n136\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.730\nwe've talked about having to have\nenterprise level technologies.\n\n137\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.950\nThis is available for the home too.\n\n138\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.640\nAnd it is a big departure.\n\n139\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.467\nMaybe some of you guys remember back to\nthe days of XP when you would run that\n\n140\n00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:48.051\nbackup utility It would let you\nselectively pick system state data,\n\n141\n00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.001\nwhat locations.\n\n142\n00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:53.376\nThis is the way that pretty much Microsoft\ntoday really wants you to back up personal\n\n143\n00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:57.643\nuser data and I can tell you now, if you\nhaven't seen it, it's a big departure.\n\n144\n00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:59.923\nGet used to it because I think\nit's going to be around for a bit.\n\n145\n00:07:59.923 --> 00:08:01.885\n>> Oh yeah.\nAnd it's really helpful too.\n\n146\n00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:06.055\nIt makes you from Zero to hero in\nthe IT department about that fast,\n\n147\n00:08:06.055 --> 00:08:10.970\npeople will call up and say oh, I've made\nan accidental change to this file and\n\n148\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.440\nall that work I was doing is now gone.\n\n149\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.070\nIs there anything I can do about that?\n\n150\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.870\nYeah, don't worry if we have this running,\n\n151\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.280\nwe should be able to restore it to a\nprevious copy of it and you'll be back to,\n\n152\n00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.960\nat least,\nthat state before you made those changes.\n\n153\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.780\nIf that's the way it was when you started\nand you been working on it for an hour,\n\n154\n00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.050\nyou should be, at least, back to where\nyou were an hour ago before you started.\n\n155\n00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.962\nIt can be very, very helpful.\n\n156\n00:08:31.962 --> 00:08:35.700\n>> Yeah and what's interesting is in the\nnext concept, this is gonna throw you off.\n\n157\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.980\nWe talk about what are some of\nthe other backup utilities that we\n\n158\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.120\nsee inside a Windows 10?\n\n159\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.730\nHere is one for you, how about\nthe Windows 7 Backup and Restore utility?\n\n160\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.810\nNow that might throw you for a loop there.\n\n161\n00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.830\n>> I went to school and they taught me\nhow to count and Windows 7 is before\n\n162\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.570\nWindows 10 and we are talking Windows 10,\nso it's still called Windows 7?\n\n163\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.200\n>> That's right.\n\n164\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.890\nIn fairness to Microsoft,\nwe know how they count to ten.\n\n165\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.800\n>> That's true, that's true.\n\n166\n00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.570\n>> They go 7, 8, 8.1, 10.\n\n167\n00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.250\nWhat this is,\nthis was a utility that's very, very good.\n\n168\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.050\nI'll tell you what,\nlet's go ahead and show it here.\n\n169\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.080\nIf you go into the control panel and\nthen you go to System and Security.\n\n170\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.250\nRight here, in the middle,\nyou're gonna see this Backup and Restore,\n\n171\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.510\nthen it says Windows 7.\n\n172\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.400\nWhen it says Windows 7,\ndon't let it confuse you.\n\n173\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.710\nIt's gonna perform the same functionality\nthat it did inside of Windows 7 but\n\n174\n00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.330\nit can be used on your Windows 10 machine.\n\n175\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330\nThe reason that they brought this back is\nbecause people like the one button click.\n\n176\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.540\nIn fact, Dan and I were talking about this\nbefore we started the show, that why would\n\n177\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.360\nsomebody take a very good utility,\ntake it right out of the operating system?\n\n178\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.840\nThey decided that we're gonna take it out,\nnow we're gonna put it back.\n\n179\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.330\nThere must have been enough complaints and\nthat's one of the big things there.\n\n180\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.130\nWhat can we do with this?\n\n181\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.190\nThis is one of the things I really like,\ncreating a system image.\n\n182\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.320\nThis is probably, I would say,\n\n183\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.990\none of the best utilities that\nare built in the operating system\n\n184\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.130\nif you need to protect your drive\nfrom a corruption or a virus.\n\n185\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.650\nImagine the ability to take a file\n\n186\n00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.250\nby file snapshot of every single\nfile on the drive, a complete clone.\n\n187\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.510\nSome of you guys might know of some other\nsoftware out there that does imaging,\n\n188\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.860\nWDS, we do it in\nthe corporate environment.\n\n189\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.090\nHow about having it on the client?\n\n190\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.140\nNow, it does take a little bit.\n\n191\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.140\nKeep in mind that when you take a system\nimage, it could take a while because\n\n192\n00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.820\nhowever much data is on your drive,\nthe whole entire drive's gonna be copied.\n\n193\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.730\nNow one of the great\nthings about this too,\n\n194\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.750\nis you'll also get the ability\nto create a system repair disc.\n\n195\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.330\nThe System Repair disc is gonna be\nsomething that allows you to launch\n\n196\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.000\nthe Windows Recovery Environment,\nwhich we'll see coming up here in a bit.\n\n197\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.920\nThe other thing, too,\nis when you run the Windows 7 Backup,\n\n198\n00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.680\nonce the system image is done\nit turns around and it asks you,\n\n199\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.740\ndo you want to create\nthis System Repair disc?\n\n200\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.760\nBecause if you have your system image,\n\n201\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.280\nit's not gonna do much good if you don't\nhave the Windows Recovery Environment\n\n202\n00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.250\nthat allows you to do\nthe full image restoration.\n\n203\n00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:13.670\nSo, keep in mind, if you're gonna use this\nutility, which I use it all the time,\n\n204\n00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.330\nmake sure that you run\nthe Create a System Repair disc.\n\n205\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:17.920\nIf you don't do that,\n\n206\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.920\nthen your image is almost useless at that\npoint because you won't have the software\n\n207\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:28.510\noutside of having your installation media\navailable to rebuild that hard drive.\n\n208\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.012\nSo, as much as it says Windows 7 Backup\nand Restore, the traditional Backup and\n\n209\n00:11:32.012 --> 00:11:35.635\nRestore that we've seen inside of Windows\n7, it was taken out of Windows 8.1.\n\n210\n00:11:35.635 --> 00:11:39.837\nAgain, like I was saying to Dan here, they\nmust've complained about it enough that\n\n211\n00:11:39.837 --> 00:11:43.267\nthey said hey, let's put that utility\nin there, and I tell you Dan,\n\n212\n00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:45.540\nit's great to have this in here for\nthe user.\n\n213\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.750\n>> Oh, I missed it sorely.\n\n214\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.460\nThis was a fantastic item to have\nbuilt into the operating system\n\n215\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.290\nbecause I used to use this all the time.\n\n216\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.260\nI'd make a change to my operating system,\nI install some software,\n\n217\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.590\nmaybe I think is gonna cost me some\nproblems or I'm doing some administrative\n\n218\n00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.060\nwork around in the background,\nmaybe some system files and I'm worried.\n\n219\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.900\nMaybe I'm gonna break this thing and\nit's not gonna be useful at all.\n\n220\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.000\nMaybe I wanna install a completely\ndifferent operating system and\n\n221\n00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.310\nplay around that for a while and\n\n222\n00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.190\nnot use a live CD, that kinda thing, I'm\nactually installing it on the hard drive.\n\n223\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.740\nI can actually use this and pop that\nrecovery disc in, restore that image,\n\n224\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.280\nand I'm right back to where I was\nbefore I started messing around.\n\n225\n00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.070\nSo, it can be very,\nvery helpful when it comes to testing but\n\n226\n00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.980\nit also, obviously, we're starting to see\nthe benefits of in that security realm.\n\n227\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.760\nMy computer's been jacked up by some\nserious malware, I've got a good\n\n228\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.902\nimage I know works, I can just restore\nto that image and I'm back live at five.\n\n229\n00:12:38.902 --> 00:12:40.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and let me tell you guys,\n\n230\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:45.280\nthe other thing about backing up your\nsystem, you wanna test your backups,\n\n231\n00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.110\neverybody, we say, run your backups.\n\n232\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.040\nMake sure you have your backups.\n\n233\n00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.100\nI've run my backup, Dan was maybe\nmy supervisor, comes to me and\n\n234\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.500\nsays, hey, Wes did you run the backups?\n\n235\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.630\nYes, I did.\n\n236\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:03.090\nThen in two months, when we need those\nbackups we find out that the data on them\n\n237\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.520\nis corrupted, or\nthe backups aren't really useful.\n\n238\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.400\nAt that point,\nyour backups are absolutely pointless.\n\n239\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.580\nOne of the things that I would recommend\nis if you do run a backup like that,\n\n240\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.690\ntest it's functionality.\n\n241\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.710\nMake sure that it's available, it works.\n\n242\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.770\nDon't wait until you need\na backup to determine whether\n\n243\n00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.970\nthe backup is good or not.\n\n244\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.055\nSo that is definitely\na good thing to have.\n\n245\n00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:28.930\nNow we got some other utilities that\nare kind of new to the Windows operating\n\n246\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.870\nsystem and we can see them here\ngoing back to the settings again and\n\n247\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.170\nthat's this update.\n\n248\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.410\nWe're going back to Update and\nSecurity here.\n\n249\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.990\nBut now, we're going into the Recovery\noption here, and one of the things you'll\n\n250\n00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.130\nnotice right here, Dan, is that we\nhave something called Reset your PC.\n\n251\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.730\nThis is a very good utility if you're\ngonna do something like a push\n\n252\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.550\nbutton and keep your files, push button\nreset, I think is what they call it.\n\n253\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.080\nNow this has definitely\nchanged a little bit.\n\n254\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.560\nWe used to have something known\nas Refresh and Reset your PC.\n\n255\n00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.210\nNotice, Dan, we only have that one option,\nReset your PC.\n\n256\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.660\n>> Yeah, they've taken away the Refresh.\n\n257\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.960\nI guess I couldn't see that cuz what's\nreally the purpose of having both,\n\n258\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.450\nthey both kind of did\nthe exact same thing.\n\n259\n00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.560\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n260\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.699\nThe Refresh your PC is let's say, we get\na piece of malware, the Refresh your\n\n261\n00:14:20.699 --> 00:14:25.837\nPC is the least invasive method because\nwhat it did is it would allow you to keep\n\n262\n00:14:25.837 --> 00:14:31.460\nthe user files, allow you to keep things\nlike your Windows store applications.\n\n263\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.820\nSo a little bit less invasive\nthan the full PC reset,\n\n264\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.640\nwhich is gonna reinstall Windows and\n\n265\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.640\nit's going to wipe out everything,\nit's going to format the drive.\n\n266\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.580\nNow, you might say well\nwait a second is that gone?\n\n267\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.460\nNot really.\n\n268\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.090\nWhat they do is,\nkind of like Dan said cuz they're doing\n\n269\n00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:53.000\nalmost the same functionality, very close,\nlet's just put it into one button.\n\n270\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.770\nThen when we scour your computer and\nwe figure\n\n271\n00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.390\nout that what we're going to reset or\nrefresh, we'll give you the option.\n\n272\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.780\nWe'll just give you the option that says,\ndo you want to save all your files?\n\n273\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.480\nIf you do, technically that's a refresh.\n\n274\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.150\nIf you say, no, discard my files,\nthen let's go ahead and do the reset,\n\n275\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.450\nit's going to reinstall\nWindows completely.\n\n276\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.224\nNow, why might you do one over the other?\n\n277\n00:15:15.565 --> 00:15:19.345\nOne of the things is if you\nget a virus in the user files,\n\n278\n00:15:19.345 --> 00:15:22.235\nsometimes those user files,\nor like the program data, or\n\n279\n00:15:22.235 --> 00:15:25.615\nthe temporary files,\ncan get things like viruses in there.\n\n280\n00:15:25.615 --> 00:15:29.075\nSo you might try\nthe Refresh your PC first.\n\n281\n00:15:29.075 --> 00:15:33.770\nWhen you try the Refresh your PC and you\nkeep those files, if you turn around and\n\n282\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:38.752\ndo a malware scan after the fact, then you\ncan turn around and if that didn't work,\n\n283\n00:15:38.752 --> 00:15:42.981\nwe'd go a little bit more invasive\nhere and we can do the Reset your PC.\n\n284\n00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.789\nKeep in mind that these two options,\nyou should still, if you've\n\n285\n00:15:46.789 --> 00:15:50.937\ngot the capability, I would still run\nthe Windows system image just so,\n\n286\n00:15:50.937 --> 00:15:55.697\nif neither of those work, if you still\nhave problems, if you determine maybe it's\n\n287\n00:15:55.697 --> 00:15:59.171\na hardware issue,\nmaybe you need to replace the hard drive.\n\n288\n00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:02.141\nMaybe it had nothing to do with\nmalware like you originally thought.\n\n289\n00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:05.632\nAt least you have the system image,\nyou can pop a new hard drive in there,\n\n290\n00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:09.238\nre image that drive and then you can\nbe back and going, and hopefully then,\n\n291\n00:16:09.238 --> 00:16:11.220\nwith a minimalistic downtime.\n\n292\n00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.820\n>> Yeah, and this actually really reminds\nme a lot of Internet Explorer, right,\n\n293\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.100\nif something goes completely\nwrong with Internet Explorer,\n\n294\n00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.710\nyou have that advanced option to reset IE,\nright.\n\n295\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.970\nAnd inside of that reset there is here's\nall the things we wanna reset, but\n\n296\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.890\nyou can leave personal data alone.\n\n297\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.411\nIf that doesn't work you can\ngo back into that reset,\n\n298\n00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:32.765\nmake sure to delete all\npersonal data as well, and\n\n299\n00:16:32.765 --> 00:16:36.148\nthat will set IE back to like it was\nif you've never ever used it before.\n\n300\n00:16:36.148 --> 00:16:38.991\nBasically factory defaults\nfrom start to finish.\n\n301\n00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:41.730\nKinda doing the exact same thing\nwith the operating system now.\n\n302\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.520\nThey say, hey that works really great.\n\n303\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.060\nWith the Internet Explorer, let's pipe\nthat into the actual operating system.\n\n304\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.030\nSomeone gets it hosed up to the place it's\njust unusable, hit that reset button,\n\n305\n00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.880\nset it back to how it was the day\nit came from the factory.\n\n306\n00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.680\nIt should start working now.\n\n307\n00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.230\n>> Yeah, definitely and the other\nthing that we've kinda mentioned here,\n\n308\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.640\nwe're gonna demonstrate this in a second.\n\n309\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.960\nIt's something known as\nthe Windows Recovery Environment.\n\n310\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.710\nNow, the windows recovery\nenvironment you might\n\n311\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.510\nhave seen an earlier operating system.\n\n312\n00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.940\nIt's been around since\nthe days of vista and\n\n313\n00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.720\nit had some upgrades over\nthe course of its life cycle here.\n\n314\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.565\nAnd this contain all of these options that\nyou can use if a machine isn't starting.\n\n315\n00:17:19.565 --> 00:17:21.025\nBut before we demonstrate that,\n\n316\n00:17:21.025 --> 00:17:25.685\none of the things I want you to mention\nis the Windows recovery environment is\n\n317\n00:17:25.685 --> 00:17:28.585\nactually built into\nthe operating system today.\n\n318\n00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:31.845\nAnd one of the things that'll happen is,\nif your machine fails to boot,\n\n319\n00:17:31.845 --> 00:17:36.365\nunderstand that when we talk about\na boot process isn't really,\n\n320\n00:17:36.365 --> 00:17:39.430\ntechnically finished until\nthe user successfully logs in.\n\n321\n00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.100\nAnd it builds the users backgrounds.\n\n322\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.950\nIt loads those settings out of the what\nis it the H key users folder down\n\n323\n00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.920\nin the sub tree down in the registry.\n\n324\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.102\nAnd then the boot process is finished.\n\n325\n00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:52.710\nIt's kinda interesting under the hood when\nyou start your Windows operating system,\n\n326\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.300\nthe first thing the boot loader\n\n327\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.630\ndoes is it sets a flag that says\nautomatic fail over to recovery.\n\n328\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.530\nThe moment the users\nsuccessfully logs in and\n\n329\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:07.560\ntheir desktop is rendered, the process\nis finished and that flag is removed.\n\n330\n00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.120\nAll right.\n\n331\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.300\nAnd next time the computer restarts,\nit sets that flag again and\n\n332\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.030\nthat suggests the cyclic process here.\n\n333\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.150\nWhy is it doing that?\n\n334\n00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.750\nWell, let's say.\n\n335\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.380\nYou do get a virus and\nthe computer restarts.\n\n336\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.570\nRemember the boot loaders gonna\nthat flag and you can't log in and\n\n337\n00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.190\nyou get a blue screen or\nit restarts again.\n\n338\n00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.320\nWell, the next time that runs,\nthe boot loader sees that automatic failed\n\n339\n00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.910\nover recovery and said wait a second,\nI don't know what's gone wrong.\n\n340\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.610\nSomething's got wrong so let me go\nahead and throw you automatically,\n\n341\n00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.020\nit's called automatic repair\nyou'll see it on the screen,\n\n342\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.870\nlet me throw you automatically\ninto the recovery environment.\n\n343\n00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.070\nAnd for the most part you can try to\nsolve some of the problems hopefully.\n\n344\n00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:49.480\nThe other thing, though, is if you create\na Recovery Drive inside of Windows,\n\n345\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.400\nwhat you get the ability to do is\n\n346\n00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.370\ntake that technology and\nthrow it into a USB thumb drive.\n\n347\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.870\nAnd then I can keep that.\n\n348\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.580\nI've actually got a USB thumb drive here,\nso\n\n349\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.330\nimagine if we started to have some\nproblems with our operating system and\n\n350\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.380\nwe needed to boot into the recovery\nenvironment in order to fix that.\n\n351\n00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.790\nWe'll go ahead and demonstrate that here.\n\n352\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.140\nNow when you restart your machine,\nwhatever the BIOS or\n\n353\n00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.580\nUEFI the firmware platform tells\nyou to boot into the boot menu,\n\n354\n00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.720\nyou'll just have to choose\nthe right keyboard shortcut here.\n\n355\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.630\nFor Dell, I think it's F12.\n\n356\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.258\nPay attention to whatever hardware\nvendor it is that you have.\n\n357\n00:19:28.258 --> 00:19:31.904\nNow that we've rebooted our machine and\nwe're into the recovery environment,\n\n358\n00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:32.929\nwe have a few options.\n\n359\n00:19:32.929 --> 00:19:36.450\nOne of the first ones that we wanna\nlook at is the troubleshoot option.\n\n360\n00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.570\nRemember that when we\nare troubleshooting a PC,\n\n361\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:44.460\nwe need to get into that recovery\nenvironment, we need to make sure that we\n\n362\n00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.920\nselect whatever the utility is\nthat is right for us at the time.\n\n363\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.830\nNotice we have the reset your PC here,\nkeep in mind with the reset your\n\n364\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.110\nPC you have to have the recovery drive\nin place already made before hand.\n\n365\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.970\nIf you are gonna do the reset your PC, you\ncan also have a Windows Installation disk,\n\n366\n00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.200\nif you happen to have that too.\n\n367\n00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.310\nOne of the ones I want to show you is,\nwhen we get into the Advanced Options\n\n368\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.610\nhere, this is your actual\nrecovery environment.\n\n369\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.720\nNow, with the recovery environment here,\ncouple of things have changed.\n\n370\n00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.780\nOne of the things that have changed\nfrom the earlier recovery environment's\n\n371\n00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.740\nan extra tile here that wasn't here.\n\n372\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.130\nPrior to Windows 10.\n\n373\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.270\nAs Windows 10 is gonna\nlike some other operating\n\n374\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.490\nsystems these incremental upgrades\nrather than service packs.\n\n375\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.050\nOne of the things that they had to\nintroduce was a way to roll back,\n\n376\n00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.380\nif you do upgrade the operating system.\n\n377\n00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.718\nThis is one that is unique to Windows 10.\n\n378\n00:20:33.718 --> 00:20:36.980\nYou're not gonna find this in\nthe earlier recovery environments and\n\n379\n00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.900\nthat's one of the things that is\na tell tale sign that you're in\n\n380\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.190\nthe Windows 10 recovery environment\nis that go to previous build.\n\n381\n00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.080\nNow the next one we have\nhere is Startup and Repair.\n\n382\n00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.770\nNow I really like the Startup and Repair\nbecause it tries to automate the process\n\n383\n00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.490\nof rebuilding things\nlike your startup files,\n\n384\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.050\nit checks the integrity\nof the file system.\n\n385\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.180\nAnd we can actually go ahead and run this\nand you'll see it reboots the machine.\n\n386\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.630\nAs it reboots the machine, it is gonna\nlaunch into the Startup Repair and\n\n387\n00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.470\nit's gonna go through a series of checks\nand balances that it's gonna try to check\n\n388\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.090\nand there we go.\n\n389\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.560\nNotice it says preparing automatic repair.\n\n390\n00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.880\nWhen it goes through this again,\n\n391\n00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.550\nit's gonna check things\nlike your boot partition.\n\n392\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.040\nIt's gonna check your boot files.\n\n393\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.890\nIf there's any corruption\nin the boot files,\n\n394\n00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.560\nit will try to correct them automatically.\n\n395\n00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.430\nNow what we should see here, oh and\n\n396\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.270\nmake sure that you have\nto authenticate as well.\n\n397\n00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.050\nThat is one thing to keep in mind there,\nso let me go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n398\n00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.076\n>> And\nwhy do they want us to authenticate?\n\n399\n00:21:43.076 --> 00:21:44.985\n>> Well because you know.\n\n400\n00:21:44.985 --> 00:21:47.775\n>> You know if you think about it,\nif I've got access to your computer\n\n401\n00:21:47.775 --> 00:21:50.435\nit's one of the ten immutable\nlaws of security for\n\n402\n00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:53.845\nMicrosoft says if I can touch your\ncomputer it's no longer your computer.\n\n403\n00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:56.855\nSo you can see right now it's going\nthrough the process of trying diagnose\n\n404\n00:21:56.855 --> 00:21:57.685\nthis automatically.\n\n405\n00:21:57.685 --> 00:22:00.250\nNow sometimes it works,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n406\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.950\nOne of the things that this might\nwork on is if you have a corruption.\n\n407\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.140\nA kernel power failure,\nsomebody doesn't do a graceful shutdown,\n\n408\n00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.140\nthey pull the power cord or\nwhatever happens.\n\n409\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.910\nLightning strike, hopefully that doesn't\nhappen, it might corrupt the boot files,\n\n410\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.150\nmight corrupt some of the system files.\n\n411\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:21.140\nNow, it's relatively easy and it really\nfor the most part doesn't take too long.\n\n412\n00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.196\nKeep in mind some of the other methods\nwe're gonna talk about are a little bit\n\n413\n00:22:26.196 --> 00:22:31.104\nmore invasive and we always wanna\nstart with the least invasive utility.\n\n414\n00:22:31.104 --> 00:22:36.179\nBecause if you can use\nan automated process like this,\n\n415\n00:22:36.179 --> 00:22:42.246\nit's a lot better than something\nyou have to wipe the hard drive,\n\n416\n00:22:42.246 --> 00:22:46.460\nyou have to reinstall those files and\nget it.\n\n417\n00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.086\nHopefully you don't have to go that far.\n\n418\n00:22:53.858 --> 00:22:55.817\nIt's taking way too long,\nit didn't take that long earlier.\n\n419\n00:23:01.558 --> 00:23:05.336\nWhen I just did this before,\n10 seconds it was done.\n\n420\n00:23:05.336 --> 00:23:06.958\n>> Nice.\n\n421\n00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:07.718\n>> All right.\n\n422\n00:23:07.718 --> 00:23:08.910\nIs it 10 seconds gonna o be then?\n\n423\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:13.770\n>> No when I did it before, 10 seconds\nit was done and I'm restarting now.\n\n424\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.830\n>> It's taking forever.\n\n425\n00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.270\nIs there any way that we\ncan back up a little bit.\n\n426\n00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.436\nI did a cut to you I thought\nyou were gonna [CROSSTALK].\n\n427\n00:23:20.436 --> 00:23:21.516\n>> Well that'll teach you.\n\n428\n00:23:21.516 --> 00:23:22.316\n>> You never know.\n\n429\n00:23:22.316 --> 00:23:24.910\n>> I'm just quibbling.\n\n430\n00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.120\nYou need to make sure I'm running\nmy app before you throw to me.\n\n431\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.740\n>> Can we do that?\n\n432\n00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.410\n>> Yeah cuz this is taking forever,\nand it shouldn't take that long.\n\n433\n00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.500\n>> Yeah that'll work cuz then we\ncan edit this whole waiting for\n\n434\n00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.850\nthis business to finish out.\n\n435\n00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.770\n>> Yep.\n>> See that?\n\n436\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.716\n>> Yeah, that's what I wanna show them,\nthat it didn't find anything.\n\n437\n00:23:41.716 --> 00:23:43.196\n>> How do we back that up?\n\n438\n00:23:43.196 --> 00:23:44.937\n>> There's a problem there, it's Will.\n\n439\n00:23:44.937 --> 00:23:46.430\n>> Yeah.\n\n440\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.700\n>> Because he wanna back up\nbefore you started doing that.\n\n441\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.479\n>> No problem.\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n442\n00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:49.979\n>> Because I-\n\n443\n00:23:49.979 --> 00:23:50.489\n>> No problem.\n\n444\n00:23:50.489 --> 00:23:51.445\n[CROSSTALK] I said,\n\n445\n00:23:51.445 --> 00:23:53.665\nwhy do we authenticate and you cut.\n>> Oh.\n\n446\n00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:55.422\nOkay. Okay. Okay.\n\n447\n00:23:55.422 --> 00:23:57.426\nLet me see if I run this one more time,\n\n448\n00:23:57.426 --> 00:24:00.682\nit shouldn't take as long as it did.\n>> But it will.\n\n449\n00:24:00.682 --> 00:24:01.662\n>> But it does.\n\n450\n00:24:01.662 --> 00:24:03.882\nTen hours.\n\n451\n00:24:03.882 --> 00:24:06.945\nWelcome to hour 17 of our vigil\n\n452\n00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:11.193\nof [LAUGH] waiting.\nThank you for hanging in there with us.\n\n453\n00:24:11.193 --> 00:24:13.780\nOne of these days this will boot.\n\n454\n00:24:18.225 --> 00:24:22.430\n>> [NOISE]\n>> No no whatever cuz you can see it.\n\n455\n00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:27.024\nWhatever you need, just,\nwaiting on a spinning cheerio here.\n\n456\n00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:34.624\nThat's why I was hoping that the XPS,\nbecause the XPS is just rifles through it\n\n457\n00:24:34.624 --> 00:24:37.564\nand says nope we couldn't find\nanything here's your log file.\n\n458\n00:24:37.564 --> 00:24:42.037\n>> I'm surprised we can't just film a\nlittle piece that you put off to the side\n\n459\n00:24:42.037 --> 00:24:45.246\nand say okay I'm gonna take this and\ncut it into here.\n\n460\n00:24:45.246 --> 00:24:46.557\n>> You can edit stuff right there.\n\n461\n00:24:46.557 --> 00:24:47.680\n>> That would be cool.\n\n462\n00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:49.663\nWouldn't that be easier?\n\n463\n00:24:49.663 --> 00:24:53.375\nJust to edit [INAUDIBLE]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n464\n00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:54.796\nI don't make the decisions.\n\n465\n00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:59.564\n>> Right, and just like have the same\nshot, I mean you say the same thing,\n\n466\n00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:03.670\ntake that and\nput it in the spot that was the bad cut.\n\n467\n00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.610\n>> [INAUDIBLE] I could\nuse a voice over for it.\n\n468\n00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:07.270\n>> Right.\n\n469\n00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.750\nHave him just basically voicing it over,\nyeah.\n\n470\n00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:14.288\n>> So, here's what we might do, we might\ngo back to the authentication part, and\n\n471\n00:25:14.288 --> 00:25:17.630\nI'll start this, and\nwe'll go to a cut and wait for it to.\n\n472\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.090\n>> Will this take a long time?\n\n473\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.515\n>> Who knows.\n>> We don't know, it should,\n\n474\n00:25:24.515 --> 00:25:28.925\nthe XPS just like that.\n\n475\n00:25:28.925 --> 00:25:32.678\n>> You are [INAUDIBLE] familiar.\n>> I like computers, they are fun.\n\n476\n00:25:32.678 --> 00:25:37.879\n>> That was it, that's what I'm waiting\non, to show them that it fails.\n\n477\n00:25:37.879 --> 00:25:42.686\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> This might be one where maybe we don't\n\n478\n00:25:42.686 --> 00:25:45.802\nshow start up and repair,\nwe just talk about it.\n\n479\n00:25:45.802 --> 00:25:46.915\n>> You just wanna cut it all together?\n\n480\n00:25:46.915 --> 00:25:51.816\n>> You know what we can do is all\nthe verbiage you had about startup\n\n481\n00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:56.243\nrepair is we'll put it into waiting for\nit to do it, so,\n\n482\n00:25:56.243 --> 00:26:00.500\nif we back up to where you\nintroed start up and repair.\n\n483\n00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.034\nWhat we do wanna do is take a look at\nstart up repair, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n484\n00:26:04.034 --> 00:26:06.827\nkick this off because it can\ntake a minute or two to do this.\n\n485\n00:26:06.827 --> 00:26:10.988\nAnd so here's the basics, you're going to\nclick this, click that, click that, and\n\n486\n00:26:10.988 --> 00:26:14.190\nnow while we're waiting for it,\nlet me explain what's going on.\n\n487\n00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:20.290\nAnd so by the time you get done\ntalking about it, it should be done.\n\n488\n00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.190\n>> Okay.\n>> That way-\n\n489\n00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.580\n>> Yeah, that's what I was trying to.\n\n490\n00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.479\n>> If you're not showing stuff what's\nthe point of running a video show.\n\n491\n00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:30.229\n>> That's right, that's right.\nWe're gonna back up to where I\n\n492\n00:26:30.229 --> 00:26:33.240\nauthenticate, right?\n\n493\n00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.120\n>> No, before that right?\n\n494\n00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.970\n>> Yeah.\n>> You're gonna be back in\n\n495\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.560\nthe Advanced Options screen and\nchoose Startup repair.\n\n496\n00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.748\n>> Well that,\nthe authentication, okay, yep,\n\n497\n00:26:41.748 --> 00:26:42.331\nyep, yep-\n>> Right?\n\n498\n00:26:42.331 --> 00:26:45.430\n>> Yep.\nLet me just do that again.\n\n499\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:46.417\n>> Close up shot.\n\n500\n00:26:46.417 --> 00:26:51.619\n>> Yeah, that'll work, and\nthen jump straight to the like give\n\n501\n00:26:51.619 --> 00:26:57.121\nhim a second to say so\nlet's jump back into our advanced options,\n\n502\n00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:03.842\nwhich will allow you to bring up the\ndouble box, Titus is completely confused.\n\n503\n00:27:03.842 --> 00:27:11.492\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah I can see it's\na pain when this, takes so long.\n\n504\n00:27:11.492 --> 00:27:15.056\n>> That's why I say, it's nice for them\nto just be able to roll back and see and\n\n505\n00:27:15.056 --> 00:27:19.320\njust go right there, that's where you need\nto and that's where we're picking back up.\n\n506\n00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.780\n>> [COUGH] So,\nwhere are we picking back up?\n\n507\n00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.150\n>> Alright, so here's what happened.\n\n508\n00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:29.968\nWe booted the thing, it finally\ncame into the recover console area,\n\n509\n00:27:29.968 --> 00:27:35.285\nyou were showing I believe something\nthat was not on this list,\n\n510\n00:27:35.285 --> 00:27:38.925\nand then you said let's jump back to the-\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n511\n00:27:38.925 --> 00:27:40.133\n>> Advanced options.\n\n512\n00:27:40.133 --> 00:27:41.243\n>> Yeah.\n>> This is really,\n\n513\n00:27:41.243 --> 00:27:43.370\noh you went to trouble shooting.\n\n514\n00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.812\n>> Yup.\n>> That it you went to trouble shooting,\n\n515\n00:27:45.812 --> 00:27:49.400\nand then you were shown something there,\nand you said but\n\n516\n00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.980\nright here is where your actual repair\noptions or advanced options are.\n\n517\n00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.952\nThat's where we wanna go,\nthe advanced options, Startup repair, and\n\n518\n00:27:57.952 --> 00:28:02.330\ninstead of talking about startup repair\nand then showing it, show it and talk.\n\n519\n00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.610\n>> Okay.\n\n520\n00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.590\nOkay.\n>> All right.\n\n521\n00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.780\nThat way, you can wait.\n\n522\n00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.706\n>> Or you can wait for it, yeah.\n\n523\n00:28:09.706 --> 00:28:10.218\n>> Wait for it.\n\n524\n00:28:10.218 --> 00:28:11.833\n>> Wait for it.\n\n525\n00:28:11.833 --> 00:28:14.491\nSo right here at this screen,\ntroubleshoots.\n\n526\n00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:16.337\nOr right there at that screen?\n\n527\n00:28:16.337 --> 00:28:17.057\n>> That screen.\n\n528\n00:28:17.057 --> 00:28:18.658\nYeah.\n\n529\n00:28:18.658 --> 00:28:19.158\nRight here.\n\n530\n00:28:19.158 -->

so.\n\n532\n00:28:43.061 --> 00:28:45.069\n>> Yeah.\n>> Eight minutes of so, yep.\n\n533\n00:28:45.069 --> 00:28:49.250\nCuz this one right here is gonna be\nthe longest, all the other stuff is just\n\n534\n00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:53.265\nvery easy, straightforward\n>> And then Wes, you just come in with,\n\n535\n00:28:53.265 --> 00:28:57.610\nso now let's take a look at the advanced\noptions and see what we have.\n\n536\n00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.663\n>> Okay.\n\n537\n00:28:58.663 --> 00:29:00.823\n>> Right here, this is where I\nreally want to start up in repair.\n\n538\n00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:01.461\n>> Yup.\n\n539\n00:29:01.461 --> 00:29:04.251\n>> Because if you are in full screen,\nand you're like,\n\n540\n00:29:04.251 --> 00:29:08.101\nanother one of the options that we\nhave is, you know, it's disjointed.\n\n541\n00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:08.867\n>> Okay.\n\n542\n00:29:08.867 --> 00:29:11.526\n>> You just say, so now,\nit's almost like there is no cut.\n\n543\n00:29:11.526 --> 00:29:12.083\n>> Okay.\n\n544\n00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:15.302\n>> It's segueing into it, so you just say,\nlet's take a look at those advanced\n\n545\n00:29:15.302 --> 00:29:18.090\noptions, which makes this full\nscreen not look so weird, right?\n\n546\n00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.945\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay, we fullscreen on you so\n\n547\n00:29:19.945 --> 00:29:23.910\nthat you could intro, and\nthen boom, he double-boxes you.\n\n548\n00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.820\n>> Okay.\n>> And then you're off to the races.\n\n549\n00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.625\n>> Okay, and hopefully, I could talk for.\n\n550\n00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:31.652\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Five minutes about Startup repair.\n\n551\n00:29:31.652 --> 00:29:33.070\n>> It won't take that long.\n\n552\n00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.680\nIt just seems longer than it does.\n\n553\n00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.190\n>> It does [LAUGH].\n\n554\n00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.663\n>> Trust me, when someone says, Let's do\na short of 2 minutes, 12 minutes later,\n\n555\n00:29:41.663 --> 00:29:42.806\nI'm still talking.\n\n556\n00:29:42.806 --> 00:29:44.478\n>> That's it?\n\n557\n00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:48.193\nYep.\n\n558\n00:29:48.193 --> 00:29:49.830\nI can move.\n\n559\n00:29:58.199 --> 00:30:00.336\n>> Can you please put these\nrusty tacks in your shoes?\n\n560\n00:30:00.336 --> 00:30:02.634\n>> Ow.\n\n561\n00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:03.737\n>> I want you comfortable.\n\n562\n00:30:03.737 --> 00:30:05.153\n>> Ow, ow ow.\n\n563\n00:30:05.153 --> 00:30:07.693\n>> After the show, we're going to\nhave you clean all the bathrooms\n\n564\n00:30:07.693 --> 00:30:09.541\nin Grand Central Station,\nwith your tongue.\n\n565\n00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:12.020\n>> With a toothbrush, your toothbrush.\n\n566\n00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.280\n>> With your tongue.\n\n567\n00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:19.710\n>> So we're going, let's go ahead and\ncheck the advanced options,\n\n568\n00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.962\nlet's go ahead and check that out.\n\n569\n00:30:21.962 --> 00:30:24.604\n>> Let's say, just say take\na look at the advanced options.\n\n570\n00:30:24.604 --> 00:30:25.400\n>> Gotcha.\n\n571\n00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.261\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Are you ready bud?\n\n572\n00:30:27.261 --> 00:30:34.339\n[SOUND]\nSo\n\n573\n00:30:34.339 --> 00:30:37.013\nlet's go ahead and take a look\nat those advanced options here.\n\n574\n00:30:37.013 --> 00:30:40.708\nNow in the advanced options, one of\nthe first ones that we wanna look at is\n\n575\n00:30:40.708 --> 00:30:43.800\nthe start up and repair,\nnow the reason, let's go ahead and\n\n576\n00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.148\nstart the startup repair,\nthat's a little redundant, right.\n\n577\n00:30:47.148 --> 00:30:49.049\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well this is a very good\n\n578\n00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:52.579\nprocess because one of the things\nthat it allows you to do,\n\n579\n00:30:52.579 --> 00:30:57.710\nit's a little bit lease invasive, it gives\nyou the chance to automate the process.\n\n580\n00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:02.436\nNow that's the goal here is to try to\nautomatically repair your computer,\n\n581\n00:31:02.436 --> 00:31:05.286\nit will go through some checks and\nbalances,\n\n582\n00:31:05.286 --> 00:31:10.011\none of the things that it's gonna do\nis it's gonna look at your boot files,\n\n583\n00:31:10.011 --> 00:31:13.482\nit's gonna look at certain\nlow level system drivers.\n\n584\n00:31:13.482 --> 00:31:18.136\nAnd if there is a problem with the boot,\nif you will, it's gonna try to fix that,\n\n585\n00:31:18.136 --> 00:31:21.832\nnow, one of the things that you're\ngonna do here, you can see,\n\n586\n00:31:21.832 --> 00:31:24.800\nis we're gonna have to go ahead and\nauthenticate.\n\n587\n00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.870\nSo let me go ahead, and\nwe'll log into this machine here, and\n\n588\n00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:34.036\nit is gonna go through the process, now\nagain keep in mind as it is diagnosing,\n\n589\n00:31:34.036 --> 00:31:36.730\nthere is a lot of things that it is doing.\n\n590\n00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:41.617\nAnd one of the things that you will see\nis if it does find some issues with your\n\n591\n00:31:41.617 --> 00:31:45.807\ncomputer and if it tries to fix those,\nyou can see that log file,\n\n592\n00:31:45.807 --> 00:31:49.781\nthat's one of the good things about it,\nit keeps a log file.\n\n593\n00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:54.627\nNow the log file is gonna be down in\nthe Windows System 32 folder, and\n\n594\n00:31:54.627 --> 00:31:59.491\nit's under log files SRT, and\nthen you'll see this SRTtrail.txt.\n\n595\n00:31:59.491 --> 00:32:02.031\nTfile, you can open that up.\n\n596\n00:32:02.031 --> 00:32:06.632\nYou can look through all the listings,\nall the checks that it's done and\n\n597\n00:32:06.632 --> 00:32:09.724\nthe great thing is,\nit puts it out there for you so\n\n598\n00:32:09.724 --> 00:32:12.910\nyou can see not only what\nStartup Repair is doing.\n\n599\n00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.440\nOne of the things that\nyou can also do is find\n\n600\n00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.570\nout as it diagnosis things it might say,\npassed this test, passes this test.\n\n601\n00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.480\nMaybe it gets to the second or\nthe third test that it's gonna do.\n\n602\n00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.860\nAnd it finds a problem so\nyou can help to diagnose it, Dan.\n\n603\n00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.760\n>> Yeah, now, Wes, what happens\nif it does find something wrong?\n\n604\n00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.135\nA file maybe is out of whack.\n\n605\n00:32:33.135 --> 00:32:34.284\nWhat does it do with that?\n\n606\n00:32:34.284 --> 00:32:36.921\n>> Well,\nthe good thing about it is it tries to.\n\n607\n00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.910\n>> Hey, hey, let me.\n\n608\n00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:40.720\n>> All right.\n\n609\n00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.075\n>> I noticed that little jump there.\n\n610\n00:32:42.075 --> 00:32:43.495\n>> Yep.\n\n611\n00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:44.490\nHe's Jiminy Clickit today.\n\n612\n00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:45.030\n>> That's okay.\n\n613\n00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:45.960\nIt goes along with.\n\n614\n00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.570\n>> He's been drinking\nespresso all morning.\n\n615\n00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.131\nHe's like [SOUND].\n\n616\n00:32:50.131 --> 00:32:52.201\n>> With the buttons.\n\n617\n00:32:52.201 --> 00:32:54.538\nWhenever I'm ready?\n\n618\n00:32:54.538 --> 00:32:55.239\n>> Yeah.\n\n619\n00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:56.248\n>> Whenever you're ready.\n\n620\n00:32:56.248 --> 00:32:56.965\n>> All right.\n>> We're still diagnosing if you wanna\n\n621\n00:32:56.965 --> 00:32:58.243\nwait a second.\n>> [LAUGH] No, that's fine.\n\n622\n00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:04.202\nIt'll be done by the time we get done.\n\n623\n00:33:04.202 --> 00:33:07.803\nSo Wes what happens if the system\nrepair finds a file that's out of wack,\n\n624\n00:33:07.803 --> 00:33:09.290\nit's not working properly?\n\n625\n00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.578\nHow does it handle that situation?\n\n626\n00:33:11.578 --> 00:33:12.326\n>> Well that's good.\n\n627\n00:33:12.326 --> 00:33:16.067\nIt's got built into the software,\nits got the logic,\n\n628\n00:33:16.067 --> 00:33:21.160\nthat it knows keeping a data base\nof what's wrong, how to fix it.\n\n629\n00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.860\nSo if it does find a problem with a file\nor it looks and it checks them and\n\n630\n00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.480\nit says hey these don't match, let me go\nahead and automatically try to fix this.\n\n631\n00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.640\nNow you can see right here that after\nthe startup repair gets done running and\n\n632\n00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.080\nit says, it tells me very basically\ncannot fix this problem, or\n\n633\n00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.540\ncouldn't fix the problem.\n\n634\n00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.720\nYou'll see down here that that's\nwhere that little log file is and\n\n635\n00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.650\nyou can check that out.\n\n636\n00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:50.550\nSo Startup Repair is one of the, again,\nless invasive utilities and we always to\n\n637\n00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.560\nstart in a recovery process, you always\nwanna start with the least invasive and\n\n638\n00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.740\nwe can always work our way,you\nknow it's a more invasive method.\n\n639\n00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:01.260\nNow continuing on here\nin the advanced options,\n\n640\n00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.970\none the things we can do here is\nwe can also do system restore.\n\n641\n00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:09.831\nNow keep in mind that system restore\nis contingent on having restore\n\n642\n00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:13.668\npoints set up Beforehand so\nif we run System Restore,\n\n643\n00:34:13.668 --> 00:34:18.210\nnotice right here it says\nSystem Protection isn't turned on.\n\n644\n00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:22.417\nThe point being here is, inside of your\nSystem Properties you have to make sure\n\n645\n00:34:22.417 --> 00:34:25.370\nthat your System Restore is enabled and\nturned on.\n\n646\n00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:30.200\nAnd as you do things like, for\ninstance, install drivers, you install\n\n647\n00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.860\nan application, Windows updates,\nit's gonna create these restore points.\n\n648\n00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.840\nAnd if you do have\na problem with the machine,\n\n649\n00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.710\nyou can restore to\nan earlier point in time.\n\n650\n00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.420\nNow, we also got some\nadditional utilities, too.\n\n651\n00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.550\nAnd one of the ones that I like here\nis there's your system image recovery.\n\n652\n00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.150\nKeep in mind,\n\n653\n00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:52.200\nyou've gotta have that system image that\nwe've talked about in the backup and\n\n654\n00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.390\nrestore for quote, unquote Windows 7,\n[LAUGH] already set up and ready to go.\n\n655\n00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:01.330\nAnd this is the process that you would\nuse to apply that system image back\n\n656\n00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.520\nto the hard drive.\n\n657\n00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.110\nKeep in mind, that hopefully you've\ncreated the system repair disk or\n\n658\n00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.710\nyou won't even see these options.\n\n659\n00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.360\nThat's where these options come from.\n\n660\n00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.508\nThe other one that I really like\nhere is the Command Prompt.\n\n661\n00:35:12.508 --> 00:35:16.190\nNow the command prompt does it's\nnot gonna look too glorious here,\n\n662\n00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.180\nit does exactly what it sounds like.\n\n663\n00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.680\nBut inside here,\nit is aware of the file system.\n\n664\n00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.200\nIt can initiate the file system so\n\n665\n00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.000\nyou have access to a lot\nof the different utilities.\n\n666\n00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.010\nOne of the utilities that you have access\nto, and you only have access to this\n\n667\n00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.180\nfrom the recovery environment\nis what's known as Bootrec.\n\n668\n00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:36.480\nAnd bootrec allows you to do some\ndifferent things for instance if I wanted\n\n669\n00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.838\nto I could type bootrec /rebuildbcd.\n\n670\n00:35:41.838 --> 00:35:47.830\nAnd in doing this oops gotta spell it\nright I don't know what vootrec is,\n\n671\n00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.330\nI'm making my own contribution's.\n\n672\n00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.160\n>> Neither does Windows.\n\n673\n00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:55.370\n>> That's right apparently Windows, you\ngotta spell it right it's B-O-O-T-R-E-C.\n\n674\n00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.160\n>> I think that's more for\nme than it is of yours out there, and\n\n675\n00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.960\nit's gonna go through and it's gonna say\nokay did I find an installation that's on\n\n676\n00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.060\nthis machine that's not in the boot\nconfiguration data because it's corrupted?\n\n677\n00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.850\nIf it does it can slipstream that entry\nback into your boot configuration data, so\n\n678\n00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:15.480\nthat next time you reboot your\nsystem the boot loader knows that,\n\n679\n00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.740\nhey you've got an operating system there,\nso very good utility to have.\n\n680\n00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.650\nThe other things that you could run\nfrom inside of here as well ,is like,\n\n681\n00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.750\nfor instance SFC, system file checker.\n\n682\n00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.770\nMaybe I think I might have\na corruption with the system files.\n\n683\n00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:33.430\nNow, start up repair\nshould catch that fact.\n\n684\n00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.380\nBut if it doesn't you can turn around and\n\n685\n00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.180\nrun your system file checker\nhere from the command prompt.\n\n686\n00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.280\nThe other one that you could\npotentially run too is check disk.\n\n687\n00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:46.470\nSo we've got the ability that if\nwe want too, we can run our all\n\n688\n00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:51.430\nthe options that we have inside command\nprompt and it's good to have access to it.\n\n689\n00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.300\nKeep in mind that the boot req utility,\nyou're not gonna see that built into\n\n690\n00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.640\nthe operating system, it has to\ncome from the recovery environment.\n\n691\n00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.079\nAnd you can just take my word for\nthat one,\n\n692\n00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:04.703\nbecause if you try to launch it in\nthe native command prompt, it's not there.\n\n693\n00:37:04.703 --> 00:37:06.346\nOne of the last ones that I would say,\n\n694\n00:37:06.346 --> 00:37:08.743\nfinal ones that I would say\nare the startup settings.\n\n695\n00:37:08.743 --> 00:37:11.999\nSome of you guys say hey,\nmaybe been in Windows for a while,\n\n696\n00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:15.206\nyou say, well is it still\npossible to boot into safe mode?\n\n697\n00:37:15.206 --> 00:37:16.784\nCan we do things like that?\n\n698\n00:37:16.784 --> 00:37:20.180\nThen we'll can go ahead and\nits gonna ask us to restart this machine.\n\n699\n00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.660\nNow when we restart this machine.\n\n700\n00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.588\nIf you guys remember the old F8 key\nyou had pressed to boot into some of\n\n701\n00:37:25.588 --> 00:37:26.963\nthe advanced options.\n\n702\n00:37:26.963 --> 00:37:28.510\nYou can see them right here.\n\n703\n00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:30.840\nThese are all those traditional ones.\n\n704\n00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.570\nThose oldies but goodies and\nif I wanted to boot into safe mode.\n\n705\n00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:35.650\nKeep in mind safe mode.\n\n706\n00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:38.470\nIf I have like virus\nthat causing a problem,\n\n707\n00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:42.740\nan executables installed itself and\nit's running, when you put into safe mode,\n\n708\n00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.470\nit only loads what's necessary to get\nthe operating systems functional.\n\n709\n00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:51.210\nSo those third party\ndrivers aren't gonna load.\n\n710\n00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.600\nThat executable there.\n\n711\n00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:57.100\nHopefully it's not gonna load so that you\ncan maybe run some malware software and\n\n712\n00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.400\ninitiate it in safe mode you can\npoint it to that sleeping virus,\n\n713\n00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.060\nthat sleeping executable that causing\nthe problem and can remove it.\n\n714\n00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.010\nThe other thing that is in\nhere too that I wanna mention,\n\n715\n00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:11.590\nnumber eight is this disable early\nlaunch anti-malware protection.\n\n716\n00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:14.000\nI don't wanna talk about it in\nthe context of disabling it, but\n\n717\n00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.390\nto tell you what ELAM is.\n\n718\n00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.048\nAnother acronym.\n\n719\n00:38:16.048 --> 00:38:20.960\nEarly Launch Anti-Malware Protection\nis a driver\n\n720\n00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.080\nthat runs in the early portions of\nthe boot process on a Windows machine.\n\n721\n00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.580\nAnd what it does is it checks\nthe integrity of the boot start drivers,\n\n722\n00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.300\nthat gets the hardware online from\nthe operating system, if you will.\n\n723\n00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.360\nIt allows it to start\ncommunicating with it.\n\n724\n00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.120\nAnd it runs every time\nyour computer starts and\n\n725\n00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.500\nif it detects that there's some kinda\nproblem with those system drivers.\n\n726\n00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.170\nAnd Dan,\nwe've talked about this with root kits.\n\n727\n00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.430\nVery hard to detect a root kit.\n\n728\n00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:50.990\nSo what this does is it says, let me\ncheck those system files at boot time And\n\n729\n00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.900\nsee if they've maintained their integrity.\n\n730\n00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:57.530\nIf the checks them and don't match up,\nit's gonna cause, you know, it'll try to\n\n731\n00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:01.590\nrepair them and shut down any executable\nit's trying to run in your boot process.\n\n732\n00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.210\nSo very good thing to have.\n\n733\n00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.260\nIt's a good thing to know\nthat it's available there.\n\n734\n00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.330\nAnd it's a good thing as\nwell to troubleshoot, Dan.\n\n735\n00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:08.838\n>> That's right.\n\n736\n00:39:08.838 --> 00:39:12.300\nAnd so, let you know that there are some\nreally great features built into\n\n737\n00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.209\nthe Windows 10 operating system\nthat help us keep secure.\n\n738\n00:39:15.209 --> 00:39:18.767\nWe've seen some of the great stuff\ninside of the GUI, like the file backup,\n\n739\n00:39:18.767 --> 00:39:19.999\nthat is an amazing thing.\n\n740\n00:39:19.999 --> 00:39:21.451\nDefinitely take advantage of that.\n\n741\n00:39:21.451 --> 00:39:24.470\nAlso take advantage of the restore points.\n\n742\n00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.040\nTurn that on, use those features.\n\n743\n00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.620\nThey're very, very helpful.\n\n744\n00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.410\nAnd then if the GUI does\nget kind of messed up,\n\n745\n00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.780\nyou can't get into there,\nwe are not left without options.\n\n746\n00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.780\nWe can boot into the recovery area.\n\n747\n00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.710\nAnd start using some of those\nadvanced features found in there.\n\n748\n00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:42.030\nWes is there anything else that we need\nto go over before we call it a day?\n\n749\n00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:46.630\n>> No, the one thing that I would\nmention is just make sure your file,\n\n750\n00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:50.500\nif you're using file history, look to make\nsure that those files are on the drive or\n\n751\n00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.090\nthe network location that\nyou're backing them up to.\n\n752\n00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.978\nIf you're performing system images,\ntry to restore them.\n\n753\n00:39:55.978 --> 00:39:57.598\nDon't wait until you need your backups.\n\n754\n00:39:57.598 --> 00:40:02.120\nDon't wait until you need your files that\nyou hope the file history is working.\n\n755\n00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.670\nConfirm beforehand so that when you\ndo need them, they'll be available.\n\n756\n00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.247\n>> Daily affirmations with Mr. Wes Bryant.\n\n757\n00:40:08.247 --> 00:40:09.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n758\n00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.587\nThanks for hanging out with us.\n\n759\n00:40:10.587 --> 00:40:11.162\n>> Been great, man.\n\n760\n00:40:11.162 --> 00:40:11.678\nThank you.\n>> And\n\n761\n00:40:11.678 --> 00:40:13.206\nshowing us how to use this\nWindows 10 operating system.\n\n762\n00:40:13.206 --> 00:40:14.078\nWe appreciate it.\n\n763\n00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:14.671\n>> That's right.\n\n764\n00:40:14.671 --> 00:40:15.951\n>> We thank everybody out there for\nwatching.\n\n765\n00:40:15.951 --> 00:40:17.417\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nclose the show down.\n\n766\n00:40:17.417 --> 00:40:18.246\nThanks for watching.\n\n767\n00:40:18.246 --> 00:40:19.539\nIt's been fun.\n\n768\n00:40:19.539 --> 00:40:20.069\n>> It has.\n\n769\n00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.616\n>> Right?\n\n770\n00:40:20.616 --> 00:40:21.460\nFor IT Pro TV.\n\n771\n00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.254\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n772\n00:40:22.254 --> 00:40:23.206\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n773\n00:40:23.206 --> 00:40:24.921\nWe'll see you next time.\n\n774\n00:40:24.921 --> 00:40:30.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "description": "In this episode, Daniel and Wes look at configuring a Windows 10 client to connect securely to a wireless network. First they go over the different encryption types (WEP/WPS/WPA/WPA2) that may be supported by any given access point. Then they jump to the Windows 10 client and configure things like the Windows Firewall profile as well as showing how to connect to a secure wireless network. They also demonstrate other wireless security measures like WiFi Sense and MAC filtering.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.280\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we're\n\n4\n00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.750\ngonna covering more Windows 10 security\ncontent, specifically wireless security.\n\n5\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.924\nAnd I brought a person onboard\nhere to help us out with that,\n\n6\n00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:29.029\nlend his expertise to that very topic.\n\n7\n00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.991\nIt's none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:31.865\nHow's it going today, Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.581\n>> Man, it's going good.\n\n10\n00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.267\nIt's good to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:37.368\nWe've got another exciting episode and I\ntell you, we're coming at you with a whole\n\n12\n00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:40.747\nbunch of alphabet soup, things you\ncan use in your own environment.\n\n13\n00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:43.265\nIn fact, right after you get\ndone watching this video,\n\n14\n00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:46.693\nyou might even be able to check some of\nthese concepts out and be sure that your\n\n15\n00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:50.410\nwireless devices are a little bit more\nsecure when you're running Windows 10.\n\n16\n00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.900\nNow, when it comes to wireless, wireless\nis becoming more and more prevalent, and\n\n17\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.970\nwith the exponential growth of the devices\nthat are connected to a wireless network,\n\n18\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.220\nit is important today's day and age to\nmake sure that you understand some of\n\n19\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.790\nthe security concepts, you understand\nsome of the options you have so\n\n20\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.960\nthat you don't make the wrong choice.\n\n21\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.160\nAnd one of the first things that we wanna\ntalk about are some of the encryption\n\n22\n00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.710\nprotocols that we used to\nsecure this wireless networks.\n\n23\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.139\nNow, couple of acronyms, let's get out\nthe way right away, we've got WEP,\n\n24\n00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:23.841\nWired Equivalent Privacy, we've also got\nsomething know as Wi-Fi Protected Get\n\n25\n00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:28.499\naccess to WPA, and we also have the\nsequel, WPA2, wi-fi protected access 2.\n\n26\n00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.709\nSo Dan, lot of choices out there, and\n\n27\n00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.520\nit can be sometimes confusing as\nto which one you're gonna pick.\n\n28\n00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.090\n>> Yeah, I've seen this a lot,\npeople don't know what to use.\n\n29\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.374\nThey see all these different protocols\nthat are in the security box, so you hit\n\n30\n00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:43.986\nthat little drop down arrow, and you're\ngreeted with all these different choices.\n\n31\n00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:45.622\nWhich ones do I use?\n\n32\n00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:46.388\nWhich one's the best?\n\n33\n00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:50.440\nDo I need to use this one for one type\nof wireless network and this one for\n\n34\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.274\nanother one?\n\n35\n00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.242\nA lot of people don't know.\n\n36\n00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:55.202\nSo we're gonna help demystify\na little bit before\n\n37\n00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:59.794\nwe get into how to employ those different\nthings inside Windows 10 itself.\n\n38\n00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:01.295\nSo, Wes, where's a good place to start?\n\n39\n00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:02.128\nI guess WEP.\n\n40\n00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:02.637\n>> That's right.\n\n41\n00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:04.958\nWe're gonna start right there\nwith the very first one.\n\n42\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.035\nIn fact, let's go ahead and dive right in\nto our access point and show you that.\n\n43\n00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:10.272\nNow, when you look at\nan access point interface,\n\n44\n00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:14.112\nit's gonna be a little bit different for\nevery different wireless access point, but\n\n45\n00:02:14.112 --> 00:02:17.309\none of the things you can see right here\nis the fact that we have quite a few\n\n46\n00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:21.394\nchoices, and at the bottom of the stack,\nwe've got, well, wired equivalent privacy.\n\n47\n00:02:21.394 --> 00:02:22.940\nWhy is it at the bottom of the stack?\n\n48\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.540\nWell, again,\nit might not be on every router,\n\n49\n00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.590\nbut one of the reasons they\ntry to tuck this one away and\n\n50\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.480\nhopefully you can't see it is because it\nwas the very first encryption protocol\n\n51\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.050\nto ever be released when the IEEE\nstandardized something known as 802.111,\n\n52\n00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.800\nwhich is just their formal specification\nfor the wireless local area networks.\n\n53\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.320\nNow WEP, or Wired Equivalent Privacy,\ndoes have a lot of issues.\n\n54\n00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.072\nOne of the biggest issues is that it's\nsurrounded by all kinds of weaknesses and\n\n55\n00:02:48.072 --> 00:02:51.376\nwe really dive into depth on some of\nthese security protocols in some of\n\n56\n00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:52.398\nour other episodes.\n\n57\n00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:54.465\nSo it's a pump over those episodes so\ncheck them out.\n\n58\n00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:58.611\nOne of the things that we really just\nwanna know is that it can be cracked\n\n59\n00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:59.185\neasily.\n\n60\n00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:01.825\nAnd when I say easy, within two minutes,\n\n61\n00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:06.440\nby the time it takes to play like\nwhatever your favorite music video is.\n\n62\n00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.940\nYou can see even kids\ncracking these access\n\n63\n00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.410\npoints that still use\nthe Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n64\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.832\nNow, one of the other things that we have\nis something know as WPA, and what is WPA?\n\n65\n00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:20.560\nWell, if you look right here,\nWPA is the successor of WEP and\n\n66\n00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.659\nit's kinda interesting on\nhow this one worked out.\n\n67\n00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.213\nThe IEEE they didn't wait when they\nissued out WEP they knew that it's\n\n68\n00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:32.231\nnot gonna be the one-stop shop for\nsecurity.\n\n69\n00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:36.270\nIn fact, if you think about the name,\nWired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n70\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.520\nAll it means is that you're gonna get\nthe same kind of privacy on the network if\n\n71\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.920\nyou plugged into a wired network.\n\n72\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.250\nAnd we'd know that if we're\nnot implementing encryption,\n\n73\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.960\nthere really isn't any privacy\non that wireless network.\n\n74\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.300\nSo when WPA came out,\nit was actually a rush type job.\n\n75\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.462\nThe WFi alliance, a consortium of wireless\nmanufacturers went to the IEEE and\n\n76\n00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:55.678\nthey said, hey, we need something now.\n\n77\n00:03:55.678 --> 00:03:57.094\nWhat do you have for us?\n\n78\n00:03:57.094 --> 00:04:00.408\nAnd they say well we haven't completely\nratified the latest and greatest standard\n\n79\n00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:03.256\nthat we're trying to push out, but\nwe do have a subset of the features.\n\n80\n00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:05.965\nSo they release this\nWiFi protected access and\n\n81\n00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:10.071\nit was a subset of the features of\na later standard that would come out.\n\n82\n00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:13.089\nNow it changed and\nit increased the security a little bit.\n\n83\n00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:17.544\nOne of the problems with the weapon\nsecurity protocol is that it has a static\n\n84\n00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:21.238\nkey giving the hackers all the time\nthey need to just crack it.\n\n85\n00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:24.830\nSo they implemented something known as\nTKIP, the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol.\n\n86\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.327\nAnd that just kinda keeps\nrenewing the password so\n\n87\n00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:28.937\nit makes it a little bit harder.\n\n88\n00:04:28.937 --> 00:04:31.593\nAnd they fixed some of\nthe vulnerabilities.\n\n89\n00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:32.834\n>> So, this is like a stop-gap measure.\n\n90\n00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:36.195\n>> It really was and\nagain it's another one like WEP, it's not,\n\n91\n00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:39.632\nit really wasn't meant to be\nthat one-stop shop for security.\n\n92\n00:04:39.632 --> 00:04:43.483\nSo, not too long after that,\nIEEE standardized their protocol or\n\n93\n00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:47.077\ntheir encryption technology and\nthey release to the public.\n\n94\n00:04:47.077 --> 00:04:52.612\nNow, when it gets released to the public,\nhere's where the confusion sets in.\n\n95\n00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:54.530\nAll right notice that we\nsee WPA2 in this list.\n\n96\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.558\nWell, the IEE standardized their\nencryption technology as 802.11i.\n\n97\n00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:00.742\nSo, what is the difference?\n\n98\n00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:02.511\nWell, the difference here is that,\n\n99\n00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:06.165\nsince people already recognize the WiFi\nmarketing alliance name of WP WPA,\n\n100\n00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:09.815\nWiFi why is it, what we'll just keep it\nas the same type of marketing name and\n\n101\n00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:14.073\nwe'll call it WPA2 because it's already\nestablished, the people can recognize it.\n\n102\n00:05:14.073 --> 00:05:18.873\nSo, if you're ever looking at your home\naccess point, you see WPA2 or you see W,\n\n103\n00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:22.422\nor 802.11i,\nas know that they're really the same and\n\n104\n00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:27.240\nif you get the chance you really should be\nusing WPA2, let me give you an example.\n\n105\n00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.178\nOne of the things that I ran into is,\nand what I'm about to tell you.\n\n106\n00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:33.540\nDon't do it to anybody else's network,\nit'll get you in trouble.\n\n107\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.310\nBut I wanted to test on my own\nnetwork how strong WEP was and\n\n108\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.510\nit took longer to correct,\nto gather the information that it did for\n\n109\n00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.850\nthings like aircrack-ng that\nactually crack the password.\n\n110\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.150\nAnd within 14 seconds on average computer,\nand\n\n111\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.480\nI mean average, I cracked that key and\nI was on my network.\n\n112\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.887\nSo when it comes down to it today,\nuse WPA2.\n\n113\n00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:58.873\nOne of the final ones I just kinda wanna\nbriefly mention here to be careful with\n\n114\n00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:03.290\nthis WPS, that's something called WiFi\nProtected Setup, it's not really a strong\n\n115\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.123\nprotocol and it's in a lot of your\nrouters and or your home access points.\n\n116\n00:06:07.123 --> 00:06:10.706\nYou have to make sure that it's disabled,\nit's a recommendation,\n\n117\n00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:14.128\nit's a little eight digit code\nthat you find on the access point.\n\n118\n00:06:14.128 --> 00:06:17.504\nAnd if I wanna connect to the network,\nI just put that code in but\n\n119\n00:06:17.504 --> 00:06:21.138\nthe problem is they way it authenticates\nis a two four character, or\n\n120\n00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:23.150\nfour yeah four characters a piece.\n\n121\n00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.670\nSo relatively weak, not something you\nwanted to implement Implement there Dan.\n\n122\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.206\n>> Yeah, there are some weak security\nproperties that are out there, and\n\n123\n00:06:29.206 --> 00:06:31.321\nobviously we're seeing them,\nour protocol I should say,\n\n124\n00:06:31.321 --> 00:06:32.689\nthey're still in the list, though.\n\n125\n00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.966\nThat does beg the question,\nif it's still in the list,\n\n126\n00:06:35.966 --> 00:06:40.710\nthey're still offering it up, and\nwe're seeing, it's not a great protocol,\n\n127\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.865\nhe's cracking it in 14 seconds,\nthat's basically no time at all.\n\n128\n00:06:44.865 --> 00:06:45.711\nWhy is it still there?\n\n129\n00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.845\nWhy are we still supporting\nit in our access points?\n\n130\n00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:51.422\nWes, when would we ever want to\nuse this or need to use this.\n\n131\n00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:53.080\n>> That is a great question.\n\n132\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.960\nAt a certain point I would say you should\nnever see anything on your access points,\n\n133\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.310\nbut I was talking to somebody that\nwas an actual network engineer,\n\n134\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.550\nand he mentioned that he said, well,\nimagine if you have a WiFi hotspot.\n\n135\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.366\nYou don't wanna leave it open so just\neverybody can come up and connect to it.\n\n136\n00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:12.169\nWell, if you have to do some kind of\ndue diligence, and you don't wanna\n\n137\n00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.255\nleave an open access point cuz remember,\neven if you're not on your network,\n\n138\n00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:17.221\nsomebody else is,\nyou're still responsible for\n\n139\n00:07:17.221 --> 00:07:19.510\nwhat goes on in your network\nthey can at least lock it off.\n\n140\n00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.730\nAnd again [LAUGH] it's only gonna keep\nthe legitimate people out it really\n\n141\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.896\ndoes nothing to stop hackers, but\nif you gotta implement some kinda due\n\n142\n00:07:25.896 --> 00:07:28.350\ndiligence that might be where\nyou might still see WEP.\n\n143\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.058\n>> Yeah, another reason would be in the\nfact that there are some old technologies\n\n144\n00:07:32.058 --> 00:07:32.628\nout there.\n\n145\n00:07:32.628 --> 00:07:36.622\nPeople are still running older equipment,\nLegacy Devices,\n\n146\n00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:40.626\nas we like to call them and\nthey only support the WEP protocol.\n\n147\n00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.685\nI'm gonna be able to say protocol today.\n\n148\n00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:42.738\n>> [LAUGH] Yup.\n\n149\n00:07:42.738 --> 00:07:45.731\n>> One time, out of the gate,\nthat'll be fun.\n\n150\n00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:46.892\nSo you have to support them.\n\n151\n00:07:46.892 --> 00:07:50.170\nIf they're on your network,\nyou have to give them the credit.\n\n152\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.338\nWhat can they do?\n\n153\n00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:54.990\nThey're gonna either use no\nencryption at all, which is bad, or\n\n154\n00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.280\nat least some type of encryption, and\nyou kinda get what Wes is talking about,\n\n155\n00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.750\nat least it's something, it's not\nabsolutely nothing, and it's gonna keep\n\n156\n00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.380\nan honest man honest, and only hackers\nare you gonna have to worry about.\n\n157\n00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.462\nBut it is a really good reason to go\nto the boss and say, you know, what,\n\n158\n00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:15.617\nwe need to upgrade our entire\ninfrastructure to make sure that everybody\n\n159\n00:08:15.617 --> 00:08:19.499\nsupports the greatest of encryptions\nthat we have available to us so\n\n160\n00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.371\nthat we can keep things around.\n\n161\n00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:24.484\nThey may wanna balk about\nthe cost of upgrading, but\n\n162\n00:08:24.484 --> 00:08:26.766\nhow much is it worth to lose that data?\n\n163\n00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:28.866\nHow much is it worth for security briefs?\n\n164\n00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:31.796\nThose are big costs as well and if If\nyou're willing to roll that dice I guess\n\n165\n00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:34.511\nyou're willing to roll that dice,\nbut I'm not one of those people.\n\n166\n00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:36.878\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh yeah, and that's the thing we say,\n\n167\n00:08:36.878 --> 00:08:40.973\nwe've talked about it before, cost of\nconvenience usually the cost of security,\n\n168\n00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:44.423\nwe want people to be up on that maybe\nwe do want our internal users to be on\n\n169\n00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.202\nthat network.\n\n170\n00:08:45.202 --> 00:08:48.274\nSo lets go ahead, I'll tell you what,\nand we've kinda talked about some of\n\n171\n00:08:48.274 --> 00:08:51.298\nthe protocols, let's go ahead and\nget down in the operating system in it,\n\n172\n00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:53.940\nlet's see what this means for\nus and where we can configure this.\n\n173\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.287\nNow here in Windows 10 there's a couple\ndifferent ways that you can do this one of\n\n174\n00:08:58.287 --> 00:09:01.953\nthe easiest ways just push your Start\nbutton here and go to Settings.\n\n175\n00:09:01.953 --> 00:09:05.500\nNow when you go to Settings you're gonna\nsee a series of icons across the top and\n\n176\n00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.005\nthe one that we're looking for,\n\n177\n00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.929\nyou might expect it,\nis the one that says Network and Internet.\n\n178\n00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:11.416\nThat's where our\ncommunications are gonna lie.\n\n179\n00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:15.678\nSo, when we launch up Network and Internet\nI want you to see that this is a new\n\n180\n00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:20.088\ninterface, this is the new way to\nconfigure your Wireless communications.\n\n181\n00:09:20.088 --> 00:09:23.277\nNow we do have some for some of you\nthat are maybe familiar with the earlier\n\n182\n00:09:23.277 --> 00:09:25.945\neditions of Windows,\nwhile the old way is still there too and\n\n183\n00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:28.977\nthat's from the Control Panel,\nlet's kind of just contrast that so\n\n184\n00:09:28.977 --> 00:09:32.195\nyou can see and compare and contrast\nthat so you can see what's going on.\n\n185\n00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:37.186\nSee here's network and internet, and again\ntypical category view from the control\n\n186\n00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:41.979\npanel, been here for a while been here\nsince Vista and we go to Adapter Settings.\n\n187\n00:09:41.979 --> 00:09:44.939\nAnd we can see WiFi communications,\nWiFi connections, and\n\n188\n00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:46.803\nyou can see it's not connected here.\n\n189\n00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:50.055\nAnd if I wanted to, I could right-click,\nand I have a series of options, but\n\n190\n00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:53.258\nwe don't, that's a way that's been around,\nand if you've been in some of\n\n191\n00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:56.230\nthe earlier operating systems\nyou're probably familiar with that.\n\n192\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.780\nWhat I really wanna show you here\nis the newer functionalities,\n\n193\n00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.970\nnewer ways that you can actually do this.\n\n194\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:08.160\nNow, you'll see very easy, click of\na button here turns it off, turns it on.\n\n195\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.710\nWhen you turn your your WiFi adapter on.\n\n196\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.720\nIt's gonna search through, and\n\n197\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.530\nit's gonna find all of the access\npoints that are potentially available.\n\n198\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.960\nNow, when you need to configure these,\n\n199\n00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.950\nyou need to select the appropriate\nwireless access point,\n\n200\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.710\nto make sure that you don't want to try\nto connect to somebody else's network.\n\n201\n00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.450\nYou want to make sure that\nyou connect to the right one.\n\n202\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.280\nNow, that you've located the appropriate\nnetwork, we need to connect to it.\n\n203\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.710\nAnd if we've got security setup,\nwhich we should have security setup,\n\n204\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.110\nwe should get a challenge here.\n\n205\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.220\nOne of the first things it does as\nit's going through this connection\n\n206\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.050\nprocess is your wireless adapter\nsends out a stationed AP probe, so\n\n207\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.490\nit's kinda communicating\nwith it beforehand.\n\n208\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.560\nAnd then, what happens is your computer's\nasking for an association request, and\n\n209\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.400\nthe access Point sends back a challenge,\nand\n\n210\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.190\nthat challenge is just the password\nthat you've set up on your access point.\n\n211\n00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.590\nNow, Dan,\nI have to mention something here.\n\n212\n00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.880\nNotice that it say on this network,\nit says,\n\n213\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.670\ndo you want to allow this computer\nto be seen by other computers?\n\n214\n00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.410\nNow, this is a, when it comes to security,\nthis is a very important concept.\n\n215\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.800\nUnderstand that if you're\nconnecting to a public network,\n\n216\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.570\nand you make yourself available,\nor I should say,\n\n217\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.480\ndiscoverable what you're doing is turning\non a protocol called Network Discovery.\n\n218\n00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.700\nAnd when you do that, it's going to start\ncommunicating with the rest of the network\n\n219\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.500\ntrying to find devices, and when it finds\nthose devices it stores that information,\n\n220\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.500\nand then,\nit also broadcasts information back.\n\n221\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.945\nIt multicasts it, actually,\nback to the other machine.\n\n222\n00:11:36.945 --> 00:11:40.425\nMachines on the network says hey, this is\nme, this is what I am, I'm over here and\n\n223\n00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:42.475\nyou can talk to me if you want.\n\n224\n00:11:42.475 --> 00:11:45.505\nSo, understand that this is part\nof network location awareness\n\n225\n00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:47.905\nlike we've talked about in\nsome of the previous episodes.\n\n226\n00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:51.055\nWhen you set this it's gonna set\nyour firewall appropriately.\n\n227\n00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:54.150\n>> Yeah, so you're basically,\nlowering your shields as it were, so\n\n228\n00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.690\nthat people can see that\nyou're actually there.\n\n229\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.860\nTheir scans will come through,\nand they'll say captain, yes,\n\n230\n00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.900\nI see another ship on the horizon,\nthere he is.\n\n231\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.600\nAnd that's what you're trying to do,\nmake yourself available.\n\n232\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.160\nIf you've got the shields up no\none's gonna be able to communicate,\n\n233\n00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.760\nand sometimes that's a good thing,\nsometimes you want that anonymity in\n\n234\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.210\na large public network, so that people\naren't going oh, well there's a computer,\n\n235\n00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.360\nlet's try, and\nbreak into that one, you know?\n\n236\n00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.330\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n237\n00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.990\nSo again, ease of use,\nreduced security here.\n\n238\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.560\nSo, make up your mind on that one,\nmake the decision I should say,\n\n239\n00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.440\nnot make up your mind.\n\n240\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.520\nBut make the decision, and\nmake it appropriate for your network.\n\n241\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.580\nIf this is a home network ,and\nyou trust all the computers,\n\n242\n00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.640\nshouldn't hurt anything to\nturn on network discovery.\n\n243\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.640\nBut if you're on a corporate network, or\nmaybe it's controlled by other policies,\n\n244\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.890\nand stuff like that, for\nthe most part you should be, okay.\n\n245\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.470\nBut if you're on a public\nnetwork when you do this, and\n\n246\n00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.860\nespecially one that's running WEP,\nI would disable this.\n\n247\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.970\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead just for security\npurposes, and I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n248\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.890\ndisable this.\n\n249\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:53.170\nAnd we'll let the access point continue to\ncommunicate with our wireless adapter in\n\n250\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.690\nhere inside of Windows, and\nsee if this thing will connect.\n\n251\n00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.950\nNow, hopefully I've entered\nthe password appropriate.\n\n252\n00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.850\nNow, if I haven't entered the password\nhere right, it's gonna challenge me again.\n\n253\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.160\nSo, it's taking a second.\n\n254\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.090\n>> Now,\nthe password is really the key, right?\n\n255\n00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.020\n>> Yes.\nThat is exactly, right.\n\n256\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.450\nOne of the things to keep in mind is\nthat when we talk about WPA, and WPA2,\n\n257\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.730\none of the things that\nyou might wanna keep\n\n258\n00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.172\nin mind is that there's a personal mode,\nand there's an enterprise mode.\n\n259\n00:13:21.172 --> 00:13:23.870\nPersonal mode is really\nabout your authentication,\n\n260\n00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:27.330\nhow do you prove to the access\npoint you are who you say you are?\n\n261\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.910\nWell, in what I just did\nright here in this connection\n\n262\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.180\nI used what's known as a pre-shared key,\nPSK.\n\n263\n00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.810\nYou might see it,\nthat's the personal edition.\n\n264\n00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.870\nThe enterprise edition\nuses other technologies,\n\n265\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.715\nhas there's a lot of infrastructure,\nand setup behind it.\n\n266\n00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:39.095\nRadius servers out there.\n\n267\n00:13:39.095 --> 00:13:41.425\nYou can do things like\nport-based authentication, and\n\n268\n00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:43.495\nthat's why they call it enterprise mode.\n\n269\n00:13:43.495 --> 00:13:46.175\nSomething you might see inside\nof the corporate environment.\n\n270\n00:13:46.175 --> 00:13:49.301\nNow, here's another configuration.\n\n271\n00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:52.710\nWhat if the password changes.\n\n272\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.310\nWell, you're no longer gonna connect.\n\n273\n00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.270\nThat password, that encryption key is\nhow you communicate with the network, so\n\n274\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.910\none of the things that\nyou might have to do is\n\n275\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.980\nyou might have to reconfigure\nyour wireless adapter here.\n\n276\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.680\nSo, how would we do that?\n\n277\n00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.000\nOne of the easiest ways is to give\nyour wireless adapter a little of\n\n278\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.030\namnesia, as I say.\n\n279\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.350\nWe're gonna forget this network because,\n\n280\n00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.930\nif you see that the connection's not\nworking that might be a telltale sign.\n\n281\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.800\nLet me go ahead, and\n\n282\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.810\nshow you how you can reconfigure\nthis inside of the settings here.\n\n283\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.370\nAnd keep in mind you could still do\nthis in the traditional way, but\n\n284\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.180\nlet me go ahead, and show you the new\ninterface, because it's really cool,\n\n285\n00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.860\nthey've really done a good job\nI'd say on this interface.\n\n286\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.420\nSo, we're gonna scroll down, we're gonna\ngo to manage wi-fi settings here, and\n\n287\n00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.120\nnotice that there is this manage known\nno networks down here at the bottom.\n\n288\n00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.510\nYour computer keeps a running list of\nthe networks that you've connected to.\n\n289\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.490\nAnd it keeps that security information.\n\n290\n00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.820\nIf the security settings\nchange on the access point,\n\n291\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.270\nfirst thing you have to do is\nyou have to come in here, and\n\n292\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.280\nyou have to select the network,\nand you choose forget.\n\n293\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.200\nAnd notice that it wipes it clean.\n\n294\n00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.060\nSo that information that's stored\nlocally on the machine is now gone,\n\n295\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.350\nand this would give me the ability to\nnow challenge the act- Access point,\n\n296\n00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.500\ngo through that challenge process again,\nreconnect.\n\n297\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.340\nAnd then, notice here,\nnow I get the ability that I could update\n\n298\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.820\nthe password if I needed to reconfigure\nit, and again, it's giving me that option.\n\n299\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.970\nIt says, be sure you want to do this,\nbecause if you turn on Network Discovery,\n\n300\n00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.180\nother computers are gonna\nbe able to see you.\n\n301\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.620\n>> Yeah, I've had to do this a few times.\n\n302\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.420\nJust sometimes,\nyou go to connect to a network.\n\n303\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.540\nEven though you've known it, you've done\nit before, it just doesn't work right for\n\n304\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.390\nwhatever reason.\n\n305\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.230\nMaybe there was Power issues,\nsomething that you weren't aware of.\n\n306\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.700\nAll you know is you're clicking on\na network that you know that you've\n\n307\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.900\nconnected before, and\nit's just not working.\n\n308\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.420\nOr you're connected to a network that\nyou've never connected to before,\n\n309\n00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.120\nand it's still not working even though you\nknow, it's there, even though you know,\n\n310\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.010\nyou have the right key.\n\n311\n00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.640\nEverything should be working and it's not.\n\n312\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.260\nA lot of times going into your device,\nand saying forget this network,\n\n313\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.050\nand then, rediscovering it will be\nthe cure-all for that kind of ailment.\n\n314\n00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.170\n>> Yeah,\nyou know what it reminds me of, Dan?\n\n315\n00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.190\nWe always talk about\nreboots fix everything,\n\n316\n00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.770\nconsider this as a reboot slash reset.\n\n317\n00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.070\nI mean your not technically rebooting the\nnetwork adapter, you're not disabling, and\n\n318\n00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.470\nturning back on, but\n\n319\n00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.880\nwhen it comes down to the network,\nessentially that's what you're doing.\n\n320\n00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.890\nYou're saying hey, let's start fresh,\nlet's go back to that challenge process,\n\n321\n00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.270\nthe whole association steps that go\non with the station and the AP here.\n\n322\n00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.360\n>> You're like, you know what,\nwe started off on the wrong foot.\n\n323\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.460\nLet's try again, hi, I'm Daniel, you know,\n\n324\n00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.810\nand move from\n>> Exactly.\n\n325\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.940\nFrom there.\nThat's kinda what you're doing.\n\n326\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.560\n>> Yeah.\nAnd so again,\n\n327\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.700\nif you have to reconfigure fairly easy,\n\n328\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.190\njust make sure that you\nchoose that forget network.\n\n329\n00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.180\nNow, the next thing we have to talk\nabout is a popular concept today,\n\n330\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.590\nand that is how we can\nallow other computers or\n\n331\n00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:36.470\nmaybe other users to join our network, so\nwe gotta be careful with this one Dan.\n\n332\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.420\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n333\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.512\nAnd what Wes is talking\nabout is hot spots, right?\n\n334\n00:16:39.512 --> 00:16:43.400\nHotspots, oviously something that\nif you're alive in this day and\n\n335\n00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.000\nage as of the recording of this episode,\nwell,\n\n336\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.050\nyou've probably encountered\na hotspot from time to time.\n\n337\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.810\nYour phones can be a hotspot,\nyou can buy hotspots,\n\n338\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.830\nyou can attach to hotspots\nthat are put up everywhere.\n\n339\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.900\nI know my cable company has set\nup hotspots all over our city,\n\n340\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.030\nthat kind of thing.\n\n341\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.690\nAnd all it is is\nan extension of the network,\n\n342\n00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.130\nit's saying I want to be able\nto connect to a network.\n\n343\n00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.600\nWell with inside of Windows 10,\nthey've come up with something new,\n\n344\n00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.460\nkind of trying to, so you don't have to\nuse your phone, you don't have to buy\n\n345\n00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.920\na hotspot, so you can use your\nWindows 10 device as a hotspot.\n\n346\n00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.020\nAnd this is called wi-fi sense,\nis that right?\n\n347\n00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.010\n>> That's right, it's a new technology\nthat's built in to Windows, and\n\n348\n00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.110\nyou have to be very careful when using it.\n\n349\n00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:19.520\nBecause it is something,\n\n350\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.880\nthat goes back to that proverbial\nsaying that we're been talking about,\n\n351\n00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.730\ntries to make it a little more simplistic\nto connect to different hot spots.\n\n352\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.920\nSo, let's go ahead and check that out here\nin our Windows 10 machine, another fairly\n\n353\n00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.860\neasy setting, we choose manage wi-fi,\nthe manage wi-fi options, and you\n\n354\n00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.850\ncan see wi-fi says here, and you can see\nhere connect to suggested open hotspots.\n\n355\n00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.390\nSo, what does that mean for us.\n\n356\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:47.400\nWell, wi-fi sense is a way that, it can\nmake suggestions on wi-fi hotspots based\n\n357\n00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.400\non things like your contact information,\nhotspots that you've connected to, and\n\n358\n00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.520\nyou have to be careful, because if you've\ngot contacts within your machine, and it\n\n359\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.960\nsynchronizes, and they've been, they're on\nWindows 10 machines, and they've connected\n\n360\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.700\nto Wi-Fi hotspots ,and they might make\nsuggestions to connect to the other\n\n361\n00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.260\nhotspots that maybe your friends, or\nmaybe even co-workers if connected to.\n\n362\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.180\nAnd that's where we get a little\nbit of the security vulnerability,\n\n363\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.110\nif I'm automatically gonna\nconnect to a hotspot,\n\n364\n00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.000\nhow do I know in the background\nthat it's secure?\n\n365\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.990\nSo, there again, ease of use does\nreduce a little bit of security.\n\n366\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.470\nSecurity there, so\nbe careful with this one,\n\n367\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.080\nknow that the potential\nsecurity risk could be.\n\n368\n00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.760\nIt's not to say by any means\nthat it's a bad feature at all,\n\n369\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.280\nbecause it does make it a little\neasier for the average home user,\n\n370\n00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.740\nbut any time we talk about simplicity,\n\n371\n00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.715\nwe usually talk about a reduction\nin the security we have, right now.\n\n372\n00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:39.035\n>> That's right, and that's just\nan unfortunate way that it works.\n\n373\n00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.685\nAgain, it goes back to those scales.\n\n374\n00:18:40.685 --> 00:18:45.165\nIf the ease of use scale is going down,\nwell, then ,guess what?\n\n375\n00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:46.935\nThat security is going up, and vice versa.\n\n376\n00:18:46.935 --> 00:18:51.475\nYou've got to start really testing, and\nseeing what's gonna work best for me.\n\n377\n00:18:51.475 --> 00:18:53.830\nI do need a level of security, but\n\n378\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.940\nI also want a level of ease of use\ndepending on the environment that I'm in.\n\n379\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.380\nSo, it does come down to your own personal\nenvironment, on where those scales\n\n380\n00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.030\nare gonna end up being, but if, our\nadvice is probably usually going to be,\n\n381\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.990\nerror on the side of security, and just\ntake more Help Desk calls because those\n\n382\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.920\nHelp Desk calls are easier to field than\noh, by the way we've been hacked, right?\n\n383\n00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.326\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> So, we want to\nstay away from those Help Desk calls.\n\n384\n00:19:16.326 --> 00:19:19.648\nI'll take the, having trouble\nconnecting to the hotspot, Dan,\n\n385\n00:19:19.648 --> 00:19:22.150\nany day of the week over\nwe've been compromised.\n\n386\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.754\nNow, talking about security, that It\ndoes bring us to one of the oldie but\n\n387\n00:19:25.754 --> 00:19:28.314\ngoodies that we have\navailable inside of wireless,\n\n388\n00:19:28.314 --> 00:19:32.232\nand that way we can protect ourself,\nwhich is something called MAC filtering.\n\n389\n00:19:32.232 --> 00:19:35.132\nNow each one of our computers\nhas a network interface on it,\n\n390\n00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:37.973\nwhether it be a wireless or\na wired network interface, and\n\n391\n00:19:37.973 --> 00:19:41.048\neach one of those interfaces has\nwhat's called a MAC address,\n\n392\n00:19:41.048 --> 00:19:44.000\nwhich is hard coded to each of\nthe network interface cards.\n\n393\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.483\nAnd that allows us to say hey,\nI'm my computer, or\n\n394\n00:19:47.483 --> 00:19:50.399\nWes has his own that's unique to himself.\n\n395\n00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:53.394\nAnd there is no,\nthere always has to be unique.\n\n396\n00:19:53.394 --> 00:19:56.797\nThat being said, I can go into\nmy access point and say, well,\n\n397\n00:19:56.797 --> 00:19:59.154\nsince everybody has a unique MAC address,\n\n398\n00:19:59.154 --> 00:20:03.230\nI can say I only want Wes to be able to\nconnect to my network and nobody else.\n\n399\n00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.900\nSo I filter it down to\nonly Wes' MAC address.\n\n400\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.252\nNow Wes, you can help us figure\nout what our MAC address is,\n\n401\n00:20:09.252 --> 00:20:12.486\nyou're gonna show us how to\nput that filtering in place.\n\n402\n00:20:12.486 --> 00:20:15.025\nAnd then we're gonna see some of\nthe weaknesses that are involved\n\n403\n00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:16.143\nwith using this technique.\n\n404\n00:20:16.143 --> 00:20:17.223\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n405\n00:20:17.223 --> 00:20:21.272\nWe're gonna show you how it is a good\naddition to your security, but\n\n406\n00:20:21.272 --> 00:20:25.678\nalways remember that MAC filtering\nshould be supplemental to everything\n\n407\n00:20:25.678 --> 00:20:27.824\nelse that you put on your networks.\n\n408\n00:20:27.824 --> 00:20:30.265\nNow, when it comes to MAC filtering,\n\n409\n00:20:30.265 --> 00:20:34.628\nthere's a few easy ways to find\nyour MAC address inside of Windows.\n\n410\n00:20:34.628 --> 00:20:37.599\nLet's go ahead and show you one of the\nolder ways or one of the traditional ways\n\n411\n00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:40.357\nthat we've been doing this, and\nthat's through the Command Prompt.\n\n412\n00:20:40.357 --> 00:20:45.848\nIf I just type my cmd here,\nit will bring up the Command Prompt and\n\n413\n00:20:45.848 --> 00:20:51.559\nall I have to do is type an ipconfig and\nwith your forward slash all.\n\n414\n00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:55.067\nAnd what this is gonna do is it's gonna\noutput on this machine, it outputs a whole\n\n415\n00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:58.594\nbunch of information because I've got\na lot of little adapters connected here.\n\n416\n00:20:58.594 --> 00:21:00.946\nBut one of the things that I'm really,\n\n417\n00:21:00.946 --> 00:21:04.310\nreally concerned about is\nthis MAC address right here.\n\n418\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.705\nAll right, notice my physical\naddress on this machine.\n\n419\n00:21:06.705 --> 00:21:09.908\nNow, there's another way\nthat you can do this, too.\n\n420\n00:21:09.908 --> 00:21:13.727\nThe other way that you can do this is\ninside of the graphical user interface.\n\n421\n00:21:13.727 --> 00:21:14.666\nAnd I like this, and\n\n422\n00:21:14.666 --> 00:21:17.721\nthis is part of the new settings\nthat you see here in Windows 10.\n\n423\n00:21:17.721 --> 00:21:20.725\nAnd this doesn't just give you the MAC\naddress, it gives you a lot of good\n\n424\n00:21:20.725 --> 00:21:23.201\ninformation, which is one of\nthe reasons I really like it.\n\n425\n00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:27.553\nNotice we have this Advanced Options here,\nnow when we look at Advanced Options,\n\n426\n00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:28.410\nthis is-\n>> I kind of missed you, Wes,\n\n427\n00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.580\nhow did you actually get to this screen?\n\n428\n00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.270\n>> Oh, okay, yeah, yep, very good.\n\n429\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.710\nSo this is the Settings option, all right?\n\n430\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.920\nSo we're just going back to the settings\nfrom the Start menu, right?\n\n431\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.320\nOnce we're here, we're gonna choose\nthat Network & Internet selection there.\n\n432\n00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.390\nSo we're back at the Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi\nshould be at the top of the list here.\n\n433\n00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:49.724\nAnd if we scroll down, notice there's this\nAdvanced Options right under the list of\n\n434\n00:21:49.724 --> 00:21:51.382\navailable wireless networks.\n\n435\n00:21:51.382 --> 00:21:55.644\nAnd when we choose Advanced Options,\nnotice that we get a lot of information.\n\n436\n00:21:55.644 --> 00:21:59.117\nI really like this, because even though\nwe're just talking about finding MAC\n\n437\n00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.445\naddresses, I can find that\nMAC address right here.\n\n438\n00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:05.465\nAll right, I can find the MAC address,\nI can find more information,\n\n439\n00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:09.831\nwhat the name of the network is,\nwhat the protocol is that's running, and\n\n440\n00:22:09.831 --> 00:22:11.936\nother information here, as well.\n\n441\n00:22:11.936 --> 00:22:15.554\nI can see this is an Intel adapter here,\nand it lets me know that.\n\n442\n00:22:15.554 --> 00:22:19.150\nSo, I get a good description of\nthe information and more specifically for\n\n443\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.241\nwhat we're doing here for MAC filtering.\n\n444\n00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:22.730\n>> Awesome.\n\n445\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.110\nSo now we can jump into\nthe access point and there's,\n\n446\n00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:28.910\nI'm guessing there's a tab somewhere built\ninto that system that we can go into and\n\n447\n00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.410\nstart putting in the MAC addresses now.\n\n448\n00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.495\nNow, Wes, correct me if I'm wrong,\nthis is kind of both a white and\n\n449\n00:22:34.495 --> 00:22:35.560\na black list, right?\n\n450\n00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.710\n>> Yes, it can be.\n\n451\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:37.470\nYes, it can be.\n\n452\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.379\nOne of the things that you do wanna keep\nin mind here is that when it comes down\n\n453\n00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:45.621\nto MAC addresses, MAC addresses can be\nused for a couple of different purposes.\n\n454\n00:22:45.621 --> 00:22:49.322\nOne of the purposes they can use is kinda\nlike Dan's already said is that, hey,\n\n455\n00:22:49.322 --> 00:22:51.431\nthis is Wes' computer, let's allow it on.\n\n456\n00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:55.540\nAll right, but imagine if you know as an\nadministrator that you've got an employee\n\n457\n00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.064\nthat's left the company for\nwhatever reason, and\n\n458\n00:22:58.064 --> 00:23:00.783\nthey've got the access\npoint's security password.\n\n459\n00:23:00.783 --> 00:23:04.187\nYou've got hundreds of people that\nare on that wireless network, so\n\n460\n00:23:04.187 --> 00:23:06.483\nit's more of a pain to\nreset the access point.\n\n461\n00:23:06.483 --> 00:23:09.354\nI've changed the security on it or\nchanged the password,\n\n462\n00:23:09.354 --> 00:23:11.881\nand then have all hundred\nusers do that same thing.\n\n463\n00:23:11.881 --> 00:23:13.902\nSo you might put it as a blacklist.\n\n464\n00:23:13.902 --> 00:23:17.790\nIf you know the MAC address, you just put\nit in there and you say, instead here,\n\n465\n00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.904\nlet's show you here.\n\n466\n00:23:18.904 --> 00:23:21.613\nAll right, notice that this is\ndisabled by default on this one,\n\n467\n00:23:21.613 --> 00:23:23.583\nand here's where it gives\nme the two options.\n\n468\n00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:28.516\nIt gives me the prevent clients\nfrom listed from accessing\n\n469\n00:23:28.516 --> 00:23:31.443\nthis wireless network or permit.\n\n470\n00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:33.196\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndo the permit on this one.\n\n471\n00:23:33.196 --> 00:23:35.751\nSo we'll say, we're gonna permit, and\n\n472\n00:23:35.751 --> 00:23:39.912\nthen what we're gonna do is,\nwe'll have a MAC address in here, and\n\n473\n00:23:39.912 --> 00:23:44.817\nI've already put in a MAC address that we\nwant to have on this wireless network.\n\n474\n00:23:44.817 --> 00:23:48.301\nNow one of the things I wanna show\nyou is once this is enabled and\n\n475\n00:23:48.301 --> 00:23:52.053\nwe apply the settings,\none of the things that's gonna go on here,\n\n476\n00:23:52.053 --> 00:23:54.476\nif we go back over to\nour Windows Settings.\n\n477\n00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:59.484\nI should see, and I do a prevent, okay,\njust make sure I did a permit there,\n\n478\n00:23:59.484 --> 00:24:02.556\nyou gotta be careful\nwhich one you're doing.\n\n479\n00:24:02.556 --> 00:24:06.517\nI should see that if I come back\nin here that I am disconnected,\n\n480\n00:24:06.517 --> 00:24:11.180\nI don't have any access and notice\nhere that it's asking me to connect.\n\n481\n00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.017\nWhat has happened here?\n\n482\n00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:15.726\nWell the access point has\nlooked at the MAC filtering,\n\n483\n00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:20.318\nit compared what it had seen on\nthe list back to my network adapter and\n\n484\n00:24:20.318 --> 00:24:23.474\nwell, guess what, I'm disconnected here.\n\n485\n00:24:23.474 --> 00:24:25.737\nLet's just make sure that\nwe can see that again.\n\n486\n00:24:25.737 --> 00:24:29.978\nIf I disable this and I choose save and\nthen apply the settings, and\n\n487\n00:24:29.978 --> 00:24:34.321\njust take a second here, we can get\nright back over to the settings.\n\n488\n00:24:34.321 --> 00:24:38.580\nAnd then I choose connect, if I give it\njust a second here, one of the things that\n\n489\n00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.158\nnow it's gonna do is,\nit's not checking a list anymore, right?\n\n490\n00:24:42.158 --> 00:24:44.591\nIt's saying okay, I looked for a list,\n\n491\n00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:49.185\nI didn't find anything about MAC address,\nor MAC address filtering here.\n\n492\n00:24:49.185 --> 00:24:53.175\nAnd I can actually go back over\nto the administration page here,\n\n493\n00:24:53.175 --> 00:24:59.595\nstatus of my wireless network,\nnow that we've disabled that.\n\n494\n00:24:59.595 --> 00:25:04.440\nAnd if I choose wireless, and oh,\nthat looks like maybe it didn't do that,\n\n495\n00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.520\nlet's try that again there.\n\n496\n00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.598\nThere we go.\n\n497\n00:25:06.598 --> 00:25:09.130\nGo back to the status page.\n\n498\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.599\nMy job is so secret even I can't\nget into the access point.\n\n499\n00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:15.930\nAnd now down here at the bottom,\nI can see my MAC address.\n\n500\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.407\nNow, let's just verify that\nthis is my MAC address so\n\n501\n00:25:19.407 --> 00:25:22.128\nyou can see that it kicked me off, right.\n\n502\n00:25:22.128 --> 00:25:24.476\nAnd then it turned around and said okay,\n\n503\n00:25:24.476 --> 00:25:29.256\nnow that I don't have that MAC address\nup there, that MAC filter, you're okay.\n\n504\n00:25:29.256 --> 00:25:33.017\nYou can join the network, and you can\nsee here it's saying my MAC address.\n\n505\n00:25:33.017 --> 00:25:34.411\nNow what if I enable that, right?\n\n506\n00:25:34.411 --> 00:25:41.020\nWhat if I say hey, I wanna be secure, I\nwant only this MAC address on my network.\n\n507\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.330\nSo we're gonna go jump back\nover to the security here, and\n\n508\n00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.420\nwe're gonna re-enable the MAC filter,\nall right?\n\n509\n00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.210\nAnd when I apply this setting again,\n\n510\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.810\nwe should see that I get disconnected,\nall right?\n\n511\n00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.470\nSo this should be secure,\nright, it should be no problem,\n\n512\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.912\nI should not be on here anymore,\nand we can verify that,\n\n513\n00:25:58.912 --> 00:26:02.746\none more time, just to verify\nthat I have been disconnected.\n\n514\n00:26:02.746 --> 00:26:07.563\nAnd you can see, there it is,\nit updated and it disconnected me.\n\n515\n00:26:07.563 --> 00:26:10.889\nThe problem here is the operating\nsystem is telling my,\n\n516\n00:26:10.889 --> 00:26:15.815\ntelling the access point and the rest\nof the network what my MAC address is.\n\n517\n00:26:15.815 --> 00:26:19.065\nSo if I get a piece of software,\nlike this one is the Technidium I think,\n\n518\n00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:21.135\nthere's a bunch of them out there.\n\n519\n00:26:21.135 --> 00:26:25.445\nNotice it says what my MAC address\nhere is, and it even tells me with\n\n520\n00:26:25.445 --> 00:26:28.725\nthe OUI that's part of a MAC address,\nhey, this is an Intel Corporation.\n\n521\n00:26:28.725 --> 00:26:31.335\nSo I can see in your adapter\nit's made from Intel.\n\n522\n00:26:31.335 --> 00:26:35.425\nWell what if I capture some\ninformation on this wireless network,\n\n523\n00:26:35.425 --> 00:26:36.640\nit's very easy to do.\n\n524\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.420\nIf I capture the information and\n\n525\n00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:45.480\nI can see who are the allowed\nMAC addresses on the network.\n\n526\n00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.250\nNotice we have this 20.15 and\nyou know, a series of characters here.\n\n527\n00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.932\nWell, if I can plug that into\na piece of software like this,\n\n528\n00:26:53.932 --> 00:26:57.940\nremember we're disconnected at this point,\nand I type, let me go ahead and\n\n529\n00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.091\ntype this MAC address here real quick.\n\n530\n00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.210\nI'm going to challenge my abilities\nto type as we all know [LAUGH],\n\n531\n00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.930\nand what I'm going to do\nis choose change now.\n\n532\n00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:11.540\nAnd it's going to reset my\nnetwork adapter completely.\n\n533\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.177\nAll right, so that you can see it\nchange successfully, all right, and\n\n534\n00:27:15.177 --> 00:27:18.397\nit's saying that hey,\nmy active MAC address unknown vendor.\n\n535\n00:27:18.397 --> 00:27:22.617\nLet's switch back over to our\nwireless access point and\n\n536\n00:27:22.617 --> 00:27:24.606\nsee if I can connect back.\n\n537\n00:27:24.606 --> 00:27:25.817\nSo we'll give it a second here and\n\n538\n00:27:25.817 --> 00:27:27.556\nhopefully I've typed\nthat MAC address right.\n\n539\n00:27:27.556 --> 00:27:29.481\nIf you haven't typed\nthe MAC address right,\n\n540\n00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:31.363\nthen spoofing is not\nreally gonna help you.\n\n541\n00:27:31.363 --> 00:27:36.820\nAnd notice here, if you look,\nI am connected now.\n\n542\n00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.201\nI could come back in here.\n\n543\n00:27:38.201 --> 00:27:43.158\nI could look at the status of the wireless\nnetwork, and if we give it a second,\n\n544\n00:27:43.158 --> 00:27:47.124\nit should show me right here in\nthe clients that, guess what,\n\n545\n00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:51.730\nyou are connected and it is verified,\nlet me just double-check here.\n\n546\n00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.327\nOh, it didn't, so maybe,\n\n547\n00:27:53.327 --> 00:27:57.731\nlet me double-check real quick the list\nbecause well, my typing abilities.\n\n548\n00:27:57.731 --> 00:28:00.831\nAnd we'll go back to the MAC filter here.\n\n549\n00:28:00.831 --> 00:28:03.687\nOh, oh, prevent.\n\n550\n00:28:03.687 --> 00:28:08.591\n[LAUGH] So just like we were warning you,\nmake sure if it's a prevent or an allow,\n\n551\n00:28:08.591 --> 00:28:10.072\nnotice I said prevent.\n\n552\n00:28:10.072 --> 00:28:12.715\nSo it looked at this MAC address and\nit said, you're not on the list,\n\n553\n00:28:12.715 --> 00:28:14.710\nno reservation, you're not eating tonight.\n\n554\n00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.140\nSo let me go ahead and\napply the right setting here.\n\n555\n00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.460\nAnd we'll bump back over now with my spoof\nMAC address now that we've got, and it's\n\n556\n00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.620\nstill telling me you can't connect to this\nnetwork because remember it's a prevent,\n\n557\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.333\nso either way [LAUGH].\n\n558\n00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:28.540\n>> So when you say a spoof MAC address,\n\n559\n00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.190\nwhat you're saying is that you have a MAC\naddress that is burned into the card.\n\n560\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.580\nBut I'm pretending to be some\nother MAC address that's not that.\n\n561\n00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.310\nThrough software, I'm telling the access\npoint this is my MAC address,\n\n562\n00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.210\nnot that one that you've been blocking.\n\n563\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.920\nThis nice,\nnew MAC address that you like so much.\n\n564\n00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.900\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n565\n00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.300\nYou're adding a layer of software because\nremember it's your operating system\n\n566\n00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.460\nthat is telling this access\npoint what your MAC address is.\n\n567\n00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.341\nAnd if you put another piece of software\nin there that masquerades that,\n\n568\n00:28:58.341 --> 00:29:02.433\nyou can tell the access point\npretty much anything you want.\n\n569\n00:29:02.433 --> 00:29:03.299\nLet's see if,\n\n570\n00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:07.575\ndouble-check here real quick on\nthe status of this wireless access point.\n\n571\n00:29:07.575 --> 00:29:08.296\nAnd there it is.\n\n572\n00:29:08.296 --> 00:29:11.642\nNotice that I am connected, and\nthat security, that MAC filter,\n\n573\n00:29:11.642 --> 00:29:13.370\nit didn't really do anything.\n\n574\n00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.960\nSo like Dan said,\nit's an oldie but goodie.\n\n575\n00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.460\nBut we always talk about a layer\nof defense, especially in Windows.\n\n576\n00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.859\nWindows gets this from\nthe United States military,\n\n577\n00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:23.503\nthe defense in depth we talk about.\n\n578\n00:29:23.503 --> 00:29:27.183\nSo if you're gonna implement security,\ndon't just rely on MAC filtering.\n\n579\n00:29:27.183 --> 00:29:29.884\nGo with the appropriate\nencryption protocols as well and\n\n580\n00:29:29.884 --> 00:29:33.267\nthen add MAC filtering, and\nyou've got that layered defense system.\n\n581\n00:29:33.267 --> 00:29:35.540\n>> That's right,\nit's just like a lock on a door.\n\n582\n00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.350\nI can put a lock on my front door and\nthe regular Joe will walk up to it and\n\n583\n00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.460\nsay oh, there's a lock on this door.\n\n584\n00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.247\nApparently I'm not\nsupposed to go through it.\n\n585\n00:29:43.247 --> 00:29:47.089\nThe criminal will walk up to it and go,\nit's locked, let me kick it in, right?\n\n586\n00:29:47.089 --> 00:29:50.442\nSo that's basically what we're doing\nwith MAC filtering, those people that\n\n587\n00:29:50.442 --> 00:29:53.962\nare trying to connect to your network and\nthey get stopped through MAC filtering.\n\n588\n00:29:53.962 --> 00:29:57.099\nAnd they're like, oh well, I guess I'm\nnot supposed to be on this network,\n\n589\n00:29:57.099 --> 00:29:58.420\nthey'll move on down the line.\n\n590\n00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.728\nThe criminal on the other hand would go\nha, ha, ha, I'm gonna kick the door in.\n\n591\n00:30:01.728 --> 00:30:05.129\nRight, so, that's basically the level\nof security that you're getting.\n\n592\n00:30:05.129 --> 00:30:06.001\nBut very cool stuff though, right?\n\n593\n00:30:06.001 --> 00:30:06.744\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n594\n00:30:06.744 --> 00:30:08.836\n>> To be able to go in and\nchange our MAC address and\n\n595\n00:30:08.836 --> 00:30:10.725\nbypass some of these security measures.\n\n596\n00:30:10.725 --> 00:30:14.557\nThat's a good thing for you to know\nbecause now you know some security\n\n597\n00:30:14.557 --> 00:30:19.004\nimplementations, how the bad guys will\ntry to attempt to access your network.\n\n598\n00:30:19.004 --> 00:30:21.349\n>> And you might say, well,\nwhere do I get this piece of software,\n\n599\n00:30:21.349 --> 00:30:22.706\ndoes everybody have this software?\n\n600\n00:30:22.706 --> 00:30:26.340\nWell if you think about it,\nvirtualization does the same thing, right?\n\n601\n00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.840\nIf I'm running more than one operating\nsystem on a single physical device,\n\n602\n00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.203\nhow is it that it has five\ndifferent MAC addresses?\n\n603\n00:30:32.203 --> 00:30:34.605\nWell, virtualization is\nalmost like a legal spoofing.\n\n604\n00:30:34.605 --> 00:30:38.687\nNot illegal, a legal spoofing,\nit's lying to those operating systems and\n\n605\n00:30:38.687 --> 00:30:42.337\nsaying this is what your MAC address\nis when it technically isn't.\n\n606\n00:30:42.337 --> 00:30:46.308\nSo, you can see this for good purposes,\nbut again, like with everything in life,\n\n607\n00:30:46.308 --> 00:30:49.033\nif there's something that's\nit could be used for good,\n\n608\n00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:50.360\nit can also be used for bad.\n\n609\n00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.206\n>> That's right.\n\n610\n00:30:51.206 --> 00:30:53.038\nWell, Wes, was there anything\nelse that we need to cover\n\n611\n00:30:53.038 --> 00:30:54.040\nbefore we close the show down?\n\n612\n00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.476\n>> Nope, just use a layer defense\nsystem and you should be good.\n\n613\n00:30:56.476 --> 00:30:57.265\n>> All right.\n\n614\n00:30:57.265 --> 00:30:59.100\nWell everyone,\nI hope you enjoyed this episode,\n\n615\n00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.459\nwe had a great time making it for you.\n\n616\n00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:01.003\n>> This was fun.\n\n617\n00:31:01.003 --> 00:31:03.279\n>> We're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n618\n00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:04.719\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n619\n00:31:04.719 --> 00:31:05.659\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n620\n00:31:05.659 --> 00:31:06.797\n>> And we'll see

They start by configuring a VPN connection using the Windows 10 VPN client and discuss the different protocols used to secure VPN connections; including Point to Point Tunneling Protocol(PPTP), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol(L2TP), and Secure Sockets Tunneling Protocol(SSTP). They also look at authentication protocols, specifically MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, and EAP; then finish up with Microsoft Direct Access.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:18.495\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.615\nwe're gonna be covering more Windows\n10 security content, specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:25.165\ncovering today remote access technologies.\n\n6\n00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:29.680\nAnd who better to join us, to teach us\nthose lovely concepts, then with me today,\n\n7\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.140\nnone other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.640\nHow you doing today, Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.380\n>> Man, I'm doing good.\n\n10\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.430\nIt's good to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.910\nThanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.130\nAnd guys, we've got some very interesting\nand cool subjects to bring at you today.\n\n13\n00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.450\nAnd one of the very first things that\nwe're gonna be talking about is how we can\n\n14\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.060\nsecure communications.\n\n15\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.270\nWhen you might be at a remote office\nright, for instance you could have\n\n16\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.470\nsomebody that is at home, and maybe\nsomebody that is in a remote location and\n\n17\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.500\ntypically, they're going to be connected\nto the internet, a public network,\n\n18\n00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.950\nand if it's sensitive information,\n\n19\n00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.520\nif it's company information we\ndon't want the hacker [INAUDIBLE].\n\n20\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.380\nPerforming a man in the middle attack,\nmaybe gathering that information up and\n\n21\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.220\nbeing able to reverse engineer it and\ntell your passwords.\n\n22\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590\nAnd now, we've got blackmail and\n\n23\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.095\nall the other stuff that goes\nalong with corporate espionage.\n\n24\n00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:17.815\nSo, let's go ahead,\n\n25\n00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:20.895\nwhat we're gonna do is come at you from\nthe client side of the configuration.\n\n26\n00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:24.055\nIt's very very important to understand\nthat if you're gonna set up\n\n27\n00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:28.135\na VPN connection from a client inside of\nWindows X back to your corporate office,\n\n28\n00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:30.695\nthat you know a little\nbit about those setting.\n\n29\n00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:33.825\nSo, let's go ahead and\ncheck out our Windows X machine here, and\n\n30\n00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:34.975\nwe'll go ahead and get that set up.\n\n31\n00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:36.585\nNow, fairly straight forward process.\n\n32\n00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:40.640\nWhen we do this,\nwe're gonna go to settings option.\n\n33\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.120\nYou can do this through\nthe traditional way.\n\n34\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.870\nMaybe some of you guys have seen it in\nthe network and sharing center, but\n\n35\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.870\nI really wanna focus in on these new\nsettings, the new interface that we see\n\n36\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.670\ninside of Windows 10,\nthat you might not be familiar with.\n\n37\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.935\n>> Now is a local VPN client.\n\n38\n00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:57.115\nIs that new to Windows 10, or is that\nsomething we can look back towards?\n\n39\n00:01:57.115 --> 00:02:02.115\n>> Oh, yeah, the VPN client has\nbeen built into Windows for\n\n40\n00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:06.045\na little bit, but I'm not exactly\nsure when it first appeared.\n\n41\n00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:08.150\nEverything seems to have appeared\nin XP service pack three.\n\n42\n00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.345\nI'm gonna go with that, but\ntake that one with a grain of salt.\n\n43\n00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:14.600\nThe VPN client, I know,\nhas been built into Windows for a while.\n\n44\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.690\nNow, fairly easy, if we're in our settings\noption here, we go to Network and\n\n45\n00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.730\nInternet, you're gonna see that\nthere's this VPN connection, or\n\n46\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.770\nVPN setting, here on the left hand side,\nsecond down from the top.\n\n47\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.730\nAnd if we click that, or\nbrowse to that location, if you will,\n\n48\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.350\nyou're gonna see that we have the add\na VPN connection, so, let's go ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.540\ndo that, let's add a VPN connection.\n\n50\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.540\nNow, one of the things that Dan mentioned\nis, hey how about that Windows client?\n\n51\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.940\nCan you use other clients, too?\n\n52\n00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.460\nWell, you can, and you wouldn't\nhave to put the VPN provider here.\n\n53\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.070\nBut, one of the great things here.\n\n54\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.320\nAgain, coming from the concept of what\ndo we have built-in to Windows 10?\n\n55\n00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.510\nDo we have to go to a 3rd party?\n\n56\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.320\nWell, you don't have to,\nyou can see the built-in Windows 10, or\n\n57\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.920\nthe Windows VPN provider if you will.\n\n58\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.800\nIt's essentially the Windows VPN client.\n\n59\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.480\nNow, when you configure this.\n\n60\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.930\nThe next thing is the connection name.\n\n61\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.006\nThe connection name is something that\nmakes it easily identifiable for you.\n\n62\n00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:15.380\nIf you're setting this up,\nI might say something like work VPN.\n\n63\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.690\nNow, the next field\nhere is very important.\n\n64\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.430\nYou can name the server, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.280\nOr you can name its IP address.\n\n66\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.160\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n67\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.490\nwhat I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna\nconfigure this by an IP address.\n\n68\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.290\n>> Now,\nreal quick about the connection names.\n\n69\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.160\n>> Yes.\n>> I know a lot\n\n70\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.900\nof people can get confused with that.\n\n71\n00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.750\nThe connection name is just\nthe descriptor, right?\n\n72\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.019\nIt's not anything to do,\nI can name it anything I want and\n\n73\n00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.310\nI can still make my connection.\n\n74\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.370\nI don't have to name it anything specific.\n\n75\n00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.730\n>> That's right I can name it\npeanut butter if I really wanted\n\n76\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.680\n>> That's a good VPN name.\n\n77\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.170\n>> I was gonna say as long as I know\npeanut butter is my VPN connection\n\n78\n00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.690\nthen I'll be good.\n\n79\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.670\nAnd this is the same thing,\nI'm glad you asked that question, so for\n\n80\n00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.930\ninstance inside a network and\n\n81\n00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.350\nsharing center where you could see your\ntraditional network adapter connections.\n\n82\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.380\nWe can rename them, right?\n\n83\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.600\nA lot of times,\nthey default to local area connection.\n\n84\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.700\nYou can rename it.\n\n85\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.368\nThis is the same thing, and\nit's gonna show up the same way here.\n\n86\n00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:07.106\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and\nput our server address here.\n\n87\n00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:10.967\nAll right, and we're gonna just\ngo ahead and leave it at that.\n\n88\n00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:14.400\nYou can see the type of sign in info here,\nand we're gonna choose save.\n\n89\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.310\nNotice the optional.\n\n90\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.520\nWe'll talk a little bit\nabout that coming up.\n\n91\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.350\nWhen I configure this now, now the VPN\nconnection, it should be ready to connect.\n\n92\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.040\nSo far, not too bad.\n\n93\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.320\nA couple of few steps there.\n\n94\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.510\n>> Seems pretty simple.\n\n95\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.750\nJust fill out a little bit of information,\n\n96\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.380\nput some descriptors in there,\nand you're off to the races?\n\n97\n00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.290\nThat's all it takes to\nget a VPN connected?\n\n98\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.330\n>> It really is.\n\n99\n00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.870\nNow.\n\n100\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.450\nNow, one of the things I should say.\n\n101\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.670\nYou might have to talk to\nyour systems administrator,\n\n102\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.600\nif you have to know that information\nahead of time, so not so simple.\n\n103\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.110\nIf you don't know that information,\nif you don't know the server address,\n\n104\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.350\nif you don't know the IP address, well,\n\n105\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.850\nyou're not gonna have a really\ngood time trying to connect here.\n\n106\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.190\n>> It's simple to unlock a safe.\n\n107\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.725\nIf you know the combination.\n\n108\n00:04:57.725 --> 00:04:59.360\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is a very good point.\n\n109\n00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.110\nThat's exactly right.\n\n110\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.910\nYou have to know the combination\nto get into the safe, and\n\n111\n00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.720\nthat's the same thing here.\n\n112\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.170\nYou have to know what the server address\nis, and then the information behind that.\n\n113\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.350\nSo, one of the things that we can do now,\nis, we should be able to connect.\n\n114\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.970\nAll right,\nwhen I click on that VPN icon right there,\n\n115\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.250\nnotice I've got this connect option.\n\n116\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.280\nNow, when I connect,\nnotice it's challenging me.\n\n117\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.666\nAll right, and this is gonna be dependent\nupon what kind of authentication your\n\n118\n00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:28.042\nsystems administrator set up.\n\n119\n00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:33.629\nFor us, we kind of left it fairly basic\nhere, so let me go ahead and authenticate.\n\n120\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.150\nAnd we'll take a second here, and now,\nhopefully the connection has been made.\n\n121\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.840\n>> It does say connected.\n\n122\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.640\n>> It does say connected.\n\n123\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.090\nWe are connected.\n\n124\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:52.500\nSo, we should be good,\nas far as the connection goes.\n\n125\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.960\nNow, one of the things that I\nalso wanna mention here is,\n\n126\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.910\nyou have to be careful when it\ncomes to your VPN communications.\n\n127\n00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.940\nOne of the things I want you to notice\nis that, if I disconnect from this,\n\n128\n00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.600\nand I choose connect again,\nnotice what didn't happen?\n\n129\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.960\nOne of the things that didn't happen is,\nit didn't ask me for authentication again.\n\n130\n00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.200\nNow, let's go ahead and\n\n131\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.030\nsee what that means for us, and\nlet me show you where I'm going here.\n\n132\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.520\nIf I choose the advanced options,\nall right,\n\n133\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.960\nthere's a couple of things\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n134\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.030\nOne of the first things that we need to\nbe aware of is that we have the ability\n\n135\n00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.430\nto turn on or off network discovery.\n\n136\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.970\nAll right.\n\n137\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.840\nDependent upon your network,\n\n138\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.800\nyou might have a policy that\neither has it turned on,\n\n139\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.650\nor maybe it stipulates that you don't want\nit to turn it on, for security purposes,\n\n140\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.470\ncuz remember, when you connect to this\nnetwork, it is gonna be a simulated\n\n141\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.050\npoint to point connection, just like\nyou're inside of your internal network.\n\n142\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.280\nAnd there are some\nsecurity risks with that.\n\n143\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.330\nThe other thing I'd like to mention here,\ntoo, is here's where your VPN proxy,\n\n144\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.830\nif you do have a VPN proxy,\n\n145\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.990\nthis is probably one of the easier ways\nto do this, the automatic configuration.\n\n146\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.440\nBut you have to be careful, because\nautomatic configuration could override\n\n147\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.510\nyour manual settings, so there could be\na little conflict, if you have that there.\n\n148\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.900\nIf you want more work, you can\nalways do the manual configuration,\n\n149\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.810\nif you're pointing to a proxy, but one of\nthe things I really wanna stress here is,\n\n150\n00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.390\nin talking about security, again,\nit's that disconnect and reconnect.\n\n151\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.790\nAnd notice,\nthat it's not challenging me again.\n\n152\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.190\nDan, you might notice that one of\nthe things that we didn't do is\n\n153\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.120\nfill out the username and password inside\nof the options there's an optional, right?\n\n154\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.987\nI left that blank, all right.\n\n155\n00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:46.590\nSo, what happens here is,\neven though, we said don't save it.\n\n156\n00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.550\nBecause if we scroll down here,\nyou'll see something here.\n\n157\n00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.232\nEven though, I said it was optional notice\nthat little remember me sign in info.\n\n158\n00:07:55.232 --> 00:07:57.304\nOr remember my sign-in info.\n\n159\n00:07:57.304 --> 00:07:59.995\nThat sounded like a pirate,\nremember me sign-in info.\n\n160\n00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:05.555\nSo, [LAUGH] Yeah, we definitely don't want\npiracy, pirates attacking your computer.\n\n161\n00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:06.704\nSo, there's a problem.\n\n162\n00:08:06.704 --> 00:08:11.430\nAny time you use that remember me option,\nthat's gonna be exactly what happens.\n\n163\n00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.190\nNow, you might say, well,\nwill doing this for\n\n164\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.003\nsecurity, it's gonna be\na secure connection.\n\n165\n00:08:15.003 --> 00:08:17.556\nHow does that really affect me?\n\n166\n00:08:17.556 --> 00:08:21.043\nWell, if you leave the machine unlocked,\nand if you're at home, maybe you got\n\n167\n00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:24.338\na friend that wants to play a joke on you,\nyou know, I mean, I don't know.\n\n168\n00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:28.418\nYou've got that computer unlocked all\nthey have to do is they come in here and\n\n169\n00:08:28.418 --> 00:08:30.522\nclick connect just like we did there and\n\n170\n00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:34.193\nnow unfortunately they've got\naccess to your corporate network.\n\n171\n00:08:34.193 --> 00:08:40.672\nSo for me I choose to uncheck this and\nI don't leave that information here.\n\n172\n00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:42.822\nAnd in fact,\nI'm going to clear this information out,\n\n173\n00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.310\nI don't even want it in there.\n\n174\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.299\nAnd that's just an added\nstep of security there.\n\n175\n00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:49.439\nAnd you'll see, and I click save here and\n\n176\n00:08:49.439 --> 00:08:51.896\nall we're doing is going\nback to the settings.\n\n177\n00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:53.499\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and\ndisconnect and\n\n178\n00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.288\nlet's verify that this actually worked for\nus.\n\n179\n00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:57.120\nNow click connect, and\nnow it's challenging me again.\n\n180\n00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.373\n>> I was thinking about you said that\na friend might be playing a joke on you,\n\n181\n00:09:01.373 --> 00:09:06.259\nI'm thinking more nefarious people out\nthere, that your home computer, usually\n\n182\n00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:11.239\nnot as secure as a business environment is\ngoing to be, because you want ease of use.\n\n183\n00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:15.661\nYou're trying to connect to different\nnetworks all the time, so it's easier for\n\n184\n00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:19.582\na hacker to be able to break into your\nsystem, and now connect to the VPN.\n\n185\n00:09:19.582 --> 00:09:24.110\nOnce they've infiltrated your low\nsecurity of your desktop, now,\n\n186\n00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.460\nall they gotta do is connect to VPN.\n\n187\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.910\nWhat do they have access to?\n\n188\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.677\nYour corporate network, through you.\n\n189\n00:09:29.677 --> 00:09:34.227\nSo, it is a good idea, as Wes was saying,\nhere, to make sure you uncheck that check\n\n190\n00:09:34.227 --> 00:09:38.712\nmark to where it's always challenging you\nwhen you connect to the VPN, asking for\n\n191\n00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:40.345\nthat username and password.\n\n192\n00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:41.079\nAnd you know what?\n\n193\n00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:41.961\nYour password's gonna change.\n\n194\n00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:44.250\nYou're gonna have to do this\nonce in a while anyway.\n\n195\n00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.190\nTrust me, I've dealt with enough VPN users\nto know that, when their password expires,\n\n196\n00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.350\nit is nothing but a headache.\n\n197\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.480\nBecause they don't realize that\nthere is multiple things going on.\n\n198\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.080\nBut making that check mark where\nthey're always challenged for\n\n199\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.510\ntheir user name and\npassword is gonna help alleviate that, and\n\n200\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.370\nkeep those bad guys, even if they\ndo compromise your home system,\n\n201\n00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.460\nto not be able to get into your VPN,\naccess your corporate network that way.\n\n202\n00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.790\n>> Yeah, sure.\nIt's definitely a good thing.\n\n203\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.570\nRemember, as we've gone through\nthis series, we've always said,\n\n204\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.670\nerr on the side of security,\nbecause what is\n\n205\n00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.130\nthe point of trying to secure your\ncommunications over a public network,\n\n206\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:25.310\nif internally you're not secure on\nwhatever the remote location is.\n\n207\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.766\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's test this connection.\n\n208\n00:10:27.766 --> 00:10:29.626\nOne of the ways we can do that here is,\n\n209\n00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:32.642\nlet's see if we can connect to\nmaybe a corporate resource.\n\n210\n00:10:32.642 --> 00:10:37.350\nNow, I'm in an administrative account\nhere so If I try to connect, maybe to\n\n211\n00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:42.888\nthe server, one of the servers, inside of\nthe corporate network here, and let's see.\n\n212\n00:10:42.888 --> 00:10:43.681\nLet's try this.\n\n213\n00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:48.235\nWe'll hit enter here, and\nnotice it's challenging me.\n\n214\n00:10:48.235 --> 00:10:50.593\nAll right, so,\nwhen it comes to the challenge,\n\n215\n00:10:50.593 --> 00:10:54.227\nI should be able to enter my password\nhere, and we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n216\n00:10:54.227 --> 00:10:56.770\nRather than just talk about it,\nlet's see if we can connect.\n\n217\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.200\nOops.\nYeah, if If you know your password.\n\n218\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.220\n>> And that is a good verification method,\n\n219\n00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.310\njust to make sure that your\nVPN is actually connected.\n\n220\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.300\nSometimes, it'll say connected, and\nthings aren't working correctly, right?\n\n221\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.020\nSo, don't always trust the fact\nthat it says, oh, we're connected.\n\n222\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.650\nThat everything's great.\n\n223\n00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.620\nMost of the time, that's fine,\nbut just going to a resource that\n\n224\n00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.340\nyou normally wouldn't have access to\nunless you were connected to the VPN,\n\n225\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.720\nthat's gonna be very helpful,\nso you can say, okay.\n\n226\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.450\nI normally wouldn't have\naccess to this server.\n\n227\n00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.353\nI normally would have\naccess to this file share.\n\n228\n00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:30.102\nIf I do have access,\nthat means my VPN tunnel is up.\n\n229\n00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:32.400\nI am connected and\nwe are piping data through it.\n\n230\n00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.910\n>> Yeah.\n\n231\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.520\nNow I do want to mention something here.\n\n232\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.860\nYou guys are probably\nseeing the background.\n\n233\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.280\nIt challenged me quite a few times.\n\n234\n00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.811\nIt's like, well, wait a second.\n\n235\n00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:41.060\nAre you really connected?\n\n236\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.630\nJust the fact that I'm getting the\ncredential user interface shows me that\n\n237\n00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.870\nI'm connected.\n\n238\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.580\nWhat you were seeing here is me struggling\nwith the ability to type a password.\n\n239\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.710\nSo, you could see,\nI'm actually connected to,\n\n240\n00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.440\nin this case, a domain controller on\nthe inside of the corporate network.\n\n241\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.760\nNow, administrative level, obviously.\n\n242\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.660\nAs an average user or the standard user,\nyou're not gonna connect\n\n243\n00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.990\nto your domain controller, but\nwhat you can see here is, I see my sys and\n\n244\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.930\nnet logon, so I'm connected to a server\non the inside of the corporate network.\n\n245\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.340\nAnother cool way that you can tell,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n246\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:16.110\nleave this connected so it'll generate\nsome SMB traffic in the background.\n\n247\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.880\nLet's, I'll tell you\nwhat let's go ahead and\n\n248\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.971\ndo some packet sniffing some\nprotocol analyzing here.\n\n249\n00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:23.696\nSo we'll launch up our message analyzer,\n\n250\n00:12:23.696 --> 00:12:28.565\nwe've already got this ready to go,\ngot it installed.\n\n251\n00:12:28.565 --> 00:12:33.497\nNow, one of the things you should see is\nthat there is a series of protocols that\n\n252\n00:12:33.497 --> 00:12:35.666\nthese VPN connections utilize and\n\n253\n00:12:35.666 --> 00:12:39.840\nwhat we want to just see here\nis if we start a local capture.\n\n254\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.530\nAnd as this starts to run,\nand grabs it's new session,\n\n255\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.430\ngenerates those filters and everything.\n\n256\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.561\nWhat we should see here in a second is\nthat it starts to output maybe some of\n\n257\n00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:53.151\nthe protocols that we're using here and\nI can see PPP is there,\n\n258\n00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:55.388\nthat's the point to point protocol for\n\n259\n00:12:55.388 --> 00:12:58.821\nsending your credentials over\nthose point to point links.\n\n260\n00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:02.725\nI can see generic routing and\ncapsulation going on here.\n\n261\n00:13:02.725 --> 00:13:06.375\nSo you can see some of the protocols\nthat are associated with your\n\n262\n00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.040\nVPN connection, VPN communication.\n\n263\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.680\nAnd it is very important when you think\nabout setting up your VPN connection,\n\n264\n00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.390\nthat you're thinking about\nhow the client connects\n\n265\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.670\nto make sure that you're\nusing the tunneling protocol,\n\n266\n00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.930\nand that you do have it set up\nappropriately on the client end.\n\n267\n00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.128\n>> Yeah.\nNow, obviously,\n\n268\n00:13:27.128 --> 00:13:29.422\nwe're seeing a lot of cool,\ndifferent protocols there.\n\n269\n00:13:29.422 --> 00:13:30.780\nProtocols are always awesome.\n\n270\n00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.750\nWe're using a nice, technical piece of\nsoftware here to allow us to view them.\n\n271\n00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.330\nOS is, what the heck are these things?\n\n272\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.000\nI mean we understand that\nthe VPN is using them but,\n\n273\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.370\nhow is it employing these\ndifferent protocols?\n\n274\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.815\n>> You know it uses the protocols\nbased on how the configuration is.\n\n275\n00:13:47.815 --> 00:13:52.549\nFirst of all on the server side, cuz the\nclient has to follow the server, so if you\n\n276\n00:13:52.549 --> 00:13:57.423\ngo into your advanced options, and as\nyou're setting up your VPN communication,\n\n277\n00:13:57.423 --> 00:14:01.528\nif I go back to the edit tab where we\nwere filling out that information,\n\n278\n00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:03.711\nwe've got a series of options here.\n\n279\n00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:04.350\nAll right?\n\n280\n00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.395\nWe've got some options.\n\n281\n00:14:05.395 --> 00:14:08.611\nSome options are old school,\ngo back to the early 90s.\n\n282\n00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:10.570\nThis one right here's PPTP.\n\n283\n00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.710\nPoint to point tunneling protocol.\n\n284\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.450\nThis was one of the very\nfirst tunneling protocols,\n\n285\n00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.260\nmade in the early 90s by Microsoft,\nand it's an older protocol.\n\n286\n00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.510\nIt's a legacy protocol.\n\n287\n00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.720\nIt's still kept around.\n\n288\n00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.270\nGenerally weaker encryption.\n\n289\n00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.800\nIt uses something known as Microsoft's\npoint to point encryption technology here.\n\n290\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.643\nSo, this is something that you might\nuse if you are gonna support backwards\n\n291\n00:14:30.643 --> 00:14:32.544\ncompatibility with older systems.\n\n292\n00:14:32.544 --> 00:14:34.528\n>> I thought that's where the young\nbraves went to relieve themselves.\n\n293\n00:14:34.528 --> 00:14:35.967\n>> That's exactly what it is.\n\n294\n00:14:35.967 --> 00:14:38.649\nIt's not an outhouse,\nas much as it sounds like it.\n\n295\n00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:44.165\n[LAUGH] Now, the next one here is more\nof a, I would say, more modern standard.\n\n296\n00:14:44.165 --> 00:14:45.045\nIt's been around for a bit.\n\n297\n00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:46.089\nIt's definitely tried and true.\n\n298\n00:14:46.089 --> 00:14:47.728\nIt's a mature protocol.\n\n299\n00:14:47.728 --> 00:14:52.528\nOne of the things that PPTP had,\nit had some interoperability problems, so\n\n300\n00:14:52.528 --> 00:14:54.853\nCisco and Microsoft got together and\n\n301\n00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:59.803\nthey formed like this coalition to make\nthe next kind of tunneling protocol and\n\n302\n00:14:59.803 --> 00:15:05.490\nCisco had their proprietary L2F layer 2\nforwarding and then Microsoft had PPTP.\n\n303\n00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.960\nSo what they did is they had\na blending of both protocols and\n\n304\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.050\nthe marriage the output becomes\nLT2P layer 2 tunneling protocol.\n\n305\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.950\nNow, if you're gonna use IPsec.\n\n306\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.790\nThis is gonna require stronger encryption.\n\n307\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.773\nIt's gonna require being\nset up on the server side.\n\n308\n00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:22.210\nIt's also gonna be required\nto set up on the client side.\n\n309\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.860\nBut it gives you just about the strongest\nsecurity that you can have.\n\n310\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.300\nThe other option that you have here is for\nthings like firewalls.\n\n311\n00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.350\nNow, when it comes to firewalls, one of\nthe things you have to worry about is,\n\n312\n00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:36.140\nthings like PPTP and\nL2TP sit in the registered port range.\n\n313\n00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.420\nPPTP is port 1723, and then the L2TP is\ngonna be port 1701, and because of that,\n\n314\n00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:47.740\nsometimes firewalls can block them if\nfirewalls aren't set up appropriately.\n\n315\n00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.577\nBut maybe you work for a library,\nfor a school district.\n\n316\n00:15:50.577 --> 00:15:54.732\n>> And there's no way they're gonna turn\noff their firewalls, or maybe even open\n\n317\n00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:58.901\ntheir firewalls, and that's where\nthe next protocol here, SSTP, comes in.\n\n318\n00:15:58.901 --> 00:16:03.127\nSSTP is the tunneling protocol over\nsecure socket layer, hence The SS.\n\n319\n00:16:03.127 --> 00:16:05.554\nIt's just SSL, TP, tunneling protocol.\n\n320\n00:16:05.554 --> 00:16:07.770\nSo, that's what that is,\nsecure socket tunneling protocol.\n\n321\n00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.630\nIt uses port 443, and\nit's not typically blocked by firewalls.\n\n322\n00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.530\nAnd port 443, you might know, is secure\nweb traffic, so it's a good thing to have.\n\n323\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.380\nOne of the last protocols that\nyou see down here is a really,\n\n324\n00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.038\nreally cool protocol, and that's\nthe internet key exchange version two.\n\n325\n00:16:23.038 --> 00:16:26.351\nIt is the successor to the first one,\nwhich is what we use for\n\n326\n00:16:26.351 --> 00:16:29.840\ncommunicating over a public network and\nexchanging keys.\n\n327\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.350\nIt also has the tunneling capabilities, so\n\n328\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.820\nit gives you access to IP sec level\nencryption, kinda like L2T people.\n\n329\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.510\nWhat goes a little bit with IKEv2 here\nis the fact that it's what's needed to\n\n330\n00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:46.090\nsupport a feature in Windows 10\ncalled VPN reconnect, right?\n\n331\n00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:50.450\nIf I happen to be, maybe,\non a mobile hotspot, and we're on a train.\n\n332\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.450\nWe go through, under a mountain, right?\n\n333\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.370\nWe disconnect.\n\n334\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.210\nWell, now we've lost\nconnection to our VPN.\n\n335\n00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.970\nBut then once we get out of that tunnel,\n\n336\n00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.560\nif you're using IKEv2, it's very, very\ngood at reestablishing that connection.\n\n337\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.000\nThey use a lot of mobile networks.\n\n338\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.730\nThat's why it's got another name, MOBIKE.\n\n339\n00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.312\nIt's just short for mobile internet key\nexchange, so, couple of cool protocols.\n\n340\n00:17:11.312 --> 00:17:15.100\nWhen it comes down to it, you really\nhave to know what the settings are.\n\n341\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.440\nA lot of times, if you are the\nadministrator, you know these settings.\n\n342\n00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.471\nIf you're not the administrator, you call\nthe administrator and find the settings.\n\n343\n00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:25.070\n>> Yeah, and\nkudos on using the tunnel analogy.\n\n344\n00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:27.160\nWith our tunneling protocol.\n\n345\n00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.140\nVery apropos, Wes.\n\n346\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.820\n>> That's right.\n\n347\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.350\nThat's called redundant, for sure.\n\n348\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.040\nNow, we've talked about\nthe tunneling protocols, right?\n\n349\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.582\nHow they establish,\nwhich ones we're gonna use and\n\n350\n00:17:37.582 --> 00:17:43.234\nwhy we would use one over the other, but\nthat's only half the battle, if you will.\n\n351\n00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:46.200\nWe also have to think about\nthings like authentication.\n\n352\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.630\nWell authentication is fairly easy to\nfigure out, and we can actually go to the,\n\n353\n00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.890\nmaybe the more traditional method.\n\n354\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.270\nSome of you guys maybe\nare familiar with the older ways,\n\n355\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.190\nthat you can get to your VPN connections.\n\n356\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.940\nSo let's go ahead and do that,\nlet's get in to the Control Panel here and\n\n357\n00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.770\nwe're going to go to Network and Internet.\n\n358\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:07.299\nWe'll go to to Network and Sharing Center\nand then change adapter settings,\n\n359\n00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:08.006\nall right?\n\n360\n00:18:08.006 --> 00:18:11.155\nNow, that's a long,\ndrawn out process, I do realize.\n\n361\n00:18:11.155 --> 00:18:15.711\nThat's the scenic approach, but sometimes,\nyou do have to take the long way,\n\n362\n00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:16.940\nthe roundabout way.\n\n363\n00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:22.750\nNow, if I was to select the VPN connection\nthat you can see here, work VPN, and\n\n364\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.220\nlike Dan mentioned earlier, you know, this\nis just for identifiable purposes, that\n\n365\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.170\nword VPN name, I could rename it just like\nanyone of my other network connections.\n\n366\n00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.380\nSo it really is up to you, and\nit's for identification purposes.\n\n367\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.290\nWhat I'm really interested\nin is the Properties tab,\n\n368\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.380\nor the Properties option here.\n\n369\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.350\nAll right, you can see some of\nthe various options that we have here,\n\n370\n00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:47.200\nbut what I'm really really concerned\nwith is this security field here.\n\n371\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.630\nNow with security, this is where we can\nset what authentication protocols we use.\n\n372\n00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:59.010\nRight now the industry wide standard and\nI believe Cisco says this EAP-MSCHAP v2\n\n373\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.690\nwith this protocol is a little bit more\nsecure than some of the older protocols\n\n374\n00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.000\nbut there again,\nif you're using backwards compatibility,\n\n375\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.820\nyou might be needing to\nsupport legacy devices.\n\n376\n00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.340\nRemember legacy, just an old device, and\n\n377\n00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.110\nit might not support those\nhigher levels of encryption.\n\n378\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.125\nSo if that would be the case, now be\ncareful with this because as we start to\n\n379\n00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:25.285\nreduce the authentication here,\nmechanisms, or lower the security of them,\n\n380\n00:19:25.285 --> 00:19:27.595\nwe do enter the risk of\ndecreasing security.\n\n381\n00:19:27.595 --> 00:19:31.355\nSo you got some options here\ntoo that you can downgrade.\n\n382\n00:19:31.355 --> 00:19:36.405\nKeep in mind that if you're using\nthe VPN reconnect feature and\n\n383\n00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:38.815\nyou're using ICEv2,\nyou don't have a choice unless you,\n\n384\n00:19:38.815 --> 00:19:43.550\nif you can see right here, EAP MS CHAPv2\nwill be used for ICE version 2.\n\n385\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.910\nI could use some of these older ones.\n\n386\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.920\nKeep in mind PAP, pap,\npassword authentication protocol,\n\n387\n00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.198\nthat's why am I even using\nthis authentication mechanism?\n\n388\n00:19:52.198 --> 00:19:54.650\nIt's clear text; that's why\nthey call it unencrypted.\n\n389\n00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.390\nAnd Chap here, if you're using\nChap a lot of times that's for\n\n390\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.320\na non-Windows based EPN Cuz inside,\n\n391\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.980\nin Microsoft LAN and Windows LAN,\nthe default is MS CHAP version two.\n\n392\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.020\nSo if you need to make a connection, and\n\n393\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.760\nyou're making a connection to\na non Windows environment,\n\n394\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.690\nwell you might have to run CHAP,\nand you might need to select that.\n\n395\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.430\nAnd then you got some other options here,\ntoo, but\n\n396\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.930\nyou can see by default\nit's MS CHAP version two.\n\n397\n00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.890\nThat becomes the authentication,\nand that's what you're gonna use\n\n398\n00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.190\nas another one of those settings\nthat has to match on both sides.\n\n399\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.600\nIf your VPN, tunnel, protocol, all that\nmatches, your server, everything else, and\n\n400\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.420\nthen the authentication doesn't match,\nyou're not gonna connect and,\n\n401\n00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.660\nunfortunately, you're not on the list,\nyou don't gain access to the network.\n\n402\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.910\nAnd, Dan they should definitely pay\nattention to what authentication\n\n403\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.440\nmechanism they're using as well.\n\n404\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.030\n>> Yeah, so make sure that you use the\nmost secure authentication method that you\n\n405\n00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.650\nhave available to you.\n\n406\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.770\nThere is sometimes when we\ndo have to support legacy\n\n407\n00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.580\nsystems that are still\nutilizing the older protocols.\n\n408\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.670\nIf that happens, well there's not a whole\nyou can do about it, you have to use them.\n\n409\n00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.490\nBut if you can get away with it,\ngo with the most secure.\n\n410\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.240\nThat being said there is one more thing\nwe need to mention before we close\n\n411\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.080\nthis show down.\n\n412\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.160\nAnd that's something call Direct Access.\n\n413\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.340\nSuperly cool kinda technology built-in to\nWindows 10 and Windows Environments and\n\n414\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.930\nthat is something I'm gonna let\nMister West tell us more about.\n\n415\n00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.130\n>> Yeah, definitely,\n\n416\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.290\nnow this is an Enterprise level\ntechnology and so far what we've\n\n417\n00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.390\ntalking about VPN communications\nhas many different types out there.\n\n418\n00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.010\nWe've mentioned that you can\ngo with Third Party Clients,\n\n419\n00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.410\na lot of vendors out there\nsupport VPN communications.\n\n420\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.040\nBut if you're already in\na Windows environment,\n\n421\n00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.020\nif you have a Windows server set up, you\nhave the Windows infrastructure set up.\n\n422\n00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:37.040\nWell, built in to the Windows platform is\nthe ability to those like a VPN connection\n\n423\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.800\nis to secure your communications between\nremote Locations with Direct Access.\n\n424\n00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.790\nSo let us go and check that out here,\nwith Direct Access again,\n\n425\n00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.210\nit is going to do the same\ntype of tunnelling here, and\n\n426\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.980\nyou are going to notice that in the DNC\nbecause this is a public facing server,\n\n427\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.580\nyou definitely don't want to\nput that inside your Network,\n\n428\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.040\nwe have what's known as\na direct access server.\n\n429\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.050\nNow what is the direct\naccess server doing for us.\n\n430\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.770\nWell, when I connect to it,\nwe'll talk about it in a second.\n\n431\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.460\nBut when I connect to it,\n\n432\n00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.800\nit's what's going to allow me to access\nthe internal resources within the network.\n\n433\n00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.550\nNow, so how does that happen?\n\n434\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.170\nWell, the client's gonna\ndo a couple of things.\n\n435\n00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.330\nOne of the things it's gonna do first is,\nif it's on the internal network and\n\n436\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.940\nwe've got DirectAccess set up,\nit's gonna try to communicate with this,\n\n437\n00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.970\nwhat's known as an NLS server,\nor network location server.\n\n438\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.480\nI know that's a little redundant.\n\n439\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.280\nAnd what it does,\n\n440\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.840\nthe only thing that that server does\nis exactly what the name sounds like.\n\n441\n00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.670\nHow do I determine, how does the client\ndetermine it's network location?\n\n442\n00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.930\nSo, what it's going to try to do is,\n\n443\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.940\nmy client is going to try to connect\nto that network location server.\n\n444\n00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.730\nNow if it can connect to it since it's\ninside of the network, my client says,\n\n445\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.220\nwell wait a second, I'm not in a remote\nlocation cuz I can talk to that server.\n\n446\n00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.730\nSo, it doesn't use direct access.\n\n447\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.520\nHowever, notice the client out here.\n\n448\n00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.660\nThe client out here is gonna use something\nknown as a name resolution policy\n\n449\n00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.370\ntable and it's gonna try to resolve and\nfind that network location server.\n\n450\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.790\nNow it's not inside of the network,\n\n451\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.450\nso it's not gonna be able\nto resolve that name.\n\n452\n00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.570\nIt's not gonna be able to find, so\nit's gonna say oh wait a second here.\n\n453\n00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.420\nI must be on the external network.\n\n454\n00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.300\nAnd it's gonna look down\nto it's firewall and\n\n455\n00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.660\nsay, I've got a couple of these\nconnection security rules here.\n\n456\n00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.650\nAnd it's gonna build up a tunnel,\nan IPV 6 based,\n\n457\n00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.570\nkeep that in mind, this,\nyou need IPV 6 for this.\n\n458\n00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.620\nIt's gonna build up two IP seg tunnel.\n\n459\n00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.210\nNow, the first IP seg tunnel we're not\neven talking about sending data yet.\n\n460\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.430\nAt this point, what we're talking\nabout is just my authentication,\n\n461\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.160\nnegotiation of encryption,\nstrengths before anything ever happens.\n\n462\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.040\nSo kind of like setting the session\nparameters before we even start sending\n\n463\n00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.860\ninformation.\n\n464\n00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.970\nThen the next thing it does once\nthe authentication has happened,\n\n465\n00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.070\nit creates a second tunnel.\n\n466\n00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.330\nAnd this is an encrypted\ntunnel with IPsec,\n\n467\n00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:59.470\nusing IPv6, and\nit connects back through this tunnel,\n\n468\n00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.440\nthrough the Direct Access Server into\nthe Corporate Resources on the inside.\n\n469\n00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.490\nSo, much like we we see\nwhen we took our VPN,\n\n470\n00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.690\nwe connect it to that corporate server,\nI connect it to the Domain Controller I\n\n471\n00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.230\ncould connect to any of\nthe internal resources.\n\n472\n00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.990\nIf I've got a file server in there,\nnow I gain access to it.\n\n473\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.060\nAnd you might be asking yourself, well\nwhy would we use VPN over direct access?\n\n474\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.840\nWell VPN's got a lot of third\nparty support, but there again,\n\n475\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.040\na lot of extra infrastructure.\n\n476\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.120\nAnd if you've already got\nthe infrastructure in place to support\n\n477\n00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.360\nsomething like direct access and\nyou've got the enterprise level licensing.\n\n478\n00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.290\nWell you're already in place.\n\n479\n00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:39.320\nYou've got the components that you need\nright here setup before anything else to\n\n480\n00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.250\nstart implementing secure\ncommunications over public Networks,\n\n481\n00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.370\nit allows you that\nencrypted remote access.\n\n482\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.100\nSo it's a very very good technology to\nhave but do keep in mind they're there,\n\n483\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.680\nit's gonna require Enterprise\nlevel addition on Windows.\n\n484\n00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.020\n>> Awesome.\nWell, that being said,\n\n485\n00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:57.960\nit is a very very nice thing to say,\nyou know what, I don't have to go out and\n\n486\n00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.750\npurchase all that third party\ninfrastructure to build a VPN connection,\n\n487\n00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.000\nI already have it built-in to my\nWindows Enterprise Operating Systems.\n\n488\n00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.730\nAnd all my servers.\n\n489\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.560\nSo might as well we just go ahead and\nimplement it there.\n\n490\n00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.490\nIt can be a nice way to keep cost down,\nand yet\n\n491\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.930\nstill maintain that level of availability.\n\n492\n00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:14.770\nVery very cool stuff.\n\n493\n00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:15.520\n>> Yeah, very cool.\n\n494\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.060\n>> Something we should definitely look\ninto more of if you're an IT guy.\n\n495\n00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.470\nThat's some business somewhere.\n\n496\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:21.901\nVersus anything else we need to cover.\n\n497\n00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:24.160\n>> No sir, I don't think so.\n\n498\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.380\nJust make sure you've\ngot your protocols and\n\n499\n00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.980\nyour connections setup on both sides of\nthe communication, you should be good.\n\n500\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.880\n>> Awesome.\nWell thank you so much for\n\n501\n00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.600\njoining us today.\n\n502\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.000\n>> Thank you.\n>> Showing us all these\n\n503\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.440\ngreat ways in which we can, surely can,\nsecurely connect to our networks.\n\n504\n00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.290\nThat being said,\n\n505\n00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.390\nI said we go ahead and call this a day\nwe're gonna close this show down.\n\n506\n00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.146\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n507\n00:25:42.146 --> 00:25:43.446\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n508\n00:25:43.446 --> 00:25:48.920\n>> And I'm Wes

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.658 --> 00:00:16.364\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:21.362\nAnd today, we're taking a look at Windows\n10 security, specifically taking a look\n\n6\n00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:25.140\nat what managing these devices with,\nwell, Microsoft Intune.\n\n7\n00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.244\nAnd who better to help us then, well, the\njack of all trades himself, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:30.614\nHow is it going, Wes?\n>> Man, it's going great, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:33.714\nThanks for having me here, and\nwe've got a cool show for you guys, today.\n\n10\n00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:37.073\nWe're gonna be talking about Microsoft\nIntune as we continue on in Windows\n\n11\n00:00:37.073 --> 00:00:37.615\nsecurity.\n\n12\n00:00:37.615 --> 00:00:41.881\nWindows 10 security, more specifically,\nand one of the things we can do is,\n\n13\n00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:45.257\nwe can control different aspects\nof our Windows 10 devices,\n\n14\n00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:48.203\nand these devices that\nare connected to the Internet.\n\n15\n00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:51.446\nOne of the great things is as we've\nbeen talking about in some of the past\n\n16\n00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:55.178\nepisodes, we've been mentioning things\nthat are specific to just an enterprise\n\n17\n00:00:55.178 --> 00:00:56.600\nlevel environment.\n\n18\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.209\nYou have to watch what operating\nsystem you have, and if you don't have\n\n19\n00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.097\nthe right edition of Windows 10,\nwell maybe that feature is not available.\n\n20\n00:01:02.097 --> 00:01:05.636\nOne of the great things about managing\nyour Windows 10 devices inside or\n\n21\n00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:07.748\nthrough Microsoft Intune is the fact that,\n\n22\n00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:10.329\nit doesn't matter what\nedition of Windows you have.\n\n23\n00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.612\nYou can have the,\nI don't wanna call it the home edition,\n\n24\n00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:16.369\nbut the Windows 10,\nnothing beside the name.\n\n25\n00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.494\nAnd it is for the consumer market,\nas well as the professional and likewise,\n\n26\n00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:22.777\neven the enterprise level devices and it\ngoes a little bit farther than that too.\n\n27\n00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:26.388\nWe can also control our\nWindows 10 mobile devices.\n\n28\n00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:28.646\nBut we're gonna kind of\nfocus on what we can do,\n\n29\n00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:31.194\nreally rifle into what we\ncan do with the client here.\n\n30\n00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:33.238\nSo what are some of the things\nyou can do inside of Windows 10?\n\n31\n00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:36.598\nWell some of the things you can do\nis submit things like hardware and\n\n32\n00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:38.040\nsoftware inventory.\n\n33\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.900\nYou can provision software to devices.\n\n34\n00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.721\nThe other things that we can do, we can\ncustomize Microsoft Intune policies,\n\n35\n00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.360\nand we're gonna take a look at that today.\n\n36\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.810\nWe can install things\nlike Endpoint Protection.\n\n37\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.570\nWe can keep these devices secure.\n\n38\n00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.799\nWe can even schedule scans\non the local machines, and\n\n39\n00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.990\nwe're gonna show you exactly\nhow that works today.\n\n40\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.720\nSome of the other things that we can\ndo is we can provide remote assistance.\n\n41\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.559\nImagine a way that if somebody's\nconnected to the Internet,\n\n42\n00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:07.107\nthey can call into you rather than waiting\nuntil they get back to the office and\n\n43\n00:02:07.107 --> 00:02:10.620\nthey can say, hey, I need a little bit\nof help here and you can provide that.\n\n44\n00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.971\nAnd one of the the last things we're gonna\nshow here today is how you can eradicate\n\n45\n00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:17.429\nthe data off of machines through something\nknown as remote business data removal.\n\n46\n00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.649\nSo Ronnie we got a lot\nof cool things today and\n\n47\n00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.675\nhopefully you guys will really enjoy\nwhat we're gonna be demonstrating here.\n\n48\n00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:26.844\n>> Sounds like a great bunch of\ninformation that we have to go through.\n\n49\n00:02:26.844 --> 00:02:30.581\nSo remember that with Microsoft Intune,\nit really is about being able to take\n\n50\n00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:33.350\nthe management features that\nwe'd like to have though.\n\n51\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.518\nBeing able to spread them beyond what the\nboundaries of our domain, being able to\n\n52\n00:02:36.518 --> 00:02:39.370\nmanage things like your devices that\nare not gonna be connected inside.\n\n53\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.432\nYou have remote users\nthat are out there but\n\n54\n00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:45.046\nyou still need to actually do some of\nthe things that Wes was talking about.\n\n55\n00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:48.530\nIntune is gonna help you but specifically\nwe're talking about Windows 10 and\n\n56\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.665\nhow we actually manage\nthat with Intune as well.\n\n57\n00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:54.185\nSo, Wes, you're gonna actually show us\nwhat we're talking about now, right?\n\n58\n00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:54.991\n>> That's right,\n\n59\n00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:58.800\none of the things that you managed\nIntune today through is your Office 365.\n\n60\n00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.723\nNow this really isn't a demonstration\nof Office 365 but they really like that\n\n61\n00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:06.257\ncentralized platform that you can\nlaunch all the major cloud services.\n\n62\n00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:09.668\nThis is a subscription based service but\nkeep in mind that if you want to test it\n\n63\n00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:11.778\nout, you'll also have\nthe trial version too.\n\n64\n00:03:11.778 --> 00:03:15.804\nSo here on my Windows 10 machine,\nI'm actually logged into the Office 365\n\n65\n00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:19.730\ninterface and the one that we really want\nto look at is down here at the bottom.\n\n66\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.021\nYou'll see all the way down at\nthe bottom we have Windows Intune, and\n\n67\n00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.855\nthis is where you can launch\nthe management interface.\n\n68\n00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:27.783\nSo when you do,\nit takes you to what's known as, well,\n\n69\n00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:28.860\ncollectively the dashboard.\n\n70\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.194\nAnd the dashboard gives you a quick heads\nup view of the different things that\n\n71\n00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:36.173\nare going on,\nincluding things like your devices,\n\n72\n00:03:36.173 --> 00:03:39.070\nthe health status of your devices,\nand updates.\n\n73\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.220\nNow, how is it that we can\nactually configure our devices?\n\n74\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.690\nWell that's through policies that you can\nissue out inside of Microsoft Intune.\n\n75\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.002\nNow to issue out a policy, first you have\nto browse to the Policy icon here on\n\n76\n00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:53.152\nthe left-hand side, and\nwhen we go to that location,\n\n77\n00:03:53.152 --> 00:03:56.720\nwe'll have a whole bunch of\npolicies that are maybe in place.\n\n78\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.430\nYou'll see different types\nof policies in here.\n\n79\n00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.228\nWe'll have configuration policies and\nsome of the other policies as well.\n\n80\n00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:06.145\nAnd if I wanna control the device,\n\n81\n00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:09.930\nall I have to do is just simplistic\nas just choosing add policy here.\n\n82\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.920\nNow, what isn't so\nsimplistic is what choice do I make?\n\n83\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.107\nHere you got all these different\npolicies and kinda like,\n\n84\n00:04:15.107 --> 00:04:18.423\njust like Ronnie said,\nthere are other operating systems,\n\n85\n00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:21.410\nbut we're really focusing\nin on Windows 10 here.\n\n86\n00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.719\nSo when we create a policy, that's one of\nthe first things you have to figure out is\n\n87\n00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.910\nwhat machine is it that you're gonna\ncontrol and make the policy accordingly.\n\n88\n00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.780\nNow one other thing, too.\n\n89\n00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.794\nThere is a couple of different\nways that you can do this.\n\n90\n00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:37.440\nThey have templates,\nwhich is the default recommendations.\n\n91\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.990\nNow, Ronnie and I, we're not\ngonna do the defaults right here.\n\n92\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.064\nWe're gonna rub against\nthe grain on this one, and\n\n93\n00:04:43.064 --> 00:04:47.630\nwe're gonna customize a policy so\nwe can look at some of these features.\n\n94\n00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.582\nAll right, so when the policies\nfirst starts getting created,\n\n95\n00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.588\nit queries the system there and\nit pulls down the right template,\n\n96\n00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:55.300\nso you have the right settings here.\n\n97\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.090\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and name this.\n\n98\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.927\nLet's just name this a Config Policy,\neasy for me cuz of my typing skills here.\n\n99\n00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:04.642\n>> Sounds like a good idea.\n>> [LAUGH] Now, as we scroll down through\n\n100\n00:05:04.642 --> 00:05:09.022\nhere there is a bunch of stuff that\nyou can enforce on your machines, and\n\n101\n00:05:09.022 --> 00:05:10.560\none of the great things?\n\n102\n00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.640\nYour machines don't even have\nto be inside of the network.\n\n103\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.545\nRemember, this can reach out across that\npublic Internet, it can find the device if\n\n104\n00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:22.350\nit does have that Internet connection,\nand it can do some configurations for us.\n\n105\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.611\nNow, notice that we can\ndo different password.\n\n106\n00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:29.230\nWe can configure the attributes and\ncharacteristics of our password.\n\n107\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.895\nNow, normally, password policies\nare limited to a local group policy or\n\n108\n00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:35.450\nsomething that you're\ngonna enforce in a domain.\n\n109\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.410\nSo, how does that benefit us here?\n\n110\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.848\nWell, imagine the fact that you have\na device that can't connect to the domain.\n\n111\n00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:43.782\nMay be I have somebody that's working at\nhome that using their just Windows 10\n\n112\n00:05:43.782 --> 00:05:46.690\nmachine, and\nWindows 10 can't join a domain.\n\n113\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.892\nSo I can still push out a password policy\nto keep it secure to a non Windows device.\n\n114\n00:05:52.892 --> 00:05:57.226\nNow here's another one, Ronnie, that I\nreally like is the ability to require\n\n115\n00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:59.990\nencryption on your mobile devices, right.\n\n116\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.710\nMost of these devices have some kind\nof pervasive encryption, right?\n\n117\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.180\nOne of the ones being the full\ndevice encryption and\n\n118\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.070\nthen we can couple that with things like\nBitLocker and get a layer of security.\n\n119\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.564\nSo this is one of the things that we\ncan require and we can implement.\n\n120\n00:06:13.564 --> 00:06:16.638\nNow we do have some other things that you,\nwe have some systems here,\n\n121\n00:06:16.638 --> 00:06:17.708\nsystem settings here.\n\n122\n00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:21.539\nOne of the ones that I really\nlike is root certification.\n\n123\n00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.300\nIn one of the other episodes,\nthat we discussed certificates.\n\n124\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.493\nAnd if you haven't checked that one out,\ngo ahead and go back and check that out.\n\n125\n00:06:28.493 --> 00:06:31.701\nWhen we talked about certificate\nmanagement, one of the things that we\n\n126\n00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.497\nmentioned is that installation of our root\ncertification authority certificate is\n\n127\n00:06:35.497 --> 00:06:37.749\na very big thing and\nshouldn't be taken lightly.\n\n128\n00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:43.490\nSo we can either allow or deny that\nwhen it comes to the certificates.\n\n129\n00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.953\nI keep saying certification.\n\n130\n00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:48.427\nBut the certificates that you download\nto these machines could potentially\n\n131\n00:06:48.427 --> 00:06:49.955\ncompromise your security here.\n\n132\n00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:51.766\nSo, be careful with that one.\n\n133\n00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:55.248\nLike I said, by default your\ntemplate's gonna have this turned off.\n\n134\n00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:59.010\nBut because we haven't made a template,\nwe're making a customized policy,\n\n135\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.554\nif I wanted to turn any one of these\nsettings on, I could do that very easy.\n\n136\n00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:05.723\nAnd if you don't know what\nthe settings define, it's very easy.\n\n137\n00:07:05.723 --> 00:07:11.211\nJust by clicking the exclamation point,\nyou can rifle down and you can find out\n\n138\n00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:17.053\nwhat that policy specifically does to the\nmachine and how it affects our machines.\n\n139\n00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:18.361\nNow scrolling down here,\n\n140\n00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:22.170\nthe other really cool thing about\ncontrolling your Windows 10 machines.\n\n141\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.246\nWe talked about the ability to\nuse a Microsoft account, right?\n\n142\n00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:25.870\nYou use your Microsoft account.\n\n143\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.531\nYou can connect to the cloud out there.\n\n144\n00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:30.460\nYou get the ability to\nsynchronize settings.\n\n145\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.658\nWell maybe we're in a heavily\nmanaged environment.\n\n146\n00:07:33.658 --> 00:07:37.963\nMaybe we don't want our users to be\nable to attach their Microsoft accounts,\n\n147\n00:07:37.963 --> 00:07:40.010\nmaybe a corporate owned device.\n\n148\n00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.380\nWell, guess what?\n\n149\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.429\nNo problem here.\nWe can rifle in on that, we can say no,\n\n150\n00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:46.755\ndon't allow that in,\nas well as synchronizing the settings.\n\n151\n00:07:46.755 --> 00:07:49.389\nKeep in mind, when you have a Microsoft\naccount attached to your Windows 10\n\n152\n00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:51.145\nmachine it could cause\na security vulnerability.\n\n153\n00:07:51.145 --> 00:07:55.926\nCuz one of the things that synchronizes\nto the cloud are your passwords, right?\n\n154\n00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:59.656\nYou might not want those passwords\nbeing synchronized to the cloud, so\n\n155\n00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:02.653\nthat right there Could be\na security vulnerability too.\n\n156\n00:08:02.653 --> 00:08:07.350\nCouple of the other things here that\nwe have, device capabilities, VPNs.\n\n157\n00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.420\nBut what I really like too here\nis the hardware aspect of this.\n\n158\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.880\nBeing able to control what can or\ncan't happen on the hardware.\n\n159\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.560\nFor instance removable storage is one,\nright.\n\n160\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.840\nWe really worry about somebody maybe\ntaking company data off of that device and\n\n161\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.660\nmaybe exposing it to some\nkind of security risk.\n\n162\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.480\nEven if it's just out there in the open so\nwe can disable that.\n\n163\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.470\nMaybe we don't want to share wi-fi.\n\n164\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.000\nRight?.\n\n165\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.280\nSo we can control internet sharing,\n\n166\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.220\nwe can say no you're not going to\nshare your internet connection and\n\n167\n00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.200\nsome of the other things you can do\nwith your network communication.\n\n168\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.250\nNow even though this is\nunder the hardware level.\n\n169\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.750\nIn the hardware you will\n\n170\n00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.160\nsee where this is all related directly to,\nIt's a networking.\n\n171\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.927\nFor instance, near field communication,\ngeo location, right?.\n\n172\n00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:55.954\nSo with geo location,\n\n173\n00:08:55.954 --> 00:08:59.750\nI have to worry about maybe broadcasting\nto the world where my device currently is.\n\n174\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.600\nAnd again, and I heavily manage\nenvironment, maybe you don't want all of\n\n175\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.260\nyour friends out there in facebook knowing\nwhere you're posting your next post.\n\n176\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.870\nRight.\nSo, that's\n\n177\n00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.190\na good think to maybe control as well.\n\n178\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.030\nOne of the last things here in\nthe hardware settings that I really\n\n179\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.410\nthink Is good.\n\n180\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.640\nIs the USB connections right.\n\n181\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.630\nUSB, we might not want anybody connecting\nan external device to your computers,\n\n182\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.950\nand you can lock that down too.\n\n183\n00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.970\nWe do that a lot in corporate\nenvironments as well\n\n184\n00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.300\nbecause we wanna have pre-approved devices\nthat are connecting to the machines.\n\n185\n00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.840\nAnd we don't want people just to\nconnecting anything to a machine,\n\n186\n00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.740\nmaybe downloading a driver, or goes\nthrough the driver installation process,\n\n187\n00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.790\nmaybe causes some system corruption so\n\n188\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.290\nRonnie with the hardware here I tell you\nwhat it's a very, very good way to control\n\n189\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.800\njust about all aspects if you will\nthe configurations of your devices here.\n\n190\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.950\nOne of the last things I'll\nsay here on a configuration\n\n191\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.870\npolicy if we make it as Cortana.\n\n192\n00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.920\nAll right you have to be careful and\nCortana is a good\n\n193\n00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.870\nthing just like some of the other\nvoice systems that you have out there.\n\n194\n00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.800\nIt's not a bad thing.\n\n195\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.880\nI've used it with myself to but you have\nto be careful with the Privacy statements.\n\n196\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.350\nIt's collecting that information and it\ncould expose that private information to\n\n197\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.370\nthe cloud and to other parties so\nyou might not want Cortana working here.\n\n198\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.110\nSo this is a way that if you don't\nwanna allow the voice assistant you\n\n199\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.930\ncan disable it.\n\n200\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.370\nIt's a very good feature there.\n\n201\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.160\n>> Yeah, it sounds like intune's\na very powerful way that we\n\n202\n00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.880\ncan have a little bit of\nsecurity control especially on\n\n203\n00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.060\ndays when we are seeing more BYOB or B\n>> B, o, i, o, d.\n\n204\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:31.560\nYes.\n\n205\n00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.170\n>> Oh, o, d.\n\n206\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:32.970\nNot d, b.\nSorry.\n\n207\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:33.483\nMy fault.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n208\n00:10:33.483 --> 00:10:34.070\n>> Yeah.\n\n209\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.730\nSo, the idea of bring your own device\n\n210\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.010\ninto, of course, your network.\n\n211\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.660\nAnd the reason behind that is\nwhat wes also mentioned here,\n\n212\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.478\nthe very fact that some of these devices\nare not designed to integrate into your\n\n213\n00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.896\ncurrent active directory structure.\n\n214\n00:10:47.896 --> 00:10:50.096\nSo you still need control if they're\ngonna be accessing what resources\n\n215\n00:10:50.096 --> 00:10:50.800\ninside your network.\n\n216\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.020\nSo, Wes has just showed us,\nvery importantly, that we can take\n\n217\n00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.660\nthose configuration policies, especially\nwhen those devices are going to be,\n\n218\n00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.270\nor won't normally a lot of times, just\npart of our company and our business being\n\n219\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.160\nable to control what connects and what can\ncontrol them or what they can actually do.\n\n220\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.330\nBut there's also other things that\nwe have to be worried about as well.\n\n221\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.540\nInside of microsoft intune we not\nonly have configuration policies but\n\n222\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.560\nwe also have things like\ncompliance policies.\n\n223\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.590\nWes, you're gonna help us\nunderstand the difference.\n\n224\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.340\n>> That's right.\nHere a policy, there a policy,\n\n225\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.210\neverywhere a policy policy.\n\n226\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.520\nPolicy.\nNow understand\n\n227\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.090\nthat really when it comes to a compliance\npolicy one of the main differences\n\n228\n00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.290\nis a configuration policy is\ndefining the configurations for\n\n229\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.420\ndevices that are already\npart of your Intune service.\n\n230\n00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.890\nThese are devices that are already\nconnected to your network.\n\n231\n00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.170\nThey're communicating and\n\n232\n00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.110\nyou wanna control exactly what\ntheir configurations are.\n\n233\n00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.260\nA compliance policy is for things like\nyour android devices, your iOS devices and\n\n234\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.070\nthis is coupled with With something\nknown as conditional access.\n\n235\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:53.480\nSo I can create a compliance policy and\n\n236\n00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.710\nI could say,\nyou have to have these settings for\n\n237\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.130\nthe condition of accessing,\nlet's say exchange, right.\n\n238\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.060\nYou know, I might not want things like for\ninstance, certain phones out there.\n\n239\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.900\nIt might be jail broken, you know,\nwe might not want jail broke, you know,\n\n240\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.560\nany phone that's been jail broken to\njoin to our networks because some of\n\n241\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.725\nthe security we really can't control it.\n\n242\n00:12:12.725 --> 00:12:17.814\nSo the compliance policies do allow you\nthe ability to control your password\n\n243\n00:12:17.814 --> 00:12:23.474\ncontrol, your encryption, and then\nultimately, jailbreaking devices as well.\n\n244\n00:12:23.474 --> 00:12:24.907\nNow the other great thing that\nwe got that I really like,\n\n245\n00:12:24.907 --> 00:12:25.810\nthe windows firewall, right?\n\n246\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:31.310\nIn some of the other episodes in\nthis series that we've talked about,\n\n247\n00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.390\nwe mentioned the windows firewall.\n\n248\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.100\nBut in the windows firewall,\n\n249\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.270\nhow do you know that the end users haven't\ngone jiminy click ,its there got bored and\n\n250\n00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.410\ndisabled the firewall and\nyou're not protected.\n\n251\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.050\nWell inside of your policies,\nin here inside of Microsoft Intune,\n\n252\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.180\nwe go back to that add\npolicy button again and\n\n253\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.020\nnow we're going to go to the computer\nmanagement session settings.\n\n254\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.400\nNow you might say, well wait a second Wes,\nthe configuration policy is\n\n255\n00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.600\nit really different, you know,\ncan I configure stuff still?.\n\n256\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.500\nYes, we are but the one that we're really\nlooking for is the firewall settings.\n\n257\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.490\nWe can set a policy and this one's\ngonna have some default as well guys.\n\n258\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.600\nYou'll see out there, again we're\nnot going with the default here.\n\n259\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.300\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna create a custom policy,\n\n260\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.160\nso that we can show you guys the settings.\n\n261\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.410\nThis is a really cool thing I tell you.\n\n262\n00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.960\nI really like this the ability to be able\nto control this on non domain devices.\n\n263\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.210\nThat's one of the major things here.\n\n264\n00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:30.010\nHere, so I'll just say Windows ten,\nlet's say at firewall policy.\n\n265\n00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.923\nI'm not too creative here on this one.\n\n266\n00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:33.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And when we go down here,\n\n267\n00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.980\nif you guys haven't seen\nour firewall episode,\n\n268\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.360\nwe explain pretty in depth what\nthese individual setting are.\n\n269\n00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.520\nSo go back and\ncheck those out if you want.\n\n270\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.720\nWe can turn on the firewall and what we\ncan do is we can configure the profiles.\n\n271\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.460\nRemember, the individual profiles that\nwe have that we can define find settings\n\n272\n00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.940\nbased on the profile because remember,\nif I've got a domain based computer,\n\n273\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.620\nit's gonna have a domain profile,\nbut that doesn't even exist inside\n\n274\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.190\nof a Windows ten device that\ncan't be joined through a domain.\n\n275\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.240\nSo, that profile doesn't exist but\nthe private profile does.\n\n276\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.920\nRight.\n\n277\n00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.080\nIf you have devices that maybe you\nknow are gonna be commonly connecting\n\n278\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.170\nto things like wifi hotspots.\n\n279\n00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.260\nYou got somebody that's out there\ntraveling across the states.\n\n280\n00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.170\nWe might not want them to have a private\nprofile or the domain profile or\n\n281\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:22.200\nthe work profile I think is the other\none if you're not in a domain.\n\n282\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.190\nSo we might force them to have\nthe public profile that locks\n\n283\n00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.610\ndown th settings a little\nbit more restrictive.\n\n284\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.040\nNow one of the great things\nthat we can also do is\n\n285\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.080\nwe can do that implicit deny\nthat we talked about, right?.\n\n286\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.460\nWe can block all of the incoming\ncommunications except what we allow.\n\n287\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.830\nAnd we can do that on\na profile-by-profile basis so\n\n288\n00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.090\nyou can get very granular on this.\n\n289\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.130\nSo, the next thing we can do,\nis we can set the notification level.\n\n290\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.310\nThis is exactly how intrusive\nyou want the warnings to be.\n\n291\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:56.500\nNow, you might say if the firewall's on,\nwhy do I need to know about it?\n\n292\n00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.150\nLet's just go ahead and disable it.\n\n293\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.950\nThat's could be a good thing,\nbut it could be a bad thing.\n\n294\n00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.230\nFor instance Ron, if I know that I'm\ngetting attacked over and over and over.\n\n295\n00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.070\nBut it keeps blocking something but\nI'm not aware of it.\n\n296\n00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.190\nOut of sight out of mind.\n\n297\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.990\nI'm not even going to know\nthat it's happening so\n\n298\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.870\ndon't think that disabling a firewalls\nnotifications is really a good thing.\n\n299\n00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.170\nIt could be a bad thing.\n\n300\n00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.490\nThat could actually be a security risk.\n\n301\n00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.110\nOne of the cool things that I want to\nkind of compare and contrast here.\n\n302\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.090\nLook at the predefined exceptions.\n\n303\n00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:29.040\nNow in the predefined exceptions you\ncan see something here if I remember\n\n304\n00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.810\nhow to spell windows those and\nwe type firewall.\n\n305\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:36.090\nIt always wants to bring up that\nfirewall with advanced security here.\n\n306\n00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.490\nI tell you what,\nwe'll do this a different way.\n\n307\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.220\nThe search feature is not giving\nme what I'm doing search for.\n\n308\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.000\nSo, I'll go to Systems &\nSecurity in the Windows Firewall.\n\n309\n00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.680\nBut really, specifically,\nwhat I wanna show you guys is.\n\n310\n00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.850\nLook at this exception list.\n\n311\n00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:48.530\nAll right.\n\n312\n00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:54.110\nAnd with the exception list here, you\ncan see that BranchCache is on the list.\n\n313\n00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.010\nNotice that BranchCache Cache here,\nand we have BranchCache, and\n\n314\n00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.450\nthen you'll see some other ones here.\n\n315\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.690\nThey're the same thing.\n\n316\n00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.660\nThe Distributed Transaction Service,\nor coordinator here.\n\n317\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.940\nI can control the exceptions to\nsomebody's firewall when I'm not sitting\n\n318\n00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.130\nin front of their computer.\n\n319\n00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.990\nI don't have to sneakernet\nover to these computers,\n\n320\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.560\nyou know walking over to the computers and\nmanually defining individual exceptions.\n\n321\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.680\nI can set them right here.\n\n322\n00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.220\nAnd notice that they\nare integrated completely.\n\n323\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.550\nAnd just Just the same as what you\nwould see inside of a Window firewall.\n\n324\n00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.730\nThat's always a good thing to have.\n\n325\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.610\nThe exceptions list there.\n\n326\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.600\nThe Windows firewall is a great way\nthat you can control the security\n\n327\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.540\nsettings specifically related\nto the firewall on all\n\n328\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.370\nof your Windows devices that are running.\n\n329\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.130\nI have to say makes it a good day at\nthe office when we can do this from\n\n330\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.770\na centralized location and we don't have\nto walk computer to computer to computer.\n\n331\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.450\nUsually only I think I\ndo is walk (inaudible).\n\n332\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:43.970\n>> Understand.\n\n333\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.050\nThere is a lot of time also forget that\nwith that firewall policy, right?.\n\n334\n00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.930\nWe want it to be consistent and this is\ngonna be true with not only the devices\n\n335\n00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.930\nthat we have inside our own active\ndirectory domain even on site, but\n\n336\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.834\nwhat if we want to actually\nmultiple sites as well.\n\n337\n00:16:57.834 --> 00:17:01.127\nWe know that we can use group policy but\nbetween different devices here.\n\n338\n00:17:01.127 --> 00:17:02.507\nIf we have this ability and\n\n339\n00:17:02.507 --> 00:17:06.410\nwe are having people come into our\nnetwork with their not jointed domain.\n\n340\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.940\nThis is one way where we can do\nthat if we set up that policy and\n\n341\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.940\nlet them know hey you have to we\nneed these compliance measure.\n\n342\n00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.820\nHere's the configuration it has to go on.\n\n343\n00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.780\nWe need to install the Intune agent onto\nyour machine, and we can do that aswell.\n\n344\n00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.580\nAnother neat feature, though, and\nWes is gonna show us this as well,\n\n345\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.570\nis about making sure that we\nhave that ability to ensure that\n\n346\n00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.530\nupdates are happening on machines as well,\nright Wes?.\n\n347\n00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.070\n>> That's right.\n\n348\n00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:27.700\nThat is a big one.\n\n349\n00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.110\nHow many times have you guys ou there,\n\n350\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:33.480\nif you're not in an IT environment\neven looked at your updates, right?.\n\n351\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.730\nWell, that's a big Inside\nof your companies, right?.\n\n352\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.950\nWe wanna make sure that for one, we have\na consistency across all of our devices.\n\n353\n00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.110\nTwo, one of the things\nthat we wanna make sure is\n\n354\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.220\nthat we have a patch management solution,\nright?.\n\n355\n00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.320\nMaybe in your home networks, even if\nyou're very familiar with Windows update.\n\n356\n00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.730\nYou've performed updates on your\nown computers, which is great.\n\n357\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.870\nIt's not that easy inside of\na corporate environment, right?.\n\n358\n00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.580\nWe go through patch management systems and\nsometimes a patch has to be thorough\n\n359\n00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:05.300\ntested before, it's gonna be\nimplemented and pushed out, cuz we\n\n360\n00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.450\ndon't wanna push out that update and then\nit brings down your production network.\n\n361\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.120\nSo we can control that inside of a domain\nenvironment with things like WSUS,\n\n362\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.830\nthe Windows Server Update Service.\n\n363\n00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.980\nWe can point all of our domain computers\nback to that centralized server.\n\n364\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.920\nWe can approve, deny,\npush out these updates, but\n\n365\n00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.680\nwe can not do that on things like your\nwindows devices that can not join domains,\n\n366\n00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.380\nincluding Windows mobile devices, right.\n\n367\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.560\nMaybe I wanna be able to\ncontrol just like Ronnie said,\n\n368\n00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.410\nthe BYOD, right, the bring your own\ndevices typically cannot be controlled\n\n369\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.630\nwith the traditional management systems\nthat we have inside of a windows domain.\n\n370\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.200\nThat's where Windows Intune comes in.\n\n371\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.570\nAnd we can go through and we can add\nupdates and in fact, I've already got\n\n372\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.090\nan update that's been applied to\nthe machine here that we're running on.\n\n373\n00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.640\nSo if I go to, let's say for\ninstance mandatory updates.\n\n374\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.020\nWith mandatory updates,\nit's gonna scroll through here and\n\n375\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.130\nit's gonna find all of the updates that,\nlike it says, are mandatory.\n\n376\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.680\nYou don't have an option here.\n\n377\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.420\nAnd I can scroll down and\nreally quickly, I can see that hey,\n\n378\n00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.180\nwe've got one of these machines\nhas a mandatory update installed.\n\n379\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.910\nAnd I can click on that update.\n\n380\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.300\nLet's say I don't know what\nthat update is and honestly,\n\n381\n00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.600\non this one, I'm not sure that I do.\n\n382\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.480\nEndpoint protection, right?.\n\n383\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.980\nNotice that it tell me.\n\n384\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.440\nOne computer has this update installed.\n\n385\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.830\nWell, what computer is that I don't know.\n\n386\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:27.450\nThis could be hundreds of computers that\nwe can manage so, I click on that and it\n\n387\n00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.610\ntakes me right to the computer that that\nupdate has been on and, I can see that\n\n388\n00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.220\nit's cl2, I can see the operating system\nand even the date that it was installed.\n\n389\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.261\nNow, here's a really cool feature I can go\neven farther than this, maybe I know that\n\n390\n00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:44.034\nI'm looking at this computer, because I\nwant to see more about this computer.\n\n391\n00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:48.661\nWell, interestingly enough,\nif you right-click on the computer and\n\n392\n00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:53.828\nview properties, it instantly switches\nover to a very detailed explanation or\n\n393\n00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:58.528\noutput of, kinda like when we do in\nwindows when we run our MS info 32 and\n\n394\n00:19:58.528 --> 00:20:00.177\nwe get all of our system.\n\n395\n00:20:00.177 --> 00:20:02.661\nInformation at a pretty low level here.\n\n396\n00:20:02.661 --> 00:20:07.050\nWell guess what, I can find out that I've\ngot endpoint protection level on here.\n\n397\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.530\nI can tell what version of\nthe malware definitions.\n\n398\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:15.160\nI can even find out when was\nthe last time it ran a scan.\n\n399\n00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.540\nIf I'm worried about hey maybe\nsomebodys been on the road for awhile.\n\n400\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.580\nWe haven't heard from them.\n\n401\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.930\nRight.\nThey haven't checked in for\n\n402\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:22.470\nsome reason or not.\n\n403\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.820\nI want to find out when's the last time\nthey've actually managed, or had a scan.\n\n404\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.700\nSo we can actually do that right here.\n\n405\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.060\nThe other thing too is,\nwhat if it does scan the computer?\n\n406\n00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.430\nWhat if I push out a scan to this\ndevice and it detects malware?\n\n407\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.710\nWell how do I know that?\n\n408\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.970\nHow do I know that the device\nitself has been infected?\n\n409\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.430\nHow do I know that maybe\nit's been quarantined,\n\n410\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.530\nmalware on it, and\nthat it's been remedied?\n\n411\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.870\nWell guess what?\n\n412\n00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.800\nYou've got the malware tab here.\n\n413\n00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.450\nAnd this is a great location\nto find absolutely nothing.\n\n414\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.250\nIf you come here and\nthis has got a laundry list,\n\n415\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.840\nyou might need to talk to that end user.\n\n416\n00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.280\nI can see the hardware that's on this\ndevice, which is really really cool.\n\n417\n00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.080\nYou can inventory all the system\ninformation on the device.\n\n418\n00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.820\nI can find out a lot of\ninformation management.\n\n419\n00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.500\nBlue tooth you can see here.\n\n420\n00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.370\nThe network.\n\n421\n00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.640\nThe drivers within it.\n\n422\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.010\nI could see any policies that\nare applying to this computer.\n\n423\n00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.220\nIf I say, okay, I've got five computers\nthat I need to be very secure,\n\n424\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.020\nbecause maybe my admins, or\nour admins are the ones using them,\n\n425\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.290\nmaybe I wanna really restrict.\n\n426\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.550\nWell, I can define policies\ndirectly to a specific device.\n\n427\n00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:38.530\nSo, very, very granular on this,\nand that's one of the things that I\n\n428\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.650\nreally like about it, is if I don't\nknow what's going on with the computer.\n\n429\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.040\nIt's got a nice heads up feature, that\nwe can locate that device, we can find\n\n430\n00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:51.790\nexactly the information in very detailed\nand verbose information there Ronnie.\n\n431\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.290\n>> Mike.\n>> Mike.\n\n432\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:52.790\n>> Sorry, Wes.\n\n433\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.640\n>> That's okay, that's okay.\n\n434\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.000\n>> Wes, along with this right,\n\n435\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.760\nwe understand it looks like great\nfeatures with Windows Intune, but\n\n436\n00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.640\nlet's go ahead and take a look\nat what ends up getting on every\n\n437\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.130\nsingle machine there,\nwhat we call that Intune Center.\n\n438\n00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.410\n>> That.\n>> Yes that's a great\n\n439\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.270\nthing to understand about,\nwhen you download or,\n\n440\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.570\nI tell you what let me show you some\nof the administration here as of now,\n\n441\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.480\nI've already downloaded\nthis ahead of time guys.\n\n442\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.350\nSo understand it's already on my machine.\n\n443\n00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:23.000\nBut if I go to for instance, if I wanna\ndo client software download here,\n\n444\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.260\nlet me get to that, navigate to that, and\nwe'll just kinda understand what that is.\n\n445\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.280\nNow this is how I get.\n\n446\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.710\nThe software that we're\nabout to talk about,\n\n447\n00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.920\nthis is how I get that software\non the machine all right.\n\n448\n00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.220\nI have to deploy this, and\nyou can do a manual deployment,\n\n449\n00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.930\nwhich is again the sneaker net local\ninstallation computer to computer.\n\n450\n00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.190\nYou can use some of your ESD methods,\n\n451\n00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.780\nelectronic software distribution\ntechnologies like group policy, and\n\n452\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.590\nyou can provision these out\nto the main devices as well.\n\n453\n00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.260\nNow I've gone ahead and I've already\ninstalled this information, and\n\n454\n00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.170\ndown here at the bottom one of the things\nthat you're gonna notice, is the fact that\n\n455\n00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.670\nthere's this little, it's kinda like\na monitor with a little toolbox on it.\n\n456\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:00.730\nThat's a Microsoft Intune Center.\n\n457\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.980\nAnd when I launch this, oh,\nnot the company portal.\n\n458\n00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.570\nWe'll talk about that in a second, here.\n\n459\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.510\nBut when I.\n\n460\n00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:11.290\n>> Let's hold on there for a second and\nsee if we can full screen this on our-\n\n461\n00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.750\n>> Yeah, there we go.\n\n462\n00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.359\nThere we go.\n[CROSSTALK] I know it's a little\n\n463\n00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.049\ndifficult to see.\n\n464\n00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:18.465\nBut down there in the bottom,\nyou've got that Microsoft Intune Center.\n\n465\n00:23:18.465 --> 00:23:21.009\nAnd if you launch that.\n\n466\n00:23:21.009 --> 00:23:24.040\n[LAUGH] It will take you to\nthis location right here.\n\n467\n00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.900\nNow, the Microsoft Intune center is\na good way that the end user themselves.\n\n468\n00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.970\nYou can call the end user,\nyou can email the end user, and say,\n\n469\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.990\nand you might not get so in-depth on this.\n\n470\n00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.690\nYou might say something like, hey,\nwe just provisioned a couple of updates,\n\n471\n00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.990\nyou need to update your machine.\n\n472\n00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.730\nYou would tell the end user, come out here\nand go ahead and choose check for updates.\n\n473\n00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.860\nIf we've provisioned applications for\nthe cloud,\n\n474\n00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.940\nand we want them to be\navailable to the user.\n\n475\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.340\nThat's where the company Poro comes in,\nand it's a way you can connect and\n\n476\n00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.280\nyou can see not only the device\nthat's link to the user, but\n\n477\n00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.660\nalso the software that might have\nbeen perversion to the user there.\n\n478\n00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.030\nSo, the Microsoft Intune center very\neasy way for the end user to have,\n\n479\n00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.680\nnot little so much control but\nsome interaction with this.\n\n480\n00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.290\nAnd here's a really good feature.\n\n481\n00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:09.320\nRemember I mentioned remote assistance if\nthe person says, well I don't know how to\n\n482\n00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.430\ndo what your asking me to do, or maybe I\ndo have a problem, they can reach out.\n\n483\n00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.530\nAnd they can say, hey, okay,\nwe can get remote assistance.\n\n484\n00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.070\nWe can use endpoint protection.\n\n485\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.930\nSo very,\n\n486\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:25.380\nvery good feature to have there when it\ncomes in to the Microsoft Intune Center.\n\n487\n00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.500\nSo, couple of really easy settings there,\nnot too difficult here.\n\n488\n00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.430\nAnd it'll give your end users a way\nthat they can interact with this,\n\n489\n00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.030\nand maybe even take some\nof the administration,\n\n490\n00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.800\nleast administrative effort\noff of your plate for you.\n\n491\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.750\n>> This is where we can see where that\nconfiguration, and that compliance,\n\n492\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.900\nis really about policies.\n\n493\n00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.150\nA lot of times, don't forget, within your\ncompany that's what is gonna be set and\n\n494\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.510\nwhat you do as an Intune administrator,\nif you're actually monitoring this for\n\n495\n00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.680\nWindows 10 computers,\n\n496\n00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.920\nis you'll set those policies again\naccording to what they tell you.\n\n497\n00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.810\nOnce that's done, that's perfectly fine,\npolicies are always great,\n\n498\n00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.260\ncuz that's what we need.\n\n499\n00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.520\nBut Intune also helps us with\nsome real-time protection.\n\n500\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.140\nWes already mentioned the idea\nthat endpoint protection,\n\n501\n00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.510\nbut there's other things that can\nalso go on there too, right, Wes?\n\n502\n00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.150\n>> That's right, for instance,\nyour endpoint protection, right,\n\n503\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:12.750\nwhen we talk about it.\n\n504\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.050\nThe endpoint protection that we have\nwith inside of Windows is known\n\n505\n00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.310\nas Windows Defender.\n\n506\n00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.500\nAnd how do I know if Windows Defender\nis actually running?\n\n507\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.560\nIt's nice to have it installed, but\nif you have something installed and\n\n508\n00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.440\nyou don't use it, well, what's the point?\n\n509\n00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.660\nWell, one of the great things\nwith the Microsoft Intune here,\n\n510\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.840\nis I can force scans.\n\n511\n00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.270\nI can force the installation\nof end point protection.\n\n512\n00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.190\nIf there's third party software\nthat somebody says, well,\n\n513\n00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.610\nI don't use what you like, I like what I\nlike, and you need a policy that says,\n\n514\n00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.700\nI don't care what you use,\nwe have a policy that says this.\n\n515\n00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.220\nI could even overwrite, and\ninstall malware protection,\n\n516\n00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.760\neven if there is Is third party and\nthey over write it.\n\n517\n00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.902\nThey can take over basically saying,\nno, we're not using that third party.\n\n518\n00:25:55.902 --> 00:25:59.010\nLet me show you how you can\ndo something like that.\n\n519\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:04.010\nNow with your end point protection, you do\nhave to make a policy for this as well and\n\n520\n00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.580\nguys, this a little\nalmost cryptic in nature.\n\n521\n00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.530\nBecause it doesn't say end\npoint in here anywhere.\n\n522\n00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:15.720\nBut what this is, it's actually an Intune\nagent setting that we have to configure.\n\n523\n00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.870\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n524\n00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.920\nwe're not gonna create the template,\ncuz we want to see these settings.\n\n525\n00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.690\nAll right and when the policy comes up,\nI might just label it simply\n\n526\n00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:29.850\nEnd Point Protection, and\nI might give a description.\n\n527\n00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:35.930\nBut notice what we have here, we have the\nEnd Point Protection Service, all right.\n\n528\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.839\nAnd this is where you can tell the Windows\nmachine,that hey you're gonna,\n\n529\n00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:44.010\nyou're gonna install End Point Protection\nand here's where we can get in here and we\n\n530\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.590\ncan say, hey, install Endpoint Protection\neven if there's third party software.\n\n531\n00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.330\nCuz I want our software that the company\nhas maybe already tested, they've\n\n532\n00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.460\napproved, it's part of a compliance\nissue and we can install it as well.\n\n533\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.540\nNow the really cool feature,\nand as we go down here.\n\n534\n00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.190\nThis is one of the ones,\nRonnie, I really like.\n\n535\n00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.209\nThis is real time protection.\n\n536\n00:27:06.698 --> 00:27:10.630\nAnd Real-time Protection, we think of it\nfrom the Windows Defender side, it's just\n\n537\n00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:17.130\nturning on Windows Defender and have it\nconstantly monitoring what's going on.\n\n538\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.670\nBut if you notice some of the activities\nthat you can do in here, notice one of\n\n539\n00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.310\nthe things that this is kind of like\nyour Real-time Protection, like an IDS.\n\n540\n00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.870\nNotice that it says behavior monitoring,\nright?\n\n541\n00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.080\nIt says monitor files and\nprograms for activity,\n\n542\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.250\nthat's one of the things our\nanti-malware software is supposed to do.\n\n543\n00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.951\nBut, I do like that fact that it can\ndo things like behavior monitoring,\n\n544\n00:27:36.951 --> 00:27:40.846\nnetwork inspection system, monitoring\nthings like your scripts as well.\n\n545\n00:27:40.846 --> 00:27:45.475\nSo, it's a good way to almost enforce like\nan intrusion detection system on your\n\n546\n00:27:45.475 --> 00:27:46.164\nmachines.\n\n547\n00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.348\nSo, very Very good thing.\n\n548\n00:27:47.348 --> 00:27:48.579\nHow about this.\n\n549\n00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:50.042\nThis I thought was really cool.\n\n550\n00:27:50.042 --> 00:27:51.677\nI really like this.\n\n551\n00:27:51.677 --> 00:27:55.590\nNotice all we are doing is scheduling\nscans but look at the scan options.\n\n552\n00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.470\nAnd it is down here at the bottom.\n\n553\n00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.140\nThis one kind of caught me off\nguard the first time I seen it.\n\n554\n00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:06.331\nI was like what a good thing to have,\nlimit the CPU usage during a scan.\n\n555\n00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:09.089\nAll right, if you notice someone\nis at their job, right, and\n\n556\n00:28:09.089 --> 00:28:11.915\nthey are sitting at their computer and\nyou want to issue a scan.\n\n557\n00:28:11.915 --> 00:28:15.587\nBut they got something that is resource\nintensive going on, maybe they are doing\n\n558\n00:28:15.587 --> 00:28:19.367\nsome video production or something like\nthat, really needs the CPU utilization.\n\n559\n00:28:19.367 --> 00:28:21.423\nI can throttle the CPU.\n\n560\n00:28:21.423 --> 00:28:23.902\nI can say, you know what,\nWindows Defender,\n\n561\n00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:28.161\nI want you to scan but I don't want you to\ntake all the CPU because that's going to\n\n562\n00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:32.570\nhinder the productivity of the person\nthat's sitting there using the computer.\n\n563\n00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.500\nThat's a really cool thing.\n\n564\n00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.390\nNow, one of the things that you\nmight have heard me mention,\n\n565\n00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.680\nis that this schedule is a scan.\n\n566\n00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.990\nWait a second here.\n\n567\n00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.940\nHow do I, maybe I know.\n\n568\n00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.380\nWhat happens if somebody calls me up and\nsays, hey my computer is going haywire.\n\n569\n00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.320\nWell, you know what I could\ndo is I could issue a policy\n\n570\n00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.310\nto scan within the next hour and then we\ncould wait for an hour for that to scan or\n\n571\n00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.440\nI've already got a policy in place, I can\nwait until this next morning at 3 AM,\n\n572\n00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.930\nwhen the policy takes place kicks in and\nthe scan starts.\n\n573\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.560\nNow let me show you something\nthat I really like.\n\n574\n00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.960\nLet's bring up our Windows Defender\non the local machine here.\n\n575\n00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:16.250\nAll right, so this is Windows Defender on\nmy local machine and one of the things\n\n576\n00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:20.260\nthat I want to show you here is that\nwe can actually schedule a scan.\n\n577\n00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.880\nSo, I'm going to go up to groups here and\nlet me go ahead and\n\n578\n00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.360\nschedule the scan first so you guys\ncan see what's going on out there.\n\n579\n00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.830\nAll right, and\nwe're going to look at our computers and\n\n580\n00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.200\nthen we're going over here to\nthe device is at the top here.\n\n581\n00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.493\nYou'll see devices and\nwe should find our CL2.\n\n582\n00:29:38.493 --> 00:29:41.917\nAll right, remember I told you you could\nview the properties of the device.\n\n583\n00:29:41.917 --> 00:29:45.017\nWell guess what you can also do.\n\n584\n00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:47.164\nYou can request a full scan.\n\n585\n00:29:47.164 --> 00:29:48.418\nYou can run a quick scan.\n\n586\n00:29:48.418 --> 00:29:51.355\nLet's send a quick scan schedule to this.\n\n587\n00:29:51.355 --> 00:29:53.422\nNotice that it says\nthe request was sent to scan.\n\n588\n00:29:53.422 --> 00:29:54.896\nNow it could take a second here.\n\n589\n00:29:54.896 --> 00:29:56.196\nI usually personally,\n\n590\n00:29:56.196 --> 00:29:59.516\nI do this a couple of times cuz\nI'd rather be safe than sorry.\n\n591\n00:29:59.516 --> 00:30:01.838\nSo let me go ahead one more time.\n\n592\n00:30:01.838 --> 00:30:05.298\nI always send out two cuz if I\nknow I want it to scan quickly.\n\n593\n00:30:05.298 --> 00:30:09.134\nAnd what it's gonna do here is\nit's gonna send the information,\n\n594\n00:30:09.134 --> 00:30:11.938\nnow first from my web browser,\nand there it is.\n\n595\n00:30:11.938 --> 00:30:13.203\nLook, it kicked right in like that.\n\n596\n00:30:13.203 --> 00:30:15.722\nAnd I didn't even turn the scan on.\n\n597\n00:30:15.722 --> 00:30:20.111\nSo it sends from my computer through\nmy browser up to the platform and\n\n598\n00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:22.197\nthen back down to the computer.\n\n599\n00:30:22.197 --> 00:30:25.030\nAnd it forces that scan to happen.\n\n600\n00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:31.350\nSo, if somebody says, hey, Ronnie, hey,\nWes, my computer's acting haywire.\n\n601\n00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.390\nWell, what did you do?\n\n602\n00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:36.200\nWell, we were looking and researching\njob applications on this website.\n\n603\n00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.850\nI downloaded some attachment,\nand now I have a problem.\n\n604\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.510\nAs an administrator,\nRonnie and I can force a scan.\n\n605\n00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:45.180\nWe don't have to wait for\nthe policy to kick in the next morning or\n\n606\n00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.530\ncreate a new policy, wait for\nit to be provisioned and\n\n607\n00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.680\nthen wait for it to deploy if\nit's just a single machine right.\n\n608\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.320\nI don't want to change all of my machines\npolicies if they're not infected and\n\n609\n00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.600\npotentially reduce the performance\nof those machines.\n\n610\n00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.560\nIf it's only one machine you come in here\nto the properties of that single machine\n\n611\n00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.480\nand then what you can do is push\nout the scan just like we did.\n\n612\n00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.780\nSo I really like this feature,\n\n613\n00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.410\nthe fact that you're not even\nsitting near the computer and\n\n614\n00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:12.400\nyou can force the scan whether\nthe person's done it themselves or not.\n\n615\n00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.530\n>> The other that in tune really helps\nus out with is the very fact that\n\n616\n00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.160\nwell devices get lost very quickly.\n\n617\n00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.136\nAnd if we're actually using these devices\nthat can get lost like the smartphones and\n\n618\n00:31:21.136 --> 00:31:24.272\neven laptops were just sitting out\nthere at a public restaurant and\n\n619\n00:31:24.272 --> 00:31:25.000\nwe forget it and\n\n620\n00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.869\nall of a sudden the device disappears the\nproblem of course is we lost that device.\n\n621\n00:31:28.869 --> 00:31:32.126\nWhich is bad enough but\nwhat can be even worse especially for\n\n622\n00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:36.182\na company is that we have proprietary\ninformation on that laptop as well.\n\n623\n00:31:36.182 --> 00:31:39.570\nAnd so, Wes,\nhow does Window's Intune help us here?\n\n624\n00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.316\n>> Yeah that's great.\n\n625\n00:31:40.316 --> 00:31:43.412\nYou don't want that\nsensitive patent research or\n\n626\n00:31:43.412 --> 00:31:46.885\nthat Martha Stewart recipe\n[LAUGH] no just kidding guys.\n\n627\n00:31:46.885 --> 00:31:50.900\nBut one of the things that you can do here\nwith the business data removal is the same\n\n628\n00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.274\nway that we just set a scan?\n\n629\n00:31:52.274 --> 00:31:52.942\nGuess what,\n\n630\n00:31:52.942 --> 00:31:56.905\nif we go back to our device itself,\nit's just another one of the properties.\n\n631\n00:31:56.905 --> 00:31:59.564\nNow I do wanna mention this\noption of retire and wipe.\n\n632\n00:31:59.564 --> 00:32:00.551\nOkay.\n\n633\n00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:03.593\nWhen, and Ronnie,\nyou've seen this as well too.\n\n634\n00:32:03.593 --> 00:32:09.118\nWhen Microsoft Intune software, get's\nit's hands into the device, if I go and\n\n635\n00:32:09.118 --> 00:32:14.807\ndelete the Microsoft Intune center because\nI don't want it to be a part of the Intune\n\n636\n00:32:14.807 --> 00:32:20.170\nplatform, and I don't mean maliciously but\neven if I'm the administrator,\n\n637\n00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.664\nit is a nightmare to get whatever\nis left behind out of the system.\n\n638\n00:32:24.664 --> 00:32:27.043\nSo when you do have one of these devices.\n\n639\n00:32:27.043 --> 00:32:30.583\nThat five fingered discount,\nsomebody steals, leaves it at a rest stop,\n\n640\n00:32:30.583 --> 00:32:34.252\nleaves it at a restaurant, and\nit's got that information that's in there.\n\n641\n00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:38.930\nYou need to retire it, and when you\nretire it it's gonna remove the software.\n\n642\n00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:43.923\nBut even more so,\nyou can do a full eradication of the data.\n\n643\n00:32:43.923 --> 00:32:46.605\nThis starts with data classification.\n\n644\n00:32:46.605 --> 00:32:51.591\nThe Microsoft Intune platform,\njust like other products like SDCM\n\n645\n00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:56.138\ncan look at the device and\nit can say okay, this was that patent\n\n646\n00:32:56.138 --> 00:33:01.662\ndocumentation that we were working on but\nthis is the photos on the device.\n\n647\n00:33:01.662 --> 00:33:05.567\nIn the photos well, we don't want to touch\nmay be the photos of that device you know,\n\n648\n00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:09.530\nthe end user that's using the device so\nthat's were selective wipe could come in.\n\n649\n00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:14.140\nBut like Ronnie said if that device\nis completely lost at that point,\n\n650\n00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.250\nwe don't even care about the user data and\n\n651\n00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.130\nthe user might I also say no I need\nyou to get that information off there.\n\n652\n00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.790\nAnd then it's a full data eradication.\n\n653\n00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:26.580\nWe don't have to worry about that\ninformation getting into the wrong hands,\n\n654\n00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.690\nand hopefully the device completely\nwipes all the information and\n\n655\n00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.530\nnow hopefully we're safe.\n\n656\n00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.280\n>> So Microsoft Intune is really\nan incredible management console for us,\n\n657\n00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.967\nthat we actually just pay a subscription\nfor and then we can manage all of\n\n658\n00:33:38.967 --> 00:33:42.347\nour devices regardless of whether\ntheir inside our enterprise or\n\n659\n00:33:42.347 --> 00:33:45.872\nwhether we actually are bringing in\nour own devices into it as well.\n\n660\n00:33:45.872 --> 00:33:49.382\nAnd then of course other devices that may\nbe outside of the scope where we can reach\n\n661\n00:33:49.382 --> 00:33:51.305\nthem with things like\ngroup policy as well.\n\n662\n00:33:51.305 --> 00:33:54.486\nAnd so it gives us a nice\ncentralized way to be able to do so.\n\n663\n00:33:54.486 --> 00:33:57.572\nBy installing a little agent on\nevery device that we can come into,\n\n664\n00:33:57.572 --> 00:34:01.485\nespecially things like Windows 10 and\nthat's really what we're focusing in on,\n\n665\n00:34:01.485 --> 00:34:02.490\nis that it will help.\n\n666\n00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.190\nBecause as Windows 10 becomes more and\nmore popular and\n\n667\n00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:10.280\nthey come out with more devices like\nthe Surface pro and of course on laptop.\n\n668\n00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.350\nWe want to have that ability of\ncourse to be on to maintain them,\n\n669\n00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:17.550\nto build or monitor them, do everything\nbut without actually having to run into\n\n670\n00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.840\nold legacy management systems\nthat may not run into Windows 10.\n\n671\n00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.250\nMicrosoft Intune gives us that ability\nto manage not only in Windows 10 but\n\n672\n00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.340\nalso multiple devices as well.\n\n673\n00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.730\nIt's a great project that helps us\nwith the security of Windows 10.\n\n674\n00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:31.740\n>> It sure is.\nYes, it sure is.\n\n675\n00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:35.640\n>> So Wes, any last words here on Windows\n10 security, especially with Intune?\n\n676\n00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.130\nAnything you wanna point out?\n\n677\n00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.530\n>> No,\nI think you really covered all of it.\n\n678\n00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.220\nSubscription based service, just make sure\nyou can figure those policies right and\n\n679\n00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.020\nalso make sure that you follow up\non your configurations to ensure\n\n680\n00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.310\nthat they're doing what you want and\nyou should be good.\n\n681\n00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:51.120\n>> Right, and so if you don't really\nhave experience with it, don't forget,\n\n682\n00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.770\na lot of times you can go and\nsee on the Microsoft side itself.\n\n683\n00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.320\nYou can probably open up a test\naccount that will allow you to do so.\n\n684\n00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.680\nThe key, though, is before the ending that\ntest date, make sure you also remove or\n\n685\n00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.660\nretire that install as well, or\n\n686\n00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:08.850\nyou're gonna find some problems trying to\nremove that Intune console center as well.\n\n687\n00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.560\nSo just kinda remember that, too.\n\n688\n00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.160\nAll right, so that's a great place, Wes,\nfor us to go ahead and end this up.\n\n689\n00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.995\nSo appreciate all the demos that you did.\n\n690\n00:35:14.995 --> 00:35:16.849\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It's a great job as far as\n\n691\n00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:21.083\nunderstanding this and helping us along as\nwe start to see some of the different ways\n\n692\n00:35:21.083 --> 00:35:23.275\nwe can provide security for Windows 10.\n\n693\n00:35:23.275 --> 00:35:26.674\nSo signing off for ITPRO TV,\nI'm Ronnie Wong and I'm Wes Bryan and\n\n694\n00:35:26.674 --> 00:35:28.018\nwe'll see you next

00:00:20.338\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're talking about Windows 10 security,\n\n4\n00:00:20.338 --> 00:00:24.314\nspecifically taking about well\nsecurity from the command line and\n\n5\n00:00:24.314 --> 00:00:28.088\nWes Bryan is our resident expert\nright now helping us out here.\n\n6\n00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:30.529\nWes, what are we actually going to\nlook at from the command line here.\n\n7\n00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.937\nYou know in this episode we talked, or\n\n8\n00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:35.250\nin this series I could say that we've\ntalked about quite a few different things.\n\n9\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.550\nSome of the things that we've mentioned\nhave been managing permissions,\n\n10\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.160\nwe've talked about the firewall, we've\ntalked about Windows Defender as well.\n\n11\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.640\nSo, if you haven't seen some of these\nconcepts, we all want you to go back and\n\n12\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.100\ntake a look at them, but\none of the things we haven't mentioned\n\n13\n00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.930\nis how to manage some of those\nconcepts right in the command prompt.\n\n14\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.130\nSo that's what we're gonna look at today,\nand\n\n15\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.110\none of the first things that we're\ngonna talk about is how you can manage\n\n16\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.180\npermissions inside of the command prompt.\n\n17\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.870\nNow, we're not gonna get the graphical\nuser interface like we've seen in some\n\n18\n00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.220\nof the earlier episodes so when you get\ninto this don't let it intimidate you.\n\n19\n00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.030\nWhen you first see some of the commands\nthey might be a little daunting but\n\n20\n00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.090\nonce you know kinda what's going on here,\nthey can be a little bit easier.\n\n21\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.080\nSo let's go ahead and\nlook at some of the things that you can do\n\n22\n00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.190\nto manage your permissions here on\nthe Windows machine in the Command Prompt.\n\n23\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.910\nSo one of the first things I'm going\nto do is I'm going to go ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.350\ndrop back to c: here and I want to show\nyou that when you are viewing permissions\n\n25\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.630\non a file or on a folder you can\nuse the fully qualified path or\n\n26\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.860\nyou can use the relative path,\neither one works.\n\n27\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.290\nOne of the commands we use\nis known as icacls and\n\n28\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.320\nit's the integrity controller\naccess control list system.\n\n29\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.790\nAnd what we're gonna do here is we'll just\n\n30\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.710\nlook at a folder that I have on\nmy desktop, so we'll go ahead,\n\n31\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.860\nwe'll navigate to that and we're gonna\nlook at this folder called test.\n\n32\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.000\nNow, I can look at the folder itself,\nright?\n\n33\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.660\nAnd I can see some information here, I can\nsee that it's object inheritance, if it's\n\n34\n00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.620\ncontator inheritance, and it just tells me\nI only see these designators on folders,\n\n35\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.020\nbecause it tells me About things\nlike permission inheritance.\n\n36\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.330\nNow, notice that's on the folder.\n\n37\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.990\nWell, I could go even farther if I know,\n\n38\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.160\nat which I do by the way\ncuz I've created it.\n\n39\n00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.030\nIf I know that I have files\ninside of this folder and\n\n40\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.410\nI wanna look at the permission\nset on the files themselves.\n\n41\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.510\nWell, I could do that too.\n\n42\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.930\nI can just put an asterisk here for a wild\ncard and what it does is it outputs and\n\n43\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.830\nit lets me know that first you can\nsee here, NT authority up here.\n\n44\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.160\nNotice the I right there, it lets me know\nthat that's actually a permission that's\n\n45\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.210\nbeing inherited for another location,\nmore specifically the authority here,\n\n46\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.840\nthe system if you will is inheriting\na full control permission.\n\n47\n00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.630\nBut I want you to notice that I do\nsee some other permissions here.\n\n48\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.220\nRight?\nI see a user here that has the read and\n\n49\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.250\nexecute permission here on\nthis file of this folder.\n\n50\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.610\nNow, that's the fully qualified path.\n\n51\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.700\nWe can change this up a little bit and we\ncan get a little bit closer to where that\n\n52\n00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.360\nfile resides in your folder hierarchy.\n\n53\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.800\nSo, let me go ahead and show you that too.\n\n54\n00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.730\nSo, if we get to my desktop, here.\n\n55\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.420\nAll right.\n\n56\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.450\nAnd we, so now this folder is\nin the desktop directory here.\n\n57\n00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.366\nSince I'm already here,\nI can rerun that command and\n\n58\n00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:18.570\nI can do icacls here but\nthis time I can just type test and\n\n59\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.870\nI can do the wild card there and\nit does the same thing.\n\n60\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.160\nSo Ronnie, pretty easy.\n\n61\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.038\nIf you want to type out the,\nfull path here you can do that.\n\n62\n00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:30.110\nAnd you can see here that it's\nprocessing information the processing of\n\n63\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.370\nthe information is returning the output,\nprint the output back to the screen and\n\n64\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.210\nshow me the different\npermissions that I have here.\n\n65\n00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.820\nSo I can just view these\npermissions if I want.\n\n66\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.350\nAnd fairly easy once you\nknow the commands here and\n\n67\n00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.060\nsome of the output here but it can show\nme the full control permission and\n\n68\n00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.890\nI can see the identities that\nare on this computer and\n\n69\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.600\nthe level of access they have all\nright here from the command prompt.\n\n70\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.090\n>> Wes if I'm not super familiar with the\ncommand prompt, being able to use this and\n\n71\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.010\nI understand that I can\nset permission with it.\n\n72\n00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.630\nBut what we're essentially seeing is the\nsame thing that we will normally see if\n\n73\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.950\nI were to right click on a file through\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n74\n00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.990\ngot on to properties,\n>> Yeah.\n\n75\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.520\n>> And select that security tab?\n\n76\n00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.220\n>> Absolutely.\n\n77\n00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.430\n>> Okay just want to make sure,\n>> I tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n78\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.100\ndo what Ronnie is talking about, so\nI'll go to back up to the desktop and\n\n79\n00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.770\nyou'll see this test directory And\nI know that's a little hard to see, so\n\n80\n00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.810\nif I zoom in here,\nthere is that test folder that I have.\n\n81\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.390\nIf I open this up I can\ndo exactly what he said.\n\n82\n00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.730\nI can see all of this through the GUI.\n\n83\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.510\nNow remember, one of those\nsecurity principles those users,\n\n84\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.830\nBilly had Read and Execute.\n\n85\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.450\nIf I check off, i can see that he's\nactually got a special permission here but\n\n86\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.630\nhe has the ability to read and execute.\n\n87\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.010\nIf I look at the system,\nnotice that the system has full control.\n\n88\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.020\nWell if I jump back over to\nthe command line I can see,\n\n89\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.810\nwell here's the system and\nnotice the system inherited full control,\n\n90\n00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.740\nthe built in administrators have full\ncontrol, and here's another thing,\n\n91\n00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.650\nsince I'm the owner of this object here,\nI also have full control.\n\n92\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.210\nSo fairly easy,\n\n93\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.370\nand you can verify this if you need to\ninside of the graphical user interface.\n\n94\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.830\nNow you might say, well wait a minute,\n\n95\n00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.276\nwhy would I want to even use\nthis if we have the GUI?\n\n96\n00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.285\nWell guess what, I mean if you look at\nthings like certain server deployments\n\n97\n00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:14.293\ndon't even give you\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n98\n00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:18.000\nSo if you need to set a permission on\nanything that's in a server that doesn't\n\n99\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.990\nhave the graphical user interface,\nwell how would you set that permission?\n\n100\n00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.720\nWell again, this is, relatively easy too.\n\n101\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.630\nSo let me go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.070\nlet's verify the permissions on\nthe test directory itself, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.700\nNow, I can see Billy has,\nBilly's a user on this computer.\n\n104\n00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.140\nI can see Billy has read level access.\n\n105\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.720\nWell guess what?\n\n106\n00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.420\nIf I don't want that to be there,\nI can always remove it, right?\n\n107\n00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.920\nI can do an icacls here, and\nI can name the directory.\n\n108\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.270\nAll right, and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.990\nat first, what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna remove that permission.\n\n110\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.670\nAnd first of all, you can go even further.\n\n111\n00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.830\nFor instance, I can remove Billy all\nthe way from this list all together.\n\n112\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.090\nAnd if I rerun that,\nyou're gonna notice Billy's not there.\n\n113\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.970\nAll right well that sets me up for\nactually setting Billy's permission.\n\n114\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.040\nIf I wanted to it'd be just as easy as\ngoing icacls was here test space forward\n\n115\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.110\nslash then you type grant and\nyou would name the identity there right?\n\n116\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.070\nSo this is Billy and I'm gonna do a colon\nhere and what I'm gonna do is the r.\n\n117\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.950\nThe read only permission.\n\n118\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.400\nAnd when I set that, notice that it says,\n1 files processed, right?\n\n119\n00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.830\nAnd if I rerun this,\njust to see what's going on here,\n\n120\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.750\nI can see sure enough Billy's\nright back there in the folder.\n\n121\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.470\nHe's got the read level permission.\n\n122\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.830\nWell that's on the folder.\n\n123\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.260\nWhat about the file?\n\n124\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.710\nCan we set these on files as well?\n\n125\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.300\nWell there again you can\ngo to the relative path or\n\n126\n00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.730\nyou can do the fully qualified path.\n\n127\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.720\nI can't type to save my life so\n\n128\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.800\nI think I'm gonna do I'm gonna do\nonce that's a little bit easier.\n\n129\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.920\nNotice that I'm still\nrunning the same command.\n\n130\n00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.120\nIcacls test and look at that back\nslash out there All right if I decide\n\n131\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.970\nthat I want to maybe set a permission\non a specific file right,\n\n132\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.590\nfirst of all let me, I tell you what,\n\n133\n00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.990\nlet's figure out what file it is\nthat I want to set permissions here.\n\n134\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.030\nSo we got sales figures and you notice\nBilly is not on the list right here.\n\n135\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.590\nWell if I want, I can turn around and\n\n136\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.820\nI can say icacls and\nI can say test and name the file.\n\n137\n00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.420\nIn this case it's gonna\nbe the sales figure.\n\n138\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.880\nAll right don't forget your quotes on this\nand I'm gonna do a forward slash grant\n\n139\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.980\nand we'll add Billy and we'll do\nthe read the read permission here.\n\n140\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.690\nAnd you can see right here it says\none is successfully processed.\n\n141\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.740\nSo now not only have I set\nthe permission on the folder but\n\n142\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.780\nI've also set the permission on the file.\n\n143\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.010\nLet's verify that.\n\n144\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.380\nAll right, if I go back here and\nlook at this file,\n\n145\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.710\nI can now see,\nwell Billy has got the read permission.\n\n146\n00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.390\nWhat if I wanted to give Billy\nmore permissions than that?\n\n147\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.070\nWell I can also set things like the read\nand execute permission if this file\n\n148\n00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.030\nhappens to be an application that\nI want him to be able to run,\n\n149\n00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.760\nI can set that here as well.\n\n150\n00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.160\nAnd it's just as easy as granting Billy\nnow the RX permission, read and execute.\n\n151\n00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.578\nAnd you'll notice here that now\nthat I've set the read and execute,\n\n152\n00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:01.710\ntells me 1 file has processed.\n\n153\n00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.010\nAnd if I rerun this to kind of figure out,\nwell what level does Billy have?\n\n154\n00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.714\nI can see now Billy's got things like for\ninstance the read and\n\n155\n00:08:09.714 --> 00:08:10.966\nexecution permission set.\n\n156\n00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:16.588\nAll right, so icacls is a way\nthat you can set, you can view,\n\n157\n00:08:16.588 --> 00:08:20.900\nand you can confirm what\nthe permissions are.\n\n158\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.258\nIf I want to turn around and maybe\nconfirm that on the marketing document,\n\n159\n00:08:25.258 --> 00:08:27.380\nthe read execute command is there.\n\n160\n00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.041\nOr not commands, excuse me, but\nthe permission is there, set for Billy,\n\n161\n00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:33.560\nwell I can turn around and\nI can view that as well.\n\n162\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.507\nI can do an iscacl, I could just\nleave it test for the folder, or\n\n163\n00:08:36.507 --> 00:08:37.521\nI could do an iscacl.\n\n164\n00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:43.778\nIn this case we're gonna do marketing,\nand we'll do the .txt here.\n\n165\n00:08:43.778 --> 00:08:44.462\nIs that a txt?\n\n166\n00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:47.620\nI think that's a Microsoft Word document.\n\n167\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.702\nMake sure that you spell the document\ncorrectly or its not gonna work, .docx.\n\n168\n00:08:51.702 --> 00:08:54.280\nAnd its not finding that file.\n\n169\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.157\nLet me go ahead,\nyou can do this a little bit.\n\n170\n00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:00.630\nWe'll navigate down into that directory.\n\n171\n00:09:03.936 --> 00:09:07.184\nAnd do a dir, make sure I've got.\n\n172\n00:09:07.184 --> 00:09:09.435\nThat's what it is.\nI didn't spell it right.\n\n173\n00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:11.300\nYou gotta spell your file right.\n\n174\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.178\nAnd remember your quotes are gonna be\nimportant there because I don't learn my\n\n175\n00:09:14.178 --> 00:09:16.020\nlesson and\nI keep spaces in some of the file names.\n\n176\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.469\nAnd that can present a problem here\nwhen you run the command prompt.\n\n177\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.690\nAnd, it doesn't like the .docx.\n\n178\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.650\nWhat is going on here?\n\n179\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.144\nLet's make sure,\ngot that right marketing doc.\n\n180\n00:09:29.144 --> 00:09:32.580\nAgain, name the file right.\n\n181\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.010\nAnd it doesn't seem to like that.\n\n182\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.600\nYou know what?\n\n183\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.981\nI don't need to put test in there,\nthat's the problem.\n\n184\n00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:41.866\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the one big,\n\n185\n00:09:41.866 --> 00:09:43.730\nwe're already speaking of relative, right?\n\n186\n00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.610\nWe're already in the test directory.\n\n187\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.620\nSo what it's saying is it says look and\ntest for test.\n\n188\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.058\nAnd I think you'll see here\nthat if I type it right,\n\n189\n00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:54.974\nfirst of all type the name right, and then\nif you're already in that directory you\n\n190\n00:09:54.974 --> 00:09:57.270\ndon't need to specify\nthe directory any more.\n\n191\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.041\nAnd what I can see here,\nis I can verify that yes, Billy,\n\n192\n00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:06.585\nif this happen to be an executable, that\nhe does have the read and execute command.\n\n193\n00:10:06.585 --> 00:10:08.380\nOr, I keep saying command but permissions.\n\n194\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.920\nBut, let's go ahead and let's jump\nback over like Ronnie was saying.\n\n195\n00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.741\nLet's jump back over to the GUI.\n\n196\n00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:18.137\nAnd let's show the permissions that\nthey are set on that test folder or\n\n197\n00:10:18.137 --> 00:10:22.069\nmore correctly the actual\nMarketing Documents and\n\n198\n00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:25.919\nlet's kinda rifle in here and\nsee what Billy has.\n\n199\n00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:28.000\nNow, Ronnie, if you'll take a look here,\n\n200\n00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.390\nyou'll see that from the GUI like\nyou were mentioning earlier.\n\n201\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.879\nI can see that yes,\nread and execute is set.\n\n202\n00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:35.428\nSo this would be helpful, like I said,\n\n203\n00:10:35.428 --> 00:10:39.992\nin a situation where maybe you have for\ninstance you're connecting to\n\n204\n00:10:39.992 --> 00:10:43.960\na machine that doesn't have\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n205\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.280\nOr as we've talked about I could manually\nset all these permissions, right?\n\n206\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.855\nOne by one by one by one but\n\n207\n00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:51.310\nthat administrative complexity\nis just a nightmare.\n\n208\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.420\nBut I can also run things like scripts,\nright?\n\n209\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.226\nAnd that's one of the good things about\ndoing this in CLIs that you could\n\n210\n00:10:58.226 --> 00:11:00.200\npotentially automate the process.\n\n211\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.740\nNow what if I want to remove an end\nuser from the access control list.\n\n212\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.730\nWhich is really what we're looking\nat here, we're looking ACLs.\n\n213\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.400\nIf I wanna remove let's say maybe\neven a permission, lets start there.\n\n214\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.095\nWe won't go so invasive,\npick on Billy too much here.\n\n215\n00:11:17.095 --> 00:11:19.847\nSo notice that I have this grant option,\nright?\n\n216\n00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:24.160\nWell, I can remove Billy all\ntogether if I want, right?\n\n217\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.566\nI can remove him completely from\nthe access control list just\n\n218\n00:11:27.566 --> 00:11:32.200\nby, Same thing here.\n\n219\n00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.495\nI can remove him from\nthe folder's permissions and\n\n220\n00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:38.260\nmake sure that you name\nthe user there too.\n\n221\n00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.680\nThat's gonna help.\n\n222\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.555\nAll right, and if we look at it again,\n\n223\n00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:47.440\nlet's see if old Billy is gone there.\n\n224\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.551\nAnd again, if you're in the test\ndirectory you don't really need to\n\n225\n00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:58.700\nmention that you're in the test directory.\n\n226\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.600\nNow, it looks like Billy,\nBilly was removed.\n\n227\n00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.310\nWe're gonna remove him from the folder,\nhere.\n\n228\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.670\nSo, let's go head and do that.\n\n229\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.550\nLet's go cd.., we'll try to\nget these commands right here.\n\n230\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.460\nAnd we're gonna rerun that.\n\n231\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.573\nBut this time i'm gonna remove\nBilly from the folder itself.\n\n232\n00:12:17.573 --> 00:12:20.093\nSo, notice the file's been processed, and\n\n233\n00:12:20.093 --> 00:12:24.120\nwhat we've said is Billy we don't\nwant you to be this folder anymore.\n\n234\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.070\nThen we can rerun this,\n\n235\n00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.630\nand again now that i'm in test I\ncould run the asterisk symbol.\n\n236\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.540\nOne of the things that I was doing wrong\nwas I was already in the test directory.\n\n237\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.390\nSo you can't turn around and\ninclude it in the list again.\n\n238\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.840\nAnd, There we go,\nthat's what I wanted to see.\n\n239\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.380\nNotice that Billy is no\nlonger in this list.\n\n240\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.840\nHe doesn't have access to the folder.\n\n241\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.760\nWe can do this on a file by file\nbasis too if we want, right?\n\n242\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.520\nAnd this is going to be whatever\nthe file is that maybe you\n\n243\n00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.000\nwanna remove somebody from.\n\n244\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.584\nI'm gonna use the tab\nfunctionality here and\n\n245\n00:12:54.584 --> 00:12:58.340\nmake a little bit easier as you've\nseen Wes' typing abilities.\n\n246\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:04.070\nTell you what, we'll go ahead and\nnavigate back in the test directory.\n\n247\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:11.090\nAll right, we've got our marketing\ndocument there you can see.\n\n248\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:15.896\nAnd what we're gonna do is remove\nBilly from having any access to\n\n249\n00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:18.750\neven the marketing documents there.\n\n250\n00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.770\nSo, we're gonna rename this\njust a little bit, here.\n\n251\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.131\nAnd we're gonna call\nthat Marketing Docs and\n\n252\n00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:30.930\nwe're gonna say remove and\nwe'll type Billy here.\n\n253\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.802\nAnd notice that it processed\nthat information and\n\n254\n00:13:34.802 --> 00:13:39.332\nif I turn around and\nI just look at the access control list.\n\n255\n00:13:39.332 --> 00:13:44.390\nNotice there, Ronnie, in the marketing\ndocuments, Billy's no longer in the list.\n\n256\n00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.500\nHe was on top of the list, now he's gone.\n\n257\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.440\nSo you have the ability, again,\nconfirming that the permissions are there.\n\n258\n00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.110\nAnd you can confirm this in the GUI.\n\n259\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.170\nRemember, we had that read and\nexecute permission set.\n\n260\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.922\nLet's navigate back over and\n\n261\n00:13:57.922 --> 00:14:02.840\nsee if that truly did what we wanted it to\ndo inside of the graphical user interface.\n\n262\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.632\nAnd I'll zoom in a little bit, guys,\n\n263\n00:14:04.632 --> 00:14:07.210\nand make it a little bit easier for\nyou to see out there.\n\n264\n00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.150\nI know it's kinda hard to see right now.\n\n265\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.590\nWell, first thing we can notice right\naway is that Billy's no longer the ACL.\n\n266\n00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.230\nBilly's gone, so we've removed him.\n\n267\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.420\nNotice that you can manage\nthe permissions, and really,\n\n268\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.740\njust about every aspect of\nthe permissions that you have.\n\n269\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.500\nNow, the other thing I'd like to show\nyou here, too is let's say that in the,\n\n270\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.990\nI tell you what,\nlet's not cheat, all right.\n\n271\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.990\nLet's stay out of the GUI.\n\n272\n00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.860\nI'm gonna add Billy back, all right?\n\n273\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.620\nI'm gonna add Billy and\nwe'll do a Marketing here Docs.\n\n274\n00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:41.517\nWe'll do grant and\nwe'll type Billy's name back in here.\n\n275\n00:14:41.517 --> 00:14:45.895\nAnd we'll give him the read permission\nbecause what I'd like to show you\n\n276\n00:14:45.895 --> 00:14:47.270\nis a deny, all right?\n\n277\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.422\nYou can deny permissions as well,\nbut you have to be careful and\n\n278\n00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.158\nI wanna show you this, all right.\n\n279\n00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:55.890\nSo notice Billy's back in the list and\nhe's got the read permission.\n\n280\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.047\nI wanna jump back to the GUI all right,\n\n281\n00:14:58.047 --> 00:15:02.574\ncuz one of the things that the GUI does a\nlot of times is that it gives us warnings.\n\n282\n00:15:02.574 --> 00:15:07.240\nIt says be careful, you're about to do\nthis, you might destroy your computer.\n\n283\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.337\nIt needs to say that to me a lot more, and\n\n284\n00:15:09.337 --> 00:15:12.589\nI probably wouldn't have to\nreinstall stuff quite as much.\n\n285\n00:15:12.589 --> 00:15:16.610\nLet me get into the documents here.\n\n286\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.204\nAnd if we right click and we choose\nproperties, and I get to the security tab,\n\n287\n00:15:20.204 --> 00:15:20.990\nI can see Billy.\n\n288\n00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.010\nNotice here Ronnie, right?\n\n289\n00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.364\nBilly's got the Read Allow.\n\n290\n00:15:25.364 --> 00:15:26.060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.057\n>> Watch what happens when I\ndecide to edit that, right.\n\n292\n00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:29.915\nI'm gonna say Read, but\n\n293\n00:15:29.915 --> 00:15:34.970\nthis time I'm gonna do what we say\nbe very careful in doing, right?\n\n294\n00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.640\nI'm gonna deny Billy the access, the Read\npermission and notice what happens.\n\n295\n00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.960\nWhen I apply this, we get the warning\nIt says be careful with the denies.\n\n296\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.460\nAs you've seen in other classes,\nin other courses that we've talked about,\n\n297\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.390\ngotta be careful with the denies,\nit trumps everything.\n\n298\n00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.896\nBut what I want to focus on is the fact\nthat it warns us, it tells us,\n\n299\n00:15:52.896 --> 00:15:54.600\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n300\n00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.862\nWell, we're not going to set that.\n\n301\n00:15:56.862 --> 00:15:58.120\nI'm gonna choose cancel,\nand there is a reason.\n\n302\n00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.472\nBecause I want you to see,\nwell something that you don't\n\n303\n00:16:02.472 --> 00:16:06.380\nsee inside of setting this with All right.\n\n304\n00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.810\nSo, if I do a deny, here.\n\n305\n00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.170\nNotice I deny, right?\n\n306\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.430\nAnd I do deny Billy read.\n\n307\n00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.370\nAll right?\nAnd I set that.\n\n308\n00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.360\nNotice a process.\n\n309\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.550\nIt's been processed.\n\n310\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.050\nThe file's.\n\n311\n00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.020\nDone.\n\n312\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.300\nBut it didn't give me a warning and that's\nsomething you do have to be careful.\n\n313\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.470\nAll right remember denies trump everything\nso if I do a deny inside of the graphical\n\n314\n00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.540\nuser interface it says\nhold on a second now.\n\n315\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.780\nYou're about to cross the streams.\n\n316\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.730\nTotal platonic reversal.\n\n317\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.670\nBut here it doesn't warn me.\n\n318\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.170\nAnd we've seen that before like Rodney\nRight with things like the registry editor\n\n319\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:47.330\nwhere you make a change it's instantaneous\nit doesn't warn you Well this is one of\n\n320\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.620\nthe things that you could get yourself\ninto trouble so just be very,\n\n321\n00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.990\nvery careful with that.\n\n322\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.750\n>> All right.\nSo, we can see\n\n323\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:59.000\nwhere we can set basic permissions in the\nway that we also can do in the gooey, but\n\n324\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.680\nwe do it all from the command line.\n\n325\n00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.070\nWes has also emphasized the time that you\nand I would actually end up doing this,\n\n326\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:07.030\nis that we need to descript this out so\nthat somebody else could run them,\n\n327\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.150\nIf they don't know how to get\naround in the GUI as well.\n\n328\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.010\nSo, there's other things that we\ncan also do from the command line\n\n329\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.680\nthat helps us out.\n\n330\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.860\nAnd we're going to talk about the idea\nof backing up the permissions?\n\n331\n00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.570\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n332\n00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.570\nSo, imagine a scenario where\nI've set the read permission.\n\n333\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.960\nAnd Ronnie and I, as administrators\nwe've set the read permission,\n\n334\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.550\nwe know what the read permission is but\nwe've delegated maybe the ability for\n\n335\n00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:33.250\nsomebody else to set permissions and\nthey come in here and they make a mistake.\n\n336\n00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.220\nWell, maybe I've got hundreds of users and\nthey've made a mistake that's inherited,\n\n337\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.370\nit's gone all over the place and\nwe can't figure out what's going on.\n\n338\n00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.490\nSo, do we have a way that we can\n\n339\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.410\nbackup all the ACLs in a state\nthat Ronnie and I have them?\n\n340\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.500\nSo, that if somebody does makes\na configuration we can revert him\n\n341\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.980\nback to the original state\nthat they were before.\n\n342\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.430\nAll right so,\nthat's something that we've had to do,\n\n343\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.350\nnow what I did in the background is I went\nahead and removed Billy, I put him back\n\n344\n00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.650\nin the list as the read only, and we can\nverify that here real quick, we'll verify\n\n345\n00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:09.210\nthat Billy's back there right, so\nthat's the settings is it running I want?\n\n346\n00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.790\nThat's what we want.\n\n347\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.160\nThat's what we want to happen.\n\n348\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.930\nNow, can I back that information up?\n\n349\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:14.850\nWell, yes I can.\n\n350\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.000\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nI'll back that acl up but\n\n351\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.760\nI'll back it up to my desktop all right?\n\n352\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.120\nSo, what we're gonna do all right is and\nwe're gonna go a little bit farther than\n\n353\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.990\nthis you know you might want to\nback up all the permissions.\n\n354\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.350\nMaybe just not the marketing documents.\n\n355\n00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.970\nSo, let me go ahead real quick and\nnavigate real Quick back to the desktop.\n\n356\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.780\nCuz maybe I wanna back up\neverything in the test folder.\n\n357\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.170\nNot just document by document,\n\n358\n00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.150\ncuz that's really gonna be more\nof an administrative complexity.\n\n359\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.000\nSo, what I can do here is I\ncan go ahead and tell icacls,\n\n360\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.700\nall right, what are we working with?\n\n361\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.700\nWell, we're working with test, all right,\nand its relative path here, so\n\n362\n00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.340\nI'm doing a wild card.\n\n363\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.030\nAll right.\n\n364\n00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:56.710\nAnd then from here, I'm gonna type a /save\nand then I'm gonna navigate to the or\n\n365\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.150\ntell it where I want to save\nthat access control list.\n\n366\n00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.691\nSo for us,\nit's gonna be back on my desktop.\n\n367\n00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:14.365\nAll right and I'm gonna say go ahead\nsave it right to the desktop and\n\n368\n00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:17.320\nI'm gonna call this file just acl backup.\n\n369\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.110\nNow, the name of the file is arbitrary but\n\n370\n00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.020\nyour naming convention\nbe able to identify it.\n\n371\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.840\nIf it just says file it might not\ntell you what it's actually doing.\n\n372\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.660\nIf I was to run this command\nright now It wouldn't work\n\n373\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.120\nbecause I'm challenging\nmy typing abilities.\n\n374\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.660\nYou have to make sure that\nif your going to output\n\n375\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.250\nthe ACL that the path is correct here.\n\n376\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.020\nWhen we run this your going to see that it\nsays hey three files were processed and\n\n377\n00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.020\nwhat it did is it backed up the ACL's to\nevery one of the files within this folder.\n\n378\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.064\nNow, if we were to come in here and\n\n379\n00:19:44.064 --> 00:19:47.790\nlet's say mis-configure permissions wrong,\nAll right.\n\n380\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.610\nInstead of granting Billy\nthe read permission, right, well,\n\n381\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.180\nwe don't get warnings here and\nmaybe somebody is doing a deny.\n\n382\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:59.120\nIf I was to do this, you do have to make\n\n383\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.470\nsure you that you have the full qualified\npath if you're not in that location.\n\n384\n00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.370\nLets see if that works.\n\n385\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.980\nWorks.\n\n386\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.060\nThere we go.\n\n387\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.620\nSo, I can see that we've got\na deny permission going on here.\n\n388\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.400\nAnd again, let's just verify that fact so\n\n389\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.310\nyou guys can see this cuz again I\nwant you to see what's going on here.\n\n390\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.890\nLet's go ahead and do test.\n\n391\n00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.380\nRemember to put your asterisk in there and\nthat let's me know,\n\n392\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.090\nlook it that there's a deny.\n\n393\n00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.410\nThere's a deny all right.\n\n394\n00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.830\nSo, somebody's misconfigured this.\n\n395\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.670\nIf they misconfigured this is there\na way that I can restore the original\n\n396\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.760\npermission set?\n\n397\n00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.070\nWell, it's fairly easy.\n\n398\n00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.610\nAll right.\n\n399\n00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:38.910\nAnd, one of the things that\nwe can do here is we can say\n\n400\n00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.740\ninstead of doing a deny, right?\n\n401\n00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.146\nI can come over and I can take all\nthis out here and I can do icacls.\n\n402\n00:20:45.146 --> 00:20:52.030\nI can do test, all right, backslash, do\nthe asterisk, and then I can do restore.\n\n403\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.250\nAnd we can name that file, all right.\n\n404\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:02.840\nNot all privileges to\nthe user are referenced.\n\n405\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.189\nAnd I'm wondering if this is going to be,\nlet's check something out here.\n\n406\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.710\nThat deny is still there.\n\n407\n00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.560\nLet's see if the restoration is probably\nsomething that needs to be run as\n\n408\n00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.400\nan administrator.\n\n409\n00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.820\nI would almost be willing to, I can view\nbut we might not be able to change here.\n\n410\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:23.050\nSo, let's just double\ncheck here real quick.\n\n411\n00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.100\nAll right, we'll get out of there.\n\n412\n00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.899\nCD back slash, yeah we're gonna go ahead\nand just navigate back to that location.\n\n413\n00:21:33.566 --> 00:21:35.399\nAll right, so let's try that again.\n\n414\n00:21:39.357 --> 00:21:44.610\nAll right, and we're gonna do a test and\nthen we will do a restore aclbackup.\n\n415\n00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.280\nOkay, so, notice that\n\n416\n00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.870\nit It took that ACL backup and\nit restored it.\n\n417\n00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.050\nBut let's verify that it actually\nhas done the restoration here.\n\n418\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.740\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna do our icalcs one more time.\n\n419\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.920\nNow, all right, and we'll do a test,\nand let's see if we restored\n\n420\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.130\nBilly's read permission there,\nand remove the deny permission.\n\n421\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.280\nNotice that it's gone.\n\n422\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.820\nSo, what it did, it said, I don't\ncare what the settings are right now.\n\n423\n00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.290\nAnd you definitely have to be careful.\n\n424\n00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:18.470\nThat restoration option does require\nan administrative level command prompt.\n\n425\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.370\nTo be able to make modifications to\nthe ACL like that, and we're back up and\n\n426\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.810\nrunning, and hopefully, we've restored\nthose permissions to something that we\n\n427\n00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.810\nas IT administrators want, and\nthen we can move on from there.\n\n428\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.780\nAnd hopefully, we've gotten ourselves\nout of a bad day at the office and\n\n429\n00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.920\na lot of support tickets as to why people\ndon't have access to the documents that\n\n430\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.470\notherwise they should have access to.\n\n431\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.660\n>> All right so, what West has actually\nshowed us is we can actually manage our\n\n432\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.320\npermissions from the command line itself.\n\n433\n00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.650\nWe can go ahead and\ncreate the permissions and add users in,\n\n434\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.300\nwe can actually remove the user, we can\nactually add in additional permissions\n\n435\n00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.650\nchanges then we can deny them and\neven restore permissions that we need to.\n\n436\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.700\nAnd all it takes is learning a little\nbit of that isackle that command.\n\n437\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.960\nThat's really helped us out.\n\n438\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.250\nWe see how versile it is, and it's not\nexactly the most complex command in\n\n439\n00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.760\nthe world which makes it easy for\nus to learn.\n\n440\n00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.810\nAnd so it's all valuable information.\n\n441\n00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.300\nWes anything else to add in here for\nisacls?\n\n442\n00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.400\n>> Not not for isacls but I tell you what\nwe've got a lot more command line coming\n\n443\n00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.550\nup we've got some cool stuff.\n\n444\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.650\nSo, but as far as your permissions just\nlike Ronnie said it's not so intuitive but\n\n445\n00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.400\nit isn't too complex just make sure\nyou pay attention to your switches and\n\n446\n00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:25.930\nyour options.\n\n447\n00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.250\nAnd what Wes always has to do\npay attention to your typing.\n\n448\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.120\n>> Right.\n>> Other than that we're\n\n449\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.070\ngood\n>> Yeah, no,\n\n450\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.790\njust speaking of that then that\nmeans that there is more to come.\n\n451\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.780\nBut for this episode though, it's a great\nplace for us to go and end this right now.\n\n452\n00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.592\nAnd we've got more on\nCommand Line like Wes said, and\n\n453\n00:23:39.592 --> 00:23:40.607\nWes is gonna join us for that.\n\n454\n00:23:40.607 --> 00:23:43.399\nSo, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong,\n\n455\n00:23:43.399 --> 00:23:44.357\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan,\n\n456\n00:23:44.357 --> 00:23:46.107\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n457\n00:23:46.107 --> 00:23:52.490\n[SOUND]\n\n",

episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:20.330\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today we're\ngonna be looking at Windows 10 security.\n\n5\n00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.040\nAnd in this episode we're actually\ncontinuing on from a previous episode.\n\n6\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.410\nSo, part two on security in the CLI or\nthe Command Prompt.\n\n7\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.230\nSo Wes, let's just dive right back in and\nsee what we got.\n\n8\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.870\n>> Sounds good.\n\n9\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.711\nWe're just gonna move right on.\n\n10\n00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:35.113\nApparently I talked\na lot in the first one.\n\n11\n00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:36.787\nWe go a lot of stuff that we cover.\n\n12\n00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:40.500\nYeah, in the first part of this, guys,\nwe talked about file permissions.\n\n13\n00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190\nLet me go ahead and step back just a\nlittle bit further because in this series\n\n14\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.270\nall of these concepts that we've seen in\nthe command prompt that we've been doing\n\n15\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.650\nwe've already done them in\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n16\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.674\nSo if you're like well, Wes, I haven't\nseen the permissions being configured\n\n17\n00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:54.132\nhere, go back and watch those\nepisodes cuz we have covered them.\n\n18\n00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:57.950\nBut one of the things I wanted to show you\nguys is how you do some of the security\n\n19\n00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.870\nconfigurations inside the command prompt,\nright?\n\n20\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.768\nThe first episode we looked at\na command that's been around for\n\n21\n00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:07.283\na little bit called and\nhow you can configure permissions, right?\n\n22\n00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:10.430\nWell, today what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna look at the firewall.\n\n23\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.560\nThe Windows advanced firewall, and\nwe're gonna see how you can make some\n\n24\n00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.730\nconfigurations inside\nof the command prompt.\n\n25\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.700\nNow one of the things that you might say\nhere is why would I wanna do this in\n\n26\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.486\nthe command prompt?\n\n27\n00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:20.440\nWe have the GUI.\n\n28\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.550\nWell if you remember actually\nit what was it 2008 or 2008 r2,\n\n29\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.470\nthe core editions came out right?\n\n30\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.945\nAnd we weren't required to use PowerShell\nas they're definitely been pushing you\n\n31\n00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:30.493\nknow more modern server additions.\n\n32\n00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:31.982\nThey're definitely pushing for\n\n33\n00:01:31.982 --> 00:01:35.541\nit cuz of the power that's behind it no\npun intended, but there are still server\n\n34\n00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:39.170\ncore additions out there that might\nhave just the command line interface.\n\n35\n00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.620\nSo that's where these\ncommands would come in handy.\n\n36\n00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.710\n>> And not to mention that but\nthe ability to script things, right?\n\n37\n00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.338\nI cannot script that\ngraphical user interface,\n\n38\n00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:50.991\nand if it's something I have to do\non a repeated basis, every week,\n\n39\n00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:55.627\nevery day, every hour, every time we set\nup a new machine, or whatever, test labs.\n\n40\n00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:57.325\nAnd I wanna be able to\nwhip out new machines and\n\n41\n00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.940\napply these rules to make it\nmatch my production environment.\n\n42\n00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.869\nI don't wanna go through the GUI and\nmanually create 15, 20,\n\n43\n00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.293\n30 different rules, right?\n\n44\n00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:05.649\nI wanna be able to script it.\n\n45\n00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.050\nAnd that's where this kinda\ninterface comes into play.\n\n46\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.150\n>> And that's one of the great things\nabout having somebody that's been a server\n\n47\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.603\nadministrator since 2000 server there with\nyou today, because that's exactly right.\n\n48\n00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:17.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think of the ability of just being\n\n49\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.010\nable to do this, he's thinking\nabout automating the process.\n\n50\n00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.220\nWhich is another power, you know the power\nof any command line interpreter,\n\n51\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.970\nit really doesn't matter which\noperating system you are in,\n\n52\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.560\nbut thank goodness what we're\ntalking about is Windows 10.\n\n53\n00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.760\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's jump right in, like Mike said.\n\n54\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.360\nLet's go ahead and let's look at\nhow to configure the firewall.\n\n55\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.300\nNow the command that we're\ngonna be using is a command\n\n56\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.190\ncalled the network shell, right?\n\n57\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.090\nWe abbreviate it in\nthe command prompt as netsh.\n\n58\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.030\nIt's just short for network shell,\nand it can do a lot of things.\n\n59\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.130\nYou've probably seen in some of the other\nepisodes that we have, where you can see,\n\n60\n00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.540\nfor instance, system administration where\nyou're setting things like your IP address\n\n61\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.490\nas you're configuring\nyour network adaptors.\n\n62\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.063\nBut you can go further than that,\nyou can configure the firewall and\n\n63\n00:02:58.063 --> 00:02:59.388\nthat's what we wanna show today.\n\n64\n00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.717\nNow the other thing I'm gonna show you,\n\n65\n00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:04.425\nis how poorly I type\nwithout a word processor.\n\n66\n00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when we get in here we're gonna\n\n67\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.870\nstart with netsh all right, now with netsh\nwe've got the next option that we had, and\n\n68\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.660\nI'll tell you Mike, I'm gonna wanna spell\nthis out advance the whole entire time.\n\n69\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.350\n>> Absolutely.\n\n70\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.030\n>> I always do, so\nit's actually advfirewall, right?\n\n71\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.910\nShort for advanced firewall but\nI always wanna say advanced.\n\n72\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.460\nAnd I'm using the electronic white out,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.706\nThe back space button.\n\n74\n00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.684\n[LAUGH] So, let's go ahead and,\nwe're gonna,\n\n75\n00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:34.492\ninside the firewall like we\ntalked about in other episodes.\n\n76\n00:03:34.492 --> 00:03:35.723\nWe talked about profiles, right?\n\n77\n00:03:35.723 --> 00:03:39.551\nProfiles to global suite is settings\nyou got, it's based on network location\n\n78\n00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:43.495\nawareness inside of Windows depending on\nthe network location that you choose.\n\n79\n00:03:43.495 --> 00:03:48.030\nIt sets your firewall\nsettings base on that choice.\n\n80\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.336\nBut what if you wanna know\nwhat the current profile is,\n\n81\n00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:53.307\nmaybe we wanna know all of the profiles\nand what their current states.\n\n82\n00:03:53.307 --> 00:03:54.181\nWell can we do that?\n\n83\n00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:57.677\nWell, with the first option after\nthe advanced firewall here at netsh,\n\n84\n00:03:57.677 --> 00:03:59.670\nthis is gonna be the show option.\n\n85\n00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.470\nGot a couple of parameters we're\ngonna see set here coming up.\n\n86\n00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.770\nBut this one's gonna be show.\n\n87\n00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.230\nWhat this means is just print that\noutput into the command prompt here so\n\n88\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.650\nwe can see that information.\n\n89\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.900\nWe're gonna do a show all profiles.\n\n90\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.770\nOops, or port files.\n\n91\n00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.930\nThere's probably some port files on here,\nand\n\n92\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.640\nthey're gonna be port files after I get\ndone with them, I can tell you that.\n\n93\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.290\nSo, we'll do state here, and it's gonna\nshow us, very easy simplistic, right?\n\n94\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.530\nIt shows us that our domain\nprofile is currently turned on.\n\n95\n00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.168\nIt shows us that our the private\nprofile is currently turned on.\n\n96\n00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:35.461\nGet that right there and that the public\nprofile is currently turned on.\n\n97\n00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:38.515\nBut notice that it just showed me\nthe state of all the profiles.\n\n98\n00:04:38.515 --> 00:04:40.965\nWell can I get it a little\nmore specific than that?\n\n99\n00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:41.785\nWell sure you can.\n\n100\n00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:45.645\nBecause what you can do is and\nI'm gonna go ahead and, Mike and\n\n101\n00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:49.521\nI were talking about the up arrow\nbeing able to re-run these.\n\n102\n00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:50.764\nBut I'm a glutton for punishment.\n\n103\n00:04:50.764 --> 00:04:52.025\nI'm gonna show you guys\nhow bad my typing is.\n\n104\n00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.605\nSo I'm gonna re-type it out.\n\n105\n00:04:53.605 --> 00:05:01.255\nSo it's netsh advfirewall show and Mike,\npublic, private or domain, pick one.\n\n106\n00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:02.130\n>> [SOUND] Domain.\n\n107\n00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.780\n>> Domain, okay.\n\n108\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.032\nThis will be the one that\nI probably didn't test.\n\n109\n00:05:05.032 --> 00:05:06.820\n>> [LAUGH] That's why I picked it.\n\n110\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.160\n>> Yeah.\nThat's exactly it.\n\n111\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.185\nSo we're [LAUGH] gonna do an netsh space\nadvfirewall space show domain profile,\n\n112\n00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:15.830\nand we're going to do the same thing now.\n\n113\n00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.110\nThe terms state here.\n\n114\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.350\nLemme give you another type of my,\nI always wanna say status.\n\n115\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.410\nI think of the status of the firewall so\n\n116\n00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.050\nI always wanna type status here and\nit's actually state.\n\n117\n00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.180\nNow, what it's telling me is not what\nis the state of every single profile\n\n118\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.160\non the machine.\n\n119\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.820\nWhat is the state of the one\nspecifically that I'm looking at?\n\n120\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.970\nI might know for instance,\n\n121\n00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.670\nspeaking of systems administration,\nI might know that I'm in a domain.\n\n122\n00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.940\nRight, by default a domain,\nunless you make some kind of group\n\n123\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.140\npolicy that changes your\nnetwork's location settings.\n\n124\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.420\nThe moment the computer\nconnects to the domain and\n\n125\n00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.460\nsays wait I know what\nnetwork I'm a part of, right?\n\n126\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.950\nIt's probably configured\nas well on the server side.\n\n127\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.020\nSo, you'll automatically get\nthe domain profile, right?\n\n128\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.320\nSo, I might not need to show everything.\n\n129\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.820\nAll the profiles,\nwhen I'm already in a domain environment,\n\n130\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.900\nI know which one I'm looking for.\n\n131\n00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.093\nNow this only shows me\nthe state of the profile.\n\n132\n00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:02.635\nIt really doesn't show me any information\nabout what's in the profile itself.\n\n133\n00:06:02.635 --> 00:06:03.729\nBut we can go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n134\n00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.818\nAnd what's interesting with this one\nis when you remove the option or\n\n135\n00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:13.262\nthe parameter if you will state,\nlook what happen.\n\n136\n00:06:13.262 --> 00:06:15.600\nAll right,\na lot more information there for sure.\n\n137\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.079\nAnd we can see,\nlet's go ahead and scroll up.\n\n138\n00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:22.311\nI believe the main profile,\nyeah the main profile is on top there and\n\n139\n00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:24.178\nthat is one that we might see.\n\n140\n00:06:24.178 --> 00:06:27.116\nAnd we might want to use because we are in\na domain environment here with our Windows\n\n141\n00:06:27.116 --> 00:06:28.230\n10 machine.\n\n142\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.990\nWell, I can see what the policy is.\n\n143\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.500\nNow the firewall policy here,\nit's kinda interesting.\n\n144\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.690\nYou might say, well,\nis that special to the domain profile?\n\n145\n00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.370\nActually, that's kinda like,\nit really is the default setting for\n\n146\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.200\nmost firewalls, right?\n\n147\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.760\nBlock everything inbound, accept\nthe things that we allow through it,\n\n148\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.660\nallow all the outbound communications.\n\n149\n00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.940\nIn fact, you can see that's pretty\nmuch the firewall profile policy for\n\n150\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.770\nall of them.\n\n151\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.610\nBlock, yeah, no, actually,\nbecause the public profile.\n\n152\n00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.680\nI take that back, right.\n\n153\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.966\nPublic profile is the most restrictive.\n\n154\n00:06:56.966 --> 00:07:01.520\nSo, they're all block inbound and I\nbelieve all should be all allow outbound.\n\n155\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.240\nAnd again,\nthat's just the default settings.\n\n156\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.790\nBut, I can go farther than that.\n\n157\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.610\nMaybe you've got some advanced\nconfiguration going on.\n\n158\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.500\nMaybe you're doing IP set communications.\n\n159\n00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.720\nYou got connection security rules.\n\n160\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.620\nAnd I wanna see are they\neven being enforced?\n\n161\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.929\nWell, I can see that\ninformation right here.\n\n162\n00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:17.098\nNow we're really not going to go in to\nconnections security rules in this episode\n\n163\n00:07:17.098 --> 00:07:19.070\nbut you can see the information.\n\n164\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.500\nWell, can I get more specific?\n\n165\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.360\nAs Mike said earlier,\nwe're going to look at the domain profile.\n\n166\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.015\nWell, can I do that?\n\n167\n00:07:24.015 --> 00:07:26.690\nWell, same thing,\njust take off the word state because\n\n168\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.590\nyou don't care if it's on or off.\n\n169\n00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.125\nWhat you want to see is the information\ndirectly related to that specific profile.\n\n170\n00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:34.758\nAnd here we can see we can\nrifle down even more, and\n\n171\n00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:38.669\nwe get the ability to see the individual\nsettings in this profile itself.\n\n172\n00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:42.486\nAll right so, one of the things I was\ngonna say is that if you don't know what\n\n173\n00:07:42.486 --> 00:07:46.549\nprofile you're looking for, you don't\nknow which ones to apply the machine,\n\n174\n00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.590\nwell then go ahead and use all profile.\n\n175\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.774\nIf you're like, in this situation, where\nwe're looking at a domain profile, cuz we\n\n176\n00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:54.710\nknow we're in the domain, you can get\na little bit more specific there, Mike.\n\n177\n00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.775\nAnd you can focus on maybe the profile\nthat you're currently looking at,\n\n178\n00:07:57.775 --> 00:07:59.320\nyou know that you wanna look Look at.\n\n179\n00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.564\n>> Now, Wes,\nwhat if I run this command and\n\n180\n00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.270\nI see that one of them is\noff that I want to turn on.\n\n181\n00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.169\nDo I have to go back to the GUI and\ndo that?\n\n182\n00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:08.623\n>> Yeah, well, you don't really have to.\nOne of the things to keep in mind, and\n\n183\n00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:09.692\nthis is kind of interesting, and\n\n184\n00:08:09.692 --> 00:08:11.850\nI'll tell you a setting where this\nactually came into play for me.\n\n185\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.943\nWe deal with a lot of virtual machines,\nright, Mike, and I, and\n\n186\n00:08:14.943 --> 00:08:16.250\nall the hosts who are here.\n\n187\n00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.280\nWe're constantly configuring\nvirtual machines.\n\n188\n00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.330\nOne of the things that you have to do\nin Windows 10, and some of thee earlier\n\n189\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.730\neditions of Windows if you want\nto use a home group, all right?\n\n190\n00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.806\nIf you're on unidentified network, there\nis a policy in your local policy, and\n\n191\n00:08:29.806 --> 00:08:33.064\nI believe it's even a domain policy too,\nthat says if I can't identify the network,\n\n192\n00:08:33.064 --> 00:08:34.850\nautomatically assign\nit the public profile.\n\n193\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.880\nBut what does that do for home group?\n\n194\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.467\nDisables it.\n\n195\n00:08:40.467 --> 00:08:43.146\nSo, if I've got the public\nprofile attached, and\n\n196\n00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:47.530\nanything other than the private profile,\nunfortunately I've got problems.\n\n197\n00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.879\nSo, what can I do here?\nI can actually, and\n\n198\n00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:50.960\nthis is where that option\nis gonna change here.\n\n199\n00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.748\nWe're gonna go from show to set, but\nit gets a little bit redundant here.\n\n200\n00:08:54.748 --> 00:08:59.106\nAnd actually, when we're setting profile\nsettings I'll show you what I mean here\n\n201\n00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:00.635\nabout the redundancy here.\n\n202\n00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:03.600\nWhen you're setting the profiles,\nyou just use a set option, right?\n\n203\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.860\nAnd I can essentially turn\noff the firewall if I want.\n\n204\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.687\nYou say, well how do you do that,\nwell I could do a set allprofiles and\n\n205\n00:09:12.687 --> 00:09:14.860\nlet's try not to type status.\n\n206\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.194\nI always wanna type status there,\nand type off.\n\n207\n00:09:19.194 --> 00:09:22.311\nAnd first rule of thumb we've talked,\nwhat is that rule of thumb?\n\n208\n00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:25.265\n>> We're gonna need permissions\nto do this operation, aren't we?\n\n209\n00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.920\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Always launch,\n\n210\n00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.154\nwhen you're viewing, and\nthat's probably a good thing to say too so\n\n211\n00:09:30.154 --> 00:09:31.120\nyou guys can see it.\n\n212\n00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.110\nWhen you're viewing,\nyou can be a standard user, right?\n\n213\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.910\nCuz you're not making modifications.\n\n214\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.594\nBut, let me go ahead and\nshut this down real quick and\n\n215\n00:09:39.594 --> 00:09:42.550\nwe'll type our CMD option here,\nctrl, Shift, Enter.\n\n216\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.470\nAnd we'll launch and administrative\ncommand prompt, that was one of the things\n\n217\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.570\nI was lacking there because again to\nview the information that's okay.\n\n218\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.985\nYou can view all you want, but you're\nnot gonna be able to make modifications.\n\n219\n00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:54.240\nSo, let's try that again.\n\n220\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.560\nSo, we're gonna do netsh advfirewall,\nall right, and\n\n221\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.340\nremember that this is going\nto be a set option now.\n\n222\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.610\nWe're not just showing here we're\ngonna actually do some configurations.\n\n223\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.340\nI'll tell you what Mike, we'll start by\nshutting all the profiles down, right.\n\n224\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.310\nSo in a scenario where may be I do want\nto configure something like home group.\n\n225\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:21.033\nSo what I can do is do a netsh space\nadvfirewall space set allprofiles,\n\n226\n00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:23.270\nand then I do state and off.\n\n227\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.266\nAll right, now one of the great things\nI love about this command is when\n\n228\n00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:28.842\nyou get it right it says Ok.\n\n229\n00:10:28.842 --> 00:10:33.770\n[LAUGH] Which means okay Wes finally\ntyped it right is really what that means,\n\n230\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.667\nyou don't see the jargon behind the scene.\n\n231\n00:10:36.667 --> 00:10:40.580\n[LAUGH] So now what I can do is I\ncould say take the off off of here,\n\n232\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.063\nboy that's redundant, and\nchange this back to show.\n\n233\n00:10:44.063 --> 00:10:48.850\nAnd when we run this now,\nwe've got a problem.\n\n234\n00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.210\nObviously I'm not gonna leave it here, but\nwe wanna turn one of those profiles on.\n\n235\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.930\nI wanna set this up maybe\nto support the home group.\n\n236\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.610\nSo now what I can do here is\nI can go netsh advfirewall.\n\n237\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.498\nAnd guys, like I said,\nI know I could use my up arrow, but\n\n238\n00:11:02.498 --> 00:11:06.307\nif you guys are gonna have to\nbe burdened with typing it,\n\n239\n00:11:06.307 --> 00:11:10.870\nwhy not me burden myself with typing\nit in front of you guys as well.\n\n240\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.850\nAnd then I would do privateprofile.\n\n241\n00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.480\nAll right, state equals on, and\nno equals here, just force of habit here.\n\n242\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.950\nAnd it says, Ok again,\nwhich means I got my typing right.\n\n243\n00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.270\nNow, if I wanna turn around and I wanna\nfind out, well, what is the state in view?\n\n244\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.154\nNow you can see, what do we have?\n\n245\n00:11:26.154 --> 00:11:30.700\nOff for the domain, off for public and\non for the private location.\n\n246\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.440\nAnd this might be a way that I can now\nconfigure my home group if I wanna\n\n247\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.080\nset it up.\n\n248\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.499\nSo, to answer your question,\nMike, more directly, yes you can.\n\n249\n00:11:37.499 --> 00:11:41.818\nIf you need to turn those states on or off\nand you need to configure the profiles,\n\n250\n00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:42.730\nyou can do that.\n\n251\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.603\nDon't do what I did and launch it from\na non-administrative command prompt or\n\n252\n00:11:46.603 --> 00:11:47.730\nyou won't be able to.\n\n253\n00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.720\n>> Right, very good, and then we can\nuse the commands we learned at the very\n\n254\n00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.318\nbeginning to verify that we've\nturned the one on that we want or\n\n255\n00:11:53.318 --> 00:11:54.559\noff the one that we wanted to.\n\n256\n00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:56.960\n>> Yeah, and I'm glad you mentioned that.\n\n257\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.251\nThat's a good thing to mention,\nverify, right?\n\n258\n00:11:58.251 --> 00:12:01.510\nSo notice that we configure,\nverify, configure, verify.\n\n259\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.410\nBecause one of the things if you're\nconfiguring multiple firewalls.\n\n260\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.547\nLet's say Mike's the administrator, been\nthe administrator of this computer for\n\n261\n00:12:07.547 --> 00:12:08.530\na very long time, right?\n\n262\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.697\nAnd he knows some of the exploits and\nmaybe some of the rules that he's had to\n\n263\n00:12:12.697 --> 00:12:15.808\nuse to allow communications\nthrough the firewall, and\n\n264\n00:12:15.808 --> 00:12:17.750\nhe's got a running list, right?\n\n265\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.080\nIf he hands this over from administration\nto me, I don't know what he's done, right?\n\n266\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.370\nSo I need to be able to view, so\n\n267\n00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.020\nevery time you configure just\nmake sure you go back and view.\n\n268\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.760\nThat's a good rule of thumb here.\n\n269\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.640\nNow the other things that we\ncan do as well is we can also\n\n270\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.180\nconfigure firewall rules.\n\n271\n00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.260\nNow, this is one that you really\nhave to pay attention to the syntax.\n\n272\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.160\nAll command line interfaces,\nif you don't type it right obviously and\n\n273\n00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.880\nyou can see it doesn't work,\nit doesn't give you the Ok, right?\n\n274\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.585\nWe're definitely looking for Ok's,\nOk's are good for us, two thumbs up.\n\n275\n00:12:47.585 --> 00:12:50.425\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you how you can configure a firewall.\n\n276\n00:12:50.425 --> 00:12:53.225\nI'll go ahead and clear my screen so\nwe can get that prompt at the top here.\n\n277\n00:12:53.225 --> 00:12:56.113\nAnd this is where I was\ntelling you earlier,\n\n278\n00:12:56.113 --> 00:13:00.555\nI said a little bit too soon\nwhere it gets a little redundant.\n\n279\n00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:06.600\nnetsh advance firewall firewall,\nI can't figure that one out, but.\n\n280\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.748\n>> I can tell you if you'd like to know.\n\n281\n00:13:07.748 --> 00:13:09.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely, tell me,\n\n282\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.780\nMike, I'm glad you're here.\n\n283\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.629\n>> Well starting with, what was it\nXP service pack three, I think.\n\n284\n00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:14.590\n>> Yes.\n>> When that firewall first came out.\n\n285\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.100\n>> Service pack two.\n>> Service pack two.\n\n286\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.465\nSo it was netsh firewall, and\nthen later on, and I can't remember when,\n\n287\n00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.490\nthey came out with that advanced firewall.\n\n288\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.740\nI think it was Windows 7, was it, I think?\n\n289\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.390\nAnd so they just had to tack that on,\nright.\n\n290\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.262\nSo you had to do both, you had to\ndo that advfirewall space firewall,\n\n291\n00:13:32.262 --> 00:13:35.640\ncuz they added commands\nin to that netsh shell.\n\n292\n00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.360\n>> Expanding functionality and\nyou expand the amount of options.\n\n293\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.030\n>> Whereas profiles weren't available in\nthe old firewall, that first firewall.\n\n294\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.927\nSo there was no adding on top of right?\n\n295\n00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:46.100\nSo there was not the advfirewall firewall.\n\n296\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.700\nIt was just advfirewall.\n\n297\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.950\n>> So\nglad he's here to help me out on that one.\n\n298\n00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n299\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.683\nI was just guessing at that if, you\nguys can find something out let me know.\n\n300\n00:13:54.683 --> 00:13:57.186\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's great, now the next one that\n\n301\n00:13:57.186 --> 00:14:01.092\nwe're gonna add to this one so, so\nfar we've got netsh adv, I almost said\n\n302\n00:14:01.092 --> 00:14:04.768\nabd I keep thinking of advanced,\nor AVP, one of my favorite movies.\n\n303\n00:14:04.768 --> 00:14:06.397\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But,\n\n304\n00:14:06.397 --> 00:14:10.547\nadvfirewall space firewall, and\nnow we're gonna have the add option.\n\n305\n00:14:10.547 --> 00:14:15.350\nNow the add option or parameter,\nit comes with it's own set of options.\n\n306\n00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.580\nThe one that specifically we're\ngonna be looking at is add rule.\n\n307\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.360\nAll right, now, when you add your rule,\nthe next thing that we do is,\n\n308\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.090\nwe add a name to it.\n\n309\n00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.650\nAnd the name,\nI would say that it's arbitrary.\n\n310\n00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.650\nI have to be very careful saying that,\nall right, because let me go ahead and\n\n311\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:30.910\nset a name here, Mike.\n\n312\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:36.874\nAnd well will go ahead and set, I tell you\nwhat, we're gonna call this ALL ICMPV4,\n\n313\n00:14:36.874 --> 00:14:41.259\noops, or maybe I can't spell V4,\ncan you help me with that?\n\n314\n00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:42.464\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's gonna be right after\n\n315\n00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:43.810\nthe three and right before the five.\n\n316\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:44.720\n>> [LAUGH] Thank you, there we go.\n\n317\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.818\nAnd, since I got quotes here,\nwe might as well, oops,\n\n318\n00:14:48.818 --> 00:14:51.890\nI know I got a parameter\nin there I missed.\n\n319\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.798\nI hit enter when I shouldn't have been.\n\n320\n00:14:52.798 --> 00:14:56.140\nAll right, Mike, so\nnaming convention is absolutely important.\n\n321\n00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.240\nI'm handing this computer over to you and\nI'm no longer administrating it.\n\n322\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.150\nWhat do you see?\n\n323\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.573\n>> Well,\nI got a problem with your name there, Wes,\n\n324\n00:15:02.573 --> 00:15:04.266\nI mean what is exactly is it doing?\n\n325\n00:15:04.266 --> 00:15:08.910\nYeah, all I see in PD4 block,\nallow, only if it sign.\n\n326\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.440\nI mean, what are you trying\nto do with this rule here.\n\n327\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.295\n>> That's exactly right,\n\n328\n00:15:13.295 --> 00:15:15.460\nso that's one of the things that\nwe gotta think about, right?\n\n329\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.860\nYou might not be the only administrator.\n\n330\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.550\nThere might be multiple administrators,\nright?\n\n331\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.965\nAnd if you want other people to\nknow what the heck's going on when\n\n332\n00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:26.759\nthey decide to start looking at your\nfirewall rules you have to make sure\n\n333\n00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.880\nthat it's a little bit more easier,\nI guess I should say.\n\n334\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.290\n>> It's a good best practice, right?\n\n335\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.127\n>> User friendly.\n>> That way other\n\n336\n00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:36.770\nadmins don't have to click on it, open it\nup, go through all the different tabs.\n\n337\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.180\nTo try to figure out what the heck did he\nmake or what is this rule actually doing?\n\n338\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.030\n>> Yeah, why is it even here.\n\n339\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.770\n>> Yeah.\n>> What are you even doing, so\n\n340\n00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.100\nvery good thing to do.\n\n341\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.390\nNow the next thing that we're gonna do,\nsay we're gonna go with this specifically.\n\n342\n00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.800\nOne of the things I should mention here\nis what type of rule we're making.\n\n343\n00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.450\nYou can set things like protocols,\nport values, programs.\n\n344\n00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.832\nIn this one you can see ICMP,\nthe internet control message protocol,\n\n345\n00:15:56.832 --> 00:16:00.902\ndefinitely has its problems with security\nSo, we're gonna say that maybe from this\n\n346\n00:16:00.902 --> 00:16:03.790\ncomputer I don't want any ICMP so\nwe're gonna block that.\n\n347\n00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:08.645\nSo, the next thing that we have to do here\nis we have to add a protocol equals, and\n\n348\n00:16:08.645 --> 00:16:11.700\nthis is one time where we\ndo have to add the equals.\n\n349\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.430\nAll right, so we do protocol equals and\nthen we do ICMPV4 and\n\n350\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.940\nthink about where the source Is.\n\n351\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.840\nOr where the destination is.\n\n352\n00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.920\nNow, you can get a little\nmore specific here.\n\n353\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.300\nYou can say okay if i'm on a server right.\n\n354\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.230\nI don't want it coming inbound\nfrom any other location, and\n\n355\n00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:33.090\nmaybe an administrative computer that\nI know is an administrative computer.\n\n356\n00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:33.970\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n357\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.450\nI'm gonna be a little bit\nmore secure on this one.\n\n358\n00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.470\nI'm gonna say I don't care.\n\n359\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:39.630\nCare who it comes from.\n\n360\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.450\nSo, I got any comment, any on that.\n\n361\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.020\nNow, the next thing I\nhave is the direction.\n\n362\n00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.320\nAll right, now the dir option.\n\n363\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.430\nSome of you guys,\nmaybe you know what the dir is out there,\n\n364\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.800\nyou're thinking well,\nthat shows me the directory I'm in.\n\n365\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.880\nDir, for obvious reasons direction,\nis what we're looking at here.\n\n366\n00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.430\nSo we say, dir in We know that this\nis gonna be an inbound option.\n\n367\n00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.420\nAll right, and we're gonna say action,\nequals, and it's gonna be block.\n\n368\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.407\nAnd hopefully I get the okay.\n\n369\n00:17:05.407 --> 00:17:07.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, there we go, so\n\n370\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.790\nwe've set that right.\n\n371\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.710\nNow, that's an inbound rule, Mike.\n\n372\n00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.500\nWe can configure the inbound rules,\nand again,\n\n373\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:18.404\nwe can configure them by the protocol for\nA program if you will.\n\n374\n00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:19.874\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah.\n\n375\n00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:20.857\nSo, poor value.\n\n376\n00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:24.870\nSo, you can do that as well but\nthat's only one direction right?\n\n377\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.140\nThat's gonna open up or\nclose off the firewall for\n\n378\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.300\none specific rule that you're making.\n\n379\n00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.940\nNow the other thing that you can do is,\nyou can also configure Outbound rules.\n\n380\n00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.960\nNow, when you configure outbound rules\nagain, very, very close to the same thing.\n\n381\n00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.910\nAnd again, I'll go ahead and since you\nguys are gonna have to type it out there\n\n382\n00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.211\nfully, I'll go ahead and type it out.\n\n383\n00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:44.013\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n384\n00:17:44.013 --> 00:17:46.822\nyou guys can see how bad\napparently I can't do that.\n\n385\n00:17:46.822 --> 00:17:49.227\nAnd we'll do our advfirewall, advfirewall.\n\n386\n00:17:49.227 --> 00:17:50.830\n[INAUDIBLE] done it again.\n\n387\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.589\nWe'll go ahead and do firewall and\nthis is gonna be add rule\n\n388\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.530\nAnd this is dir equals l, remember that\nis just direction not the contents of\n\n389\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.890\nthe directory over here alright and\nwe are going to do name equals and\n\n390\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.260\nI don't know about you, but I don't really\nlike putting spaces in there so I am going\n\n391\n00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.740\nto go ahead and be a little bit strict\nhere and I am going to say block RDP.\n\n392\n00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.260\n>> So, ports are only necessary if\nI got a space in the name, right?\n\n393\n00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.140\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you'll\n\n394\n00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.020\nprobably see some people that\nare a little finicky about that.\n\n395\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.140\nI think you might be one.\n\n396\n00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.330\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz you deal with databases and\n\n397\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.960\nstuff like that.\n\n398\n00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.760\nSo, it's really a good idea if you're\ngonna run from the command prompt.\n\n399\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.300\nAnd you're gonna be doing a lot\nof CLI Keep the spaces out.\n\n400\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.120\nSpaces are no good.\n\n401\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.880\n>> It's annoying having to put\nspaces around everything you do.\n\n402\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.060\n>> And it doesn't come back saying okay,\nwhich means it's not gonna work.\n\n403\n00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:40.060\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nkeep the spaces out here.\n\n404\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.000\nAll right so once we do that,\nall right, we've got the first part.\n\n405\n00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.900\nWe're adding a rule.\n\n406\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.300\nThe direction is an outbound rule and\nthe name is gonna be BlockRDP.\n\n407\n00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.800\nNow, let's apply the action, action=block.\n\n408\n00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.740\nAnd here is where we're going\na little bit different.\n\n409\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.700\nRemember in the first inbound one we set a\nprotocol=, now we're gonna do program= and\n\n410\n00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.570\nwe're gonna point it to the path\nof where that program is.\n\n411\n00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:07.120\nAnd if I remember right mstsc is in\nSystem32 directory, if I remember right.\n\n412\n00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.670\nAnd I believe it's one of\nthe only two s mstsc files.\n\n413\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.920\nOne's a dill if I remember right.\n\n414\n00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.320\nLet's tab there's\nan executable there's a dill.\n\n415\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.190\nThat's not what we want we want\nthe executable all right so\n\n416\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.220\nwhat we've said is block this executable.\n\n417\n00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.180\nAnd for\nthose of you that have been in Windows for\n\n418\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.790\na while probably remember when it was\ncalled Microsoft terminal services.\n\n419\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:31.360\nSo, even though I said block rdp that's\nMicrosoft terminal services client.\n\n420\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.470\nThey just never changed the name there.\n\n421\n00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.860\nLittle bit behind\nthe times now the oops and\n\n422\n00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.450\napparently now I'm gonna have\nto type the whole thing again.\n\n423\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.980\nSo, now I am gonna use my up arrow and\n\n424\n00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.410\nwe're gonna call this\nname equals block rdp.\n\n425\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.140\nHey good practice right?\n\n426\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.180\n>> That's right.\n\n427\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.120\n>> And we'll do action equals\n>> Block, and\n\n428\n00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.360\nthen now we get back to\nthe program equals N.\n\n429\n00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.420\nGuys, in fact Micah it's funny.\n\n430\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.030\nA few years ago when we worked for\n\n431\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.340\nthat company you told me about that\ntab functionality and I tell you what.\n\n432\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.480\n>> It's a beautiful thing.\n\n433\n00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.500\n>> It absolutely is, and you guys can see\nwhy when you see Weis' typing skills here.\n\n434\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.310\nSo, stay out of the system\n32 folder MSTSC.\n\n435\n00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:17.200\nAnd apparently there is a lot\nof things there ms Tsc nope, tsc\n\n436\n00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.110\nand I say how good is that and\nthen I don't use it.\n\n437\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.210\nSo nothing like having a good feature and\nthen just completely avoiding it.\n\n438\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.460\n[LAUGH] What we're gonna do now and\nthis is what I missed before I decided\n\n439\n00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.860\nto erase the whole thing\nis enable equals yes.\n\n440\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.430\nAlright now we're back to the profiles.\n\n441\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.480\nProfiles the way we want this applied to,\nso\n\n442\n00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.630\nwe're going to say profiles equals any and\ninterface type.\n\n443\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.620\nThat's one of the things we\nreally haven't talked about.\n\n444\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.460\nWhat interface?\nIs it going to be a remote connection,\n\n445\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.740\nis it going to be a local connection.\n\n446\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.990\nI'm going to say I don't\ncare what connection, so\n\n447\n00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:55.210\nwe're gonna do interface equals- and\nagain- interface type.\n\n448\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.090\nExcuse me, gotta put the type.\n\n449\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.310\n>> Been there and\nthat's the actual option.\n\n450\n00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.500\nInterface type equals ne.\n\n451\n00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.070\nAnd let me see which I what I missed here.\n\n452\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:12.590\nAnd again we've got to\ndouble check it here.\n\n453\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.662\nAdd rule, block.\nName equals block rdp Should equals block\n\n454\n00:21:14.662 --> 00:21:20.660\nprogram [INAUDIBLE] and you know\nwhat it might not be interfacetype,\n\n455\n00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.350\nit might be interface equals we see here.\n\n456\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:27.960\nOne of the things that\nwe had there There is.\n\n457\n00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.300\nWe had to enter our direction there.\n\n458\n00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.250\nYou'll notice that if I leave\nthe direction off it's going to tell you\n\n459\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.190\nright now one of the more essential\nparameters was not entered and apparently\n\n460\n00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.420\nthis is a non-positional parameter so\nI can add it right to the end here.\n\n461\n00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.190\nI got to tell it what direction and\nI didn't tell it what direction so\n\n462\n00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.960\nit's saying,\nwhat do you want me to do here?\n\n463\n00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.420\nAnd now, thank goodness.\n\n464\n00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.160\nI've gotten my okay.\n\n465\n00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.160\nBut, let's not stop there.\n\n466\n00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.830\nAll right.\nNow,\n\n467\n00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.240\nI know this about the command line\ninterface but I'm gonna fall back here,\n\n468\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.940\nMike and\nI'm gonna use the safety net, right?\n\n469\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.100\nSo, we're gonna just\ndouble check real quick.\n\n470\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.190\nDid that firewall rule actually create?\n\n471\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.750\nAll right.\n\n472\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.890\nWell, one of the things that I can see\nright here is that I have a block all\n\n473\n00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.260\nICMP V4.\n\n474\n00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.740\nIf I go to my outbound.\n\n475\n00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.080\nLooks like I got quite a few\nof the block RDPs here.\n\n476\n00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.770\nSo, you can see that it\nhas been configured.\n\n477\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.960\nAnd that's one of the good things\nto be able to configure inbound and\n\n478\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.760\noutbound rules right here\nfrom the command prompts.\n\n479\n00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.280\nNow, what if I wanna verify that\nthat firewall rule was created?\n\n480\n00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.260\nAll right.\n\n481\n00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.510\nWhat if I want to verify other rules?\n\n482\n00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.090\nSo, I know that I've got block RDP set.\n\n483\n00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.950\nI also know that I've\ngot another protocol,\n\n484\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.480\nanother program, protocol if you\nwill called network discovery.\n\n485\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.620\nSo Mike, if you will, I'm going to go\nahead and type out this command and\n\n486\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:49.010\nI need you to tell me the status\nThe fire wall block RDP\n\n487\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:55.830\nrule, and you know that you actually\nknow this step because we just seen it.\n\n488\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.330\nBut I want you to show me the status of\nthe network discovery protocol, you ready?\n\n489\n00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n490\n00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.000\n>> And apparently you got to put\nyour fire wall there, remember?\n\n491\n00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.150\nAdvanced fire wall, fire wall that's\nwhere the redundancy comes in.\n\n492\n00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.687\nYou gotta type it right or\nit doesn't work.\n\n493\n00:23:10.687 --> 00:23:14.430\nYeah okay.\n\n494\n00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:14.930\n>> Okay.\n\n495\n00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:15.570\n>> It yeah.\n\n496\n00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.140\n>> Did you get it?\n\n497\n00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.760\n>> I think so. No.\n>> Okay, I'll do it again.\n\n498\n00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.020\nHold on a second catch it.\n\n499\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.920\n>> Wait.\n\n500\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.119\n>> No, you didn't get it right?\n\n501\n00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:28.260\n[LAUGH] You know what's funny is this\nis actually hard to do a control c on.\n\n502\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.278\nIt does not like even the control C.\n\n503\n00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:33.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, when you wanna show all the rules.\n\n504\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.250\nWell, now that's a problem.\n\n505\n00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.690\nObviously, you can see the output\nthere really didn't help us out.\n\n506\n00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.750\nSo, can we view rules?\n\n507\n00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.360\nBe a little bit more specific for that?\n\n508\n00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.880\nWell, yeah, we can actually if\nwe wanna do show rule, here.\n\n509\n00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.030\nWe got our name equals all.\n\n510\n00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.740\nBut, we could filter\nthis down a little bit.\n\n511\n00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.200\nI could do a profile equals.\n\n512\n00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.866\nAnd, you know we've been picking on\nthe domain profile, so let's go ahead and\n\n513\n00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:55.260\npick on the domain profile.\n\n514\n00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.804\nAll right?\nAnd then the next thing that I'm gonna do\n\n515\n00:23:57.804 --> 00:23:59.470\nis just go ahead and run this.\n\n516\n00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.690\nWell it was a little shorter-\n>> Little bit less, right?\n\n517\n00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.329\n>> But it's still pretty dang quick.\n\n518\n00:24:03.329 --> 00:24:04.597\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Still didn't help me out so\n\n519\n00:24:04.597 --> 00:24:05.550\na lot of information.\n\n520\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.630\nNow what I said is just output to the\nfile, or output to the text, go ahead and\n\n521\n00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.680\njust show me everything.\n\n522\n00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.340\nSo can we get a little bit more granular?\n\n523\n00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.130\nAnd that's one of\nthe things that we can do.\n\n524\n00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.710\nBut what's really cool is this\nsupports the piping command.\n\n525\n00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.160\nAll right,\nI can output this to the more option.\n\n526\n00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:25.650\nAnd when I do that, notice, it stops,\nand it shows me the firewall rule here.\n\n527\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:31.010\nBut if I do enter, line by line, and\nI'm not gonna bore you with a redundancy,\n\n528\n00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:36.620\nbut notice, line by line, now,\nMike's got a standing chance, right?\n\n529\n00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.440\nOr I could do a space bar,\nand it's page by page.\n\n530\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.078\n>> Nice.\n>> Right, so\n\n531\n00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:40.789\nwe can make it a little bit easier.\n\n532\n00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:42.039\nLet go ahead and Ctrl+C that.\n\n533\n00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:45.706\nSo you can even filter this down but\nthat's still a lot of information.\n\n534\n00:24:45.706 --> 00:24:48.082\nWhat if we want to view\njust this specific rule?\n\n535\n00:24:48.082 --> 00:24:50.872\nWell, we can get even more granular,\nright?\n\n536\n00:24:50.872 --> 00:24:57.750\nSo this time what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna say name equals, all right?\n\n537\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:02.382\nAnd we're gonna do a predefined rule, and\nhere's where and you'll see what Mike was\n\n538\n00:25:02.382 --> 00:25:06.001\ntalking about, what we're talking\nabout what the quotes there.\n\n539\n00:25:06.001 --> 00:25:09.366\nWe're gonna do Network Discovery and\n\n540\n00:25:09.366 --> 00:25:15.770\nwe'll do the Link Local Multicast\nName Resolution Protocol.\n\n541\n00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.370\nAnd we'll do UDP, cuz it's\nrelatively insecure protocol, right?\n\n542\n00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.060\nConnection list.\n\n543\n00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.751\nAnd there we go.\n\n544\n00:25:24.751 --> 00:25:26.332\nNow notice what this did.\n\n545\n00:25:26.332 --> 00:25:29.539\nIt didn't just filter it by profile.\n\n546\n00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:34.499\nIt shows me the profiles that it's\nassociated with, which tells me, and\n\n547\n00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:38.990\nit might make sense if you understand\nwhat this protocol is doing.\n\n548\n00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.240\nWell, you know it actually\ndoes apply to all profiles.\n\n549\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.740\nI noticed that the domain is\nactually lumped in here with public.\n\n550\n00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.760\nSo, it did output to all of\nthe profiles that you can see,\n\n551\n00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.320\nand you can see the current state.\n\n552\n00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.550\nBut again,\nwhat if we wanna get more specific?\n\n553\n00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.160\nWell now I can go a little bit farther,\n\n554\n00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.260\nand remember the rule\nthat we just created?\n\n555\n00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.595\nThat Mike couldn't catch because\nhe couldn't read fast enough?\n\n556\n00:25:58.595 --> 00:26:01.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, well now, I can say well,\n\n557\n00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.610\nwhat's that rule?\n\n558\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.990\nAnd where does it apply?\n\n559\n00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.320\nIs it enabled on this profile or\nthat profile?\n\n560\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.210\nWell, it tells me right away that guess\nwhat, it's an outbound direction.\n\n561\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:15.310\nYou can find it on all of\nthe profiles that it's\n\n562\n00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:19.600\ncurrently turned on as\nwell as how it applies.\n\n563\n00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.735\nYou can get really, really granular\nif you need to find the output,\n\n564\n00:26:22.735 --> 00:26:26.420\nyou don't have to output everything cuz,\nagain, very verbose information.\n\n565\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.829\nIt might make it actually more complex and\n\n566\n00:26:27.829 --> 00:26:29.450\nyou would be better using\nthe GUI at that point.\n\n567\n00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:34.039\nBut if you get real specific, you can\nfilter it out to more, and you can look at\n\n568\n00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:38.289\nit line by line, page by page, or\nyou can say, find the specific rule.\n\n569\n00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:39.122\nI keep saying profile.\n\n570\n00:26:39.122 --> 00:26:41.940\nFind the specific rule,\nwhether it be one that's built in or\n\n571\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.360\none that is something\nthat you've configured.\n\n572\n00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.530\nSo, you can really get granular with it.\n\n573\n00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.660\nGood thing to have.\n\n574\n00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.660\nNet sh, advanced firewall options so\n\n575\n00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.260\nif you do have something like a server\ncore installation out there or\n\n576\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.990\nlike Mike says, you want to automate\nsomething through scripting it out.\n\n577\n00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.330\nThis will be the way to go because there's\nreally no way to script out all those\n\n578\n00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.370\nbutton clicks in a GUI.\n\n579\n00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.790\nSo that's gonna be limiting.\n\n580\n00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.460\nBut you know you have those options and\nI would take advantage of it.\n\n581\n00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:05.980\n>> Absolutely.\n\n582\n00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.598\nGreat information there, Wes.\n\n583\n00:27:07.598 --> 00:27:11.210\nGood to be able to work with this stuff\nfrom that command line interface,\n\n584\n00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.100\nlike Wes said, when that GUI's not\navailable or when I want to script it.\n\n585\n00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.720\nIf somebody calls me up and says,\nhey I need to know what all the domain,\n\n586\n00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.490\nmake sure these specific rules\nare being applied to machine B,\n\n587\n00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.250\nI've got a script ready to go.\n\n588\n00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.610\nI can just run it and I'm good to go.\n\n589\n00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:26.430\nLove it.\nAll right, Wes.\n\n590\n00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.550\nWell, great information there.\n\n591\n00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.650\nThanks for teaching us all about\nworking with that good old netsh from\n\n592\n00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.430\nthe command line interface.\n\n593\n00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.122\nHope you guys out there enjoyed watching,\nI know we had a good time filming it.\n\n594\n00:27:35.122 --> 00:27:38.122\nBut, for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n595\n00:27:38.122 --> 00:27:39.123\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n596\n00:27:39.123 -->

here at ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:20.360\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're looking at Windows 10 security.\n\n5\n00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.220\nAnd specifically managing their security\nfrom a command line interface and\n\n6\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.320\nwe're gonna be continuing on, we've\nalready done some episodes we're showing\n\n7\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.260\nyou some really cool netsh commands or\n\n8\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.600\nyou can work with those firewall settings\nfrom that command line interface and today\n\n9\n00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.630\nwe're gonna take a look at working with\nWindows Defender from the command line and\n\n10\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.100\nwho better than Mr.\nWes Bryan to guide us through that.\n\n11\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.210\n>> This is one that kinda slips under the\nradar the fact that we talk about working\n\n12\n00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.810\nwith the windows defender from\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n13\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.230\nI am sure some of you are familiar\nwith the interface itself out there.\n\n14\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.840\nSame here with me, familiar launching\nit up from the control panel, but\n\n15\n00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.480\nbelieve it or not you actually have\na command that let's you run your scans.\n\n16\n00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.120\nAll inside of the command prompt and\n\n17\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.970\nthat's one of the things we wanna look at\nso when we get into the command prompt\n\n18\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.250\nhere you have to navigate down into where\nthe Windows Defender executable is.\n\n19\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.020\nSo, let's go ahead and\nshow you how that's done.\n\n20\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.000\nI'm here at the root of c if you will and\nI'm just gonna do a cd and change here,\n\n21\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.660\nwe're gonna change to the program files.\n\n22\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.120\nWe'll go ahead and go in there and\nthen we'll do a cd,\n\n23\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.560\nand I'm sure I could of\nlumped all these together.\n\n24\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.820\nBut, we'll do the Windows Defender here.\n\n25\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.430\nAnd once we are in here.\n\n26\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.930\nSee if I'm gonna make\na mistake doing that.\n\n27\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.430\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.190\n>> You're gonna see.\n\n29\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.520\nYou never know when you do a DIR what\n\n30\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.840\nyou're gonna find inside\nof the directory here.\n\n31\n00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.390\nBut there should be, in here,\nan MPCMD and there it is right there,\n\n32\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.010\nthat's actually the Windows Defender\nexecutable here.\n\n33\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.170\nSo, that's what we're gonna\nbe working with here today.\n\n34\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.150\nSo, what are some of\nthe things that we can do,\n\n35\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.820\nwell we can set all of our skins right,\nin other episodes we've talked about using\n\n36\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.340\nthat Windows Defender What\nthe different types of scans are,\n\n37\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.980\nwhat do they mean for us, and in what\nscenarios might we use one over the other?\n\n38\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.970\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n39\n00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.860\nI think one of the first things I'm\ngonna do is go ahead and start a scan.\n\n40\n00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.670\nFairly easy to do here.\n\n41\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.640\nJust remember what the command it is.\n\n42\n00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.500\nIt's mpcmd there, and it's run.exe.\n\n43\n00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.480\nAnd I'll do a -scan and we'll do -1 and\nnotice it's starting to scan.\n\n44\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.586\nWell, Mike what does that -1 mean?\n\n45\n00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:26.830\nYou know,\n\n46\n00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.460\nI've just typed it in there -1 you know\nit doesn't really mean much to us, right.\n\n47\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.960\n>> You wanna know on a one time?\n\n48\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.052\n>> You wanna know on a one\ntime that's right so [LAUGH].\n\n49\n00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:41.180\nInside of the Graphical User Interface\nProbably familiar with the text\n\n50\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.390\nthat we have in the GUI, right?\n\n51\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.700\nCustomized scan, quick scan, full scan.\n\n52\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.420\nWell, we have options in here\nthat we can run these as well.\n\n53\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.510\nNow, let me go ahead and\nwhat I'm gonna do while that's.\n\n54\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.940\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncancel that scan here just to show you\n\n55\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.688\nhow you can fire off and start a scan but\nwe're gonna use our legendary /?\n\n56\n00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:01.285\nand I want to show you\nsome of the options.\n\n57\n00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:06.320\nNow, lot of options, you can get very,\nvery specific in what you're doing here.\n\n58\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.370\nBut, I want to make mention of this one\nas we scroll back up here because this is\n\n59\n00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.080\nsomething that's not in,\nlet's say a Windows 7 Box.\n\n60\n00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.410\nIn fact, I was kind of surprised,\ncuz I did work with it in Windows 7,\n\n61\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.710\nI used the GUI, right?\n\n62\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.065\nYou open up Windows 7 and you run this\ncommand and there is a number missing.\n\n63\n00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:26.353\nIt goes 0, 1, 2.\n\n64\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.620\nWell, what's up with the three.\n\n65\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.580\nThe three is where they\nintroduce the custom scan.\n\n66\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.070\nIf I want I can do a customized scan it's\nno different there than any other scan,\n\n67\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.760\nyou know the customized scan you would do\ninside of the graphical user interface.\n\n68\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.540\nThe zero, what do the zero mean?\n\n69\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.720\nWell the zero is whatever the default\nscan is that you have set.\n\n70\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.620\nSo, I didn't even have to look at it.\n\n71\n00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.990\nWhatever your default is I don't even have\nto know what the graphical user interface.\n\n72\n00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.530\nIf I do it scan dash zero it's gonna\nsay just use the default that's\n\n73\n00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.190\nalready preset.\n\n74\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.420\nI use the dash one right?\n\n75\n00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.330\nDoesn't mean run one time\nlike you would think.\n\n76\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.030\nWhat that means as you can\nsee here is run a quick scan.\n\n77\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.050\nSo, that's what we just did.\n\n78\n00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.670\nWhen we ran that we said\nrun a quick scan One of\n\n79\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.760\nthe cool things that we introduced\nin the new windows defender.\n\n80\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.760\nWhen I say windows defender let\nme be a specific on that and\n\n81\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.340\nsay the command prompt, right?\n\n82\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.990\nIt's been in the interface for\na while, the graphical user interface.\n\n83\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.980\nBut they gave us a little bit more\ncontrol, and that's the customized scan.\n\n84\n00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.100\nI can actually set a customized skin,\nyou might say, wait a second Wess What's\n\n85\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.830\nnew about the customized skin, and what\nyou can see here is the dash three option,\n\n86\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.950\nwe've had customized skin for\na while so what's new about it?\n\n87\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.560\nWell, imagine the ability\nto do a boot sector scan.\n\n88\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.450\nRight and\nsome of the other security classes, and\n\n89\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.930\nwe'll even talk about some of\nthe malware briefly here in this course.\n\n90\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.580\nAll right.\n\n91\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.230\nWhat if I have something that runs before?\n\n92\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.810\nA virus that runs before\nthe operating system even starts.\n\n93\n00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.030\nAnd that is one of the additions that\nthey added, an additional parameter,\n\n94\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.160\nif you will, to the customized scan here.\n\n95\n00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.850\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n96\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.940\nYeah, I love being able to work from\nthe command line, as you know, Wes,\n\n97\n00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.740\nand You know one of the things\nI like to tell people is\n\n98\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.080\nyou probably use the graphical\nuser interface before.\n\n99\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.620\nThink about that as you're going through\nthese commands because all the same\n\n100\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.230\nquestions that you have\nto answer in that GUI,\n\n101\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.410\nyou're going to answer the command prompt,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.940\nWhen you open up that wizard you have\nto choose, do I want to do a full scan,\n\n103\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.530\na quick scan, a custom scan?\n\n104\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.440\nYou gotta do the same thing, here.\n\n105\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.660\nIt has to know what you want to do.\n\n106\n00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.180\nAnd so I think being familiar with the\nwizard can definitely help you remember\n\n107\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.590\nwhat options you have to\ndo from the command prompt.\n\n108\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.400\nAnd then, as you said, sometimes we\ncan even get some options that aren't\n\n109\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.780\navailable in the Gooey that are only\navailable through that command prompt.\n\n110\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.800\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n111\n00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.720\nWe've said it before, right?\n\n112\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.040\nWhen it comes to\na graphically user interface,\n\n113\n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.180\nit's limited to whatever the coder in that\nprogram included in the functionalities.\n\n114\n00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.850\nOne of the benefits in the other CLI\nthat we used today, power shell right?\n\n115\n00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.480\nDifferences today a lot of your\ninterfaces are built off of power shell.\n\n116\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.330\nSo, your limited really inside of the\ngooey to whatever application developers\n\n117\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.780\nput inside of the software.\n\n118\n00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.710\nSo, it's good to have it.\n\n119\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.640\nAnd again saying that we're\nnot talking about third party.\n\n120\n00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.200\nWe're talking about in\nher inside of windows.\n\n121\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.510\nAnd one of the good things in that\nyou can't do in a customized scan\n\n122\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.380\nin the gooey it to say,\nyou know what I want to scan.\n\n123\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.540\nI'm going to do a custom scan,\nwhich you can do obviously.\n\n124\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.890\nThen I am going to type in an option\nthat says boot sector scan.\n\n125\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.530\nAll right, and notice it starts scanning.\n\n126\n00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.900\nIt's going to check that boot partition\nright where data boot viruses,\n\n127\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.430\nboot loader viruses, like to get in and\nthat's one of the great things.\n\n128\n00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.370\nBeing able to check that boot sector in a\ncustomized scan where you otherwise don't\n\n129\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.850\nhave that option even available\ninside of a graphical user interface\n\n130\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.760\n>> Yes, very good,\n\n131\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.990\nand then of course what I always like to\ntalk about too is the fact that I could\n\n132\n00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.720\n>> And script this.\n\n133\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.210\nRight?\nIf I've got a machine that\n\n134\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.330\nI think might be infected,\nI wanna run a scan on it.\n\n135\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.740\nI can simply remote in that machine or\nbe at that machine.\n\n136\n00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.420\nI've already got this file created with\nall my scan options that I wanna do.\n\n137\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.970\nIt's sitting up in a network share.\n\n138\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.396\nI just go to that machine and I reach out\nand grab that share and I run that scan.\n\n139\n00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:56.880\nI don't have to take the time\nto go through the wizard and\n\n140\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.990\nanswer all those questions again, right.\n\n141\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.380\nI've got pre built scan parameters\nalready configured in my script.\n\n142\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.960\nI simply have to run them.\n\n143\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.930\n>> It makes it easier right?\n\n144\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.980\nThe least administrative\neffort is what we want and\n\n145\n00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.940\nit's definitely why they ask you in\nthe Windows or Microsoft environment.\n\n146\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.700\nOne of the options that they've added here\nin the newer Command line interface for\n\n147\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.000\nWindows Defender is the ability\nto defer updates, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.600\nIn the earlier versions you\ncould remove an update, but\n\n149\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.820\none of the things that you\ncouldn't do is just start a scan.\n\n150\n00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.030\nNotice that, in fact, let me go ahead and\njust stop this here real quick, and\n\n151\n00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.270\nI'm just gonna use my up arrow.\n\n152\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.919\nNotice it starts scanning\nright away there, Mike?\n\n153\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.580\nIn the earlier versions of this if\nyour signatures weren't up to date,\n\n154\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.310\nyou start this scan,\nit's says downloading signatures.\n\n155\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.780\nIt didn't give you the option.\n\n156\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.130\nWhat if you know your antivirus software,\nfor the most part,\n\n157\n00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.560\nwhat if you did an update maybe a few\nminutes ago before you even started this.\n\n158\n00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.300\nWell, you don't want it to wait, connect\nand check, I want to know right away.\n\n159\n00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.070\nSo, what they did is\nthey separated that out.\n\n160\n00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.990\nAnd then you'll say wait a second don't\nyou have the ability to do signature\n\n161\n00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.500\nupdates inside of the command line?\n\n162\n00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.000\nYes, you can.\n\n163\n00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.930\nBut it doesn't happen by default.\n\n164\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.370\nNow, so what we can do here, and agin\nthis is fairly easy, let me go ahead and\n\n165\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.820\njust control C this here right?\n\n166\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.330\nAnd if I decide that I want to\nrun a signature update I can\n\n167\n00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.520\ntell Windows defender here, I can say\nall right, we're gonna do our MPCNB run.\n\n168\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.470\nAnd you know guys, I keep typing the exe,\nit's force of habit.\n\n169\n00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.590\nIt's implied, you really don't have to,\nbut I'm just kind of doing it for\n\n170\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.520\nforce of habit here.\n\n171\n00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.390\nAnd then what I can do is choose\nan option that says, signature,\n\n172\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.260\nmaybe if I can type it, signature update.\n\n173\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.020\nAnd I can run this.\n\n174\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.380\nAnd notice it's a signatures\nupdate started.\n\n175\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.090\nIn the earlier versions of\nthis command line interface or\n\n176\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.810\nin this program it would\nstart that without you.\n\n177\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.080\nYou started the scan the first thing\nit would do is that right there.\n\n178\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.900\nWell, what if you got a slow link?\n\n179\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.639\nRight, what if you you're\ncompany has a meter bandwidth\n\n180\n00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.120\nWell every time I run\na scan I don't want it\n\n181\n00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.790\nto have to wait to do an update\nbefore it can even start the scan.\n\n182\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.690\nIf I can even connect down pound.\n\n183\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.950\n>> You know if we've pulled it off the\nnetwork it's not connected because it's\n\n184\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.310\npossibly infected I want to scan\nit I can do updates, right?\n\n185\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.890\n>> Very good point, yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.850\nWhat if you're right?\n\n187\n00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.070\nDon't plug that thing into my network.\n\n188\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.580\nWe're gonna want to scan it first.\n\n189\n00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.900\nI don't want to give you network access.\n\n190\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.910\nSo, that's one of,\nthat's actually a very good feature.\n\n191\n00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.100\nNow, what if you want to find\nout have your definitions been\n\n192\n00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.890\nimported from these locations.\n\n193\n00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.610\nWell we have what's known as maps.\n\n194\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.810\nAnd maps there is your Microsoft\nacu protection service.\n\n195\n00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:35.400\nYou might have heard it before and\nwhen you automatically do Windows Update.\n\n196\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.830\nWindows Defender is part\nof dynamic security.\n\n197\n00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.870\nWhen you update the definitions or\nexcuse me I probably say this a little bit\n\n198\n00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.550\nbetter when you use Windows\nupdate It automatically updates\n\n199\n00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.160\nthe signatures dynamically,\nwhich is a great thing to have because\n\n200\n00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.940\nsometimes that's an option that you have\nto turn on in other antivirus software.\n\n201\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.560\nYou might now know that it's there.\n\n202\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.200\nThank goodness once you turn on Windows\nUpdates, today it automatically does that.\n\n203\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.770\nBut if I wanna list maybe signatures that\nare in this in your Windows defender\n\n204\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:10.220\ndatabase here that have been added\ndynamically through something like maps.\n\n205\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.000\nI can add a different option.\n\n206\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.730\nI can come in here and\nI can say list all dynamics.\n\n207\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:20.230\nMaybe.\n\n208\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.180\nSignatures and it's not case sensitive\nby the way guys I'm just type it.\n\n209\n00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.350\nTrying to type this to give myself a\nchance even a prayer here in typing this.\n\n210\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.080\nSo, let me make sure that's\nright dynamic signatures.\n\n211\n00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.730\nAll right now notice it says no\ndynamic signatures on this machine.\n\n212\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.880\nNow, one of the things\nthat you can see is if\n\n213\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.410\nthat Microsoft active protection software.\n\n214\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:43.910\nWhat does it do?\n\n215\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.710\nYou send anonymous statistics.\n\n216\n00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.500\nYou might have seen it when\nyou're setting up Defender.\n\n217\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.190\nIt says do you wanna send usage\nstatistics out to Microsoft and\n\n218\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.510\nthey keep track of this information.\n\n219\n00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.830\nWell, if the maps community.\n\n220\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.490\nWhich is a community at large\nthat Microsoft oversees.\n\n221\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.460\nHave found definitions.\n\n222\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.210\nOr they found viruses and they wanna\nadd to the community database there.\n\n223\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:00.980\nDid it come in there?\n\n224\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.560\nDid these definitions come\nin from that location?\n\n225\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.110\nAnd you can see right here that\nit's just integrating with\n\n226\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.580\nWindows the update service, here.\n\n227\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.070\nAnd we don't have any of\nthese dynamic signatures.\n\n228\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.490\nSo, a couple other things\nthat you can do here.\n\n229\n00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.990\nRemember your scans.\n\n230\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.980\nYou know what type of scan you're\nrunning and thank goodness today,\n\n231\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.510\nyou don't to run a signature\nupdate every time you run a scan\n\n232\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.330\njust like Mike said it if\nyou got maybe a laptop.\n\n233\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.420\nRight.\nYou're laptop you've got a corporate\n\n234\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.540\nwindows 10 machine that you're, you've got\na tele commuter, you've got people that\n\n235\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.790\nroute all over the world,\nthey connect in somebody else's network.\n\n236\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.830\nI don't want them to turn around and\n\n237\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.900\nconnect back to my network\nbefore they can do their scans.\n\n238\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.170\nI want to do their scans and I want to\nforce these scans to happen So, it's good\n\n239\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.030\nthat they kinda diverted that, and if you\nwanna do a signature update you can do it.\n\n240\n00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.930\nSo, lot of new features in\nthe windows ten defender if you will.\n\n241\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:52.380\nInside of the command prompt that you can\nuse if you know the options are there,\n\n242\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.960\nand I would take advantage of them.\n\n243\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.600\n>> Very good, that's great stuff Weis.\n\n244\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.620\nThe ability to work with windows defender\nfrom that command line interface.\n\n245\n00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.320\nGives the [INAUDIBLE]\nthe ability to do those scans.\n\n246\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.920\nLike you said from a command line and\n\n247\n00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.406\nscript to start automating that now\nif we need to so always great, Wes.\n\n248\n00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:08.163\nAnything else we wanna throw in there?\n\n249\n00:12:08.163 --> 00:12:10.650\n>> No, I think that's pretty\nmuch [INAUDIBLE] again\n\n250\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.910\njust make sure that whatever scanning\nsoftware you're using that you are using\n\n251\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.920\none whether using it from the command\nprompt or using for the GUI.\n\n252\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.090\nIf you set it and forget it, it's good but\nif you forget to set it, it's a bad day.\n\n253\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.900\nSo, just make sure you've got some kind\nof active protection, you'll be good.\n\n254\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.820\n>> Very good.\n\n255\n00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.950\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen\nthat's going to do it for this one.\n\n256\n00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:38.550\nSigning off for IT Pro TV I'm Mike Rodrick\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n",
