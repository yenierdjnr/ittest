Very good, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.050\nWhen it comes to this course, it's really\ngonna be for anybody that wants a better\n\n9\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.254\nunderstanding of the security mechanisms\nthat are inside of Windows 10.\n\n10\n00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:32.600\nKeep in mind that this isn't really\nfocused at any different skill level.\n\n11\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.730\nYou could be entry level, if you will.\n\n12\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.270\nMaybe somebody that just kinda home user\nif you will what is a little bit more\n\n13\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.840\ninterested in how you can secure your\nWindows 10 machines around the home.\n\n14\n00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.910\nYou could be an employer or\nan employee for that matter,\n\n15\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.190\nthat maybe you want to stand out\na little bit more than the rest and\n\n16\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.380\nbuild your skills inside of Windows\n10 by learning how to secure it.\n\n17\n00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.350\nAgain, like I said employers too.\n\n18\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.490\nIt could be managers as well, so this\nreally isn't focused to any one person.\n\n19\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.620\nAnd when it comes to the skill levels\nitself there aren't any prerequisites,\n\n20\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.330\nso it's a good way to kinda up your\nskills when it comes to security.\n\n21\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.430\nNow, what are some of the topics\nthat we're gonna look at?\n\n22\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.670\nWell, we're gonna look at various topics,\nthings like data security, authentication\n\n23\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.530\nand some of the authentication mechanisms\nthat you can see inside of Windows.\n\n24\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.820\nWe're gonna look at some\nconcepts like host security.\n\n25\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.990\nWhat does it mean to get your\noperating system secure so\n\n26\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.820\nyou're less vulnerable to some of\nthe attacks that are out there?\n\n27\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.870\nAs well as things like\napplication security.\n\n28\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.360\nNot only host security is important,\nbut the applications and\n\n29\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.030\nthe software that runs with inside of the\nWindows operating system is gonna be very,\n\n30\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.430\nvery important to be able to secure them.\n\n31\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.770\nWe'll look at concepts like some of\nthe enterprise-level concepts as well,\n\n32\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.320\nlike group policy, how about web browsers?\n\n33\n00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.620\nEverybody out there has used a web browser\nonce or twice I'm sure, so we're also\n\n34\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.260\ngonna look at things like web browser\nsecurity and functionalities that you can\n\n35\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.350\nuse to maybe even enhance your experience\ninside of the web browser itself.\n\n36\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.130\nWe'll look at things\nlike account management.\n\n37\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.820\nDo you know how to create user account,\nand some of the things that you can do to\n\n38\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.770\nrestrict to the access that a user might\nhave, if they're using the computers.\n\n39\n00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.290\nFor instance, maybe you have a child\nthat's logging into the machine,\n\n40\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.370\nyou wanna be able to control\nthe user experience that they have,\n\n41\n00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.630\nmake it a little bit more safe for them.\n\n42\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.940\nSo we'll look at things like\nbasic account management.\n\n43\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.720\nNow, Ronnie, we're gonna have all\nother kinds of things there, but\n\n44\n00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.730\nthese are some of the high level of\ntopics that you can expect to see\n\n45\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.810\ninstead of the Windows 10 security.\n\n46\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.840\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, is this particular\nshow then exam-focused or\n\n47\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.630\ndo we have to worry about anything like?\n\n48\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, this one is one that kinda\ndeviates from other things like our\n\n49\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.130\nWindows 10 courses that we have that are\nspecific to the MCSE and specific exams.\n\n50\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.620\nThis really isn't exam-centric.\n\n51\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.500\nKeep in mind, however, that you always\nbenefit, if you are out there right now\n\n52\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.720\nmaybe currently studying for a Windows 10\ncertification, well, this can benefit you\n\n53\n00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.540\nbut keep in mind that we're not gonna be\nfollowing things like skills measured and\n\n54\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.840\nthe objectives that you would\nfind in those certifications.\n\n55\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.710\nBut more information is always better\ninformation so if you wanna learn a little\n\n56\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.205\nbit more about Windows 10 security, stick\naround cuz we got a lot more coming up.\n\n57\n00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:07.424\n[NOISE]\n\n",
