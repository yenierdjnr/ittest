00:00:10.783\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:15.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.570\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.650\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.360\nHere today with a very special\nseries that we're kicking off,\n\n8\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.550\nwhich is Windows Hello for Business.\n\n9\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.210\nAnd I've got a special guest\nhere in the studio with us, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.100\nMike Stephens, who's gonna be helping\nus kinda walk through Windows Hello for\n\n11\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.240\nBusiness and see what it can do for us.\n\n12\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.080\nMike, thanks for\njoining us in the studios.\n\n13\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.450\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Don,\nit's a pleasure to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920\n&gt;&gt; And what's on our agenda for\ntoday as far as where to get started?\n\n15\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, Windows Hello for Business\nis a new thing that we brought out.\n\n16\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.410\nAnd this is going to,\nbasically it's a password replacement.\n\n17\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.780\nWe're targeting users on passwords.\n\n18\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.020\nAnd so what we're gonna do today\nis talk about the concepts\n\n19\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.840\nof leading up to Windows Hello.\n\n20\n00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.845\nAnd why we need Windows Hello\nin the infrastructure today?\n\n21\n00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:04.650\nAnd the first thing here is to talk\nabout password itself because you have\n\n22\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.580\na problem.\n\n23\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.830\nAnd when you have a problem,\nyou need to solve that problem.\n\n24\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.290\nSo our first thing today is talk\nabout that passwords are bad.\n\n25\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.140\nWe've been using passwords for\n20 something years.\n\n26\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.650\nAnd there's just the go to.\n\n27\n00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.410\nThey're reliable on the sense that\nmost of use have figured out how to\n\n28\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.080\ncreate a password that's\nsemi-strong enough.\n\n29\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.960\nAnd we just have hard time\ngetting off of them because so\n\n30\n00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.080\nmuch of the infrastructure\ndepends on the password.\n\n31\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.510\nAnd so today what we need to do is\nlook at why is the password so bad and\n\n32\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.040\nwhy do we need to get off of that?\n\n33\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.570\nAnd so what we really need to do\nis break down what a password is.\n\n34\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.350\nAnd at the end of the day,\na password is just a symmetric key.\n\n35\n00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.773\nWe type in a password that we know,\nso it's like my favorite dog or\n\n36\n00:01:43.773 --> 00:01:45.690\nsomething to that effect.\n\n37\n00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.680\nBut underneath the covers that password\nis hashed with a hashing algorithm or\n\n38\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.880\nwe use a key derivation like PBKDF2 and\n\n39\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.280\nwe throw some salt in there, and\nmaybe some additional entropy.\n\n40\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.140\nAnd the output of that\nis basically it's a key.\n\n41\n00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.820\nIt's a symmetric key,\nit's the secret that I know and\n\n42\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.859\nthat it's the secret that\nthe authenticating server knows.\n\n43\n00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.830\nAnd so that's server is just going to\ncompare that key to the key I typed\n\n44\n00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.040\nin after doing all this computational\nstuff and that's how we authenticate.\n\n45\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.780\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know you said we've\nbeen using passwords for 20 years,\n\n46\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.860\nprobably longer for certain things.\n\n47\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.780\nYou watch the old war spy movies where\nthey had the password response type thing.\n\n48\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.650\nThat technology's been around a long time.\n\n49\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.700\nIt's far more advanced\nnow than it used to be.\n\n50\n00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.650\nYou mentioned hashes and\nsalts and all that.\n\n51\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.430\nSo, if we have a highly\nsecured password like that,\n\n52\n00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.740\nwhy isn't that a good technology for\nauthentication?\n\n53\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.840\n&gt;&gt; So, it's not a good technology for\nauthentication because there are three\n\n54\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.280\ncomponents that we've looked at when\nwe did Windows Hello for Business.\n\n55\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.850\nAnd one is passwords are phishable.\n\n56\n00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.620\nYou can trick somebody into\ngiving you your password.\n\n57\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.000\nThe other thing is\npasswords are replayable.\n\n58\n00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.780\nThe great things about\npasswords is thy are portable,\n\n59\n00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.685\nhe bad thing is that they are portable.\n\n60\n00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:01.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once I get one, I can use it anywhere,\n\n61\n00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.350\nand so if I happen to know\nDon's password I can go back\n\n62\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.180\nto Washington in my office and\nI can pretend to be Don.\n\n63\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.510\nAnd it works.\n\n64\n00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.000\n&gt;&gt; At that point the computer has no\nway of knowing whether it's you or\n\n65\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.990\nme because all it's checking for\nis a password.\n\n66\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.310\nIf you've got my password,\nit thinks you're me.\n\n67\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.760\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a single factor.\n\n68\n00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.160\nIt's just, I just know that you typed in a\nuser identity and you typed in a password,\n\n69\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.980\nand on the back-end server that's doing\nthe authentication that password worked.\n\n70\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.810\nAnd so it has no other choice but\nto let that user in.\n\n71\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.390\nThe other thing that it is,\n\n72\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.920\nis that we talked about that there\nare phishable and what the big thing and\n\n73\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.540\nwhat we've seen in a lot of the TV\ntoday is they're breachable.\n\n74\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.040\nLike I said,\nin that talk about the password.\n\n75\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.280\nWhen I create a password and we do all\nthat crypto underneath, that password\n\n76\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.130\nstill has to be stored on the back end so\nit knows how to authenticate me.\n\n77\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.690\nAnd so that's become a very big target.\n\n78\n00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.270\nWe've had quite a few things that\nwe've heard in the news about people\n\n79\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.900\nhaving identity theft because\nthese breaches on these servers.\n\n80\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.790\nSo the idea of Windows Hello\nis to go to not one factor or\n\n81\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.120\nsingle factor but two factors of\nauthentication and we'll get into that.\n\n82\n00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.530\nBut the point is that two\nfactors of authentication and\n\n83\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.391\ndesign it in the way to where we can\ntry to move forward to, non-phishable,\n\n84\n00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:19.100\nnon-replayable and non-breachable.\n\n85\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.590\nSo with that I want to go into, this is\nwhere we have this whole password thing\n\n86\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.420\nand so why I wanted to just\ngive the users or viewers,\n\n87\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.030\nI should say, give the viewers a view of\nhow passwords are easily breached today.\n\n88\n00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.320\nI have this little PowerPoint animation\nhere that we can show you here.\n\n89\n00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.640\nAnd my head's covering up the bottom\nthere, but we'll get to that.\n\n90\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.060\nSo here we have this is,\n\n91\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.000\nhumans are humans, and\nwe don't like to use complex passwords.\n\n92\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.210\nAnd the problem is,\nwe end up using the same password over and\n\n93\n00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.210\nover again, because, well, we remember it.\n\n94\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.220\nSo the problem here is,\nI use the password at Bank.com.\n\n95\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.280\nI'll also use that same password all\nthe way through my social media,\n\n96\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.400\nmaybe some other things, but\n\n97\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.050\nthen I go to this one obscure sight that\nI only need to do one or two things.\n\n98\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.250\nBut, like a lot of sights, they make me\nwant to actually sign in with something.\n\n99\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.370\nAnd so, I use the same password,\ncuz it's easy to remember.\n\n100\n00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.880\nWell, while we think of our bank being\na very secure and very trustworthy entity.\n\n101\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.380\nAs we go down this list here on the right\nside, we start getting our level of trust\n\n102\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.170\nstarts to diminish until we\ngo to Obscure.com, which,\n\n103\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.610\nI don't know what they are but there was\nsomething on the website I wanted to see.\n\n104\n00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.140\nAnd so what happens is,\n\n105\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.970\nnow the attacker, he's just gonna find\nthe weakest link in all of these.\n\n106\n00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.280\nHe's not gonna go directly to the bank\nbecause banks they are tasked with\n\n107\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.320\nmaking sure that people don't breach.\n\n108\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.847\nSo what we wanna do then is that\nbasically the attacker finds Obscure.com,\n\n109\n00:05:42.847 --> 00:05:44.550\nhacks that password.\n\n110\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.720\nAnd now all of a sudden,\nas we alluded to in the intro here,\n\n111\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.372\nthat attacker can be me anywhere,\nall over the place.\n\n112\n00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:53.770\nBank.com, Social.com.\n\n113\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.997\nAnd so now, what ends up happening is that\nI'm actually compromised at that point and\n\n114\n00:05:58.997 --> 00:06:01.465\nmy identity is gone on multiple sites and\n\n115\n00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:04.900\nthen you just have this\nrunaway identity problem here.\n\n116\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.820\n&gt;&gt; And there's been some high\nvisibility instances of this lately.\n\n117\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.000\nI know Apple was subjected to this\nwhere they were saying there were\n\n118\n00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.600\nhundreds of thousands of\naccounts were breached and\n\n119\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.020\nit turned out that they themselves\nweren't breached, it was other sites and\n\n120\n00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.660\nthrough password reuse they were able\nto compromise those credentials.\n\n121\n00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.610\nSo that's a real problem not just for\none company but for\n\n122\n00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.670\nevery company,\nevery organization that is out there.\n\n123\n00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.650\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point, Don, yeah,\nI mean the problem we have today\n\n124\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.200\nis that we are really,\nheavily dependent on passwords today.\n\n125\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.960\nAnd it's a big mountain to move, we've\n\n126\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.110\ndone several years of investigation on how\ncan we get to a world without passwords?\n\n127\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.620\nAnd it's not an easy task, it's going\nto take a lot of investigation in\n\n128\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.850\neach particular enterprise to figure\nout how they can move their business\n\n129\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.690\nfrom something that we call weak\ncredential, which is just user name and\n\n130\n00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.280\npassword to a strong credential,\nthat is, Windows Hello for Business.\n\n131\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.570\nSo what I wanna do and how is Windows\nHello for Business a strong credential?\n\n132\n00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.655\nWell, let's start with what's\ntwo factor authentication, or\n\n133\n00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:07.495\nbasically multi-factor authentication.\n\n134\n00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:09.606\nAnd there's a great document,\n\n135\n00:07:09.606 --> 00:07:15.485\nNIST SP800-171 has a definition of\nwhat multi-factor authentication is.\n\n136\n00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:17.125\nBut we can simplify it here.\n\n137\n00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:19.755\nBasically, it's something you have.\n\n138\n00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:24.765\nIt's typically a private key, and\nhighly recommended that it not be movable,\n\n139\n00:07:24.765 --> 00:07:27.855\nor secured by some sort\nof security device.\n\n140\n00:07:27.855 --> 00:07:33.070\nA common thing is a smart card, or\nperhaps a TPM inside the computer.\n\n141\n00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.600\nThe next thing that we have is something\nyou know and this can be a pin.\n\n142\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.790\nAnd these pins they kind of,\npeople get, well, pin and password,\n\n143\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.110\nthat's kind of confusing,\nisn't it the same?\n\n144\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.200\nAnd its really not because in these\nscenarios where you're doing multifactor\n\n145\n00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.280\nauthentication, the pin is actually\nentropy, it's not really stored anywhere.\n\n146\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.200\nIt's basing on the fact that the user\nis going to provide this entropy that\n\n147\n00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.440\nhas been given during\na time of provisioning.\n\n148\n00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.744\nAnd it will use that entropy to do\nsome sort of computation that will\n\n149\n00:08:00.744 --> 00:08:04.524\neventually then say, yes,\nthat is the user, because they knew this.\n\n150\n00:08:04.524 --> 00:08:08.430\nIt doesn't have to compare\nThe PIN to a stored PIN.\n\n151\n00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.008\nAnd then,\n\n152\n00:08:09.008 --> 00:08:13.540\nthe final thing that we have here is that\nit's something that is a part of you.\n\n153\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.270\nIn this case, Windows Hello, we have\nability to where we can tie Windows Hello\n\n154\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.800\nfor Business to use biometrics.\n\n155\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.145\nSo then you could sign in with your face,\nor you can do fingerprint reader.\n\n156\n00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:26.835\nSo it's a very fluid and easy motion,\nand it's kind of very futuristic for us,\n\n157\n00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:29.965\nbecause you get to go and show all your\nrelatives how you just sign into your\n\n158\n00:08:29.965 --> 00:08:32.555\ncomputer using your face,\nor using a fingerprint.\n\n159\n00:08:32.555 --> 00:08:34.355\nAnd it's very, very cool.\n\n160\n00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:37.845\nSo, the objective, and\nwhen we did Windows Hello for Business,\n\n161\n00:08:37.845 --> 00:08:42.851\nwas to basically work on those\nthree pillars of non-fishable,\n\n162\n00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:46.790\nnon-replayable, and\nbasically non-breachable.\n\n163\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.030\nAnd the way we do that is we start\nwith the something you have.\n\n164\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.810\nWindows Hello for\n\n165\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:56.160\nBusiness is essentially going to create\na private key in the computer's TPM.\n\n166\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.420\nSo we support TPM 1.2 and 2.0.\n\n167\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.825\nAnd for older machines we do\nsupport a fallback to software.\n\n168\n00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:07.540\nAlthough for enterprises we have group\npolicies that will actually allow them to\n\n169\n00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.650\nforce a hardware one where you\nwon't fall back to software.\n\n170\n00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.250\nBut we have to keep in\nmind that everybody's\n\n171\n00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.130\ncomputer refresh cycle is\nnot what it's going to be.\n\n172\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.595\n&gt;&gt; And I think at this point pretty much\nevery computer made in the last three to\n\n173\n00:09:19.595 --> 00:09:21.198\nfive years should have a TPM in it.\n\n174\n00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:24.551\nIt's kind of becoming more of a rarity to\nfind a computer that doesn't have a TPM\n\n175\n00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:25.990\nintegrated, right?\n\n176\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.736\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just depends on\nwhere you procure your hardware.\n\n177\n00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:33.710\nTPMs, when you do a build of materials for\nthese laptops and everything,\n\n178\n00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.690\nthese manufacturers are cutting costs.\n\n179\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.090\nA TPM might be $0.17, but\nthat's $0.17 to the bottom line.\n\n180\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.400\nSo you definitely want to make sure that\nwhen you are looking at Windows Hello for\n\n181\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.370\nBusiness and upgrading your hardware\nthat you make sure that you call out to\n\n182\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:53.130\nthat vendor that you want a TPM,\nand preferably you want a TPM 2.0.\n\n183\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.660\nI know that Microsoft has recently changed\ntheir hardware guidelines where TPM 2.0\n\n184\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.530\nis what we are recommending for\nWindows Logo PCs right now.\n\n185\n00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.060\nAnd TPM 2.0 is just\na better version all out.\n\n186\n00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.120\nIt doesn't lock out as easy, it has better\nperformances, it supports more crypto.\n\n187\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.160\nSo, it's just a better overall thing.\n\n188\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.870\nBut we know that it's gonna\nbe a gradual movement\n\n189\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.220\nbefore you get from TPM 1.2 to 2.0.\n\n190\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.980\nBut most PCs in an enterprise\nwill have a TPM 1.2.\n\n191\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.380\nThere's already things that use it.\n\n192\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.170\nLike right now BitLocker needs a TPM 1\nto use that, and there are other things\n\n193\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.410\nthat is more and more prevalent where\nTPMs are just being used more and more.\n\n194\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.550\nSo that's not really a hard thing, but we\nneed to have that TPM because what do we\n\n195\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.910\nwant, we wanna have that thing that you\nknow, or sorry, that thing that you have\n\n196\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.015\nis gonna be a private key,\nthat private key is generated in a TPM.\n\n197\n00:10:45.015 --> 00:10:48.570\nTPMs have all this crypto built into them,\n\n198\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.700\nso they can do random number generator,\nthey do all this stuff inside the TMP.\n\n199\n00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.930\nAnd they generate a key.\n\n200\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.950\nAnd that key is then\nwrapped with a key that's\n\n201\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.210\nburnt into the TPM at\nthe time of manufacturing.\n\n202\n00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.310\nAnd that key is different for\neach TPM that's manufactured.\n\n203\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.760\nAnd so\nTPMs don't really have a lot of storage.\n\n204\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.760\nSo what happens is is that key\nis wrapped with that unique key\n\n205\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.450\nthat's burnt into the TPM at the time of\nmanufacturing and then persisted to disk.\n\n206\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.540\nAnd so that way, even if you were to get\nthat key and move it laterally one way or\n\n207\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.620\nanother, it's not gonna work because\nyou need to feed it into the TPM that\n\n208\n00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.540\nactually created it.\n\n209\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.490\nAnd so that's where we can get this\nwhere we don't have lateral movement of\n\n210\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.120\nthe actual something you have.\n\n211\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.310\nThe next thing that we're gonna\ntalk about is is that the something\n\n212\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.480\nyou know which is the PIN.\n\n213\n00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.120\nAs I mentioned, that's entropy, and\nso we don't persist the PIN anywhere.\n\n214\n00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.350\nAnd so that way, if that PIN is ever\nentered wrong, then it's not gonna work.\n\n215\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.070\nBecause what happens is is the way to\n\n216\n00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.400\nbring that key out of its persistent\nstate or where it's stored on disk, and\n\n217\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.960\nto bring it back into the TPM\nto where it can be used\n\n218\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.260\nis I need to have that key that's wrapped,\nand I need to provide the entropy.\n\n219\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.190\nBoth of those get fed into TPM,\nand it's gonna do a computation.\n\n220\n00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.510\nAnd if it's not what it expects, then it\njust fails and you don't get to use that.\n\n221\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.735\nSo those are the things that we have as\nfar as there is something you have and\n\n222\n00:12:13.735 --> 00:12:15.485\nsomething that you know.\n\n223\n00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.285\nThe or in this matter for\n\n224\n00:12:17.285 --> 00:12:21.185\nwhere you can get into a different one\nis that you can use your biometrics.\n\n225\n00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:24.675\nThe biometrics you can enroll your\nbiometrics during Windows Hello.\n\n226\n00:12:24.675 --> 00:12:29.305\nAnd in that enrollment, you can use your\nfingerprint and you can use your face,\n\n227\n00:12:29.305 --> 00:12:31.170\ndepending on the hardware that you have.\n\n228\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.250\nAnd then, from that point on,\ninstead of using your PIN as a gate\n\n229\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.590\nto get to that key, you can use your\nbiometrics as a gate to get that key.\n\n230\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.930\nSo that makes it a little bit more cooler,\nand it's a very frictionless sign in.\n\n231\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:49.104\nSo, if we look at those three factors, and\nwhat we do, how do those play into our\n\n232\n00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:55.060\nobjective of non-fishable, non-replayable\nand certainly, non-breachable?\n\n233\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.710\nSo if we look at the something you have,\n\n234\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.735\nyour authentication is not\nreally a symmetric key,\n\n235\n00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:06.560\nit's I'm doing a cryptographic signature\noperation to sign in or authenticate.\n\n236\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.890\nThen what you get there is this that,\nwell,\n\n237\n00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.860\nknowing my PIN doesn't\nreally help me anything.\n\n238\n00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.760\nBecause it's not gonna work,\n\n239\n00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.200\nif the PINs in this laptop,\nit's not gonna move to another one.\n\n240\n00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.040\nSo, where you have that is\nit's just very difficult to\n\n241\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.510\nphish something because all you're gonna\nget is a cryptographic output of phishing.\n\n242\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.640\nIf you ask me to type in my PIN,\n\n243\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.030\nI'm gonna type in a PIN\nthat's not gonna do anything.\n\n244\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.750\nSo you can't really phish it.\n\n245\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.830\nThe next thing about it is\nthat it's non-replayable.\n\n246\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:38.820\nBecause I'm using a key that can't\nmove off of this computer, well,\n\n247\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.960\nit can't move off this computer.\n\n248\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.720\nThat means that it can't be replayed.\n\n249\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.700\nThe analogy we had, if Don's using\nWindows Hello for Business, I can't go and\n\n250\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.860\nbe Don in Washington because\nI don't have his key.\n\n251\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.520\nIt's on his device.\n\n252\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.780\nAnd then the next thing\nis it's non-breachable.\n\n253\n00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.330\nAnd this is more of a forward\nthinking objective in that,\n\n254\n00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.750\nif you think about when we talked about\npasswords being stored on a server, and\n\n255\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.930\nthese breaches that we were talking about,\nwell, now all sudden in doing\n\n256\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.580\nthe registration process, I need to know\nwho Don is, when he's authenticating.\n\n257\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.940\nBut these are asymmetric keys.\n\n258\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.480\nSo I have the private key stored here.\n\n259\n00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.610\nThe public key, well, it's a pubic key,\nit can go anywhere it needs to go.\n\n260\n00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:22.860\nSo the public key gets registered with the\nidentity provider or the authentication.\n\n261\n00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.090\nSo now what you have is\nif you fast forward,\n\n262\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.490\nyou have a server full of public keys.\n\n263\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.890\nAnd a server full of public keys\ndoesn't really do an attacker much good\n\n264\n00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.420\nat that point.\n\n265\n00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.240\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of the neat parts about\nthis whole aspect is that you'll hear\n\n266\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.200\nabout companies where they have password\ndatabases that are very heavily encrypted,\n\n267\n00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.620\nvery well secured.\n\n268\n00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.110\nAnd a breach happens,\nsomebody gets a copy of that database.\n\n269\n00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.030\nAnd they say, well, yeah,\nthey got the database, but\n\n270\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.890\neverything's encrypted, it's fine.\n\n271\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.000\nWell, that encryption might be very,\nvery strong today.\n\n272\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.870\nBut two years from now, four years from\nnow, six years from now, processors get\n\n273\n00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:01.660\nbetter, computers get faster, our compute\nresources get significantly larger.\n\n274\n00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.510\nAnd maybe that strength and\nsecurity is no longer there anymore and\n\n275\n00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.550\nnow they are able to be compromised.\n\n276\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.360\nWell, that's passwords four or\nfive years down the road, but\n\n277\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.710\na lot of people aren't\nchanging their passwords.\n\n278\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.150\nThey are using passwords that are very,\n\n279\n00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.630\nvery old and\nthat means you now have a compromise.\n\n280\n00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.150\nSo with this,\nbecause they're just public keys,\n\n281\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.550\nit really doesn't matter if\nsomebody gets that database.\n\n282\n00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.040\nI mean, obviously,\nwe'd rather it didn't happen,\n\n283\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.290\nbut if it did, that risk is far,\nfar mitigated.\n\n284\n00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.572\nSo we don't have to worry about it so\nmuch.\n\n285\n00:15:26.572 --> 00:15:30.052\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, the whole idea of\na public key in RSA is it's public,\n\n286\n00:15:30.052 --> 00:15:32.730\nit's allowed,\npeople are allowed to see that key.\n\n287\n00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:37.860\nSo, yeah, the idea here is that\nit's not gonna, it's a roadblock.\n\n288\n00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.280\nWe know attackers are,\nattacking is a business now.\n\n289\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.140\nPeople are doing this to make money.\n\n290\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.990\nSo we know that by virtue of attacking\na server that once had symmetric keys and\n\n291\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.630\nnow it only has public keys,\n\n292\n00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.600\nwe're kind of moving the target\nattack to something else.\n\n293\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.150\nAnd so that's why that defense in depth\nthat you hear all throughout the IT\n\n294\n00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.830\nindustry is very important.\n\n295\n00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.776\nYou protect one thing, and\nthey're just gonna move and find.\n\n296\n00:16:00.776 --> 00:16:02.676\nAttacks go to the path\nof least resistance.\n\n297\n00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:07.119\nSo they're always gonna try to find where\nis the weakest link And that's the attack\n\n298\n00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:11.563\nfactor and with Windows Hello for Business\nis this long term strategy of getting off\n\n299\n00:16:11.563 --> 00:16:15.075\npasswords and moving to this\nstrong two factor authentication.\n\n300\n00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:19.583\nThat's where we can sit there and\nsay AK in the future the directory or\n\n301\n00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:24.559\nthe authentication, in this case\nActive Directory, or in the cloud like of\n\n302\n00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:29.480\nlike Azure, these particular attacks\nare not going to be valid there.\n\n303\n00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.180\nYou're gonna have to move\nto something else there, so\n\n304\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.280\nthat's kind of the gist of why we\nhad Windows Hello for Business.\n\n305\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.730\nOne follow up point on that particular\nthing is, is there's been two\n\n306\n00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.000\nfactor our for a while, I'm sure everybody\nout there has heard of smart cards.\n\n307\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.960\nAnd smart cards, they're about 15 to 17\nyears old and they've gone through these\n\n308\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.650\nsame little hurdles that they\nhad to go to and work out.\n\n309\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.670\nBut the problem with smart cards,\nfrankly, is it's very expensive,\n\n310\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.390\nyou need an infrastructure, you need\nto have smart card management software,\n\n311\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.950\nyou need to have smart card readers,\nyou need the smart card itself.\n\n312\n00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.690\nAnd then there's\nthe ongoing maintenance and\n\n313\n00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.130\ncost of making that infrastructure and\nkeeping it in place.\n\n314\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.300\nAnd then, so those are the things\nthat deter a lot of companies\n\n315\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.350\nfrom wanting to go to a strong credential,\nit's just, they simply can't afford that.\n\n316\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.130\nAnd so what Windows Hello for\n\n317\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.944\nBusiness does is it brings strong\ntwo factor authentication,\n\n318\n00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:25.760\nstrong two factor authentication,\nto the enterprise in an affordable manner,\n\n319\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.780\nwhere most of it just reuses the existing\ninfrastructure you have today.\n\n320\n00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.580\nSo on top of infrastructure,\n\n321\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.690\nlet's talk about some of the technologies\nthat Windows Hello is gonna use,\n\n322\n00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.490\nbefore we jump in to actually\ngetting our feet wet with it.\n\n323\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.642\nSo some of the technologies that Windows\nHello is gonna cover is Active Directory.\n\n324\n00:17:42.642 --> 00:17:46.069\nWe're gonna be doing some stuff in\nActive Directory, user maintenance but\n\n325\n00:17:46.069 --> 00:17:48.585\nwe're also going to be doing\nsome schema extensions and\n\n326\n00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:50.312\nwe will get to that in a later episode.\n\n327\n00:17:50.312 --> 00:17:52.849\nWe're gonna be using DNS\nto make sure that we have,\n\n328\n00:17:52.849 --> 00:17:56.339\nany time you mention Active Directory,\nDNS goes hand in hand with it.\n\n329\n00:17:56.339 --> 00:18:00.431\nPKI, Public Key Infrastructure,\nwe're gonna need a certificate server, and\n\n330\n00:18:00.431 --> 00:18:02.490\nwe're gonna use that as a root of trust.\n\n331\n00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.270\nAnd then we're also gonna use that to\nissue identity certificates to the actual\n\n332\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.400\nuser itself.\n\n333\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.110\nSo that's what they'll authenticate with,\nthen\n\n334\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.720\nwe're gonna manage it with group policy,\nwhich makes it very easy, very affordable.\n\n335\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.240\nWe don't need to have\nan expensive management solution,\n\n336\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.560\nwe can just use what's built into\nWindows Server right then and there.\n\n337\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.450\nAnd then we're gonna throw\na little twist into this and\n\n338\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.080\nwe're gonna bring in Active Directory\nfederation services.\n\n339\n00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.130\nAnd we use that, is a way we'll\nsee how that is being used with,\n\n340\n00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.440\nI talked about registering\nthat public key.\n\n341\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.972\nThat's gonna be where our\nregistration point, and\n\n342\n00:18:35.972 --> 00:18:40.250\nwe're gonna see how that actually plays\na very pivotal role in Windows Hello for\n\n343\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.400\nBusiness in that defense in depth\nsecurity model that I spoke of.\n\n344\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.328\nAnd then, we're gonna introduce a new\nthing that many people may not know.\n\n345\n00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:52.950\nBut what we're talking about today is\nthe on prem version of Windows Hello for\n\n346\n00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:57.710\nBusiness, which we recently have\nintroduced with the creator's update.\n\n347\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.300\nAnd in that we've brought it to where it\nworks with this on prem Active Directory.\n\n348\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.917\nBut we have a little, little snag\nhere to where doing multi-factor\n\n349\n00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:10.410\nauthentication on prem\nis not cost-productive.\n\n350\n00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:15.466\nSo we're gonna introduce the Azure\nmulti-factor authentication server.\n\n351\n00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:19.420\nIt's an on prem server, and we'll have\na pretty good discussion about that and\n\n352\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.360\nhow that keeps the credentials on prem.\n\n353\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.450\nBut it leverages the cloud just simply\nto make that one phone call because\n\n354\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.110\nwe don't wanna upgrade a user from a weak\ncredential to a strong credential just\n\n355\n00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.030\nbecause they typed in a password.\n\n356\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.340\nWe need to know that when Don\ngoes to the provisioning flow,\n\n357\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.570\nthat, Don is Don, and it's not just\nan attacker that stole his password.\n\n358\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.180\nSo in that provisioning flow we're\ngonna make the user do another form or\n\n359\n00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.090\na second factor of authentication\nto make sure we're\n\n360\n00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.460\ngiving them a strong credential and\nwe're giving it to the right person.\n\n361\n00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.370\nAnd then lastly, there's some supporting\nmechanisms here with the multi-factor\n\n362\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.180\nauthentication where there's a user portal\nthat lets you set up a self-servicing\n\n363\n00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:03.440\nportal to where the users can manage\ntheir multi-factor authentication and\n\n364\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.830\nhow that's going to play.\n\n365\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.870\nWhether they register a phone number or\nthey could use an authenticator app,\n\n366\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.020\nthese are the things that we don't\nwanna have that burden on the IT.\n\n367\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.090\nSo part of the server is there's\na user portal that you can set up in\n\n368\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.520\nyour enterprise.\n\n369\n00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.800\nAnd then you can use that user\nportal to then let the users\n\n370\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.670\nmanage their own identities there.\n\n371\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.579\nAnd so we'll be doing some\nIIS web services stuff, but\n\n372\n00:20:25.579 --> 00:20:29.892\nbasically just helping you understand\nthe requirements you need to install it.\n\n373\n00:20:29.892 --> 00:20:34.043\nWe're not gonna go deep into IIS there,\nand that basically we'll wrap up.\n\n374\n00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:37.128\n&gt;&gt; And I know it sounds like a lot of\ncomponents, but if you look at the list of\n\n375\n00:20:37.128 --> 00:20:40.365\nthings that we need to get Windows Hello\nfor Business setup most of it is stuff\n\n376\n00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:43.245\nthat you should have already or\nmost businesses are going to have.\n\n377\n00:20:43.245 --> 00:20:45.000\nYou're going to have\nActive Directory domain controllers,\n\n378\n00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.730\nyou're going to have a DNS infrastructure.\n\n379\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.610\nSo it's mostly reusing the technology\nyou've already got and\n\n380\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.470\nadding a little bit more to\nthem to get that support.\n\n381\n00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.620\nBut it's also important to note that\nthere is a big difference between\n\n382\n00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.310\njust plain old Windows Hello and\nWindows Hello for Business.\n\n383\n00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.730\nNow with Windows Hello for Business,\nwe're controlling that infrastructure,\n\n384\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.760\nthat's why we need all\nthese different components.\n\n385\n00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.860\nThe original Windows Hello,\nwas it in the anniversary update or\n\n386\n00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.190\nwas it in the original Windows 10 release,\ndo you remember?\n\n387\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.710\n&gt;&gt; I think it was in the November when we\nfirst did the original Windows Hello for\n\n388\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.427\nBusiness one.\n\n389\n00:21:15.427 --> 00:21:19.224\n&gt;&gt; So the consumer version of Windows\nHello, that just taps into Microsoft's\n\n390\n00:21:19.224 --> 00:21:23.336\ninfrastructure and it is all controlled\nin the cloud and we don't worry about it.\n\n391\n00:21:23.336 --> 00:21:26.198\nBut here, Windows Hello for\nBusiness it's integrated into our on\n\n392\n00:21:26.198 --> 00:21:28.635\npremises environment, and\nwe maintain that control.\n\n393\n00:21:28.635 --> 00:21:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good point Don,\nto expand on Windows Hello, actually\n\n394\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:37.490\nMicrosoft is using Windows Hello for\nBusiness, the infrastructure, whatever.\n\n395\n00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.420\nSo when you sign in with your\nMicrosoft account into Windows 10,\n\n396\n00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.880\nyou have the option to sign it,\nwhen you sign in, you can create a PIN.\n\n397\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.050\nIn fact, we wanna encourage users to\ncreate PINs because creating that\n\n398\n00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.850\nPIN gets you off of that password,\neven if you have the password there.\n\n399\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.240\nNot using the password and\n\n400\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.910\nnot being prompted to enter\na password is a good thing.\n\n401\n00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.870\nWe wanna get users out of the habit\nof something popped up and ask me for\n\n402\n00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.240\nmy password, let me go ahead and\ngive it to you.\n\n403\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.880\nSo, Microsoft accounts will do that,\nAzure is using Windows Hello today, so\n\n404\n00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.020\nwe have a lot of things.\n\n405\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.840\nNow to be very transparent here\nthere is a Windows Hello or\n\n406\n00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.840\na standalone Windows Hello for\njust your local machine.\n\n407\n00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.750\nAnd that's not really\nthe Windows Hello for\n\n408\n00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.180\nBusiness, that is what we\ncall a convenient sign in.\n\n409\n00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.410\nAnd there's a big distinction there,\nin a convenient sign in, so\n\n410\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.940\nif I just have a computer\nwith no infrastructure and\n\n411\n00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.880\nI'm not connecting to either Azure or\nwiht my Microsoft account.\n\n412\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.530\nThe convenient sign in is really, Don,\n\n413\n00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.450\nwe hear that convenience and\nsecurity, they're mutually exclusive.\n\n414\n00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.202\n&gt;&gt; They don't play well.\n\n415\n00:22:42.202 --> 00:22:43.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n416\n00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.160\nthe reason why we call it a convenient\nsign in is that's exactly what it is,\n\n417\n00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.520\nit's a convenience.\n\n418\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.400\nSo what it's really doing under the covers\nis it's not using a private key,\n\n419\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.470\nit's not really using the TPM for\na private key.\n\n420\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:59.070\nIt's basically what we call\na password stuffer, it'll ask you for\n\n421\n00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.280\nyour password, it'll grab that password.\n\n422\n00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.080\nNow one of the improvements\nis it will use the TPM to\n\n423\n00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.990\nencrypt that password before\nit's persisted to the disk.\n\n424\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.444\nBut at the end of the day you're sill\nusing a password, so the way I try to tell\n\n425\n00:23:12.444 --> 00:23:16.915\npeople is, is that every decryption\noperation leaves you with clear text.\n\n426\n00:23:16.915 --> 00:23:21.075\nClear text is clear text, so that means\nI'm still gonna get your password, yes,\n\n427\n00:23:21.075 --> 00:23:24.934\nthe brute force attack of trying to get\nit from the disc is much more difficult\n\n428\n00:23:24.934 --> 00:23:26.531\nbecause we're using the TPM.\n\n429\n00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:29.670\nBut if I'm malware and\nI'm sitting there and I'm just looking for\n\n430\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.257\nthings in memory, eventually that\npassword is going to get decrypted, and\n\n431\n00:23:33.257 --> 00:23:36.482\nit's gonna get into clear text and\nthen I'm gonna be able to get it.\n\n432\n00:23:36.482 --> 00:23:41.860\nSo that's just a thing to let people\nknow in the enterprise we have\n\n433\n00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:48.040\nconvenience sign in turned off by default\nand it's only turned on with group policy.\n\n434\n00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.280\nSo, you wanna make sure that\nthat one is not turned on.\n\n435\n00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.390\nIn fact, when we get into the policy\nsections I'll probably mention it then as\n\n436\n00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:59.400\nwell, that if you try to have a conflict\nbetween Windows Hello for Business and\n\n437\n00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.415\nthe convenient sign in we kinda just\ndon't let you create a pin at all.\n\n438\n00:24:02.415 --> 00:24:05.483\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and for\na business we don't want that anyway, so\n\n439\n00:24:05.483 --> 00:24:08.315\nit makes sense that we'd stick\nwith the Windows Hello for\n\n440\n00:24:08.315 --> 00:24:11.460\nBusiness infrastructure and\nget that implemented properly.\n\n441\n00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.330\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's the stronger of\nthe versions that we want people to use.\n\n442\n00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.770\nLike I said, even with your Microsoft\naccount it's a good idea to\n\n443\n00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.630\njust go ahead and create that pin.\n\n444\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.060\nAnd if you can get hardware,\nthere's a lot of cameras,\n\n445\n00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.430\nthird party cameras that are coming out.\n\n446\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.470\nThere's more, a lot of fingerprint readers\nI'm seeing in laptops now more than ever.\n\n447\n00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:33.780\nSo, it's really starting to get\na popularity and gaining in momentum.\n\n448\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.760\nSo if any time you can do those things is,\n\n449\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.250\nmoving off of a password is just\nthe be all end all of what we want.\n\n450\n00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Mike, I think\nthat's probably a pretty good spot for\n\n451\n00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.320\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n452\n00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.550\nDid

00:24:52.210\nand we're gonna be here for\na while talking about Windows Hello, and\n\n455\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.600\nsetting it up, and\nmaking sure people can use it.\n\n456\n00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.210\n&gt;&gt; All right everybody,\nwell, in this episode,\n\n457\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.750\nwe had a chance to learn a little bit\nabout Windows Hello for Business.\n\n458\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.660\nWe talked a bit about the reason\nwhy we want to have it, and\n\n459\n00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.738\nwhy passwords are no longer cutting\nthe mustard for our security solutions.\n\n460\n00:25:05.738 --> 00:25:08.740\nAnd we talk a little bit about the\ninfrastructure that we're going to need\n\n461\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.060\nto put Windows Hello for\nBusiness in place.\n\n462\n00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.000\nAnd in the coming up episodes\nwe're gonna be seeing actually how\n\n463\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.510\nto put that into place, get it implemented\nin your on premises environment.\n\n464\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.140\nI hope you enjoyed it,\nbe sure to stay tuned for\n\n465\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.240\nthe follow up episodes cuz we're
