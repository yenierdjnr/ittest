  "description": "Wireshark is a free and open source network packet sniffer and protocol analyzer. It is an invaluable tool for any network administrator who needs detailed visibility into the traffic on their network. It utilizes a packet capture utility or sniffer, which watches any traffic/communication that crosses the network adapter and writes it to a file and then the protocol analyzer interprets the raw data obtained by the sniffer and turns it into readable data. It also provides in-depth tools for isolating faults and troubleshooting failures.",

called\n\n3\n00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:12,900\nWireshark.\n\n4\n00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,210\nA lot of people have heard about it,\nnot a lot of people have used it.\n\n5\n00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,570\nWe want to take some time to show you how\nthe product works, how you can use it,\n\n6\n00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,040\nhow you can take advantage of that to\nhelp with your troubleshooting and\n\n7\n00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,510\njust general network\ngathering information.\n\n8\n00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,150\nIt is a terribly useful tool,\nand it is completely free,\n\n9\n00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,780\nthat makes it really attractive.\n\n10\n00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,640\nLet's start at the beginning though.\n\n11\n00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,370\nWhat is Wireshark?\n\n12\n00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,030\nWell, it's kind of hard to describe,\n\n13\n00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,900\nbecause Wireshark is actually\nseveral tools in one.\n\n14\n00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,860\nIt's a packet analyzer, it's a sniffer,\n\n15\n00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,770\nit's a protocol analyzer,\na packet capture device.\n\n16\n00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,660\nIt's all these different things\nwrapped into one big envelope.\n\n17\n00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,340\nSo let's tackle the pieces independently.\n\n18\n00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,110\nWe start with a packet capture utility,\nsometimes called a sniffer.\n\n19\n00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,990\nThere are many different sniffers that\nare out there from various vendors, but\n\n20\n00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,110\na sniffer pretty much works the same\nway no matter who it's from.\n\n21\n00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,300\nWhat a sniffer does, is it watches your\nnetwork card, and any traffic that crosses\n\n22\n00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,250\nthe network card, any communications,\ntelnet, SSH, TCP stuff, UDP stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,950\nAny communication across that\nnetwork card, it captures it and\n\n24\n00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,410\nwrites it to a file.\n\n25\n00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,800\nIt doesn't do anything with it,\nit just gets it and saves it.\n\n26\n00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,890\nOn a normal computer, Linux,\nMac OS, Windows, doesn't matter, if\n\n27\n00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,970\nit receives traffic that is not destined\nfor that computer, it throws it away.\n\n28\n00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,020\nBut a sniffer, or a packet capture\nutility, won't throw it away.\n\n29\n00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,620\nIt'll hold it, it'll say all right,\nI'll take a copy of that, and\n\n30\n00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,170\nit'll write it down.\n\n31\n00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,340\nAll right, once you've got it written\ndown, you can then do stuff with it.\n\n32\n00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,230\nOne of the most popular packet capture\nutilities that are out there is called\n\n33\n00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,310\nTCP Dump.\n\n34\n00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,020\nIn the Unix and Linux world,\nit's a command line utility you can run\n\n35\n00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,155\nthat'll just give you\nan onscreen output or\n\n36\n00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:01,910\nit can dump it to a file of all\nthe traffic hitting your network adapter.\n\n37\n00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,860\nSo if you want to see what's going on in\nthe network, it's a great way to do it.\n\n38\n00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,732\nThe problem though is it just\ngives you this raw data and\n\n39\n00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:12,760\nyou then have to interpret it, and\nthe interpretation part is the hard part.\n\n40\n00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,670\nThat is what a protocol analyzer does.\n\n41\n00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,330\nAnd again there's a number of\nprotocol analyzer out there,\n\n42\n00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,340\nbut what they all do is\npretty much the same.\n\n43\n00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,690\nThey take the packets that\nwere obtained by a sniffer And\n\n44\n00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,030\nthey transform them into something\nthat becomes human readable,\n\n45\n00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,770\nsomething that we can look at and\nrecognize.\n\n46\n00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,230\nSome of them go even further, and not just\ntranslate into something we can recognize,\n\n47\n00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,280\nbut string it together to form patterns\nand give us additional information.\n\n48\n00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,870\nThat is what a protocol analyzer does,\nand the really advanced ones can\n\n49\n00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,640\nbreak that data down in a way\nthat makes it super simple for\n\n50\n00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,510\nus to interpret and to work with.\n\n51\n00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,251\nAnd that's why when you go to like,\n\n52\n00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,410\nWireShark's website they say\nit's WireShark, go deeper.\n\n53\n00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,720\nYou get this data,\n\n54\n00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,110\nyou've got the information,\nwhat can you extrapolate form it?\n\n55\n00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,460\nWhat can you determine based on\nthe information that you've gathered?\n\n56\n00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,290\nAnd you'll find there's actually a lot\nstuff you can learn about your network.\n\n57\n00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,990\nNow I started working with protocol\nanalyzers over 15 years ago, and\n\n58\n00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,700\nback then, they were almost like voodoo\nmagic, and they were incredibly expensive.\n\n59\n00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,460\nThe one I used the most\ncommonly was a product,\n\n60\n00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,780\nit's been bought out by a few\ndifferent companies, but back then,\n\n61\n00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,890\nit was network general sniffer pro is what\nit was called, and it cost about $15,000.\n\n62\n00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,530\nIt was very, very expensive.\n\n63\n00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,380\nThe company I worked for had purchased\nthe license for it, and we used it for\n\n64\n00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,220\ntroubleshooting all the time.\n\n65\n00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,210\nIt was a great product, but\nthat was a long time ago.\n\n66\n00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,560\nTechnologies have changed,\nprotocols have changed, and\n\n67\n00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,130\nall the software packages\nhave had to keep up to date.\n\n68\n00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,480\nSome of them have, some of them haven't.\n\n69\n00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,800\nUtilities like tcpdump haven't\nchanged much over the years,\n\n70\n00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,740\nthey just dump the data out to a file.\n\n71\n00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,110\nThere's much they can advance on that.\n\n72\n00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,620\nOther ones like Microsoft has something\ncalled the Microsoft Network Monitor, and\n\n73\n00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,930\nwhen it came out back in 1997,\nit was fancy, it was nice.\n\n74\n00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,560\nIt could really do a lot of stuff,\nbut today,\n\n75\n00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,330\nit's basically been abandoned by\nMicrosoft, they haven't updated it much.\n\n76\n00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,460\nYou can go to their site and\ndownload it for free, but\n\n77\n00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,290\nit's crippled compared to Wireshark.\n\n78\n00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,450\nWireshark is an open source protocol\nanalyzer that is actively being developed,\n\n79\n00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,550\ngetting new features every single week, so\n\n80\n00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,980\nit's a very current system and\nit's extremely powerful.\n\n81\n00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,050\nIt does pretty much\neverything you could want.\n\n82\n00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,590\nThere are a few little things,\nadvanced type functionalities,\n\n83\n00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,800\nthey might not have, and that's why other\nvendors still have the high end market.\n\n84\n00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,950\nCompanies like Fluke has\nthe network inspector, and\n\n85\n00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,850\nthat thing is incredibly expensive, but\n\n86\n00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,670\nit does a very good job and it breaks down\nyour network and shows what's going on.\n\n87\n00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,760\nSo there is still a high end market for\nthat, but for me as a network engineer,\n\n88\n00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,770\nI'm a big Cisco guy,\nI work with networking equipment a lot.\n\n89\n00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,120\nFor me, I rarely use these utilities,\nthese high end utilities because I know\n\n90\n00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,280\nthat WireShark does everything that\nI need so very powerful utility,\n\n91\n00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,030\nvery free and it will run on top of Linux,\nMac OS and Windows so it's multi platform.\n\n92\n00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,320\nA lot of the high end stuff, like the\nfluke stuff Will only run on windows, so\n\n93\n00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,620\nthere's limitations you have there, but\nwith Wireshark, you don't have that.\n\n94\n00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,220\nReally, really cool stuff.\n\n95\n00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,670\nNow, it's possible you've worked with\nWireshark before and don't know it..\n\n96\n00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,380\nIt used to have a different name.\n\n97\n00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,010\nWireshark was an open source product.\n\n98\n00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,820\nIt was developed by a network\nengineer/developer in his spare time,\n\n99\n00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,030\nand it was originally called ethereal,\nor you'll here ether real, but\n\n100\n00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,670\nit was ethereal.\n\n101\n00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,100\nThat was the original product, and when\nhe left the company he was working for,\n\n102\n00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,420\nthe name had been\ntrademarked by that company.\n\n103\n00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,640\nHe couldn't keep the name, so when he\nleft, he took his product with him, but\n\n104\n00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,650\nhe couldn't take the name until\nwe changed it to Wireshark.\n\n105\n00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,520\nThat was years ago now, so, anybody\ngetting started in IT in the last four or\n\n106\n00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,390\nfive years would probably only know it as\nWireshark, but every now and then you'll\n\n107\n00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,713\nhear it referred to as a theory of\nthat old name that was attached to it.\n\n108\n00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:03,240\nNow, it is open source, it's free,\nyou can go and download it,\n\n109\n00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,960\nyou can get the source code if you want\nbut, most of us just want the program.\n\n110\n00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,420\nSo, to get it you go to Wireshark's\nwebsite and you can download it and\n\n111\n00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,200\ninstall from there.\n\n112\n00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,790\nSo they've got the get started and\n\n113\n00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,930\non there you'll see where it's got\nthe different OS's, so here I've got OSX,\n\n114\n00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,150\nI've got Windows, Source Code,\nyou'll see other ones that are out there.\n\n115\n00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,050\nAnd if you're running Linux it's likely\nalready been ported to your distro,\n\n116\n00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,470\nyou just need to check\nthe repositories for your distro.\n\n117\n00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,730\nScent OS and Red Hat have got\nWireshark in their distros already,\n\n118\n00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,680\nso while it's not listed right here on\nthe website, it is available, all right.\n\n119\n00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,600\nNow, Wireshark will watch\nyour network adapter, so\n\n120\n00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,070\nwhichever network adapters you have,\nwireless or wired, and\n\n121\n00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,490\nit will capture any of the data on\nthose interfaces and record it.\n\n122\n00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,540\nYou don't have a whole lot of system\nrequirements with Wireshark because it is\n\n123\n00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,650\nreally flexible and multi-platform, but\none thing you need to be aware of is,\n\n124\n00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,140\nin order to capture traffic on a network\nadapter that's not destined for your\n\n125\n00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,660\nmachine, the network adapter has to be\nput into what's called promiscuous mode.\n\n126\n00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,940\nPromiscuous mode means even though I'm\ngetting traffic that's not destined for\n\n127\n00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,270\nme, I'm gonna to keep it.\n\n128\n00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,010\nSome physical network adapters will block\nthat traffic before it even makes it to\n\n129\n00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,170\nyour OS, so the OS doesn't even\nhave a chance to capture it,\n\n130\n00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,260\nit's already gone at that point.\n\n131\n00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,190\nAll right, so you need to make sure your\nnetwork adapter supports promiscuous mode.\n\n132\n00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,560\nA lot of them do, so, it's not like\nit's a rare feature or whatever.\n\n133\n00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,600\nBut if you find that no matter what you do\nwith Wireshark, you're just not getting\n\n134\n00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,190\nany packets, well that might be your\nindicator that you've got a problem there.\n\n135\n00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,920\nBut like I said most adapters do and when\nyou go to Wireshark's website, if you're\n\n136\n00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,400\nwondering how they make money because it\nis a free product, you'll see advertising.\n\n137\n00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,670\nAnd a lot of times the advertisements\nwill center around network adapters, so\n\n138\n00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,090\nlike right here 802.11\npacket capture adapters.\n\n139\n00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,180\nYou might already have a wireless\nadapter in your system, but\n\n140\n00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,650\nit might not support full promiscuous\nmode on a wireless network.\n\n141\n00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,640\nIt might not be able to capture all that\ndata, so if you're trying to do something\n\n142\n00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,170\nlike a WEP key attack, or even WPA1\ntype attacks, you might not be able\n\n143\n00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,330\nto pull them off with the wireless\nadapter that's built in your system.\n\n144\n00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,290\nSo if you purchase one of these network\nadapters, they specifically support\n\n145\n00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,120\nthe features you need,\nyou know you'll have that functionality.\n\n146\n00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,630\nThat's how Wire Shark makes their money.\n\n147\n00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,090\nWhen you buy things like this,\nthey also do consulting, there's training,\n\n148\n00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,800\nthere is an official certification track\nwith Wire Shark you can go through.\n\n149\n00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,610\nWe're not tackling that here, we're just\ngonna do general usage of the product, but\n\n150\n00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,550\nthere's various ways like that\nthat they generate their revenue.\n\n151\n00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,900\nSo don't think that they're\nshady because it's free,\n\n152\n00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,850\nthey just make their money other ways.\n\n153\n00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,090\nIt's a great resource and\n\n154\n00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,090\nit's really a gift to the networking\ncommunity to even have this available.\n\n155\n00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,012\nIt's incredibly powerful.\n\n156\n00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:42,540\nAll right, so,\nthat's pretty much all we need for\n\n157\n00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,080\nour high level interview\nhere with Wire Shark.\n\n158\n00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,630\nIf you're curious,\nyou can browse through their website,\n\n159\n00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,050\nit's just wireshark.org, and\nthey've got a Get Acquainted menu up top.\n\n160\n00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,580\nAnd you can read about it, you can learn\nabout the product and download it.\n\n161\n00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,580\nAt the end of the day,\nit is an open source product.\n\n162\n00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,170\nHere's all the different developers.\n\n163\n00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,240\nIt's a neat program and\n\n164\n00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,280\nwe'll see how to use it as we go\nthrough these series of videos.\n\n165\n00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,340\nSo stay tuned for those as we follow\nup with how to get it installed,\n\n166\n00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,690\nhow to work with it, and\nhow to interpret our data.\n\n167\n00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,800\nSo it's gonna be a whole series on that.\n\n168\n00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,075\nMake sure you stay tuned.\n\n169\n00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:21,644\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:08,280\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,566\nAll right, so\nif we're gonna use Wireshark,\n\n3\n00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,590\nwe probably need to get it installed.\n\n4\n00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,720\nFortunately that's a pretty easy process.\n\n5\n00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,900\nTo install Wireshark, we just go to\ntheir website, wireshark.org, and\n\n6\n00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,050\nthey've got a great big download\nbutton right on their homepage.\n\n7\n00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,160\nSo you'll see it right\nhere at the top left.\n\n8\n00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,170\nWhen you click on it, it'll try and\nfigure out what operating system you're\n\n9\n00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,330\nrunning and\ngive you the recommendation, right?\n\n10\n00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,170\nSo it sees that I'm running\na 64-bit version of Windows, and so\n\n11\n00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,180\nit's got that installer highlighted for\nme.\n\n12\n00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,015\nYou can download the other\nversions if you want.\n\n13\n00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:39,400\nThere's the 32-bit version,\nthere's the Mac OS versions.\n\n14\n00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,210\nWe've got source code.\n\n15\n00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,500\nIf you're on the Linux or\n\n16\n00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,980\nUnix machine, you can certainly download\nthe source code and compile it from code.\n\n17\n00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,710\nIt's a pretty big undertaking.\n\n18\n00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,740\nSo you're normally better off\nlooking to the repositories for\n\n19\n00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,863\nyour distro, all right?\n\n20\n00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:56,169\nSo if you're running CentOS or Red Hat,\nyou can check the repositories and\n\n21\n00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,490\nthere's usually a Wireshark\nbuild already there.\n\n22\n00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,870\nYou can just install from a package.\n\n23\n00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,240\nNow there is this\nWindows Portable Edition.\n\n24\n00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,460\nThat's a special one that's\ndesigned to run from a USB key.\n\n25\n00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,370\nSo if you wanna run\nWireshark on a machine, but\n\n26\n00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,960\nyou don't wanna actually install it,\nyou can use the portable edition.\n\n27\n00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,150\nIt won't write any\nentries to your registry.\n\n28\n00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,750\nIt doesn't write any temporary\nfiles on the C drive.\n\n29\n00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,290\nIt stores everything right\nthere on that USB key, so\n\n30\n00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,550\nyou can tote it from machine to machine,\nall right?\n\n31\n00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,700\nWell, once you figure out which\nversion you're gonna get, go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,450\ndownload it.\n\n33\n00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,550\nNow the download, it runs kinda slow.\n\n34\n00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,450\nI was originally gonna download it during\nthe show, but it took many minutes.\n\n35\n00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,060\nWireshark is a free product, and so they\ndon't have a ton of bandwidth available.\n\n36\n00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,910\nBut you'll go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,820\ndownload it, and I downloaded it and\nsaved it to my desktop right here.\n\n38\n00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,350\nTo get it installed we just fire it up.\n\n39\n00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,730\nWe'll run that.\n\n40\n00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,490\nIt just prompted me for\nadministrative privileges.\n\n41\n00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,580\nYou guys didn't see that cuz my\nscreen share doesn't show it.\n\n42\n00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,230\nBut here we are,\nit's just this simple startup wizard.\n\n43\n00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,700\nNow, if you're like me,\n\n44\n00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,210\nyou might already have Wireshark\ninstalled with other products.\n\n45\n00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,180\nBecause it is free, it sometimes\ngets packaged with other things.\n\n46\n00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,490\nI did a show yesterday on a product\ncalled GNS3 that had Wireshark built in.\n\n47\n00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,020\nSo, you might see that\nit's already installed.\n\n48\n00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,980\nAnd if that's the case,\nit'll prompt you and say,\n\n49\n00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,490\ndo you wanna uninstall\nthe other version first?\n\n50\n00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,050\nSo you might see that.\n\n51\n00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,500\nIf this is your first time though,\nyou'll see this wizard.\n\n52\n00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,290\nAnd we just walk through and\ndo the install.\n\n53\n00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,510\nFor the most part, the only decisions we\nhave to make here are what path we wanna\n\n54\n00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,990\ninstall Wireshark into, and a couple\nof decisions built around WinPcap that\n\n55\n00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,830\nwe'll see here in just a moment,\nall right?\n\n56\n00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,170\nYou'll see that it's\ngonna install Wireshark.\n\n57\n00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,550\nThat's the main thing that I care about.\n\n58\n00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,734\nAnd there's some other\ncomponents that it'll bring in,\n\n59\n00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:38,240\nlike the text-based Wireshark, tshark.\n\n60\n00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,560\nYou've also got some other tools and\nutilities that are gonna come in,\n\n61\n00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,340\nmost of these just for interpreting\nthe data that we're gathering.\n\n62\n00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,810\nAll right, then it's gonna ask\nwhere I wanna create my icons and\n\n63\n00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,620\nall that good stuff.\n\n64\n00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,640\nI'll just go with the defaults here.\n\n65\n00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,620\nAnd it's gonna associate the file\nextensions that Wireshark creates, so\n\n66\n00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,093\nI'll go with the defaults there,\nall right?\n\n67\n00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,450\nThe file path doesn't really matter to me.\n\n68\n00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,860\nI'll go with the default\nof C:/programfiles.\n\n69\n00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,090\nYou might install your software\nto different directories.\n\n70\n00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,830\nNot a big deal there.\n\n71\n00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,790\nAll right, now here's the important one.\n\n72\n00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,160\nIt's offering to install WinPcap.\n\n73\n00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,320\nNow what is that?\n\n74\n00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,120\nThat's the Windows packet capture utility.\n\n75\n00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,420\nIf you're installing Wireshark on Linux,\n\n76\n00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,960\nit's already got a packet\ncapture utility built into it.\n\n77\n00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,970\nIt doesn't need this, right?\n\n78\n00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,790\nAnd if you're installing on Mac OS,\nwell it's based on BSD.\n\n79\n00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,620\nIt also has its own\npacket capture utility.\n\n80\n00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,280\nBut in Windows we don't.\n\n81\n00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,860\nIn Windows, your network adapter will\nreject traffic that's not destined for\n\n82\n00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,210\nyour machine by default.\n\n83\n00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,460\nIf the physical adapter doesn't do it,\nWindows will do it.\n\n84\n00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,340\nWell WinPcap overrides that.\n\n85\n00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,740\nIt goes in and it says, let's allow\nthe gathering of packets on that interface\n\n86\n00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,130\nregardless of whether they're destined for\nus or not.\n\n87\n00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,730\nSo it's the packet capture driver.\n\n88\n00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,230\nIt basically steps in and\nattaches itself to your network adapter.\n\n89\n00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,470\nNow, when you install it,\nit will reset your network adapter.\n\n90\n00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,370\nSo if you're in the middle of something,\nyou'll get disconnected.\n\n91\n00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,240\nSo like if I'm in the middle\nof sharing my screen out,\n\n92\n00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,940\nit's gonna disconnect us, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,820\nWell, now I've already got WinPcap\ninstalled on my machine, so\n\n94\n00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,160\nI don't have to install it here.\n\n95\n00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,020\nYou can uncheck it if\nyou've already got it.\n\n96\n00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,650\nHow do you know if you have it?\n\n97\n00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,141\nWell, just check your system, right?\n\n98\n00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:19,285\nIf we go into our programs\nhere to see what's installed,\n\n99\n00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:22,362\nwe can look at all the junk\ninstalled on our machine, and\n\n100\n00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,241\nyou'll probably find WinPcap right\nthere if you've already got it.\n\n101\n00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:30,360\nI'm running 4.1.3, which is exactly\nwhat's packaged here, all right?\n\n102\n00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,380\nIf you don't have WinPcap,\njust leave that checked, and\n\n103\n00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,780\nthat'll be the next part of the install.\n\n104\n00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,840\nIt'll install it.\n\n105\n00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,370\nThere's not really any options with it.\n\n106\n00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,280\nYou pick a folder and\nyou hit next a bunch of times.\n\n107\n00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,620\nSo there's not anything\ntoo exciting there.\n\n108\n00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,590\nI'll uncheck that and hit install.\n\n109\n00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,980\nSo here it goes, doing the installer.\n\n110\n00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,570\nNow if I had chose to do WinPcap,\nmy adapter would be about to reset, and\n\n111\n00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,550\nmy desktop would freeze,\nbut we'll be okay here.\n\n112\n00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,922\nIt's gonna install.\n\n113\n00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:56,760\nNow, Wireshark is written, and\n\n114\n00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,310\nit's basically built on\na lot of Python and a lot of\n\n115\n00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,840\nopen programming languages to make it\neasy to port to multiple platforms.\n\n116\n00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,570\nSo you'll see it copy a lot of files.\n\n117\n00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,070\nThere's a lot of stuff that gets\ncopied over as part of the software.\n\n118\n00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,180\nBut once it's in place,\nthere's really just one icon forest and\n\n119\n00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,590\nit becomes a lot easier to use.\n\n120\n00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,100\nWe'll go ahead and hit Next here,\nand finish that up.\n\n121\n00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,050\nAnd now, I've got Wireshark on my machine.\n\n122\n00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,710\nIf I go under my start menu,\n\n123\n00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,060\nI should be able to find a new\nWireshark entry in here.\n\n124\n00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,200\nHere we go.\n\n125\n00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,940\nI've got Wireshark,\nas well as the Wireshark 2 preview.\n\n126\n00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,890\nThat was one of the options\nin the install that I chose.\n\n127\n00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,936\nI installed Wireshark version 1.12.\n\n128\n00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:36,580\nWireshark 2.0 is on the horizon, right?\n\n129\n00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,130\nSo they give you the preview\nversion of that.\n\n130\n00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,630\nBut for this series I'm gonna\nfocus on the stable version.\n\n131\n00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,392\nWhen 2.0 comes out,\nwe'll do another video series to cover it.\n\n132\n00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:49,750\nOnce Wireshark's installed though,\nyou can fire it up and there it is.\n\n133\n00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,180\nIt's up, it's running, and it's happy.\n\n134\n00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,660\nNow, when you installed WinPcap,\nit asked you whether or\n\n135\n00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,750\nnot you wanted it to start when\nWindows started, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,855\nAgain, in Linux and Mac OS you don't\nhave to worry about it, but in Windows,\n\n137\n00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:07,720\nWinPcap has to be running for\nWireshark to run.\n\n138\n00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,960\nWireshark won't work if WinPcap\nisn't running, all right?\n\n139\n00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,580\nIf you don't remember what option you\nchose when you ran the installer,\n\n140\n00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,630\nyou can double check that.\n\n141\n00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,306\nI'm gonna close out of Wireshark.\n\n142\n00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:22,410\nAnd in Windows,\nI'm gonna go in my Services tool.\n\n143\n00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,250\nSo you can just use your search\nbox to type in services.\n\n144\n00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,980\nAnd then run the wrong thing.\n\n145\n00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,690\nThere we go.\n\n146\n00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,210\nWe want this one.\n\n147\n00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,240\nIt has the little gears on it.\n\n148\n00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,580\nSo I'm gonna go into Services, and WinPcap\nactually installs itself as a service.\n\n149\n00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,970\nAnd so you'll find it in here.\n\n150\n00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,070\nIt's called something or another.\n\n151\n00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,230\nBut basically it has to be up and running,\nand when you installed it, the packet\n\n152\n00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,280\ncapture utility should have set itself\nto automatically start with the system.\n\n153\n00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,110\nAnd if it didn't, well you could come in\nand manually start it when you wanted.\n\n154\n00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,520\nI'm trying to remember\nexactly what it's called.\n\n155\n00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,230\nIt's buried in here somewhere.\n\n156\n00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,940\nMine's set to automatically start,\nso I'm okay, but\n\n157\n00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,692\nI did wanna show you guys that service.\n\n158\n00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:05,930\nLet's see,\nI probably looked over it five times now.\n\n159\n00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,550\nBut basically it installs itself as\na service in here, and you can start and\n\n160\n00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,000\nstop it whenever you want,\nbased on what your needs are.\n\n161\n00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,457\nIt'll probably have some name that's stuck\nat the beginning that's making me not\n\n162\n00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,950\nfind it, but it is in here somewhere.\n\n163\n00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,526\nAll right, the other place that you'll\nsee it is actually attached to your\n\n164\n00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:30,580\nnetwork adapter, so that's the other\nplace where it needs to be activated.\n\n165\n00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,320\nIf I go into my Network and\nSharing Center, let me go into that.\n\n166\n00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,260\nIf I go into my Network and\nSharing Center, and I go into\n\n167\n00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,370\nChange Adapter Settings, you can pull up\nthe properties of any of your adapters and\n\n168\n00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,600\nyou'll see that the WinPcap has\nkind of attached itself there too.\n\n169\n00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,380\nSo it's in a few different places that\nyou'll see it bound to your system.\n\n170\n00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,570\nSo it actually gets in here and\nattaches to the network adapter.\n\n171\n00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,880\nI'm not seeing the net list either.\n\n172\n00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,310\nI said I had WinPcap\ninstalled on this machine.\n\n173\n00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,509\nMaybe I don't.\n[LAUGH] Well,\n\n174\n00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,107\nthe easiest way to find out there is to\nsee whether or not it's working, right?\n\n175\n00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:11,309\nYou can quickly and easily see whether\nWinPcap is functioning by firing up\n\n176\n00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:14,300\nWireshark, and\npulling up a list of your adapters.\n\n177\n00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,850\nSo I'll do that.\n\n178\n00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,730\nI'll fire up Wireshark.\n\n179\n00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,380\nAnd you'll see your list\nof adaptors over here.\n\n180\n00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,860\nBut if you click on this button that says\nInterface List, it'll list your adaptors.\n\n181\n00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,360\nAnd see how you've got this\npacket information right here?\n\n182\n00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,330\nIt's showing you whether\nit's seeing any packets.\n\n183\n00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,260\nIf WinPcap is functional,\nyou'll see these numbers going up.\n\n184\n00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,670\nIf it's not functional,\nyou'll just see all zeros, right?\n\n185\n00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,450\nNow most of mine show all zeros cuz those\nnetwork adapters aren't plugged in.\n\n186\n00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,930\nI'm not connected to\na WiFi network right now.\n\n187\n00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,710\nThis Local Area Connection 8\nis actually a fake connection.\n\n188\n00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,380\nSo a lot of these are just\nnot even connected.\n\n189\n00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,530\nBut my real connection,\n\n190\n00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,100\nthis ethernet jack,\nI see packets traveling over it, right?\n\n191\n00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,650\nThat's my indicator right there, so\nI know that WinPcap is operational and\n\n192\n00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,850\nrunning fine, all right?\n\n193\n00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,510\nSo just keep that in mind\nwhen you do the install that\n\n194\n00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,240\nWinPcap is kind of\nan important part of this.\n\n195\n00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,080\nAll right.\n\n196\n00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,200\nSo that's getting Wireshark installed.\n\n197\n00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,710\nNot a big deal, right?\n\n198\n00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,060\nOnce it's installed, we need to use it.\n\n199\n00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,700\nSo that's what our next set of\nvideos are gonna be covering.\n\n200\n00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,039\nSo stay tuned and make sure you check out\nthose as we see how to capture our data,\n\n201\n00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,570\nand then how to interpret our data.\n\n202\n00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,410\nIt'll be a lot of fun.\n\n203\n00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,689\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090\n[SOUND].\n\n2\n00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,460\nSo in a previous video we did\ninstalling Wireshark on a Windows PC.\n\n3\n00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,460\nNow I wanna take a look at installing\nWireshark on a Mac OS machine.\n\n4\n00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,733\nYou might have an Apple laptop,\nthey're very common, and\n\n5\n00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,840\nWireshark will run just fine.\n\n6\n00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,640\nThe Wireshark installation on a Mac,\nthough, is a little bit more complex,\n\n7\n00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,940\nI suppose, than on the Windows side.\n\n8\n00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,430\nAnd the reason is the version\nof Wireshark written for\n\n9\n00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,770\nMac wasn't natively written for the Mac.\n\n10\n00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,020\nIt was actually written for Linux and\nthen ported from Linux over to the Mac.\n\n11\n00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,600\nAnd that means there's a few little\nthings we have to do before we can get\n\n12\n00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,570\nWireshark installed.\n\n13\n00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,830\nNow a lot of it isn't called\nout on the Wireshark page.\n\n14\n00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,352\nAnd if you go to the Wireshark webpage and\nyou go to Download, it'll detect that\n\n15\n00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:56,010\nyou're running Mac OS and so you'll see\nwhere it's got the different OSes listed\n\n16\n00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,540\nhere, and I've got OS X 10.6 and later\nIntel 64-bit, that's what I'm running.\n\n17\n00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,330\nSo it's right there.\n\n18\n00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,190\nI see it.\n\n19\n00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,950\nI can jump in there and do the install.\n\n20\n00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,220\nBut, the graphical user interface\n\n21\n00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,850\nis all written in a way that expects\nyou to have a Linux machine.\n\n22\n00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,750\nAnd in Linux, you have the X-1-1,\nor X11, windows manager.\n\n23\n00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,490\nOn a Mac, we don't have that.\n\n24\n00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,330\nWe've got the Aqua windows manager and\nall that stuff, so\n\n25\n00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,090\nit's a different window manager.\n\n26\n00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,310\nSo before we can install the Wireshark,\n\n27\n00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,820\nwell, I guess you could\ninstall it right now.\n\n28\n00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,900\nIt's just not gonna work.\n\n29\n00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,460\nBefore we can get it to work, we need to\ninstall an X window manager on our Mac.\n\n30\n00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,050\nThat doesn't mean we're gonna lose\nthe interface that we've already got.\n\n31\n00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,417\nEverything stays the same, it's just for\n\n32\n00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,250\nWireshark it'll have\nthis alternate interface.\n\n33\n00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,590\nThere's several different X windows\nmanagers that are out there.\n\n34\n00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,130\nThe best one in my opinion\nis one called XQuartz.\n\n35\n00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,745\nIf you go to this website right here,\nwww.macosforge.org,\n\n36\n00:01:54,745 --> 00:02:00,400\nwhen you go to that website they've\ngot several projects listed here.\n\n37\n00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,330\nOne of them is way down\nhere at the bottom.\n\n38\n00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,180\nIt's the XQuartz program and\nso I'm gonna fire that up.\n\n39\n00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,920\nAnd it'll take you the XQuartz page.\n\n40\n00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,031\nAnd it's just a port of the x.org or\n\n41\n00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:16,750\nthe X11 window manager over to\nthe Mac OS environment, right?\n\n42\n00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,710\nSo you can download it.\n\n43\n00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,150\nIt's got XQuartz 2.77.DMG,\nthat's our installation file.\n\n44\n00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,690\nYou know, my mouse is not quite pointing\nat what I'm talking about there, is it?\n\n45\n00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,920\nBut anyhow, it's right there.\n\n46\n00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,560\nWe can download it, and\nwe'll have it ready for us.\n\n47\n00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,590\nSo to get this installed on a Mac, we\nneed to download that file, that's first.\n\n48\n00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,170\nAnd we need to go ahead and\ndownload the Wireshark installer.\n\n49\n00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,670\nSo we'll download that DMG too.\n\n50\n00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,620\nAnd I downloaded those before the show,\nso I've got them sitting right here.\n\n51\n00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,170\nNow in order to install XQuartz,\n\n52\n00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,220\nyou will need to be an administrator\non your machine, right?\n\n53\n00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,580\nIt needs to get installed.\n\n54\n00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,810\nSo if I open up that DMG,\n\n55\n00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,580\nit's gonna connect up and\nit'll have a package that I can install.\n\n56\n00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,860\nYou know, if there's an app where you\ndon't have to be an administrator,\n\n57\n00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,300\nit's one of those where you just drag it\nand drop it into your application folder.\n\n58\n00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,730\nBut in this case, XQuartz has some display\ndriver settings inside of it, and so\n\n59\n00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,360\nit's got to be an installation package.\n\n60\n00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,390\nThat's why we've got to\nbe an administrator.\n\n61\n00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,160\nSo I'm gonna fire that up.\n\n62\n00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,400\nThere's not really any options in here.\n\n63\n00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,790\nWhen we go through and set it up, it's\nbasically just clicking Continue a bunch.\n\n64\n00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,300\nSo I'll hit Continue on my read me,\nI'll hit Continue on the license.\n\n65\n00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,580\nFor the installation type,\nthere's no choice, right?\n\n66\n00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,400\nIt's just a standard install so\nI'll hit that and then it's gonna install.\n\n67\n00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,850\nNow it's prompting me for\nmy administrator permissions\n\n68\n00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,380\nbecause it's gotta install some\nsystem files as part of it.\n\n69\n00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,630\nSo it's gonna get installed and\nthen we'll have it.\n\n70\n00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,250\nOnce that's done I'll turn around and\nI'll do the same thing for Wireshark.\n\n71\n00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,670\nI'm gonna click on that DMG and\nthat'll fire up and\n\n72\n00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,080\nI'll get an installation\npackage there too.\n\n73\n00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,970\nNow, Wireshark is also not just one of\nthose simple drag and drop ones because it\n\n74\n00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,190\nhas to load some packet driver software,\nbut it'll do it as part of the install.\n\n75\n00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,740\nAnd then it'll be done too, right?\n\n76\n00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,610\nSo the installation's pretty\nstraightforward so far.\n\n77\n00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,070\nThe big difference between here and\n\n78\n00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,500\na Windows machine is having to install\nthat X.org desktop environment, right?\n\n79\n00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,170\nSo once we've got that,\n\n80\n00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,450\nthe first time we launch Wireshark it's\ngonna ask where the X environment is, and\n\n81\n00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,770\nwe'll have to point it to XQuartz so it'll\nknow where to find it, so we'll do that.\n\n82\n00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,100\nAfter that, it's installed and\nyou run Wireshark like normal, so\n\n83\n00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,780\nit's really not that bad.\n\n84\n00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,898\nWell, we'll give it just a moment here,\nit's telling me it's about a minute.\n\n85\n00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:31,400\nInstalling this, XQuartz is actually\nreally small so I'm not quite sure why\n\n86\n00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,830\nit's taking so long, but like most\nLinux and UNIX programs it's made up of\n\n87\n00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,510\ntons of very small files and so\ncopying those can take a while.\n\n88\n00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,870\nI'm on an SSD though, so\nit should be pretty fast.\n\n89\n00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,770\nI'll see how patient I can be.\n\n90\n00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,230\nWhile I'm waiting on that, actually, here\nI'll just move that off to the side so\n\n91\n00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,150\nit's kind of doing its thing.\n\n92\n00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,758\nWhile we're waiting on that, I'll go ahead\nand get ready for the Wireshark install.\n\n93\n00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:57,530\nIf I double-click and\nmount that DMG you'll see it right here,\n\n94\n00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,950\nit's got a packaged install\njust like XQuartz did.\n\n95\n00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,420\nAnd it's got a read me you can go\nthrough but we wanna do that install.\n\n96\n00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,910\nThe order that you install\nthese in doesn't really matter.\n\n97\n00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,740\nI could have installed Wireshark first and\n\n98\n00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,940\nthen installed XQuartz afterwards, it's\nnot like one is dependent on the other.\n\n99\n00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,399\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nstart the install for Wireshark.\n\n100\n00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,390\nAnd we'll move forward.\n\n101\n00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,140\nIt's just gonna give me their licensing\nagreement, which I'll sign off on.\n\n102\n00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,306\nAnd it's gonna ask where I wanna install,\n\n103\n00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:28,050\nand it's giving me the choice to change\nthe install location if I want to.\n\n104\n00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,960\nI don't.\n\n105\n00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,468\nI'll leave it be, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:33,658\nAnd then, well,\nnow it's gonna tell me to wait.\n\n107\n00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:36,766\nSo now [LAUGH] I'm gonna wait for this\nguy to finish before the second one can\n\n108\n00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:40,250\nfinish, so we'll give it a second while\nit finishes and then we'll pick back up.\n\n109\n00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,210\nSo let's just take a quick time out and\nwe'll be back as soon as this is done.\n\n110\n00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:52,129\n[SOUND].\n\n111\n00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,482\nAll right, so\nboth the installers just finished,\n\n112\n00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:57,500\nso I'm just gonna hit Close on those,\nand get them out of the way.\n\n113\n00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,754\nNow, when it installed,\nit did install some system preferences and\n\n114\n00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,717\nthings like that, so those are in place,\n\n115\n00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:05,710\nbut I wanna show you where\nthe applications actually ended up.\n\n116\n00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,770\nI'm done with these DMGs, so\nI'll just get those out of there.\n\n117\n00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,600\nIf we go into our Applications\nfolder we'll see we have a new\n\n118\n00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,616\napplication in here, which is Wireshark,\nand it'll be located right there.\n\n119\n00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:19,900\nThe other thing that I want to point out\nis inside of your Applications folder,\n\n120\n00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,810\nthere's a Utilities folder and\ninside of Utilities, you'll find X11.\n\n121\n00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,590\nThat is the XQuartz software\nthat we just installed.\n\n122\n00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,560\nSo it's not called XQuartz,\nit's called X11.\n\n123\n00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,630\nAnd that can be a little bit confusing.\n\n124\n00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,620\nWhen we launch Wireshark the first time,\nit's gonna ask you where that\n\n125\n00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,440\nX windowed environment is, and you'll\nhave to point to that file right there.\n\n126\n00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,280\nSo we just need to know where it's\nlocated, inside of Applications and\n\n127\n00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,860\nUtilities.\n\n128\n00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,820\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nfire up Wireshark, and\n\n129\n00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,890\nwe'll just get that launched.\n\n130\n00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,050\nNow I use X applications like\nthese pretty often and so\n\n131\n00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,590\nit may have cached that to see that\nI've already got the environment.\n\n132\n00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,920\nIf you already have XQuartz for\nsome reason, it may already be there.\n\n133\n00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,810\nBut otherwise,\nit should launch up and prompt us.\n\n134\n00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,010\nNow, I've seen this before.\n\n135\n00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,470\nI've launched Wireshark and it's not\nprompting me, it's just sitting here.\n\n136\n00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,580\nIt's sitting here doing nothing.\n\n137\n00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,110\nAnd I can see I've got\nWireshark up here in my menu.\n\n138\n00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,920\nSo I know it launched.\n\n139\n00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,150\nIt's just not working.\n\n140\n00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,630\nI've seen this before when\nyou launch Wireshark and\n\n141\n00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,080\nyou haven't launched XQuartz prior to it.\n\n142\n00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,890\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nquit out of Wireshark.\n\n143\n00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,710\nAnd I'll launch XQuartz first, and\nso I'll go under Utilities here and\n\n144\n00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,360\nfire up XQuartz, which we only\nhave to do this the first time.\n\n145\n00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,330\nIn the future we'll be able to\nlaunch Wireshark by itself.\n\n146\n00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,050\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nlaunch XQuartz and\n\n147\n00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,390\njust make sure that it doesn't have\nanything pending inside of it.\n\n148\n00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,490\nAnd it seems to be fine.\n\n149\n00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,490\nSo I've just launched it.\n\n150\n00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,580\nI can see I've got XQuartz\nup here in my menu and\n\n151\n00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,190\neverything seems to be fine there.\n\n152\n00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,830\nAll right.\n\n153\n00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,380\nNow I'll go and relaunch Wireshark.\n\n154\n00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,090\nAnd we'll fire it up.\n\n155\n00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,430\nAnd it should see that environment and\ntie into it.\n\n156\n00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,130\nAll right, it looks like it is not picking\nit up, which is going to be a problem,\n\n157\n00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,790\nisn't it?\n\n158\n00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,060\nAll right, unfortunately,\nI've seen this before also.\n\n159\n00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,770\nNormally, the first time you launch\nWireshark, it'll prompt you and say,\n\n160\n00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,570\nhey, where's the X environment?\n\n161\n00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,200\nAnd you browse, and you point it to X11,\nand it's got it and it's happy.\n\n162\n00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700\nIn my case, it didn't prompt.\n\n163\n00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,080\nSo, my next step is to launch XQuartz\nfirst and then launch Wireshark.\n\n164\n00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,380\nAnd it didn't prompt.\n\n165\n00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,950\nMy next thing is to close them both and\ntry and open Wireshark by itself.\n\n166\n00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,570\nAnd if still doesn't work you might\nactually have to reboot to take effect.\n\n167\n00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,100\nI had a lot of this software installed\nin my laptop prior to the show, and\n\n168\n00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,880\nI uninstalled it, and\nI haven't rebooted since then.\n\n169\n00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,150\nSo there's probably some old\npreferences that are getting in my way.\n\n170\n00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,150\nI've seen each of these.\n\n171\n00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,940\nIt's all little quirks with\ngetting Wireshark installed.\n\n172\n00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,775\nOh, actually,\nlooks like I just had to be patient.\n\n173\n00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,570\n[LAUGH] If I waited long enough,\nit launched.\n\n174\n00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,710\nSo anyhow,\nthat does give you guys an idea though,\n\n175\n00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,430\nof some of the scenarios you might have.\n\n176\n00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,910\nIf you launched initially and\n\n177\n00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,940\nit doesn't come up, it may be that it's\nstill just sorting out that environment.\n\n178\n00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,647\nNow I'm in Wireshark,\nI'm gonna get out of it though,\n\n179\n00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:03,364\nbecause I wanna make sure you\nguys see all this cleanly.\n\n180\n00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:08,160\nNotice how I'm in WireShark but\nin my menu bar up here, it say X11.\n\n181\n00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,135\nThe two are tied together.\n\n182\n00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:15,950\nWireshark is dependent on that X windows\nenvironment, so it's connected in there.\n\n183\n00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,840\nIf we close the X environment, it'll close\nevery application that's tied into it.\n\n184\n00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,990\nSo I'm just gonna quit out entirely.\n\n185\n00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,630\nSo, at this point I don't have\nWireshark and I don't have X11 running.\n\n186\n00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,300\nI don't have any of that stuff going on.\n\n187\n00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,660\nAnd I'm just gonna run\nWireshark by itself.\n\n188\n00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,780\nNow, I'm not launching X11 and\nthat's fine.\n\n189\n00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,360\nWireshark knows where to find it.\n\n190\n00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,510\nAnd there it goes.\n\n191\n00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,491\nSo that first time you launch it,\nit's a little bit tricky,\n\n192\n00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,710\nbut after that it runs nice and smooth.\n\n193\n00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,170\nYou don't even have to remember that\nyou've got XQuartz, you just go and\n\n194\n00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,028\nrun Wireshark and\nit'll take care of launching it for you.\n\n195\n00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:53,625\nSo a little bit different than what we saw\nunder Windows where it was just able to\n\n196\n00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,910\nuse the Microsoft Windows Manager,\nno big deal there.\n\n197\n00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,804\nOn the Linux side, you've already\ngot x.org, and so it uses that and\n\n198\n00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:02,063\nit comes up just fine.\n\n199\n00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:06,703\nBut on Mac, because they didn't rewrite\nthe interface to be able to handle Aqua,\n\n200\n00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:10,550\nthey just went ahead and\nbasically brought over this port of X11.\n\n201\n00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,950\nAnd that's what they use,\nso a little bit tricky.\n\n202\n00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,055\nOnce you get past that, though,\nit runs like any other application and\n\n203\n00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:16,950\nyou're good to go.\n\n204\n00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,600\nAll right, well,\nhope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n205\n00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,100\nStayed tuned.\n\n206\n00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,570\nWe got more videos coming\nup on how to use Wireshark,\n\n207\n00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,990\nsome of the other advanced features.\n\n208\n00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,320\nDefinitely be sure to check that out.\n\n209\n00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,600\nBut from this point it doesn't really\nmatter if you're on Mac, Windows or\n\n210\n00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,450\nLinux, you're running Wireshark and\n\n211\n00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,265\nit's the same on the three platforms\nonce you're past the install.\n\n212\n00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:40,034\n[SOUND]\n\n",

right?\n\n3\n00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,040\nThat's how we make this thing\nuseful is get data into it.\n\n4\n00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,320\nSo, I'm going to fire up Wire Shark\nhere and we'll get started.\n\n5\n00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,270\nNow, when you launch Wire Shark up,\nit's gonna fire up.\n\n6\n00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,510\nAnd it's basically going to\npresent you with this screen.\n\n7\n00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,320\nAnd it's asking you whether you're wanting\nto capture new data or open existing data.\n\n8\n00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,410\nYou might have data you\ncaptured previously or\n\n9\n00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,430\nthat you captured with the text\nutility from the command line.\n\n10\n00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,480\nAnd now you wanna go and open it up and\ntake a look at some data.\n\n11\n00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,830\nIt's actually got some sample\ncaptures you can look at,\n\n12\n00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,660\njust to get an idea of\nhow the software works.\n\n13\n00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,760\nWhat I wanna do is I wanna\ncapture some live data.\n\n14\n00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,460\nIt's got a list of my interfaces\nright here that I can pick from, but\n\n15\n00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,650\nI'm really bad about this.\n\n16\n00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,940\nI've always got multiple multiple\nnetwork adapters in my system, and\n\n17\n00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,340\nI can never remember\nwhich one is plugged in.\n\n18\n00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,350\nSometimes, I've bothered to rename them so\nI know what they are,\n\n19\n00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,029\nlike this is my Genus Three network.\n\n20\n00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:03,650\nSometimes I haven't, though, and I've got\nthings like Local Area Connection Eight.\n\n21\n00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,928\nSo, one of the things\nthat I like to do is,\n\n22\n00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:10,630\ninstead of using this set of options here,\nI like to go up to the Interface List.\n\n23\n00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,190\nWhen you click on the Interface List,\nyou can see all your interfaces, and\n\n24\n00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,100\nyou can see which ones\nare receiving traffic.\n\n25\n00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,960\nThat let's me spot really quick which\none it is that's actually plugged in and\n\n26\n00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,860\nin use.\n\n27\n00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,090\nAnd I can see the you\nknow IPv6 address that's\n\n28\n00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,660\nattached to an interface or whatever.\n\n29\n00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,240\nSo, the easy way to kinda go in and\nspot which adapter you want.\n\n30\n00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,410\nYou can capture from more than\none adapter at the same time.\n\n31\n00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,580\nI don't recommend it, because it's\na kind of a lot for the system to do.\n\n32\n00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,930\nBut you can capture multiple NICs at once.\n\n33\n00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,340\nSo, you'll see where I can come over\nhere and check off a couple of these and\n\n34\n00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,640\nnow I'm doing a capture.\n\n35\n00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,020\nThis is the same as if I\nhad done it from out here.\n\n36\n00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,580\nSee how we can just\nhighlight multiple entries?\n\n37\n00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,930\nAnd we can go in and\ncapture these different entries.\n\n38\n00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,210\nThat's the same thing.\n\n39\n00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,830\nNo real difference between the two.\n\n40\n00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,095\nIn fact, the interface list is really\njust combining these two sets of options\n\n41\n00:01:59,095 --> 00:01:59,990\nright here.\n\n42\n00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,640\nThe option to pick pick which\ninterface and my capture options.\n\n43\n00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,120\nLet's take a look at those capture\noptions before we get started,\n\n44\n00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,010\ncuz they're kind of important.\n\n45\n00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,400\nBasically, it's got a few entries\nin here that are useful for us.\n\n46\n00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,570\nYou don't have to change any\nof these if you don't want to.\n\n47\n00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,500\nIf you just want to capture packets and\nhave them on the screen and look at it and\n\n48\n00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,150\nmanually start and stop the capture, then\nyou don't need to change these at all.\n\n49\n00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,820\nThat's exactly how it works.\n\n50\n00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,810\nYou start a capture,\nit dumps it to your screen and\n\n51\n00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,690\nit keeps doing that until\nyou tell it to stop.\n\n52\n00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,080\nAnd if you just let it run and run and\nrun, you'll either run out of RAM or\n\n53\n00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,950\nrun out of hard drive space and\nthen it'll stop.\n\n54\n00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,550\nSo one way or another,\nit'll stop eventually.\n\n55\n00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,220\nBut we can control a lot of that,\nright here.\n\n56\n00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,240\nYou'll see where we can pick which\ninterface we're gonna capture on.\n\n57\n00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,160\nWe can specify a capture filter.\n\n58\n00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,330\nThere might be some traffic that's\ncoming in that we just don't care about.\n\n59\n00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,680\nAnd I don't need that filling up\nmy hard drive space or whatever,\n\n60\n00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000\nif it's something that I\nwanna filter out anyway.\n\n61\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,970\nA lot of times, I'll put a filter on\nthere to filter my own workstation out.\n\n62\n00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,420\nI don't want to see my own traffic.\n\n63\n00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,620\nThat's not why I'm watching the network.\n\n64\n00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,800\nI want to see other traffic.\n\n65\n00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,575\nWe'll do a separate video on\nthe filters a little bit later,\n\n66\n00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:07,460\ncuz there's a particular\nfilter syntax that we'll see.\n\n67\n00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,940\nMore importantly though,\nwe've got our capture files.\n\n68\n00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,490\nSo, I can say I'm gonna do a capture and\nthis is the file that I want to log to.\n\n69\n00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,120\nSo, I can come in here and\nI can specify a particular file.\n\n70\n00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,620\nI'll just call this Show Capture, and\nI'll save that right here on my desktop.\n\n71\n00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,144\nThere we go.\nSo\n\n72\n00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:29,943\nnow I'm gonna be saving to\nthis Show Capture folder.\n\n73\n00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,624\nAnd I can tell it whether I\nwant it to be one file or\n\n74\n00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:35,090\nif I wanna do multiple files, right?\n\n75\n00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,055\nMultiple files are nice if you're worried\nabout having files larger than what your\n\n76\n00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:39,550\nfile system can support.\n\n77\n00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,210\nMaybe you're on FAT32 and you can't\nhave a file over four gigs in size.\n\n78\n00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,150\nMaybe you just want smaller files so\nthat it's easier to analyze.\n\n79\n00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,900\nThe larger files take longer to analyze,\nso you might wanna break it up.\n\n80\n00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,940\nAnd so you can break it up by size or\nby time, right?\n\n81\n00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,020\nI might wanna say, create a separate\nlog file every 30 minutes.\n\n82\n00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,350\nSo, if I run this scan for six hours,\nit'll create 12 files, alright?\n\n83\n00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,108\nOr, you might wanna go by size.\n\n84\n00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:10,400\nJust every time it hits 200 megabytes,\ngo ahead and break it into a new file.\n\n85\n00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,040\nWhatever works for you,\nyou can choose right there.\n\n86\n00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,320\nAnd then you also have what\nis called a ring buffer.\n\n87\n00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,390\nNow, what is that?\n\n88\n00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,670\nWhat is ring buffering?\n\n89\n00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,310\nWell that means you limit the amount\nof data that you can write, and\n\n90\n00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,150\nwhen you fill it up, you just go back and\nstart overwriting the older stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,280\nSo if I say,\ncreate a new file every one hour.\n\n92\n00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,320\nOkay, so every hour I want\nit to create a new file, and\n\n93\n00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,680\nI set the ring buffer to six, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,760\nThat means each hour for six hours,\nit's gonna create a file.\n\n95\n00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,360\nBut on the seventh hour, it'll delete\nthe first file and overwrite it.\n\n96\n00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,280\nSo, I'll never have more than six files\nbecause I chose one file an hour and\n\n97\n00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,200\nring buffer at six.\n\n98\n00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,710\nSo, I'll never have more than six files.\n\n99\n00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,560\nIt works the same way for size.\n\n100\n00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,060\nIf I said every one gigabyte, and\n\n101\n00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,830\na ring buffer with six files,\nthat means I'll have six gigs of files.\n\n102\n00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,470\nAnd when it fills that up,\nit'll just overwrite the original one.\n\n103\n00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,150\nSo, some people call this log rotation or\nrotating.\n\n104\n00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,590\nThere's different names for it.\n\n105\n00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,330\nBut basically,\nwe're doing circular logging.\n\n106\n00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,020\nAt the end,\nit starts to overwrite the beginning.\n\n107\n00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,276\nI'm gonna turn those off though, cuz I'm\ngonna do manual execution All right,\n\n108\n00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:31,850\nthen we've got stop capture\nautomatically after.\n\n109\n00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,990\nBy default, when you start a capture,\nit'll run forever.\n\n110\n00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,830\nIt'll run until you stop it.\n\n111\n00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,560\nBut if you just want to run it for\nthe day, and capture some data,\n\n112\n00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,770\nyou might wanna stop it\nat a particular time.\n\n113\n00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,170\nSo you can come in and you can say,\nstop after a certain amount of packets or\n\n114\n00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,960\nstop after a certain amount of files.\n\n115\n00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,000\nYou'll have those options.\n\n116\n00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,620\nAnd see how some of these are grayed out?\n\n117\n00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,630\nIt's because it's influenced by\nthe options up above, right, whether or\n\n118\n00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,800\nnot you'll see these.\n\n119\n00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,380\nSo there's particular mixes and\n\n120\n00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,749\nmatches that you have to do to\nget all the different options.\n\n121\n00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,620\nOther things we've got,\ndisplay options, right?\n\n122\n00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,940\nThis one right here: update\nlist of packets in real time.\n\n123\n00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,150\nIf you're gonna be watching\nthis on the screen,\n\n124\n00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,340\nit'll display the packets in real time.\n\n125\n00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,960\nThat takes a lot of CPU power.\n\n126\n00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,180\nIt takes a lot of resources to do that,\nespecially on a busy network.\n\n127\n00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,610\nSo you can turn that off and say don't\nupdate the list of packets in real time.\n\n128\n00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,770\nIf you're just gonna analyze this later,\nyou're not going to analyze it now,\n\n129\n00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,670\nyou're gonna analyze it later,\ndon't display it on the screen.\n\n130\n00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,340\nIt'll speed up performance considerably.\n\n131\n00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,740\nNow it just gets the packets and\nwrites them to the hard drive.\n\n132\n00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,420\nAs opposed to getting the packets and\nhaving to write them to the screen and\n\n133\n00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,570\ndo real time interpretation.\n\n134\n00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,740\nNow, on a fast machine,\nit's not that big of an impact.\n\n135\n00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,470\nBut if this is an older machine or\n\n136\n00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,760\na machine where you're gonna be doing\nother work on it at the same time,\n\n137\n00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,060\nit's a good idea to turn off that\nreal time display, all right?\n\n138\n00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,740\nOther things, like automatically\nscroll during live capture.\n\n139\n00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,770\nSo, it's keeping the newest packets\non the screen at all times.\n\n140\n00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,990\nAgain that takes up some resources.\n\n141\n00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,030\nHide capture info dialog.\n\n142\n00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,415\nWhen you float over or\n\n143\n00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:04,690\ndouble-click on a capture item it'll\ndisplay some information on it.\n\n144\n00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,720\nYou can choose to hide that,\n\n145\n00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,820\nwhich again will help to improve\nperformance of the capture.\n\n146\n00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,320\nAnd notice,\nif I turn off update list in real time,\n\n147\n00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,930\nautomatically scrolling is turned off.\n\n148\n00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,110\nSo, some of these are tied together.\n\n149\n00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,800\nAnd then down here, name resolution.\n\n150\n00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,980\nThis is another one that\naffects performance.\n\n151\n00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,460\nWhen it gets a MAC address or\nwhen it gets an IP address, it can try and\n\n152\n00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,080\nresolve that to a name.\n\n153\n00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,980\nThat's helpful for us if we're trying to\nkeep track of what machine is what and\n\n154\n00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,482\nwe don't have all our IPs memorized.\n\n155\n00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000\nBut, It does create some effort.\n\n156\n00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,860\nSo, you've got resolve MAC addresses.\n\n157\n00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,200\nThat one is checked by default cuz\nthat's an easy one to look up.\n\n158\n00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,690\nYou know, a MAC address is 48 bits,\nand the first 24 bits identify\n\n159\n00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,118\nthe manufacturer and\nthe last 24 bits are random stuff.\n\n160\n00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:48,040\nSo here it'll look a the first 24 bits and\nit'll say,\n\n161\n00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,270\noh that's a Dell network card or\nHP or Cisco, Juniper, whatever.\n\n162\n00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,050\nAnd it'll show who that vendor is.\n\n163\n00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,879\nThat's on by default.\n\n164\n00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,590\nBut network layer names, right.\n\n165\n00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,095\nThat's your IP addresses.\n\n166\n00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:04,400\nIt'll take your IPs and do a reverse DNS\nlook up to try and find the host name.\n\n167\n00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,580\nThat takes a little bit more effort.\n\n168\n00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,950\nBecause we gotta do a lookup for\neach one individually versus a vendor,\n\n169\n00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,828\nwhere it's almost common\nthroughout your data.\n\n170\n00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:15,850\nHere's it's different.\nSo that one's turned off by default.\n\n171\n00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,060\nResolve transport layer names.\n\n172\n00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,120\nNow, we're up at that TCP layer.\n\n173\n00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,980\nThat's where it's gonna take a look at the\nports that are communicating and try and\n\n174\n00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,020\nturn those into names.\n\n175\n00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,030\nAnd then lastly,\nuse external network name resolver.\n\n176\n00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,890\nThat's where, do we do the look\nups just on our own local cache?\n\n177\n00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,110\nOr do we actually reach out to things\nlike a DNS server to look for that?\n\n178\n00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,610\nThis is all good stuff, cuz it makes\nthe information easier to interpret, but\n\n179\n00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,970\nit does affect performance.\n\n180\n00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,100\nSo, I may or may not wanna turn these on,\n\n181\n00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,420\ndepending on whether I'm gonna use my\nsystem while it's scanning or not.\n\n182\n00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,720\nAll right, so\n\n183\n00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,220\nthose are all some of the options that\nwe can choose when we turn on a scan.\n\n184\n00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,740\nI'm gonna cancel out of that,\n\n185\n00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,870\nbecause I'm gonna just run with\nthe default options and fire it up.\n\n186\n00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,070\nBasically, if you want to do a quick and\neasy scan,\n\n187\n00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,480\nyou just choose the adaptor you wanna\nscan, and you hit the Start button.\n\n188\n00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,140\nOr, like I said, what I normally\ndo is go to the interface list,\n\n189\n00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,650\ncuz I can never remember\nwhich adapter is live.\n\n190\n00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,130\nI find the adapter I want, and\nI choose it, and hit Start, all right?\n\n191\n00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,120\nSo, whichever way you choose to go about\nit, there's different ways to find it.\n\n192\n00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440\nSet up your options, and\nfire up that capture.\n\n193\n00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,580\nNow, since I've gone in here, and\nchanged some of my capture options,\n\n194\n00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,590\nit's got a few different things\nclicked and changed now.\n\n195\n00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,670\nActually I think I've put everything\nback to the way that it was.\n\n196\n00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,820\nLet me just scan that real quick,\nmake sure it's all good.\n\n197\n00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,270\nI believe it is.\n\n198\n00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,780\nSo, if I fire that up,\nit's gonna start capturing and\n\n199\n00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,120\nright off I can start to\nsee data flowing through.\n\n200\n00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,060\nNow, there's a lot of information\npassing through when it connects, and\n\n201\n00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,980\nsometimes it might not look\nlike its updating at all.\n\n202\n00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,830\nIt may look like its standing still.\n\n203\n00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,290\nSo, you can look down here at the bottom\nto get an idea of whether anything's\n\n204\n00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,530\nactually happening.\n\n205\n00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,350\nAnd I can see in the few moments that I've\nrun, it's captured over 180,000 packets.\n\n206\n00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,140\nAnd it's displayed, well now over 200,000.\n\n207\n00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,370\nThat mean's I'm in a 100% real\ntime display mode right now.\n\n208\n00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,260\nI'm seeing everything that comes through.\n\n209\n00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,190\nIt's possible that my\ndisplay could get behind and\n\n210\n00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,280\nI might see where I've received more\npackets than are being displayed.\n\n211\n00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,189\nThat can happen.\n\n212\n00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:17,510\nBut it's capturing and it's running.\n\n213\n00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,650\nI'm over 300,000 packets now,\nand it's churning along.\n\n214\n00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,050\nThe interface is broken up into a couple\nof different pieces, which I'll describe.\n\n215\n00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,140\nActually I'll do that in\na separate video segment.\n\n216\n00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,800\nSo we'll see that in\nthe next video segment.\n\n217\n00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,340\nBut the main part here that I'm\nconcerned about is this little\n\n218\n00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,770\nstatus bar right here at the bottom.\n\n219\n00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,900\nIt's letting me know I am capturing data,\n\n220\n00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,890\nI'm gathering the information and\nit's right there.\n\n221\n00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,440\nAll right, so\nthat's how we start capturing data.\n\n222\n00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,940\nStay tuned.\n\n223\n00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,020\nIn our next video we're gonna\nsee how this interface works.\n\n224\n00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,130\nWe'll kind of walk through\nthe user interface and\n\n225\n00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,820\nthen we'll start to work\nwith some of the data too.\n\n226\n00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,790\nSo I hope to see you then.\n\n227\n00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,979\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,286\n[SOUND] So\none of the most intimidating things about\n\n2\n00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:11,048\nWireshark can be how much\ndata it's throwing at you and\n\n3\n00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:16,948\nthe user interface and\nit's just a lot to kind of grasp.\n\n4\n00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,974\nSo, in this video, I want to take\na look at that user interface and\n\n5\n00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:23,661\njust kind of show you what's going on and\nwhat we expect to see in the software and\n\n6\n00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:24,725\nhelp make sense of it.\n\n7\n00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,276\nIn an earlier episode,\n\n8\n00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:31,120\nwe covered all of the basic stuff of\ngetting a packet capture started.\n\n9\n00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,190\nSo, I'm just going to fire one up here and\nget that running.\n\n10\n00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,163\nSo, this is the interface that\nwe're going to see the majority\n\n11\n00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,700\nof the time that we're\nworking inside of Wireshark.\n\n12\n00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,938\nLike most Windows software,\nor really software on any OS,\n\n13\n00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:48,018\nyou've got your task bar at the top\nwhere you've got various menu items and\n\n14\n00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:51,023\nicons that represent stuff\nthat's in the menu items.\n\n15\n00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,634\nA little bit of redundancy, and\n\n16\n00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:55,460\nthen you've got a status\nbar here at the bottom.\n\n17\n00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,290\nNow the status bar is pretty handy\nbecause it's letting me know that I'm\n\n18\n00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,110\nactually capturing data.\n\n19\n00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,900\nSo we see that this stuff is\nbeing updated in real time,\n\n20\n00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,690\nwe can see what's kind of happening.\n\n21\n00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,060\nBut let's take a look at\neach of these pieces.\n\n22\n00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,197\nUp at the top I've got my menu bar and\n\n23\n00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:15,342\njust like any software I've got\nthings like file and save or save as.\n\n24\n00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,711\nNotice that my save and save as options\nare kind of grayed out right now,\n\n25\n00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,972\nand that's because I'm actively capturing.\n\n26\n00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:25,264\nSome of these options will light up\nonly when you're not capturing so\n\n27\n00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:29,800\nI might have to stop or pause\nthe capture to be able to save the file.\n\n28\n00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,080\nIt can't say if a file was being actively\nwritten to is its main problem there.\n\n29\n00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,118\nYou'll see where I can export packets and\ndo some really cool things.\n\n30\n00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:39,046\nUnder Edit we've got our Copy, Paste,\n\n31\n00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:42,730\nall the different things that we'd\nexpect to have inside of software.\n\n32\n00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,333\nWe're gonna use some of these\noptions in later episodes.\n\n33\n00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,819\nThings like Time Shift is really cool.\n\n34\n00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,370\nSo we'll get a chance to see those.\n\n35\n00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,470\nBut for the most part,\n\n36\n00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,330\nwhat's up here is really is really being\nrepresented is these icons down here.\n\n37\n00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,410\nThese are the most common menu items.\n\n38\n00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,220\nAnd so they're the ones we are going\nto use on a regular basis.\n\n39\n00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,640\nAnd if you look at them they're\npretty straight forward.\n\n40\n00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,550\nThese three guys right here, the green\nshark fin, that's starting the capture and\n\n41\n00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,430\nthat's grayed out for\nme cuz I'm already in a capture.\n\n42\n00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,990\nBut I can also stop the capture or\nrestart the capture.\n\n43\n00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,632\nStopping it, that just stops\nme from gathering stuff and\n\n44\n00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,401\nfrees the system up to be able to work.\n\n45\n00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:20,360\nI can see my packet numbers down\nhere have stopped incrementing.\n\n46\n00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,000\nSo now I'm not recording anymore.\n\n47\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,460\nIt's just sitting here waiting for\nme to do something, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,091\nAnd that restart button\nif I would have hit that,\n\n49\n00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:32,183\nwould have wiped out the capture and\nstarted over again.\n\n50\n00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:37,140\nAnd started capturing again with\nour new data coming in, all right?\n\n51\n00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,480\nMy green fin lit up again, so\nI can start a new capture.\n\n52\n00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,690\nOn the initial page when I first\nlaunched Wireshark, I had options to\n\n53\n00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,990\npick my interface, and I had options\nto change the capture options, right?\n\n54\n00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,970\nWhat if we're already beyond that.\n\n55\n00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,980\nWell that's what these\nfirst two icons are.\n\n56\n00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,790\nThe first icon pulls up\nthat interface list.\n\n57\n00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,640\nSo I can pick which interface\nI'm capturing on and\n\n58\n00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,690\nI can change it from here.\n\n59\n00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,830\nThe second icon is the capture options and\nif I click on that there's my capture\n\n60\n00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,270\noptions and so I can adjust things like\nwhat file it's writing to and all of that.\n\n61\n00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,120\nI think I did that in a different episode.\n\n62\n00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,871\nSo I can come in here and\npunch in that information.\n\n63\n00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,715\nAnd so now, it's got it and\noff we go, right..\n\n64\n00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:22,330\nSo we can start that\ncapture back up again.\n\n65\n00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,650\nIf I try and start a new capture,\n\n66\n00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,200\nit's going to ask what I\nwant to do with the old one.\n\n67\n00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,710\nDo I want to save it or\ndo I want to just throw it out.\n\n68\n00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,260\nI'm going to say continue without saving.\n\n69\n00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,000\nThat means throw out my old capture and\nstart again.\n\n70\n00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,764\nSo there it goes trying to close it.\n\n71\n00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:36,450\nApparently it's taking its time.\n\n72\n00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,740\nAnd then once it's closed,\nit will start again.\n\n73\n00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,815\nAnd it's actually returned me back\nto this little wizard screen.\n\n74\n00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:44,926\nBut I didn't have to come to this because\nI had the menu options up here to do it.\n\n75\n00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:51,760\nSo, if you see a long closing time like\nthis, it usually means one of two things.\n\n76\n00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,810\nOne, it may mean you\njust have an incredibly,\n\n77\n00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,530\nI got a little click happy there.\n\n78\n00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,310\nIt probably means you have\nan incredibly large capture file.\n\n79\n00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,303\nYou've captured a lot of data to RAM and\nit's having to write it to hard drive, or\n\n80\n00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:04,021\ntwo it could be file permissions.\n\n81\n00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:07,117\nMine finished, so that just means\nI captured a lot of data, so\n\n82\n00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:08,618\nit took it a while to write it.\n\n83\n00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:12,831\nBut if I had, you know, still been sitting\nhere and it wasn't done, it could mean\n\n84\n00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:16,640\nthat it was trying to write to a file\nthat it doesn't have permissions to.\n\n85\n00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,190\nSo that could be another reason\nthat it's sitting there.\n\n86\n00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,230\nBut mine finally finished and\nnow it's started a new capture and\n\n87\n00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,310\nit's churning along.\n\n88\n00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,400\nI was over 800,000 packets before, and\n\n89\n00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,889\nnow I see that I'm just creeping up on\n300,000, so I know it did start over.\n\n90\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,970\nAll right.\nLet me stop that so\n\n91\n00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,730\nit doesn't go crazy on me.\n\n92\n00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,190\nAll right.\nThe rest of these options,\n\n93\n00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,270\nwe're gonna tackle later on\nin other segments cuz there's\n\n94\n00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,870\na lot of stuff in here as far\nas reloading captures and so on.\n\n95\n00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,853\nThe rest of the interface is really\nmade of of three primary panes,\n\n96\n00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:45,770\nlike window panes.\n\n97\n00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,446\nThe top part here,\nthis is my live packet capture, so\n\n98\n00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:51,364\nit's listing all of the packets\nthat have been captured.\n\n99\n00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:52,805\nWell, it was live when I was running it.\n\n100\n00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:55,040\nNow that I've stopped it,\nit's kind of frozen.\n\n101\n00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,990\nBut I can see all the different\npackets that came through.\n\n102\n00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,090\nAnd it breaks them down based on\nthe time we captured it, the source IP,\n\n103\n00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,360\nthe destination IP,\n\n104\n00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,910\nthe protocol that was used, and\nthat's the transport layer protocol.\n\n105\n00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,370\nThe length of the packet.\n\n106\n00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,040\nI'm seeing all of that information right\nthere that it gathered off of that.\n\n107\n00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,020\nAs I click on each packet,\nthe bottom two frames will update.\n\n108\n00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,800\nThe middle one,\nthis is the packet that's been dissected.\n\n109\n00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,300\nIt's broken it apart and turned it\ninto something that's human readable.\n\n110\n00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,250\nA packet,\n\n111\n00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,950\nyou know really what we're gathering\nare frames at the end of the day.\n\n112\n00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,210\nAnd a frame is made up of\nseveral layers of data.\n\n113\n00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,630\nThis is all from the OSI model, right.\n\n114\n00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,970\nWe have our seven layer\nnetworking OSI model, and\n\n115\n00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,082\neach layer represents a certain\namount of information.\n\n116\n00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:47,140\nWell, Wireshark is taking\neach of these packets, and\n\n117\n00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,080\nbreaking down those layers of\nthe OSI model to show us that data.\n\n118\n00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,110\nSo I can come in here and\nI can see the frame information.\n\n119\n00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,160\nFrame, right,\nthat's layer two of the OSI model.\n\n120\n00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,890\nAnd so I can look in and\nI can see information about\n\n121\n00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,380\nthings like the source MAC address,\nthe destination MAC address.\n\n122\n00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,570\nI can see the, there's the source and\ndestination MAC address.\n\n123\n00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,440\nI can see the CRC,\nthe check sum that was done.\n\n124\n00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,290\nThe header lengths.\n\n125\n00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,870\nAll that stuff is stored right here in\nthe layer two information of that frame.\n\n126\n00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,550\nThen we see the layer three and\nlayer four sections from the OSI model.\n\n127\n00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,490\nLayer three for me is Internet protocol.\n\n128\n00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,610\nI'm using TC/IP,\nIP is layer three protocol.\n\n129\n00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,918\nSo I can see things like the source and\ndestination IP address.\n\n130\n00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,000\nThey're right down here,\nsource and destination IPs.\n\n131\n00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,990\nAll right.\n\n132\n00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,020\nAnd then I can see layer four for\nwhatever this packet was.\n\n133\n00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,850\nSo I clicked on this one.\n\n134\n00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,680\nThis was a TCP packet.\n\n135\n00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,845\nAnd if I expand it out here it will\nshow the source port was 49,200,\n\n136\n00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:51,733\nmy destination port was 49,490.\n\n137\n00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:52,464\nAll right?\n\n138\n00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:53,440\nWhat protocol is that?\n\n139\n00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,500\nI have no idea, right?\n\n140\n00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,610\nProtocols with a port\nnumber that's over 1,024,\n\n141\n00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,650\nwe don't necessarily know\nexactly what they are.\n\n142\n00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,560\nSome of them are registered.\n\n143\n00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,310\nThere's a lot of registered\nports higher than that.\n\n144\n00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,970\nBut when they're this high, 49,000,\nthat's in that range where it's free use.\n\n145\n00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,470\nSo any software can use this.\n\n146\n00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,270\nSo I don't really know what\nthis communication is just\n\n147\n00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,890\nbased on a port number.\n\n148\n00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,270\nBut sometimes we'll get packets that\nare a little more recognizable.\n\n149\n00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,700\nLet me see if I can find one.\n\n150\n00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,590\nWell, there's DHCP.\n\n151\n00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,940\nDHCP's a bad example though,\nbecause it's broadcast.\n\n152\n00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,520\nBut I guess it'll do in a pinch.\n\n153\n00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,815\nAll right, so\nhere's a DHCP packet that's going out.\n\n154\n00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,225\nAnd so when I look in here, I'll see the\nlayer one, layer two, layer three stuff.\n\n155\n00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:37,105\nYou don't see layer one,\nright, that's physical.\n\n156\n00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:40,865\nBut there's no layer four side to DHCP,\nit's just a broadcast out.\n\n157\n00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:45,595\nSo this is actually DHCP V6, which is\nactually a multicast out that's going on.\n\n158\n00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:48,685\nSo I can start to see some of\nthat information and dissect it.\n\n159\n00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:51,720\nBut the point is the top\npane is the list of packets.\n\n160\n00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,362\nThe middle pane is a human\nreadable breakdown of that packet.\n\n161\n00:07:56,362 --> 00:08:02,190\nAnd then the third pane, the one at\nthe bottom, that's the raw packet itself.\n\n162\n00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,230\nThis was what was actually being sent\nacross the network for that particular\n\n163\n00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,320\ncommunication, so we start to look at\nsome of these, that's the raw data.\n\n164\n00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,020\nWell, these packets here that\nI don't know what they are.\n\n165\n00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,900\nWell, I actually do know what they are.\n\n166\n00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,030\nThat's my IP address on the left, and\n\n167\n00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,620\nthe IP address on the right is\nthe IP of our video switch.\n\n168\n00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,750\nThat's my shared desktop.\n\n169\n00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,170\nI'm sharing my screen using some\nvideo sharing software and that's it.\n\n170\n00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,430\nNow when I look at this down here,\nI just see a bunch of hexadecimal and\n\n171\n00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,640\nmachine code garbage.\n\n172\n00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,190\nDoesn't mean anything to me.\n\n173\n00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,999\nBut, that's actually the encoded\nvideo of my desktop.\n\n174\n00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:37,040\nThat's a picture of my desktop, right?\n\n175\n00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,530\nIt may actually be a couple pictures,\n\n176\n00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,510\ndepending on how much fit\ninside of that packet.\n\n177\n00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,900\nBut it's probably just one snapshot\nof my desktop right there.\n\n178\n00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,300\nAnd it doesn't make any sense down here.\n\n179\n00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,750\nBut when it interprets it, when it\nbreaks it down in this middle pane,\n\n180\n00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,450\nwe can start to see a lot\nmore information about it.\n\n181\n00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,860\nThe ports, the source, the destination.\n\n182\n00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,340\nIt's probably a part of a sequence, right?\n\n183\n00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,947\nThere's probably more than one frame or\npacket being sent for this so\n\n184\n00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:04,005\nit can actually string that together.\n\n185\n00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:08,270\nHere's my sequence number, 11,681.\n\n186\n00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,252\nThat means there's probably an 11,680 and\nprobably an 11,682, and\n\n187\n00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:16,010\nWireshark can actually string those\ntogether to show me the whole sequence.\n\n188\n00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,660\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n189\n00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,640\nAll right, the last part of\nthe user interface is right\n\n190\n00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,370\nhere at the bottom which\nis the status bar.\n\n191\n00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,810\nAnd so\nI can see what I'm viewing right now so\n\n192\n00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,990\nI'm viewing a sequence number right now.\n\n193\n00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,276\nI can see that I've got 327,000 packets,\nand I'm displaying,\n\n194\n00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:39,760\n[LAUGH] 327,000 packet,\nif i can read numbers.\n\n195\n00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920\nI can see dropped, zero.\n\n196\n00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,453\nThat means that at no point did my machine\nget overloaded and I had to drop packets.\n\n197\n00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,855\nFor the amount of time that I monitored,\n\n198\n00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:51,397\nI captured 100% of what my\ncomputer saw on the network.\n\n199\n00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:55,670\nAll right, now all of this gets gathered\ntogether, it all gets represented\n\n200\n00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,233\nin this user interface,\nit's where we spend most of our time.\n\n201\n00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:02,680\nBut there are other\ninterfaces that you'll see.\n\n202\n00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,480\nSo, for example, if you take a packet and\n\n203\n00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,760\ndouble click on it,\nyou get a break down window.\n\n204\n00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,560\nNow, what's in the break down window?\n\n205\n00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,090\nThe same information that was\nin the main window, right?\n\n206\n00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,700\nExcept it's taken out the packet list,\ncuz now I'm just looking at one packet.\n\n207\n00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,640\nI get the human readable breakdown up here\non the top, and I get the raw output.\n\n208\n00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,245\nThis is what the actual packet\ncontained right here at the bottom, and\n\n209\n00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:28,261\nit's kinda fun if you go around here and\n\n210\n00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,640\nclick It will show you where in\nthe raw packet that data came from.\n\n211\n00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,456\nSo the fact that the source port\nwas 49,490 was stored right at\n\n212\n00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:39,510\nthe beginning of the packet in the header.\n\n213\n00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,000\nAnd you can even click around here to\nexperiment, say well what is this?\n\n214\n00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,980\nWell this was one of\nthe destination bit values.\n\n215\n00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,800\nThese will be things like the source\nMAC address and destination.\n\n216\n00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040\nYeah, this one's actually\nthe source MAC address right here.\n\n217\n00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,890\nSo you can spot that inside of the packet.\n\n218\n00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,040\nIt's all stored right there\nif you know how to read it.\n\n219\n00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,590\nThe problem is most of us\ndon't know how to read it.\n\n220\n00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,740\nI don't know exactly which\nbits contain what data.\n\n221\n00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,022\nSo the interpretation up here\ntakes that burden away from me.\n\n222\n00:11:06,022 --> 00:11:10,080\nAll right, now on this screen you\ndon't have to see all this data.\n\n223\n00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,788\nYou can customize the layout\nhowever you want and\n\n224\n00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:17,345\nyou'll see a bunch of buttons up here that\nlet you manipulate that like here we've\n\n225\n00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:20,598\ngot colorize the packets and\nauto scroll the packet list.\n\n226\n00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:24,278\nYou can turn those on and off and that\nwill manipulate the way you know maybe I\n\n227\n00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,256\ndon't want those things to be colored but\nit is kind of nice to have them colored,\n\n228\n00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:30,850\nit's different colors for\ndifferent activities.\n\n229\n00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,160\nBut you can also customize other\nthings if you go into your view menu.\n\n230\n00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,120\nSee how I've got my main toolbar,\nfilter, and status bar, packet list,\n\n231\n00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,130\npacket details, packet byte.\n\n232\n00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,250\nA lot of times if I'm running this and\nI'm running it for\n\n233\n00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,920\na long period of time, I might just\nturn off the packet details and\n\n234\n00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,340\nthe packet bytes so\nthat all I'm seeing is the packet list.\n\n235\n00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,890\nRight?\n\n236\n00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,900\nNow I can start it up and it's running and\nI'm just seeing the packet list.\n\n237\n00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,337\nAnd it's scrolling in real time to\nkeep the packets up on my screen.\n\n238\n00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:04,456\nI might turn that off to say don't scroll\nin real time, just capture the packets.\n\n239\n00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:08,409\nThis is a pretty low intensity way to\nwatch it, and I can come in here and\n\n240\n00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:11,828\nscroll around and\nsee what's getting recorded and view it.\n\n241\n00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:16,522\nIt does get a bit sluggish because it's\nreally active doing stuff, and if I want\n\n242\n00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:21,233\nto see a particular packet, I can find\none, and I can just double-click on it.\n\n243\n00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:29,847\nAnd there's the other two panes\nof data that I just turned off.\n\n244\n00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:34,571\nSo I still have quick and easy access\nto that data if I want to get to it.\n\n245\n00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,218\nAnd then if I want to turn it back on,\nI can always go back up here to View and\n\n246\n00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:37,706\nturn the packet details and\npacket bytes back on whenever I want.\n\n247\n00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:38,936\nReal easy to manipulate that stuff.\n\n248\n00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:42,071\nChange the user interface to be\nwhatever's convenient to you.\n\n249\n00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:45,697\nWhen you're troubleshooting you\nshouldn't have to fight with software\n\n250\n00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,880\nto get the information you need.\n\n251\n00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,290\nMake this work for you.\n\n252\n00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,220\nAll right well,\nthat's probably enough for this segment.\n\n253\n00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,764\nI do want to go a little more into some of\nthe neat things we can do with the packets\n\n254\n00:12:56,764

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,081\n[SOUND] All right at this\npoint we've seen how to fire\n\n2\n00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:10,138\nup Wireshark and\nwe've seen how to get data flowing\n\n3\n00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,208\ninto the system to start\ncapturing those packets.\n\n4\n00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,004\nNow I wanna highlight something\nthat's really important,\n\n5\n00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:20,800\na big mistake that a lot of people make.\n\n6\n00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,970\nWhen you fire up Wireshark and\nyou pick your network interface and\n\n7\n00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,320\nyou start it recording.\n\n8\n00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,330\nRight?\nSo off it goes,\n\n9\n00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,500\nit's capturing data on that network.\n\n10\n00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,270\nIt's probably not getting all\nthe data you think it is.\n\n11\n00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:32,970\nAll right?\n\n12\n00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,650\nMy laptop is plugged into\nthe 10.1.230.0 network.\n\n13\n00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,970\nThat's the network we\nuse here in the studio.\n\n14\n00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,990\nAnd I know that my producer over there,\nour director,\n\n15\n00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,560\nsome of the others hosts that\nare off camera right now.\n\n16\n00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,950\nThey've all got their computers fired up.\n\n17\n00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,220\nThey're on that 10.1.230 network and\nthey're browsing the Internet and\n\n18\n00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:50,960\ndoing other things.\n\n19\n00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,660\nSo I know they're on the network with me,\nand I'm capturing data with Wiresharks so\n\n20\n00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,480\nI'm probably getting their data, right?\n\n21\n00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,144\nWell, probably not.\n\n22\n00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:04,420\nOn a switch based network, which\nalmost every network is today, right,\n\n23\n00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,090\non a switch based network,\na switch will take a broadcast and\n\n24\n00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,860\nsend it out every port of the switch.\n\n25\n00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,560\nSo, yes, I'm seeing all the broadcasts.\n\n26\n00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,670\nBut Unicasts, it will look at\nthe source MAC address, and\n\n27\n00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,220\nthe destination MAC address.\n\n28\n00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,680\nAnd it will send those frames\n\n29\n00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280\njust to the port that matches\nthe destination MAC address.\n\n30\n00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,350\nSo if my director, Jason, if Jason\nis reaching out to Nate's computer,\n\n31\n00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,730\nwell, neither of those are my computer.\n\n32\n00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,630\nMy Mac address is not the destination\nof that communication, so\n\n33\n00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,440\nthe switch is never going\nto send it to my computer.\n\n34\n00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,350\nThose two computers could be talking\nright now and I wouldn't even know it.\n\n35\n00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,030\nSo for example, let's do this,\nwe'll use Jason our director.\n\n36\n00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,090\nJason could I get you to\nfire up the ITProTV page or\n\n37\n00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,960\nif you are already on it just\nhit refresh or something.\n\n38\n00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,750\nSo I've been capturing for a little while\nnow, we're at almost 800,000 packets.\n\n39\n00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,880\nAnd I know for a fact Jason just\nwent to the ITProTV website.\n\n40\n00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,640\nI'm gonna stop the capture and\nI'm gonna search for him, for his stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,390\nAnd there's a few ways to search\nyou'll see like find a packet,\n\n42\n00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,050\na little button you can use.\n\n43\n00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,690\nBut I like to use filters and we're\ngonna do a dedicated video on filters.\n\n44\n00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,440\nBut one of the most simple ones is\nwhere you can search for an IP address.\n\n45\n00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,020\nAnd I know Jason's address,\nso that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n46\n00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,190\nHe is 10.1.230.5.\n\n47\n00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,878\nSo I'm basically saying just show\nme the packets that are from or\n\n48\n00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,720\nto 10.1.230.5, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,070\nSo it's gonna filter through all those\npackets that I just captured, and\n\n50\n00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,980\nthen it's gonna give me a list of\njust the ones that meet my criteria.\n\n51\n00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,430\nSo it'll take just a second\ncause I captured a lot of stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,490\nNow, you might be expecting to see,\noh here's where Jason browsed to ITProTV.\n\n53\n00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,610\nHere's where this happened,\nor that happened.\n\n54\n00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,400\nBut at the end of the day you'll come\nin here and be surprised, right?\n\n55\n00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,540\nSo, I see some UDP traffic here,\nthat's not his web browsing, right?\n\n56\n00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,100\nI see some NBNS, and that's it.\n\n57\n00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,160\nI just see a little tiny handful of\npackets from his machine, right?\n\n58\n00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,800\nLet me stretch this out here so\nyou can see a little better.\n\n59\n00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,590\nThis is it.\n\n60\n00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,350\nThis is not a lot of packets.\n\n61\n00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,120\nThis is just a handful.\n\n62\n00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,150\nIt's 15.\nIf I look down here it says displayed.\n\n63\n00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,667\nI only see 15 packets from Jason.\n\n64\n00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,620\nThe source on all of them is 10.1.230.5.\n\n65\n00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,370\nLook at the destinations.\n\n66\n00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,930\nThe destination on every\none of them 10.1.230.255.\n\n67\n00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,990\nThat's when Jason sent out a broadcast.\n\n68\n00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,190\nI got his broadcast, great!\n\n69\n00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,920\nI didn't get his Unicast.\n\n70\n00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,530\nI only see stuff that came from him,\nI don't see what came to him at all.\n\n71\n00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,770\nBecause I'm not in that communication.\n\n72\n00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,280\nOn a switch based network, you will\nnot get other people's Unicasts and\n\n73\n00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,900\nthat really hinders the functionality of\nprotocol analyzers like Wireshark, right?\n\n74\n00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,090\nSo we need to get around that.\n\n75\n00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,340\nHow do we get around that?\n\n76\n00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,210\nWell you could take a hub and\nput a hub in between you and\n\n77\n00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,440\nthe person you're trying to capture.\n\n78\n00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,840\nThat'll work right?\n\n79\n00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,960\nBut who's got a hub around anymore, right?\n\n80\n00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,850\nAnd if you're on a gigabyte network, and\nI don't think they even make gig hubs.\n\n81\n00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,820\nSo you're already gonna have to take\nyourself down to a hundred megs or\n\n82\n00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,950\nten megs or\nsomething ridiculous like that.\n\n83\n00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,780\nIt's just not a viable option.\n\n84\n00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,270\nSo if you really wanna leverage your\npacket analyzers, you'll need to make\n\n85\n00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,100\nuse of other technologies on your switch\nto get around that limitation, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,570\nMost switches support what's\ncalled port mirroring.\n\n87\n00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,060\nPort mirroring is where you can\ntake the traffic on one port.\n\n88\n00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,860\nAnd send a copy of it to another port.\n\n89\n00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,720\nThat way you can intercept\ncommunications that\n\n90\n00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,350\nwouldn't normally be sent to your machine,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,950\nIt does require physical\naccess to the machine, or at\n\n92\n00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,130\nleast administrative access to the switch\nto be able to go in and configure it.\n\n93\n00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,270\nAnd not every switch does it.\n\n94\n00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,310\nBut, in an enterprise environment,\nalmost all of your switches will.\n\n95\n00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,460\nIt's a very, very common feature.\n\n96\n00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,310\nThey might call it different things.\n\n97\n00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,400\nHP calls it port mirroring, Cisco calls\nit SPAN, the Switch Port Analyzer.\n\n98\n00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,480\nSo you'll see different names for\nthe technology.\n\n99\n00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,630\nBut it's all the same.\n\n100\n00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,010\nIt takes traffic from one port and\ncopies it to another port.\n\n101\n00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,420\nSo if I wanted to get just Jason's\ntraffic, I can go on the switch,\n\n102\n00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,510\nfigure out what port he was plugged\ninto and mirror his traffic.\n\n103\n00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,840\nBut what if I wanted to\nget the whole office?\n\n104\n00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,360\nWhat if I want to get as\nmuch communication as i can?\n\n105\n00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,110\nWell that's a lot harder.\n\n106\n00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,840\nIt's really difficult to\ncapture all the traffic.\n\n107\n00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,100\nYou've gotta try and locate some kind\nof a bottleneck on your network and\n\n108\n00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,030\nthat'll give you the best picture, right?\n\n109\n00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,330\nMaybe there's an uplink\nbetween two switches.\n\n110\n00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,930\nThat'll help you get everything\nthat crosses over the uplink, but\n\n111\n00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,900\nany communications that stay\nwithin a switch you won't see.\n\n112\n00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,810\nSo there's not really any\nway that you can capture\n\n113\n00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,390\nall the traffic of your whole network.\n\n114\n00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,410\nWhat I commonly do,\nis pick the Internet connection.\n\n115\n00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,050\nI know that these guys\nare going out to the Internet.\n\n116\n00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,780\nAnd if I want to see what\nInternet access is happening,\n\n117\n00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,070\nI can find where my router is plugged in.\n\n118\n00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,560\nAnd I can capture the router's traffic,\nand then I'll be able to see all that.\n\n119\n00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,500\nLet me show you how that works.\n\n120\n00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,792\nOn my system, my IP address,\nlet me go find my IP address real quick.\n\n121\n00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:11,584\nI am 10.1.230.243.\n\n122\n00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,293\nThat's me.\n\n123\n00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:17,410\nRight and my router is 10.1.230.1.\n\n124\n00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,000\nSo I can go and find those ports on\nthe switch and redirect that traffic.\n\n125\n00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,040\nNot redirect it but copy that traffic,\nso I get a duplicate of it, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,110\nI'm gonna do that on our switch.\n\n127\n00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,230\nOur switch is a Cisco switch.\n\n128\n00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,040\nSo yours may vary right?\n\n129\n00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,929\nDifferent people are gonna\ndo this different ways.\n\n130\n00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,780\nLet me get into this one.\n\n131\n00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,830\nAnd I'm gonna go and set that mirror up.\n\n132\n00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,390\nNow, the first thing I need to do is\nfigure out what port I'm plugged into.\n\n133\n00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:45,280\nSo on the switch I'm just gonna have to\ndo a little bit of experimenting around.\n\n134\n00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,320\nIf I know my MAC address,\nthat's the easiest way to do this.\n\n135\n00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,800\nSo I'm gonna do an ipconfig/all and\nfigure out the MAC address of my nick.\n\n136\n00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,960\nSo let's see.\n\n137\n00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,460\nThere's my studio connection,\n10.1.230.243.\n\n138\n00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,420\nMy MAC address is 685b blah, blah, blah.\n\n139\n00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,950\nMACs are fairly unique, so I'm just\ngonna grab the last four digits, 0162.\n\n140\n00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,410\nI doubt anybody else in\nthe building is gonna end in 0162.\n\n141\n00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,855\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say,\nshow MAC address table and\n\n142\n00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:17,626\nI'm gonna filter that to include 0162.\n\n143\n00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,020\nLet's see.\n\n144\n00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,160\n>> Oh, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n145\n00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,850\nRonnie's all set.\n\n146\n00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,040\nIt's MAC address -table, there we go.\n\n147\n00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,580\nAll right, so\nthere's my MAC address right there.\n\n148\n00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,170\nI'm on port fa5/35.\n\n149\n00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,680\nNow I want to find my router.\n\n150\n00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,290\nNow for the router, I can just ping it.\n\n151\n00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,300\nI probably don't have to do this,\nbut I'm going to ping it.\n\n152\n00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,040\nBecause that will add it to my ARP table.\n\n153\n00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,950\nNow I can do an ARP-A, and\nI'll find the MAC address of the router.\n\n154\n00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,680\nSo there's the MAC address of my router.\n\n155\n00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,400\nIt ends in D444.\n\n156\n00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,900\nSo I'll go and\ndo this same thing over here.\n\n157\n00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,130\nI'm going to look for D444.\n\n158\n00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,850\nAll right?\n\n159\n00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,200\nSo, I'm plugged into fa5/35.\n\n160\n00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,530\nThe router's plugged into\nGI2/13 it's in a gig port.\n\n161\n00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,050\nAll right, that's gonna be a problem.\n\n162\n00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,020\nIf I mirror a gig port\nof traffic to my fa,\n\n163\n00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,420\nmy fast ethernet port, that's a Gig of\ntraffic going to a hundred Mag port right?\n\n164\n00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420\nI can oversubscribe my port.\n\n165\n00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,720\nThat's going to be a problem.\n\n166\n00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,480\nWhen I put this mirror in place it's\ngoing to throttle the connection.\n\n167\n00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,000\nI'm not too terribly worried\nabout that because out\n\n168\n00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,560\nInternet connection is only 80 megabit,\nright?\n\n169\n00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,000\nSo even though that router is\nplugged into a gigabit port,\n\n170\n00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,335\nit's really only able to\nmove 80 megabit of traffic,\n\n171\n00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:33,830\ncause that's what our fiber\nconnection is here in the building.\n\n172\n00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,920\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and do this, but\n\n173\n00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,770\nin real life land, you wanna make sure\nthat when you're plugged into a port doing\n\n174\n00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,100\nmirroring that you have the same bandwidth\nas the port that you're copying,\n\n175\n00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,830\notherwise, you'll saturate your port and\nyou'll drop packets.\n\n176\n00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,310\nAll right?\n\n177\n00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,450\nOkay, so I'm gonna get this set up.\n\n178\n00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,970\nI'm gonna come in here and\nsay, monitor session, and\n\n179\n00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,855\nI need to give it a number,\nI'll call this session 1.\n\n180\n00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,100\nAnd on a Cisco switch we just give\nit a source and a destination.\n\n181\n00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,700\nThe source of this traffic is gonna be\nan interface and it is Gi2/13, right?\n\n182\n00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,370\nSo that's where my traffic\nis coming from and\n\n183\n00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,730\nthen I'll say monitor session 1\ndestination interface fa5/35.\n\n184\n00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,130\nThat's my laptop, right?\n\n185\n00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,980\nAnd then if you do a question mark,\n\n186\n00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,350\nyou'll see whether you can specify whether\nyou want it to be ingress forwarding\n\n187\n00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,740\nwhere you still allow the other\nside to communicate or not.\n\n188\n00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,130\nI'm not gonna mess with that.\n\n189\n00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,770\nYou know I did leave out one option.\n\n190\n00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,490\nOh shoot, all right.\n\n191\n00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,630\nSo, I just went ahead and\n\n192\n00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,350\nran that and what you'll notice\nis my connection is locked.\n\n193\n00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,090\nOkay.\n\n194\n00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,020\nI'm not able to communicate\nwith that system anymore.\n\n195\n00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,050\nIn fact my screen sharing has locked.\n\n196\n00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,750\nSo, I've over compensated my interface.\n\n197\n00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,740\nI'm trying to send a gig of traffic\ndown to this hundred meg port, right?\n\n198\n00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,950\nAnd so it's killed my connection and\nI'm now off the network, all right.\n\n199\n00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,340\nSo we definitely want to be aware of that.\n\n200\n00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,530\nI need to go and move my laptop over\nto a gig port before I capture that.\n\n201\n00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,880\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n202\n00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,960\nWe'll stop here, and\nthen I'll go and correct that.\n\n203\n00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,270\nAnd then we'll follow back up and\n\n204\n00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,690\nwe'll get a chance to see that\ncapture run again, all right?\n\n205\n00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,385\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n206\n00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:17,455\n[SOUND] All right, so I just patched\nmyself down to a new port so\n\n207\n00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:25,208\nI can see my MAC address right here is\nnow in this nice gigabit port right here.\n\n208\n00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,992\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and set this up and\n\n209\n00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:30,561\nI'm kind of glad I had the interruption\ncause it'll give me a chance to add a few\n\n210\n00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:33,290\nmore features to this\nspan that I'm setting up.\n\n211\n00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,080\nSo I'm going to go and\ntell it to take the traffic\n\n212\n00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,270\non the port that my router is\nplugged into, there's my router.\n\n213\n00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,200\nAnd I'm going to tell it to\nmirror that traffic to my port.\n\n214\n00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,730\nAnd when I did it before\nthe little interruption there,\n\n215\n00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,700\nI forgot to add a special flag.\n\n216\n00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,550\nBy default, Cisco,\nwhen you set up a monitor like this,\n\n217\n00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,930\nit only sends traffic one way.\n\n218\n00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,470\nTraffic that's going to that port,\nnot traffic coming from that port.\n\n219\n00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,610\nAnd I want both sets of traffic.\n\n220\n00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,210\nSo, I'm gonna extend my\ncommand a little bit.\n\n221\n00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:06,619\nI'm gonna say monitor session 1\nsource interface gi2/13 both.\n\n222\n00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:11,240\nAll right, that both keyword right there\nis gonna say I want traffic going in and\n\n223\n00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,990\nout of that port.\n\n224\n00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,226\nAnd then I'll say monitor\nsession 1 destination interface\n\n225\n00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:21,229\nGI2/41 that is me, my interface.\n\n226\n00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:25,940\nAnd I'm gonna add the ingress keyword to\nthe end of it' which will is gonna let me\n\n227\n00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,670\nstill keep talking on that board also.\n\n228\n00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,380\nSo, I'll run that and\napparently I left something out.\n\n229\n00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,150\nOh, I have to fill out VLAN\nonline I'm on VLAN 230, there.\n\n230\n00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,680\nAll right.\n\n231\n00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,050\nNow any traffic being sent to or\n\n232\n00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,680\ncoming from that router is\nbeing copied over to my port.\n\n233\n00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,280\nI'm getting a copy of all that data.\n\n234\n00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,270\nThat's data that's not to or from me.\n\n235\n00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,040\nIt's data to or from the router,\nwhich any of the guys here,\n\n236\n00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,340\nif they're browsing out to the internet,\n\n237\n00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,890\nif they're accessing inappropriate\nmaterial, we'll see it here in a second.\n\n238\n00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,480\nIt'll be kinda fun.\n\n239\n00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,850\nI shouldn't have said that.\n\n240\n00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,490\nShoot.\nNow they're all closing windows and\n\n241\n00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,610\nminimizing.\n\n242\n00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,340\nMinimizing Windows doesn't hide\nyou from a packet capture.\n\n243\n00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,230\nAnyhow, so let's go and\nsee what this looks like.\n\n244\n00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,430\nIf I jump back over into Wireshark.\n\n245\n00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,490\nDid I leave this in capturing?\n\n246\n00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,650\nI'll just start a new capture here.\n\n247\n00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,830\nSo I'm going to go to my\nethernet adaptor and fire it up.\n\n248\n00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,240\nHere it goes capturing.\n\n249\n00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,070\nNow I should start seeing a lot more,\n\n250\n00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,160\nnot just information about me,\ntraffic I'm sending.\n\n251\n00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,170\nBut I should see traffic between\nhosts that I'm not even involved in.\n\n252\n00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,706\nAnd I'm gonna stop that because\nI can see it already, right.\n\n253\n00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,180\n10.1.230.6, that's me, right?\n\n254\n00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,740\nSo I can see me talking to this\nother host over here, 23.81.66.85.\n\n255\n00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,677\nWhich, actually you know what,\nI'm not 10.1.230.6 am I?\n\n256\n00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,530\n10.1.230.6, that's our video switch,\nright?\n\n257\n00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,830\nAnd that IP right there,\nthat's actually our live stream.\n\n258\n00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,170\nWe're streaming live right now for\nthis episode.\n\n259\n00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,400\nThe protocols RTMP, real time media\nprotocol, that's the live feed.\n\n260\n00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,590\nIf you're watching us live,\nthat's it right there.\n\n261\n00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,710\nI'm intercepting the packet's for\nthe live feed.\n\n262\n00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,110\nI'm not 10.230.6.\n\n263\n00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:11,287\nAnd I'm not 23.81.66.85, I'm intercepting\nthis traffic, traffic not destined for me.\n\n264\n00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:15,190\nNow, I wanted to see traffic\nthat Jason was doing.\n\n265\n00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,330\nRight, and you know Jason is sitting\nover there, he's got his machine.\n\n266\n00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,760\nSo let's try that out.\n\n267\n00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,270\nI'm gonna start a new capture.\n\n268\n00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,110\nI'm not gonna save that one.\n\n269\n00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,700\nAnd Jason,\ncan I get you to refresh the ITProTV page?\n\n270\n00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,440\nGood?\n\n271\n00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,600\nAll right, so he just did that so\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n272\n00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,122\nstop this session, all right?\n\n273\n00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:35,320\nAnd it's thinking for a second apparently.\n\n274\n00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,710\nAll right, so somewhere in here\nI imagine I have this traffic.\n\n275\n00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,360\nI'll filter this down a bit to\nlook just for his IP address.\n\n276\n00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,310\nAnd he is dot five.\n\n277\n00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,500\nAnd before when I did this,\nI only saw 15 packets, and that was it.\n\n278\n00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,390\nNow when I search for his IP address,\nI can see 1,990 packets,\n\n279\n00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,430\nand this was a much smaller\ncapture than the one before.\n\n280\n00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,010\nI'm seeing traffic between his machine and\nother IPs.\n\n281\n00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,510\nI'm not in that flow.\n\n282\n00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,460\nI'm now intercepting traffic that\nI wouldn't normally get, right?\n\n283\n00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,650\nBut I had to configure that on my switch.\n\n284\n00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,220\nThat is a big mistake\na lot of people make.\n\n285\n00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,999\nThey fire up Wireshark and\nassume they're gonna get all this data.\n\n286\n00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,430\nAnd then all they see are broadcast.\n\n287\n00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,810\nAnd they go man,\nour network is broadcast heavy.\n\n288\n00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,840\nWe need to do something about that.\n\n289\n00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,540\nNot realizing that,\nno you're not broadcast heavy.\n\n290\n00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,970\nIt's just that's all you're seeing.\n\n291\n00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,800\nThe Unicasts aren't even\ncoming to your port.\n\n292\n00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,340\nBut now I can see these and\nI can go through and\n\n293\n00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,820\nstart to look at that traffic and\nfigure out what it is.\n\n294\n00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,900\nI can see that Jason's machine is\na TCP connection to 23.81.44.149.\n\n295\n00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,630\nWell I don't know what that is.\n\n296\n00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,540\nIf I had turned the capture option\non to do the DNS look up for that,\n\n297\n00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,180\nit would resolve it and find out.\n\n298\n00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,200\nBut that might be ITProTV.\n\n299\n00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,490\nWhat is our IP address?\n\n300\n00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,710\nLet's do an NSlookup here for ITProTV.\n\n301\n00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:59,910\nOh ours is 72.10.35.33 so\nthat is not you talking to them.\n\n302\n00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,920\nSo I can write a more advanced filter\nto catch that specific track but\n\n303\n00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,960\nI probably just scan across and find it.\n\n304\n00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,385\nThere it is.\n\n305\n00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:09,070\n72.10.35.44.\n\n306\n00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,140\nThere's TCP traffic being sent\nbetween him and that host.\n\n307\n00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,240\nThat's him going to the ITProTV site.\n\n308\n00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,020\nNotice right here, HTTP traffic.\n\n309\n00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,680\nAnd down in the breakdown of the protocol,\n\n310\n00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,230\nI can look and\nstart to get an idea of what we're seeing.\n\n311\n00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:30,150\nHere I can see he's doing a get request\nand he's asking for slash forums.\n\n312\n00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,210\nLooks like he clicked on\nthe Q & A link right?\n\n313\n00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,220\nSo, is that what you did?\n\n314\n00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,440\nOh, that's what he did,\nhe's giving me confirmation over there.\n\n315\n00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,960\nSo, he did a GET for slash forums, that's\nour Q and A page, and we intercepted.\n\n316\n00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,680\nI can see that GET request and\nall the header information for that GET.\n\n317\n00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680\nSo that was the GET request.\n\n318\n00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,340\nIf I keep going down,\nI should start to see the replies,\n\n319\n00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,860\nthe server feeding him that webpage.\n\n320\n00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,370\nSo if I look down a little bit further,\n\n321\n00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,160\nI should start to see some of\nthose replies like this one.\n\n322\n00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,040\nThis is just an acknowledgement,\nyeah so it doesn't have any payload.\n\n323\n00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,715\nI know it's an acknowledgement\nbecause it tells me.\n\n324\n00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:01,480\n[LAUGH].\n\n325\n00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,270\nBut, if I keep looking down further,\nI'll find where there aren't\n\n326\n00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,830\nany acknowledgements,\nones that are actually caring payload.\n\n327\n00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,100\nAnd it'll have the web page and\nall that data.\n\n328\n00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,700\nNow, I have to kind of sift around and\nlook for it,\n\n329\n00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,360\nbecause I'm seeing a ton of traffic.\n\n330\n00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,690\nI'm seeing everybody here in the office\nas they go out to the internet.\n\n331\n00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,350\nI'm seeing their traffic.\n\n332\n00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,940\nIt's all in here.\n\n333\n00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,090\nAnd that may be a little bit\noverwhelming sometimes, right?\n\n334\n00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,100\nIf we look, it looks like there\nwas some kind of a URL rewrite,\n\n335\n00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,870\nand somewhere in here\nwe'll find the packet.\n\n336\n00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,895\nI'm doing it the hard way here,\nvisually looking for it.\n\n337\n00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:36,820\nWireshark can actually\nreassemble these communications.\n\n338\n00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,230\nIf you find what you're looking for,\n\n339\n00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,890\nyou can tell it to assemble\nthe path to that communication.\n\n340\n00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,060\nIt will show you all the packets that\nwere involved in that particular string,\n\n341\n00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,000\nand it makes life a lot easier.\n\n342\n00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,480\nBut I want to save that for\nanother episode,\n\n343\n00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,270\nbecause that's part of the tool set\nthat we use as we start to troubleshoot\n\n344\n00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,300\nproblems.\n\n345\n00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,870\nBut this gives you guys a great example\nhere of how we capture that data.\n\n346\n00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,976\nThere's more to it,\nthan just installing WinPCap, and\n\n347\n00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,420\ntelling WireShark to capture data.\n\n348\n00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,330\nWe've gotta make sure that our\nswitch understands we need to see\n\n349\n00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,540\nthe information, otherwise we're\nnot gonna get very far, all right?\n\n350\n00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,712\nSo that's a key component\nof capturing data.\n\n351\n00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:13,490\nAll right, well stay tuned cause we've got\nmore videos coming up as we show how to\n\n352\n00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,820\nuse some of the more advanced things.\n\n353\n00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,790\nI do wanna show you guys how to\nstream together those communications\n\n354\n00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,560\nand filtering.\n\n355\n00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,110\nWe need to do a whole episode on filtering\nso you understand exactly how you can see\n\n356\n00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,280\njust the information you want, and\nnot get overwhelmed by the data.\n\n357\n00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,833\nAll right.\nSo stay tuned.\n\n358\n00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,542\nI'll see you in the next video.\n\n359\n00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:35,714\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,086\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:09,115\nSo by this point,\n\n3\n00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:13,980\nwe've already seen how amazing\nWireshark is at gathering this data in.\n\n4\n00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,430\nBut you've probably already\nnoticed how easy it is to get\n\n5\n00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,490\noverwhelmed with the data.\n\n6\n00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,530\nWhen you start capturing\ntraffic on a network,\n\n7\n00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,500\nespecially a busy network, you're gonna\nhave hundreds of thousands if not\n\n8\n00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,870\nmillions of packets in a very\nshort amount of time, right?\n\n9\n00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,290\nLet's just take mine as an example.\n\n10\n00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,660\nI'm on a very small network.\n\n11\n00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,020\nI'm on our studio network.\n\n12\n00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,270\nAnd there are maybe, I'm kind of\nlooking around the studio here,\n\n13\n00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,000\nthere's maybe twelve machines here\non this particular studio network.\n\n14\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,670\nNow Throughout the building\nwe've got well over 100, but\n\n15\n00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,230\non the network that I'm on\nthere's only about twelve.\n\n16\n00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,180\nAnd I'm monitoring this particular routers\ntraffic like we saw on an earlier episode.\n\n17\n00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,610\nAnd so\nI'm not seeing a ton of machines, but\n\n18\n00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,850\nwe'll see that this small network\ngenerates a good amount of traffic.\n\n19\n00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,630\nIf I go and look at my interfaces here.\n\n20\n00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,890\nI'm gonna monitor this one.\n\n21\n00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,040\nAnd I'll start up a packet capture here.\n\n22\n00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,700\nSo here it's going, and I've just\nbeen running for a few moments, and\n\n23\n00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,420\ndown here in my status bar I can see\nI've already gathered 5,000 packets.\n\n24\n00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,760\nSo in that short amount of time\nI've already got 5,000 packets.\n\n25\n00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,990\nAnd it's starting to grow and\ngrow as it continues to monitor and\n\n26\n00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,090\ncollect data from these systems,\nit is impressive, right?\n\n27\n00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,980\nIt's a huge amount of data\nthat it's collecting.\n\n28\n00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,550\nAnd let me just turn on auto scroll here\nso we can see it kinda rattling on by.\n\n29\n00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,030\nIn the moment I've stalled there\nI'm already at 15 thousand packets.\n\n30\n00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,860\nSo this is a huge amount of data.\n\n31\n00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,100\nWell if we're firing up Wireshark\nthere's normally something in particular\n\n32\n00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,250\nthat we're looking for.\n\n33\n00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,860\nI wanna know some particular\npiece of information.\n\n34\n00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,336\nWell, how do we find it in all this mess?\n\n35\n00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,503\nI can run a capture like this for\na few moments.\n\n36\n00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:52,499\nI'm kinda waiting until\nI get to 30,000 and\n\n37\n00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:57,360\nthen I'll stop it, and as soon as I\nhit 30,000 I'll stop so, there we go.\n\n38\n00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360\nSo now I've got 30,159\npackets that I captured.\n\n39\n00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,920\nI want to find out what Jason,\nour director, has been doing.\n\n40\n00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,570\nI can see him over here by\nthe control station, and\n\n41\n00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,520\nI know he's been doing some\nstuff over on his machine.\n\n42\n00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,850\nI want to know what he's been doing.\n\n43\n00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,631\nWell, I know his IP address.\n\n44\n00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:17,470\nHis IP address is 10.1.2.30.6.\n\n45\n00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,678\nNo, .5.\n10.1.2.30.5.\n\n46\n00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:21,571\nRight.\nThat's his IP address.\n\n47\n00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,380\nHow do I find that?\n\n48\n00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,840\nWell I can scroll around in here.\n\n49\n00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,080\nThere's only 30,000 packets, right?\n\n50\n00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,770\nSo I can start at the top and just go\ndown and look for 10.1.2.30.5 right?\n\n51\n00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,920\nOr I can even do a search and\nget a little magnifying glass up here.\n\n52\n00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,480\nI can say find a packet and\nI'm looking for 10.12.30.5.\n\n53\n00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,340\nBut when I start to type that in,\nnotice how it's red, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,590\nRed means whatever I'm putting\nin there is not valid, right?\n\n55\n00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,030\nBy default, Wireshark is using\na special filter language.\n\n56\n00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,120\nIt's got its own little filter language\nit uses to allow us to find things.\n\n57\n00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,680\nIf I just want to search for that string,\n\n58\n00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,470\nI would need to choose\nthe string value here.\n\n59\n00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,970\nAnd then it lights up green.\n\n60\n00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,330\nNow, I can go in and I can search for\nthis value and I can find it.\n\n61\n00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,260\nThe problem with going this way is\nit's kind of packet by packet of\n\n62\n00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,720\nfinding one after another after another.\n\n63\n00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,940\nAnd, I'll find weird things too,\n\n64\n00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,280\nlike here's one of our Apple devices\nthat's doing a broadcast, right.\n\n65\n00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,210\nSo, it's doing an ARP broadcast.\n\n66\n00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,210\nThat's not involving 10.1.230.5, is it?\n\n67\n00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,648\nBut if you look at the payload over here,\nwho has this IP?\n\n68\n00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:28,932\nTell 10.1.235 this is an ARP\nbroadcast that is coming out from\n\n69\n00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:33,180\nthe machine that is actually 10.1.235 so\nit found it.\n\n70\n00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,990\nSo I could do string searches like that.\n\n71\n00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,330\nBut what's better is to do a filter.\n\n72\n00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,460\nNow when we filter in Wireshark\nthere's two types of filters.\n\n73\n00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,230\nThere's a display filter and\nthere's a capture filter.\n\n74\n00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,308\nA display filter just filters\nwhat we see on screen.\n\n75\n00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:52,490\nI've captured 30,000 packets.\n\n76\n00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,975\nIf I'm looking for a particular set,\nI can put a display filter in and\n\n77\n00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:59,800\nit'll hide the other packets\nthat don't match my filter.\n\n78\n00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360\nIt doesn't delete them,\nit just hides them.\n\n79\n00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,040\nRight?\n\n80\n00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,800\nThe alternative is a capture filter.\n\n81\n00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,550\nA capture filter will say only capture\nthe packets that match my criteria.\n\n82\n00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,420\nAnd ignore the other ones.\n\n83\n00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,400\nSo it's not hiding them, it just doesn't\neven log them in the first place.\n\n84\n00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,540\nSo, if we're trying to keep our capture\nfile small, we can use a capture\n\n85\n00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,600\nfilter to just block out certain things,\nso they don't get logged at all.\n\n86\n00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,010\nVersus a display filter where\nwe still logged all the packets,\n\n87\n00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,328\nwe're just changing which ones we see.\n\n88\n00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:33,870\nSo of 30,000 packets,\n\n89\n00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,850\nif I just wanted to see Jason's machine,\nI could write a filter.\n\n90\n00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,625\nNow the filter format is\ndifferent unfortunately for\n\n91\n00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,995\na display in a capture filter.\n\n92\n00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:46,155\nSo there's two different language types\nand I wanna show you guys some of the most\n\n93\n00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:49,775\ncommon examples of each so you can\nrecreate this in your own environment.\n\n94\n00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:52,545\nI'm gonna start with display filters\nbecause they're the ones I use the most\n\n95\n00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:56,305\nfrequently, but capture filters\nare the most useful if you're trying to\n\n96\n00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:59,970\nminimize the data set you're working with,\nif you're trying to shrink your log files.\n\n97\n00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,310\nBy excluding that you\nknow is not important.\n\n98\n00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,850\nSo if I take these 30,000 packets here and\nI just want to see Jason.\n\n99\n00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,800\nWell this is going to be one of\nthe easiest filters that we write.\n\n100\n00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,690\nI want to filter the traffic to\nonly show me traffic that involves\n\n101\n00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,710\na host with the IP address of 10.1.230.5.\n\n102\n00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,599\nWell, I can do ip.source, src.\n\n103\n00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:33,310\nSo ip.src = = 10.1.230.5.\n\n104\n00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,045\nAll right.\n\n105\n00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:40,003\nShow me every packet that has\na source IP address of 10.1.230.5.\n\n106\n00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:43,314\nAs you're typing these filters, you'll\nnotice it turn red and when it's red,\n\n107\n00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:46,990\nthat means you haven't given it enough\ninformation, or you've got bad syntax.\n\n108\n00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,530\nWhen you've got a good filter written,\nit'll turn green.\n\n109\n00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,779\nSo that's an easy way to tell whether\nyou're writing a good filter.\n\n110\n00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,120\nIf you have the filter syntax\nmemorized you can just type it.\n\n111\n00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,570\nIf you don't have it memorized you can\nactually hit the expression button.\n\n112\n00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,175\nAnd when you hit that it brings\nup a little wizard type screen,\n\n113\n00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:11,905\nwhere you can pick your filters and go\nthrough it this way to pick what you want.\n\n114\n00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,845\nI tend not to do this just\nbecause there's so much in here.\n\n115\n00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:19,535\nJust look at all the stuff\nthat you can pick from.\n\n116\n00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:25,297\nAnd if I went here under IPv4,\nI could find in here under IPv4,\n\n117\n00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:30,545\nIP.source And let's see.\n\n118\n00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:32,330\nip.src right here.\n\n119\n00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,130\nAnd then is present.\n\n120\n00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,130\nThat means it has any value.\n\n121\n00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,435\nEquals equals that means if the IP source\nis equal to what I'm about to put in.\n\n122\n00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:44,050\n!=, that means not equal.\n\n123\n00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,050\nI want to find any traffic where the IP\naddress does not equal a host, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,170\nOr if the IP address is greater or\nless than, greater than or equal than,\n\n125\n00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,280\nless than or equal than an IP address\nthat I provide here, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,886\nSo you have a lot of control,\nand you can specify IP source = =\n\n127\n00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:04,240\n10.1.230.5 and hit okay and\nit'll type it in.\n\n128\n00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,740\nAnd see how it typed in the same\nthing that I had already typed in.\n\n129\n00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,100\nSo if you got it memorized it's way faster\nthen trying to find it in that giant\n\n130\n00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,280\nexpression menu.\n\n131\n00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,620\nBut the expression menu doesn't give you\nan idea of all the different things that\n\n132\n00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,490\nwe can filter on, it's incredibly\npowerful and it's all right here.\n\n133\n00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,320\nAll right, once we've got it in there,\nyou can hit Apply and\n\n134\n00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,420\nnow it's going to filter\nwhat's on your screen.\n\n135\n00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:34,544\nAnd now I'm only seeing packets whose\nsource IP is 10.1.230.5, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:39,500\nAnd down here at the bottom of the screen\nI can see I've got 30,159 packets.\n\n137\n00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,690\nBut I'm only displaying 2775 which\naccounts for 8.5% of my total packets.\n\n138\n00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,660\nSo now I'm just seeing\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n139\n00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,010\nMaybe I want to see traffic\nthat's going to Jason's machine.\n\n140\n00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,792\nSo I can go in here and\nchange that source to destination, DST.\n\n141\n00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:01,260\nAll right, then I can go ahead and\nhit apply.\n\n142\n00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,635\nAnd now it's going to\nreverse that filter and\n\n143\n00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:06,710\nnow I'm only seeing traffic\nwith a destination of his IP.\n\n144\n00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,770\nAll right?\n\n145\n00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,710\nWhat if I want to see both,\ntraffic to him and from him?\n\n146\n00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,990\nI want to see all the communications\nfrom his machine.\n\n147\n00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,400\nAll right?\n\n148\n00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,830\nWell, in that scenario,\nwe can change this just a little bit.\n\n149\n00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,029\nInstead of saying source or\ndestination, you can say IP Address.\n\n150\n00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:26,698\nIP.ADDR.\n\n151\n00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:29,020\nAll right, now I'm saying,\n\n152\n00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,600\nshow me packets that involve this\naddress as a source or a destination.\n\n153\n00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,970\nSo when we run that,\nnow I'll see full conversations with him.\n\n154\n00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,630\nPackets going to him, and\npackets coming from him.\n\n155\n00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,340\nAnd you'll see these mapped together\nlike he's talking to 23.81.44.149.\n\n156\n00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,970\nAnd getting replies right, so all those\ncommunications are right here; and\n\n157\n00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,800\nI can get an idea what's going on.\n\n158\n00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,158\nI see he's got some RTMP traffic going on,\nso he's watching a video stream...\n\n159\n00:08:57,158 --> 00:09:00,135\nProbably us,\nright; Our live video stream I imagine.\n\n160\n00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,430\n[LAUGH] He's giving me\nthe thumbs up over there.\n\n161\n00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,810\nOr he could be [LAUGH] All right,\n\n162\n00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,205\nI won't do the hand gesture\nthat he just gave me but.\n\n163\n00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:10,400\n[LAUGH] Could be all sorts of things.\n\n164\n00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,938\nSo we can start to see that traffic and\nbreak it down and get an idea.\n\n165\n00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:17,280\nNow, that IP.addr.\n\n166\n00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,350\nWhat that is, is that's actually an alias.\n\n167\n00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,870\nIt's an alias for doing two queries.\n\n168\n00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,440\nIt's doing a query for\nIP source of 10.1.230.5.\n\n169\n00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,150\nAnd IP destination 10.1.230.5, all right?\n\n170\n00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,190\nThis is the short-hand\nmethod of writing it.\n\n171\n00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,030\nWe could write it long-hand\nif we wanted to, all right?.\n\n172\n00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,910\nIf I wanted to write it out longer, we\ncould write this a slightly different way.\n\n173\n00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:48,966\nWe could say ip.source = 10.1.230.5 or\n\n174\n00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:55,232\nip.destination = 10.1.230.5.\n\n175\n00:09:55,232 --> 00:10:02,020\nShow me any packet whose source\nis 10.1.230.5 or destination.\n\n176\n00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,225\nWhen I apply that,\nit's the same exact same as if I had done\n\n177\n00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:13,110\nIP.ADDR but I wanted to show you this so\nyou can see that or operator.\n\n178\n00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,770\nWhen I say or, now I'm giving it\nmultiple criteria that can be matched\n\n179\n00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,280\nto help me isolate exactly what\nit is that I'm looking for.\n\n180\n00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,110\nBe careful with this because you\nmight be tempted to say and.\n\n181\n00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,757\nShow me packets that have\na source of 10.1.230.5 and\n\n182\n00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:30,660\na destination of 10.1.230.5.\n\n183\n00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,000\nWell the only time I would see that is if\nJason is talking to himself, all right?\n\n184\n00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,290\nThen the source and\nthe destination would both be 10.1.230.5.\n\n185\n00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,910\nSo we're more commonly going to use or\nif the source is this,\n\n186\n00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,400\nor the destination is that.\n\n187\n00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,110\nAll right, so\nthose are some examples of some filters.\n\n188\n00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,310\nDon't forget that we can do the not equal.\n\n189\n00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:00,150\nI can say if the IP source\nis not equal to 10.1.230.5.\n\n190\n00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,230\nOr the destination is not equal\nto 10.1.230.5 show me that.\n\n191\n00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,550\nThis is how we start to exclude people.\n\n192\n00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,010\nMaybe I don't wanna see\ntraffic from Jason.\n\n193\n00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,460\nI wanna see all of the other traffic,\nand so\n\n194\n00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,800\nif I apply that it's gonna filter it out.\n\n195\n00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,780\nAnd now I can see I have 30,159 packets.\n\n196\n00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,542\nAnd it's only displaying 20,790, and\napparently I've written it wrong.\n\n197\n00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:25,150\nOh shoot!\n\n198\n00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,656\nI forgot!\nI've gotta do some parentheses on\n\n199\n00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:28,480\nthis one.\n\n200\n00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,670\nSee how I've got some packets that\nactually include some Jason 10.1.230.5.\n\n201\n00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,380\nAll right, and\n\n202\n00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,460\nthat's because this packet it's actually\nmatching off of this first one.\n\n203\n00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,870\nIts source is not 10.1.230.5,\nand so it's displaying it.\n\n204\n00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,140\nSo this is a slight problem.\n\n205\n00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,510\nLet me show you how we\ncan work around that.\n\n206\n00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,870\nOkay, sometimes the filters require\na little bit of finesse to get it working.\n\n207\n00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,780\nRemember when I did it this way,\nwhen I did the == like this.\n\n208\n00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,520\nI did get just traffic involving Jason.\n\n209\n00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,130\n8349 packets, and that's it.\n\n210\n00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,300\nRight?\nIf I want\n\n211\n00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,500\nto exclude both of these criteria,\nwell, you don't want to do\n\n212\n00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,150\nthe 'not equal' right here inside of\nthe criteria with an 'or' statement.\n\n213\n00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,715\nIt causes the problem that\nI just had Instead what you\n\n214\n00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:20,878\nwanna do is put the whole\nthing in parentheses.\n\n215\n00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:21,410\nRight?\nSo\n\n216\n00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,460\nI'm gonna stick some parentheses at the\nbeginning and at the end of the filter.\n\n217\n00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,490\nAll right?\n\n218\n00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,830\nAnd once I've got those\nparentheses at the beginning and\n\n219\n00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,820\nend, I'm gonna add the exclamation point\nright there at the very beginning.\n\n220\n00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,460\nOkay?\n\n221\n00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,070\nSo I'm saying filter traffic.\n\n222\n00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,070\nI want traffic to not have\na source of 10.1.235 or\n\n223\n00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,650\na source of 10.1.230.5, so\nthat's gonna do it proper.\n\n224\n00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,720\nThe negation is actually being outside\nof the or statement, all right?\n\n225\n00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,683\nWhen we apply that, now I should see,\nsure enough, now I've got 30,000 packets.\n\n226\n00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:04,430\n21,810 are being displayed and I don't\nsee any here that match Jason's IP.\n\n227\n00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,240\nAll right.\n\n228\n00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,980\nI do see a lot of IPv6 stuff,\nbut nothing that matches Jason.\n\n229\n00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,880\nSo, writing a proper filter might take\nyou a few tries to get that syntax\n\n230\n00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,910\nquite right.\n\n231\n00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,060\nJust be careful.\n\n232\n00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,630\nWhen you're doing equal equals, those\nare pretty safe pretty much all the time.\n\n233\n00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,470\nBut when you're doing not equals,\nwhen you're doing negations or\n\n234\n00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,700\nexclusions, it can get a little tricky.\n\n235\n00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,260\nAnd you may have to use parentheses like\nthis to handle that exclusion properly.\n\n236\n00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,290\nAll right, now filtering by IP is one\nthing is one thing we might do but\n\n237\n00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,430\nfiltering but protocol is another one.\n\n238\n00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,590\nSo we can filter a few\ndifferent ways by protocol.\n\n239\n00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,960\nMaybe I just want to see web traffic.\n\n240\n00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,070\nSo I could say TCP.port, == 80.\n\n241\n00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,130\nShow me any traffic where\nthe TCP port is 80.\n\n242\n00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,190\nThat's going to be\nunencrypted wed traffic.\n\n243\n00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,540\nAnd if I apply that It's gonna run and\n\n244\n00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,140\nnow I'll see any time\nsomebody's browsing the web.\n\n245\n00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,060\nRight.\nFiltering by that protocol.\n\n246\n00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,430\nYou'll find a lot of protocols\nactually have an alias name put in.\n\n247\n00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,140\nAnd so sometimes you can punch in,\n== http.\n\n248\n00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,590\nRight?\nBut in this scenario it's not working.\n\n249\n00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,750\nSo if it stays red then it doesn't have\nit and you can type in a port number.\n\n250\n00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,700\nI've kind of gotten in the habit\nof typing in a port number because\n\n251\n00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,840\nI know those always work.\n\n252\n00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,750\nThe alias names don't always work.\n\n253\n00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,950\nIn fact,\nthere is something a little bit quirky.\n\n254\n00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,670\nLet's say that I wanted to see\nunencrypted and encrypted web traffic.\n\n255\n00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,620\nI wanted port 80 and port 443.\n\n256\n00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,710\nWell, watch this.\n\n257\n00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,090\nIf I say TCP.port == 80 or\n\n258\n00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,544\nTCP port == 443,\n\n259\n00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:42,850\nalright that works for me and\nif I apply that, there we go.\n\n260\n00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,650\nAnd now I'm seeing unencrypted web\ntraffic as well as encrypted web\n\n261\n00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,140\ntraffic as two separate statements.\n\n262\n00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,490\nBut there is actually a way\nthat we can combine these.\n\n263\n00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,150\nLet's see do I have an example of that?\n\n264\n00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,530\nI may not have an example of that one.\n\n265\n00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,330\nI'll show you an example a little bit\nlater when we get into the capture filters\n\n266\n00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,770\nwhere these can be a problem.\n\n267\n00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,680\nBut as long as we're separating them\nwith or statements it's not a big deal.\n\n268\n00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,170\nIn the capture situation there's a part\nwhere we won't use that or statement and\n\n269\n00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,590\nit causes a bit of a problem.\n\n270\n00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,310\nBut here we do that filter and\nit's catching it and\n\n271\n00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,250\nit's knocking it right out.\n\n272\n00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,150\nAlright, other types of\nfilters that we might do.\n\n273\n00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,650\nLet's see that was\nan example of a TCP port.\n\n274\n00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,520\nWhere are some other examples?\n\n275\n00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,040\nLet's see oh, alright so,\nif we say on this filter,\n\n276\n00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,560\nwe just go real simple like this and\nwe just type in filter http.\n\n277\n00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,940\nAll right.\n\n278\n00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,360\nWhen you run that, it will filter\nit out and just show that protocol.\n\n279\n00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,640\nSo, I didn't even have to type in\nTCP.protocol, whatever TCP.port = 80.\n\n280\n00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,711\nYou can just type in the protocol and\n\n281\n00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:51,418\nif it's got an alias name\nit will pull that up.\n\n282\n00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:56,332\nSo if I'm just looking for\nthat RTMP traffic I can apply it, and\n\n283\n00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,833\nit won't find it.\n\n284\n00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:02,157\n[LAUGH] So apparently that\none didn't work for me, but\n\n285\n00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:07,840\nI guess the rtnp traffic is UDP so\nit's probably not happy about that.\n\n286\n00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,440\nI was doing tcp port but you also have udp\nport other filters that are like that for\n\n287\n00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,630\nbeing able to go in there and locate\nwhatever it is that you're looking for.\n\n288\n00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,220\nNow I filtered based on protocol,\nand I filtered based on IP.\n\n289\n00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,890\nYou can also filter based on a network,\nlike an entire subnet if you want.\n\n290\n00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:30,160\nso you could say a range\nof IPs if you wanted.\n\n291\n00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,550\nWhen you do that IP source, you can\nspecify in subnet notation, 10.1.230.0/24,\n\n292\n00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:42,880\nand then you would just see traffic that's\noriginating from inside of your network.\n\n293\n00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,970\nThat's useful for a few reasons.\n\n294\n00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,580\nIf you're monitoring a trunc, and\na trunc is carrying multiple VLANs and\n\n295\n00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,610\nmultiple subnets, you might wanna limit\nyourself down to just one VLAN's traffic,\n\n296\n00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,650\nand this is just one way to go about that.\n\n297\n00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,370\nLet's see what else do I have?\n\n298\n00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,330\nI think that's about it.\n\n299\n00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,800\nLet's see different port numbers,\nwe talked about negation,\n\n300\n00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,550\nwe saw port filters.\n\n301\n00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,050\nYeah, so as far as display filters go,\nthose are the main ones,\n\n302\n00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,120\nthose are the ones that I\ntypically work with right there.\n\n303\n00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,690\nAnd those are ones that I just got\nmemorized, so their quick and easy to use.\n\n304\n00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,350\nBut, there's a ton more, you can\nfilter based on darn near everything.\n\n305\n00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,470\nBut all the filters I just\nshowed you were display filters.\n\n306\n00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:23,980\nAll right?\n\n307\n00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,960\nThey're just filtering what\nshows up here on screen.\n\n308\n00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,650\nIf I clear the filter out, I still have\n30,000 packets that are sitting there.\n\n309\n00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,110\nOkay?\n\n310\n00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,000\nIf I want to minimize\nthe size of my capture,\n\n311\n00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,450\nif I'm on a really busy network and I\njust can't possibly capture all the data.\n\n312\n00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,390\nThen we can do a Capture Filter to stop\n\n313\n00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,830\npackets from even making it into\nour capture in the first place.\n\n314\n00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,050\nWith those we set them up\nwhen we start a new capture.\n\n315\n00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,440\nSo, I'm gonna go up here\nto my capture options.\n\n316\n00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,310\nAnd in my capture options screen I'll\nsee where I can put in a capture filter.\n\n317\n00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,300\nJust like a display filter\nI can click on that and\n\n318\n00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,860\nI've got all the different things\nthat I can filter on, but notice.\n\n319\n00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,360\nIt's a much smaller list.\n\n320\n00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,070\nI don't have as much power\nwith Capture Filter.\n\n321\n00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,210\nSo you'll see I can use like TCP or\nUDP only, particular IP addresses.\n\n322\n00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,850\nThey give you a lot of examples here.\n\n323\n00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,120\nYou can filter based on a Mac address.\n\n324\n00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,240\nThere's all sorts of\nneat things you can do.\n\n325\n00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,970\nAnd they're basically giving\nyou the syntax right here\n\n326\n00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,480\nthat you would use to create that filter,\nall right?\n\n327\n00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,200\nBut I'll just type out a few\nhere to give you some examples.\n\n328\n00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,360\nLet's say that I wanted to\nget a particular host, right?\n\n329\n00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,560\nWell what I would type is host 10.1.230.5.\n\n330\n00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,240\nAnd now when I run this capture,\n\n331\n00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,080\nit is just going to get\ntraffic from that one host.\n\n332\n00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,420\nAnd if I start that up, right,\nhere it goes capturing.\n\n333\n00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,030\nAnd, sure, I'm getting a lot of data,\nbut look at it all.\n\n334\n00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,390\nIt's all either from or\nto Jason's computer.\n\n335\n00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,320\nThere's other traffic being\ngenerated on the network.\n\n336\n00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,170\nI'm ignoring it.\n\n337\n00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,920\nI'm throwing it out.\n\n338\n00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,170\nSo all that other traffic is\nnot even making it into my log.\n\n339\n00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,470\nThat helps to keep the log files\na lot more succinct, right.\n\n340\n00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,691\nThey're not full of all this extra data.\n\n341\n00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,066\nAll right.\n\n342\n00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:18,526\nSome of the other filters\nthat I could have used.\n\n343\n00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:19,361\nThat was a host.\n\n344\n00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:20,400\nI could have done a network.\n\n345\n00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,980\nYou could do net 10.1.230.0/24.\n\n346\n00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,285\nWhen I do that, that's saying,\nthrow out any other networks.\n\n347\n00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:30,885\nI don't wanna get anything else, just give\nme traffic dealing with this network right\n\n348\n00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:35,965\nhere and keep my log files small.\n\n349\n00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:40,755\nWhen we do this, when we do net or\nhost, it defaults to both directions.\n\n350\n00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:43,405\nSo it's giving traffic to and\nfrom that network.\n\n351\n00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:49,380\nBut you can do source and destination if\nyou want, so you could say dst.net, right?\n\n352\n00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380\nOr dst host.\n\n353\n00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,690\nOr you could say src.net or src host.\n\n354\n00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,490\nThat way you're just getting the source,\nthe data coming from that host.\n\n355\n00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,950\nOr destination, data going to that host.\n\n356\n00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,910\nSo you can be really specific if you want.\n\n357\n00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,580\nBut when you just do net or\nhost, it's bi-directional.\n\n358\n00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,840\nIt's getting traffic to and\nfrom that particular person.\n\n359\n00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,130\nWe can also do other things like,\nlike we can say Port 80 right?\n\n360\n00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,750\nJust give me traffic on TCP port 80,\n\n361\n00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,910\nthat's going to be\nunencrypted web traffic.\n\n362\n00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,670\nWe can say, we can be really specific.\n\n363\n00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,300\nPort 80 that'll get TCP and UDP.\n\n364\n00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,010\nBut if I say TCP port 80, then that's\ngonna give me just the TCP traffic, and\n\n365\n00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,860\nnot UDP.\n\n366\n00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,733\nSo really starting to shrink down\nthe traffic that we're gonna get.\n\n367\n00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:39,233\nIf I want to monitor something like SIP,\nI could say UDP port 5060.\n\n368\n00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:39,733\nRight.\n\n369\n00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:43,836\nThat's SIP for voice over IP\ncommunications, It doesn't use TCP or\n\n370\n00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:45,650\nat least not normally.\n\n371\n00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,580\nAnd it uses UDP for the communications.\n\n372\n00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,370\nSo now I'll be able to capture that.\n\n373\n00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,170\nAll right.\n\n374\n00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,780\nYou can combine multiple ports.\n\n375\n00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,020\nSo we could say, like,\nport 80 or 443, right?\n\n376\n00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,040\nSo now it's gonna get both.\n\n377\n00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,350\nI wanna get just web traffic in general,\n80 or 443,\n\n378\n00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,970\nand when I fire that up,\nnow it's gonna capture that.\n\n379\n00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,786\nAnd I'm getting it for all hosts,\nI didn't put a host filter on there, but\n\n380\n00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:11,858\nit's gonna reach out and get that data.\n\n381\n00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,139\nNow, when we do a display filter,\n\n382\n00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:20,690\nthe display filter we use the exclamation\npoint to negate things for exclusions.\n\n383\n00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,460\nIn a capture filter you use the word not.\n\n384\n00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,510\nSo you can say not host whatever.\n\n385\n00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,700\nSo maybe I want to exclude myself.\n\n386\n00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,316\nI don't want a log traffic coming from me.\n\n387\n00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:35,025\nSo I might say not host 10.1.230.243,\nall right?\n\n388\n00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,275\nI'm on the capture station.\n\n389\n00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,580\nSo I don't need to capture\nmy own traffic and in fact,\n\n390\n00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,470\nthat can kind of bog the system down.\n\n391\n00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,810\nI'm streaming my desktop out\nto you guys right now so\n\n392\n00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,040\nall that stream traffic\nis gonna show up there.\n\n393\n00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:52,976\nSo I could say not host 10.1.230.243 or\n\n394\n00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:55,950\nI could say not port.\n\n395\n00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,890\nOh shoot,\nI don't remember our TMP's port number.\n\n396\n00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,566\nBut I can add on to it and say.\n\n397\n00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:05,983\nOh, I guess it would be orb,\nnor port, or TMP.\n\n398\n00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:08,030\nIf I knew its port number\nI could put that in there.\n\n399\n00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,650\nBut you could specify that and\n\n400\n00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,970\nadd additional criteria to start stacking\nit together to exclude that traffic out.\n\n401\n00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,810\nSo it just doesn't even make\nit into the capture at all.\n\n402\n00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,400\nAll right.\n\n403\n00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,290\nAnd so, when I run that, now I'm going to\nbe capturing traffic on the network, but\n\n404\n00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:27,850\nnot traffic from my own machine,\nkeeping it clean.\n\n405\n00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,760\nAll right.\n\n406\n00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,460\nSome other examples we might do.\n\n407\n00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,260\nWell here, we'll take like my\nscreen capture example, right?\n\n408\n00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,070\nSo I said not host 10.1.230.243.\n\n409\n00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,010\nMy software on my laptop that's\nstreaming on my desktop,\n\n410\n00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,691\nit's actually using two ports.\n\n411\n00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:49,172\nSo I could add to this and say,\n\n412\n00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:55,751\nlet's do and not port 49001 or\n\n413\n00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:59,275\nport 49002.\n\n414\n00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:02,958\nOkay, so now it's gonna say,\nany traffic from that host,\n\n415\n00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,862\nwe're gonna drop off if it's\nfrom that host and it's, well,\n\n416\n00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:10,210\nactually I wouldn't\nwant to do a not there.\n\n417\n00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,910\nThere.\n\n418\n00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,650\nSo if it's from this host,\nand it's on these ports,\n\n419\n00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,500\none of these two ports,\nthen we'll exclude it.\n\n420\n00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,540\nYou see how this starts\nto get a little complex,\n\n421\n00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,590\nyou start to combine all these different\nelements and it gets confusing.\n\n422\n00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,310\nBut now I would still get traffic from\nmy host as long as it wasn't on one\n\n423\n00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,190\nof these two ports,\nthe ports that I'm using for streaming.\n\n424\n00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,290\nThat would lop that off and\nagain keep my capture small.\n\n425\n00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,756\nNow again, if you're only running\na capture for a few minutes,\n\n426\n00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:39,066\nyou probably don't care about Capture\nFilters, you'll just use display filters.\n\n427\n00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:41,830\nBut if you want to run a capture for\n24 hours and\n\n428\n00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,191\ncapture a very specific set of traffic.\n\n429\n00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:46,708\nCapture filters will help to make\nsure that you don't run out of\n\n430\n00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,870\nhard drive space or run out of RAM\nwhile you're running your capture.\n\n431\n00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,160\nSo they're pretty important.\n\n432\n00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,090\nYou're actively discarding the packets\nthat don't match your filter.\n\n433\n00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,340\nWhatever you're excluding in your filter\nis not going to get logged at all.\n\n434\n00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,660\nIt's gonna get thrown away and\n\n435\n00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,560\nyou'll just be left with\nthe information you actually need.\n\n436\n00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:11,370\nAll right, one last one that I like to\nuse is not broadcast and not multicast.\n\n437\n00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,950\nThere, when we do a capture,\n\n438\n00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,660\na lot of times we're concerned\nabout unicasts, right?\n\n439\n00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,030\nBroadcasts can be useful if you're trying\nto locate like viruses that are scanning\n\n440\n00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,210\nyour network or whatever.\n\n441\n00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,590\nBut typically broadcast and multicast\nis not going to give you what you want.\n\n442\n00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,590\nAnd so\nwe can punch that into block those out.\n\n443\n00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,780\nI'll do that.\n\n444\n00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,090\nAnd so now I'm capturing\ntraffic on my network but\n\n445\n00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,079\nI'm knocking out those broadcasts and I'm\njust seeing unicast between the sheets.\n\n446\n00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,390\nSo those are some of the examples\nof filters that we can use.\n\n447\n00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,170\nThe filter language is not too\nterribly intuitive because there's\n\n448\n00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,170\ntwo different languages.\n\n449\n00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,590\nOne for display filter,\none for capture filter.\n\n450\n00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,630\nSo just remember if you forget the syntax\n\n451\n00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,970\nthat you can always rely\non the expression button.\n\n452\n00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,490\nIn the display filter,\nyou'll see you've got a ton of power.\n\n453\n00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,400\nIn the Capture Filter, not as much,\nbut you do have a decent bit to\n\n454\n00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,880\nbe able to go in, and they give you\nsome examples you can build off of.\n\n455\n00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,660\nAnd then you can go on and modify them\nright down here to match your needs, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,790\nSo take advantage of\nthe Expressions button.\n\n457\n00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,110\nIt's pretty helpful to be able\nto get some examples on the fly.\n\n458\n00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,040\nAll right.\n\n459\n00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,530\nSo that pretty much wraps up filtering.\n\n460\n00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,310\nThat'll give you a better\nhandle on your data.\n\n461\n00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,460\nSo it is an important skill\nto have with Wireshark.\n\n462\n00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,270\nWe sure to stay tuned.\n\n463\n00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,380\nWe've got some other videos coming up with\nmore advanced Wireshark features, but\n\n464\n00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,480\nI hope you guys enjoy this one.\n\n465\n00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,125\nI'll see you next time.\n\n466\n00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:35,950\n[NOISE]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,729\n[SOUND] So\nonce we start capturing packets,\n\n2\n00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:12,870\nwe got a lot of data in there.\n\n3\n00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,580\nAnd the majority of those packets\nare related to each other, right.\n\n4\n00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,460\nWhen two machines communicate, they rarely\ncommunicate with just single packets.\n\n5\n00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,310\nMost networks have a maximum transmission\nunit, MTU, of about 1,500 bytes.\n\n6\n00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,460\nSo if you're sending more than\n1,500 bytes, it's gotta break it up\n\n7\n00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,850\ninto multiple frames to be able\nto send it on the network.\n\n8\n00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,600\nAnd those then get\nreassembled into packets.\n\n9\n00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,110\nSo we see that.\n\n10\n00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,490\nThings are being reassembled,\nwe get the packets on our screen.\n\n11\n00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,070\nThat's what we see here.\n\n12\n00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,930\nBut some communications like Telnet and\nother protocols you're sending keystrokes.\n\n13\n00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,800\nThey're very small, and\neach one fits in a single packet.\n\n14\n00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,830\nAnd so your communication then\ngets broken up into many,\n\n15\n00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,520\nmany packets just because\nit's not very large.\n\n16\n00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,890\nAnd you're sending them at certain times.\n\n17\n00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,750\nSo how can we string all of that\ntogether to form an entire conversation?\n\n18\n00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,290\nThe conversation is when two hosts\nare talking to each other and\n\n19\n00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,680\nexchanging information.\n\n20\n00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,580\nAnd one packet by itself\nmight not be very useful.\n\n21\n00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,180\nBut if we have the entire set of packets,\nwe can actually reassemble\n\n22\n00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,080\nthat communication and\ndo some pretty neat things.\n\n23\n00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,292\nLet me show you an example\nof how that works.\n\n24\n00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:20,130\nI'm gonna run a capture here and\nI'm just gonna capture my laptop.\n\n25\n00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,490\nSo I'm doing a capture\nfilter to tie just to me.\n\n26\n00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,440\nAnd I'll start that up, all right.\n\n27\n00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,300\nSo here I'm capturing just the traffic\ncoming from my laptop, and\n\n28\n00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,180\nthen I'm gonna do something bad, right.\n\n29\n00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,700\nI'm gonna fire up a non secure and\nunencrypted protocol like Telnet.\n\n30\n00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,890\nSo I'm gonna jump over here\nto a terminal window, and\n\n31\n00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,040\nI'm gonna Telnet to a host on the network.\n\n32\n00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,765\nAnd this is a Cisco switch\nthat I'm Telneting into, and\n\n33\n00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:49,820\nI'll provide my username, and\nI'll provide my password.\n\n34\n00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,820\nSo I'll just punch that in there.\n\n35\n00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,150\nSo here I am, I'm in the switch.\n\n36\n00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,190\nAnd now I can do a show version, and\n\n37\n00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,140\ntake a look at what version\nof the software I'm running.\n\n38\n00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,850\nI can do a show IP interface brief.\n\n39\n00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,570\nAnd start to take a look at\nthe interfaces that are on this switch,\n\n40\n00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,040\nI can start to do all my work,\nso there I go very exciting.\n\n41\n00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,460\nI'm working the switch and I get out.\n\n42\n00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,100\nNow I know Telnet is\na non encrypted protocol.\n\n43\n00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,570\nSo I know all that traffic went\nacross the network in plain text.\n\n44\n00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,773\nAnd if I come back here and I look, and\nI can see all those packets right here,\n\n45\n00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:30,000\nbecause you know I'm limiting\nit down to just my laptop.\n\n46\n00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,660\nAnd so when I look [LAUGH] I've\ngot a couple of things going on.\n\n47\n00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,250\nIt looks like Dropbox is\nsynchronizing in the background.\n\n48\n00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,050\nThat's always good, but then we see some\nother junk going on and as we scroll down,\n\n49\n00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,810\nI think I went a little too far.\n\n50\n00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,760\nLet me stop the thing.\n\n51\n00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,720\nSo if I go back in here and\nlook, I can find Telnet.\n\n52\n00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,080\nThere's the Telnet communications.\n\n53\n00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,270\nAll right, and in fact,\n\n54\n00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,880\nif I put a filter in here and\ntell it just to show me Telnet.\n\n55\n00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,990\nNow I'm just seeing that Telnet\ncommunication that we did.\n\n56\n00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,180\nAnd so I can take a look at that.\n\n57\n00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,910\nNow you saw what I did.\n\n58\n00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,800\nAnd if we look here we can see it's\nactually broken up into 193 packets.\n\n59\n00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,530\nSo my communication with the switch,\nwhen I logged in, and\n\n60\n00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,790\nI ran those few commands, was 193 packets.\n\n61\n00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,410\nNow if I was a patient man.\n\n62\n00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,910\nI could go through and\nlook at each one of these.\n\n63\n00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,170\nAnd find the information that happened.\n\n64\n00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,818\nAll right, I can see the communication in\nfact you can kind of see it starting in\n\n65\n00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:29,350\nsome of these.\n\n66\n00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,750\nIf you look at the raw data down here.\n\n67\n00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,350\nI see X term 256 colors.\n\n68\n00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,940\nThat's me negotiating out the protocol\nto connect with for that console.\n\n69\n00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,680\nAnd as we go down, somewhere in here we'll\nfind where it prompts for a username and\n\n70\n00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,230\npassword.\n\n71\n00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,400\nThose will be in here.\n\n72\n00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,580\nThere we go, so\nhere it's prompting for a password.\n\n73\n00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,450\nI see password:.\n\n74\n00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,490\nAnd here this is gonna\nbe me responding back.\n\n75\n00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,950\nNow when I was typing my password,\nI typed one letter at a time.\n\n76\n00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,960\nAnd with each letter it was\nsent to the other side.\n\n77\n00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,820\nAnd log.\n\n78\n00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,070\nWell this is the first letter, right here.\n\n79\n00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,120\nThe letter D.\n\n80\n00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,520\nAnd here's the second letter.\n\n81\n00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,430\nThe letter O.\n\n82\n00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,270\nAnd the third letter.\n\n83\n00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,400\nThe letter M.\n\n84\n00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,440\nEach one, right here in these packets.\n\n85\n00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,120\nAnd if I was patient, I could go through\neach one of these and figure it out.\n\n86\n00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,512\nBut Wireshark can do it for me.\n\n87\n00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,630\nWith Wireshark,\n\n88\n00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,540\nyou can take any one packet in a TCP\nstream, you can right click on it,\n\n89\n00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,210\nand you'll see where you've got an option\nright here to follow the TCP stream.\n\n90\n00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,530\nThis is also under\nthe Analyze menu up top.\n\n91\n00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,673\nIf you go under Analyze, you'll see follow\nTCP stream there, it's the same thing.\n\n92\n00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,720\nAnd what it'll do is it will look\nat the packet you selected, and\n\n93\n00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,500\nthen it will look at all of\nthe packets in that communication, and\n\n94\n00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,350\nassemble them together in\na full communication, and\n\n95\n00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,530\njust show you the payload, not headers and\nall that other junk, just the payload.\n\n96\n00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,300\nAnd so that's what I wanna do,\nI'm gonna take this packet.\n\n97\n00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,760\nI'll choose to follow the stream and\nit's gonna reassemble.\n\n98\n00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,140\nAnd look what we see now, right.\n\n99\n00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,220\nNow I can read this as if\nit was really happening.\n\n100\n00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,350\nWhat's in red,\nred is what I sent to the switch.\n\n101\n00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,200\nWhat's in blue is what\nthe switch sent to me.\n\n102\n00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,820\nSo when I logged in the switch\nsent me this login banner.\n\n103\n00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,310\nUnauthorized access is not permitted.\n\n104\n00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,190\nAccess verification.\n\n105\n00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,050\nAnd it prompted for a username.\n\n106\n00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,224\nAnd then I sent it a username.\n\n107\n00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:21,530\nWell notice my username: it was DPezet,\n\n108\n00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,990\nyou guys saw me type it on the screen,\nwhy are the letters there twice?\n\n109\n00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,270\nWell I sent it,\nthe letter D, that's in red,\n\n110\n00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,070\nand then it sent back the letter\nD to show it on the screen.\n\n111\n00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,690\nI saw it as I typed it, right.\n\n112\n00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,960\nIt's echoing.\n\n113\n00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,150\nWhen I typed the password,\nit didn't do that though.\n\n114\n00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,590\nI sent it my password and\nit did not echo it back on the screen.\n\n115\n00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,610\nSo I just see my password\ndonttasemebro right there, right.\n\n116\n00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,980\nSo, there's my password.\n\n117\n00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,613\nThat's our Florida humor\nwe get to throw in.\n\n118\n00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:53,282\nSo [LAUGH] and we've got that one there,\nand I can read that password.\n\n119\n00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:54,929\nIt was sent across\nthe network in plain text.\n\n120\n00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:59,441\nNow this was 190,\nactually 304 packets now, so\n\n121\n00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:02,580\nit was 304 packets in this stream,\n\n122\n00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,220\nit has reassembled that all and\nI can just read it.\n\n123\n00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,100\nI logged in, I ran show version.\n\n124\n00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,380\nNow for echo commands, it get's kind of\nannoying seeing the double up like that,\n\n125\n00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,120\nso down here,\nwe can choose some different filters\n\n126\n00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,700\nto change the direction that\nwe're seeing and so on.\n\n127\n00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,540\nAnd actually you know what in the,\nin the Windows version you can choose.\n\n128\n00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,680\nOh yeah, here we go, so\nin the Mac version we can too.\n\n129\n00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,660\nHere I'm on entire conversation and\n\n130\n00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,762\nif we drop that down you can choose to\nsee one direction versus the other.\n\n131\n00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:37,982\nI'm gonna tell it just to show me stuff\nthat the switch was sending, 10.1.10.2.\n\n132\n00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:41,360\nAnd that's gonna filter out the commands\nthat I saw and make it easier for\n\n133\n00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,500\nme to read.\n\n134\n00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,120\nAnd now when I go through,\nI can see, they ran show version and\n\n135\n00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,830\nhere's the output for show version.\n\n136\n00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,590\nNow I know.\n\n137\n00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,540\nWhat iOS that switch is running.\n\n138\n00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,690\nAnd then after that we ran\nshow IP interface brief.\n\n139\n00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,330\nAnd then here's the output for that.\n\n140\n00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,400\nAnd you'll get a little bit\nof a screen mess up here,\n\n141\n00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,140\nbecause we've got more prompts, and\nthen you hit space bar to make it go on so\n\n142\n00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,740\nit kind of throws it off a little bit.\n\n143\n00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,520\nBut there's that output plain as day.\n\n144\n00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,920\nThat entire session has been reassembled.\n\n145\n00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,270\nIf we do this when somebody\nis browsing to a webpage,\n\n146\n00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,260\nwe'll see the HTML codes of that\npage reassembled right here.\n\n147\n00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,710\nThis is the page they went to.\n\n148\n00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,130\nYou can see the links and so on.\n\n149\n00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,860\nIt's really powerful stuff.\n\n150\n00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,040\nIt makes it a lot easier than trying\nto piece this together ourselves.\n\n151\n00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,930\nWe just let Wireshark do it.\n\n152\n00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,140\nAnd when it comes to FTP, Telnet, right.\n\n153\n00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,490\nUnencrypted protocols.\n\n154\n00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,390\nWe can get a full session payload,\nand not only know what they did, but\n\n155\n00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,250\nhave access to it.\n\n156\n00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,880\nThe files, the images, all that stuff.\n\n157\n00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,210\nWe can reassemble that and\nhave access to it.\n\n158\n00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,720\nWith encrypted traffic,\nit's not so useful, right.\n\n159\n00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,882\nLet me show you an example\nof encrypted traffic.\n\n160\n00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:50,689\nI'm gonna clear out my filter, and\nlet me just start this over again.\n\n161\n00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:54,492\nAll right, and\nthis time I'm gonna go back here and\n\n162\n00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:58,212\ninstead of using Telnet,\nthis time I'll do SSH.\n\n163\n00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,421\nAnd I'm gonna connect right\nback to that same switch,\n\n164\n00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:05,604\nI'm gonna login as dpezet, see I sent\nin my login name right there, and\n\n165\n00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:09,472\nI'll punch in that same password,\ndonttasemebro, all right.\n\n166\n00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,162\nAnd I'll run show version.\n\n167\n00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:13,720\nAll right.\n\n168\n00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,750\nAnd I'll run show IP interface brief.\n\n169\n00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,777\nSo I'm doing the exact same\nthing I did with Telnet.\n\n170\n00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:23,340\nAnd then I'll get out.\n\n171\n00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,740\nAll right.\n\n172\n00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,610\nSo the same as I did with Telnet, If I go\nback here and I look, here's that stream.\n\n173\n00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,480\nSee all this SSH version two traffic,\nand I can filter that out, so I just see\n\n174\n00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,330\nthe SSH version two,\nwhich apparently it doesn't have.\n\n175\n00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,730\nAll right, well, we'll do TCP port = 22.\n\n176\n00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,650\nThere.\nAlright.\n\n177\n00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,120\nSo now I'm just seeing the SSH traffic.\n\n178\n00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,780\nSo here it is, this is my SSH session.\n\n179\n00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,890\nBut SSH is encrypted.\n\n180\n00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,520\nSo when I look at the payload down here.\n\n181\n00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,130\nRemember on Telnet when\nI looked at the payload,\n\n182\n00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,450\nI could actually see the word password or\nuser name or whatever.\n\n183\n00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,060\nHere I just see junk on each one of these.\n\n184\n00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,480\nActually one of them, will have text\nin it where it describes the encryption\n\n185\n00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,310\nprotocols that are supported.\n\n186\n00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,600\nBut other than that,\neverything else is gonna be encrypted.\n\n187\n00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,930\nAll right, since it's encrypted,\nthere's not anything I can get out of it.\n\n188\n00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,635\nAnd if I right click on that, and I do\nlike follow TCP stream, it will try and\n\n189\n00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:24,700\nreassemble it.\n\n190\n00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,520\nHere's that header part,\n\n191\n00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,100\nwe're showing all the encryption\nprotocols that are supported.\n\n192\n00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,180\nAnd then after that, it goes encrypted.\n\n193\n00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,270\nIt's still reassembling it for\nme, here it is.\n\n194\n00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,530\nThis is the communication.\n\n195\n00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,270\nBut it's a bit of a mess, isn't it?\n\n196\n00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,890\nAnd I don't know what's going on.\n\n197\n00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,950\nHere, I ran some command,\nI don't know what, right.\n\n198\n00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,140\nWas that me running show version,\nwas that me running show IP interface.\n\n199\n00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,490\nWas that me pressing space bar\nto get more on the screen.\n\n200\n00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,550\nI have no idea because\nit's fully encrypted.\n\n201\n00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,050\nSo following the TCP steam of\nan encrypted communication\n\n202\n00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,070\nis not terribly useful, right.\n\n203\n00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,620\nBut like any stream its got sequence\nnumbers, we can piece this stuff together.\n\n204\n00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,370\nAnd it tries.\n\n205\n00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,630\nNow some of this it's having to guess on,\n\n206\n00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,020\nbecause the sequence number\nin an encrypted packet\n\n207\n00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,900\nis not necessarily the sequence number for\nthe data that's inside of that packet.\n\n208\n00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,700\nIf it's running in tunnel mode, then the\nsequence numbers don't mean anything, and\n\n209\n00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,670\nso we could be assembling something\nhere that's completely unrelated data.\n\n210\n00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,000\nI could be sending two completely\nseparate sets of data to that server, and\n\n211\n00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,690\nwe're merging them here because\nwe can't tell the difference.\n\n212\n00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,780\nIf this was like a VPN in\ntransport mode though,\n\n213\n00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,030\nthe sequence numbers mean something.\n\n214\n00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,570\nAnd now I would know that this\nwas the right set of data.\n\n215\n00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,320\nSo depending on the data people\nare sending, we may or may not be able to\n\n216\n00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,300\nreassemble it, but unencrypted traffic, we\ncan piece together that communication, and\n\n217\n00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,800\nactually strip out the payload using\nthat follow TCP stream, all right.\n\n218\n00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,120\nYou've also got follow UDP stream and\neven follow SSL streams, but again,\n\n219\n00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,160\nthe SSL stream's not terribly useful\nunless you have the private key to be able\n\n220\n00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,810\nto decrypt it.\n\n221\n00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,380\nNow if you're monitoring your own network,\nand\n\n222\n00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,780\nyou've got that private key,\nthen that can be useful to you, right.\n\n223\n00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,480\nSo that's why the option is included here,\nall right.\n\n224\n00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160\nBut that's a really cool\nway to go in there and\n\n225\n00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,390\ntake a look at that to break into,\nnot necessarily break in.\n\n226\n00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,490\nBut to break out that data and take\na look at it in a more meaningful manner,\n\n227\n00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,460\nin a conversational manner.\n\n228\n00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,700\nBy stringing it all together.\n\n229\n00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,720\nAll right.\nWell, I hope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n230\n00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,147\nStay tuned.\nWe've got more videos on Wireshark coming\n\n231\n00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,395\nup, and\nwe've got a lot more features to cover.\n\n232\n00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:26,535\nSo hope to see you then.\n\n233\n00:11:26,535 -->

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,087\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:10,820\nSo you've just performed a capture.\n\n3\n00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,180\nYou've got a ton of data.\n\n4\n00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,940\nNow where do you get started, right.\n\n5\n00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,890\nA lot of times when we're running\nWireshark, we're looking for\n\n6\n00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,670\nsomething in particular, but sometimes\nwe don't know exactly what that is.\n\n7\n00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,250\nFor example,\nmaybe my network is running slow.\n\n8\n00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,070\nI know that I've got a good gigabit\nnetwork, or hundred megabit network or\n\n9\n00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,270\nsomething like that, and for some reason\nI'm just not getting that throughput.\n\n10\n00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,440\nSo I assume somebody else is\nconsuming traffic on the network.\n\n11\n00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,500\nWho is it?\n\n12\n00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,920\nHow do I start to find\nthat information out?\n\n13\n00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,390\nHow much bandwidth is my network\ncurrently consuming and so on?\n\n14\n00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,770\nWell, Wireshark contains\nan entire set of statistics and\n\n15\n00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,440\nreporting utilities that can\ngive you that information.\n\n16\n00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,130\nThat can let you compare\nhost communications and\n\n17\n00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,980\nquickly isolate who is\nthe primary user on your network.\n\n18\n00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,190\nFrom there you can start to write filters\nto capture just that person's traffic and\n\n19\n00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,460\nisolate what it is.\n\n20\n00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,150\nSo to get a starting point,\nwe normally start with the statistics and\n\n21\n00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,990\nreporting inside of Wireshark.\n\n22\n00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,560\nMost of this is buried\nunder the Statistics menu.\n\n23\n00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,880\nIf you drop it down you'll see a lot\ninformation here to be able to generate\n\n24\n00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,210\ncharts and graphics that relate to what's\ngoing on on your network, all right?\n\n25\n00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,140\nI'm gonna go over some of the most common\nones, but there are a ton in here, so\n\n26\n00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,310\ntake advantage of what you've got.\n\n27\n00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,230\nBut if we start right here at the top,\nwe've got the Summary.\n\n28\n00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,970\nThe Summary screen is not terribly\nuseful in my opinion, but\n\n29\n00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,060\nbasically what it does is it takes\nthe capture that you've gathered, and\n\n30\n00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,140\ngives you some overall highlights,\nlike how much data is in the capture.\n\n31\n00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,947\nI can see down here, you know, some basic\ninformation about the capture that I did.\n\n32\n00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:47,760\nI captured 139,000 packets,\nand I'm displaying them all.\n\n33\n00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,020\nI didn't have any drops.\n\n34\n00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,400\nAll right.\nI got everything in.\n\n35\n00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,400\nThe average packet size, was 1,003 bytes.\n\n36\n00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,789\nSorry, the average packets\nper second was 1,003.\n\n37\n00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:01,660\nMy average packet size was only 860 bytes.\n\n38\n00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,916\nSo even though my MTU\nmight be much higher,\n\n39\n00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,995\nthe average size is actually smaller.\n\n40\n00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:10,995\nThe bytes that I got in total,\nI can see that during that\n\n41\n00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:16,560\ntime that I was monitoring,\nI got 119 megabytes of data.\n\n42\n00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,760\nSo not a whole heck of a lot in there.\n\n43\n00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,730\nAnd my average megabit\nper second was only 6.9.\n\n44\n00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,130\nSo on average during this operation,\nmy network was at just 6.9 megabits.\n\n45\n00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,770\nNow I might have spiked much\nhigher during that time.\n\n46\n00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,500\nI might have dropped down to\nnothing during that time.\n\n47\n00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,340\nBut this is just that overall summary,\nall right.\n\n48\n00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,250\nIf that's what you're looking for,\nthis screen is pretty useful.\n\n49\n00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,080\nBut if you're trying to find a culprit\nthis doesn't really help much.\n\n50\n00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,420\nSo it's here, we can use it.\n\n51\n00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,530\nI don't typically go to it too often.\n\n52\n00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,810\nSlightly more useful screens,\n\n53\n00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,120\nif you go under Statistics\nyou've got Protocol Hierarchy.\n\n54\n00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,060\nProtocol Hierarchy will analyze\nall the packets you captured.\n\n55\n00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,260\nAnd break out the traffic\nbased on protocol,\n\n56\n00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,790\nwhat type of traffic was\nconsuming most of your bandwidth?\n\n57\n00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,810\nAnd it will lay it out for you right here\non the screen, so I can look at mine and\n\n58\n00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,200\nI can see.\n\n59\n00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,740\nKind of what was happening, and\n\n60\n00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:15,210\nif we kinda shrink some of these items\ndown to make it a little more explorable.\n\n61\n00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,680\nThere's no like quick\nbreakdown button on these.\n\n62\n00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,270\nBut if we kinda collapse\na lot of this data down,\n\n63\n00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,870\nyou can get a higher level view,\nand it makes a little more sense.\n\n64\n00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,080\nI can see that 100% of\nmy traffic were frames.\n\n65\n00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,815\nI expect that.\n\n66\n00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:30,290\n100% of my traffic was ethernet.\n\n67\n00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,190\nI'm not running token ring or anything\nelse like that on this network, so\n\n68\n00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,590\neverything was ethernet.\n\n69\n00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,414\nAnd then I can see IP version 6\naccounted for 22% of my traffic,\n\n70\n00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:43,380\nIP version 4 accounted for\n77% of my traffic.\n\n71\n00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,940\nSo almost a quarter was IPv6,\nbut the bulk was IPv4.\n\n72\n00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,840\nYou've got other things in here like ARP,\nLLC,\n\n73\n00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,170\nLLDP but there were almost negligible just\na handful of packets for each of those.\n\n74\n00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,600\nBut just inside of here I can break this\ndown and see more about this traffic.\n\n75\n00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,030\nNow IPv4 77% of my traffic, that's great.\n\n76\n00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,730\nMaybe I look at this and go,\nyou know what, I'm not running IPV6,\n\n77\n00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,740\nhow is that consuming 22% of my traffic?\n\n78\n00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,330\nWhy is that?\n\n79\n00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,540\nYou can start to break it down.\n\n80\n00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,680\nI am using IPv6 to stream my desktop so\nthat's likely going to be this one.\n\n81\n00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,130\nIf I go in here I can see the TCP\ntraffic accounting for all of it.\n\n82\n00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,180\nAnd inside of there I can see\nmost of that was data, and\n\n83\n00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,910\nthen looks like there's some\nunaccounted for information.\n\n84\n00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,649\nIt just kind of disappears.\n\n85\n00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:34,580\nI've got my TCP at 22.39% of my packets,\nbut only at 15.98% of it was data.\n\n86\n00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,655\nThe other, it's gone.\n\n87\n00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,640\nIt's just not here in the list.\n\n88\n00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,240\nThat is one of the problems with\nthese summaries, sometimes they don't\n\n89\n00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,190\nhave menu entires for certain types\nof information and it gets excluded.\n\n90\n00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,570\nSo that's exactly what's happening here.\n\n91\n00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,240\nIf I break up that IPv4 data, though,\nthis one will be a a little more advanced.\n\n92\n00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,170\nI can see that RTMP, the Real Time\nMessaging Protocol, accounted for\n\n93\n00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,070\n10% of my traffic.\n\n94\n00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,850\nThat's our stream,\n\n95\n00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,880\nthe live stream, if you're watching\nthis live, it's what you use.\n\n96\n00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,000\nI can see SSL was another 7%,\nplain test HTTP was only .7%.\n\n97\n00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,760\nSo we're doing secure browsing apparently.\n\n98\n00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,850\nBut you can break that even further\ndown and see JPEG, HTML, JavaScript.\n\n99\n00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,990\nLaying it out based on what\nwas consuming the bandwidth.\n\n100\n00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,570\nAnd we get bandwidth in terms of\njust the percentage of packets,\n\n101\n00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,710\nwhich is really our throughput,\nand percentage of bytes, so\n\n102\n00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,559\nour actual size of our traffic, and\nyou can break it down from there.\n\n103\n00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,110\nSo it's a really useful way of seeing\n\n104\n00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,320\nwho was the main traffic\nconsumer in terms of protocols.\n\n105\n00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,150\nBut it not normally the protocols we\ncare about so much as it is the host.\n\n106\n00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,710\nWhich host?\n\n107\n00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,650\nWhich machine wasn't on my network that\nwas actually consuming the bandwidth?\n\n108\n00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,560\nThe protocol hierarchy\ndoesn't tell me that, right?\n\n109\n00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,410\nIt tells me the protocols but\nnot who did it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,970\nSo if we wanna know who did it.\n\n111\n00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,288\nThat's what we need endpoints.\n\n112\n00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:53,170\nI need endpoints to know\nwho was the machine,\n\n113\n00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,980\nthe actual computer that\nused this bandwidth.\n\n114\n00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,550\nAnd if we go back under\nStatistics you'll see Endpoints.\n\n115\n00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,660\nAnd if we go to Endpoints now it's\ngonna give me a list of computers.\n\n116\n00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,300\nAnd it's breaking it down by protocol.\n\n117\n00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,350\nSo it starts with ethernet, and notice\nhow there's just 40 endpoints there.\n\n118\n00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,785\nAnd then I've got IPv4 where there's 206,\n\n119\n00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:19,230\nIPv6 where there's 18, TCP 648, UDP 256.\n\n120\n00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,600\nIt's breaking it down by\nthe protocols that it found.\n\n121\n00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,760\nIf a protocol is not lit up like IPX.\n\n122\n00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,000\nThat means that we just didn't have any\npackets that were in that protocol.\n\n123\n00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,290\nSo we can go in and\nwe can start to locate this.\n\n124\n00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,190\nMy Mac address is one-way, you can see all\nof our various systems that are out there.\n\n125\n00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,970\nWe've got Dells and [INAUDIBLE],\nI wonder what that is,\n\n126\n00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,690\nLG, Samsung, we've got all sorts of\ndifferent hosts that are on our network.\n\n127\n00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,655\nA lot of Apple, apparently we've\ngotten a little Apple heavy.\n\n128\n00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,170\n[LAUGH] But we can start to\nsee all that If we go to IPv4,\n\n129\n00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,960\nwe can get the breakdown by IP.\n\n130\n00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,490\nAnd if I sort it up here,\nI can start to see some of that traffic.\n\n131\n00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,900\nNormally, I'm not gonna sort by IP,\nI'm gonna sort by either bytes or packets.\n\n132\n00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,740\nWho sent me the most packets is not\nalways gonna match up with who sent\n\n133\n00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,900\nthe most bytes.\n\n134\n00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,890\nSo you may see some differences there.\n\n135\n00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:14,111\nBut I can see the bulk of my traffic\nwas being generated by 10.1.230.30.\n\n136\n00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:16,850\nOkay, they generated\nthe bulk of my traffic\n\n137\n00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,520\nat about 27 megs during this capture.\n\n138\n00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,860\nSo, not terribly large amount of data.\n\n139\n00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,400\nBut they were the one that was up top.\n\n140\n00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,614\nNow, who is 10.1.230.30.\n\n141\n00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,760\nI don't know, I'd have to go and\ndo a reverse name lookup.\n\n142\n00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,730\nI've got a set to do name resolution, but\n\n143\n00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,960\nit apparently wasn't able to find\na reverse lookup on that one.\n\n144\n00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,100\nSo, I don't necessarily know who that is.\n\n145\n00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,990\nI need to go and find out on my network.\n\n146\n00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,163\nI also see a lot of traffic\nfrom 168.61.129.78.\n\n147\n00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:46,862\nWho is that?\n\n148\n00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:47,540\nWell, again, I don't know.\n\n149\n00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,898\nI'd have to go and do a reverse lookup and\nfind out who that maps to and\n\n150\n00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:53,135\nlocate that host.\n\n151\n00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:53,773\nAll right?\n\n152\n00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:59,300\nNow, this is the total communication for\n10.1.230.30.\n\n153\n00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,010\nThis might all be talking\nto one destination, or\n\n154\n00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,880\nit might be talking to many destinations.\n\n155\n00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,520\nI don't know.\nThese are summaries, right?\n\n156\n00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,010\nThese are totals of that data.\n\n157\n00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,920\nSo, what I may need to do is\nfind out a little bit more.\n\n158\n00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,910\nThe endpoints, it's just a total.\n\n159\n00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,910\nIf I want to break it down\nto who they were talking to,\n\n160\n00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,110\nI need to look at their conversations.\n\n161\n00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,170\nAnd if I go back up to that Analyze menu,\nor Statistics menu, we'll see Endpoints.\n\n162\n00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,380\nSorry, that's where we just came from.\n\n163\n00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,110\nWe'll see Conversations,\nthat's what I was going for.\n\n164\n00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,360\nConversations is where it maps\nnot just a particular host, but\n\n165\n00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,140\na host with who they talked to.\n\n166\n00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,130\nAnd in my opinion, this is the most\nuseful screen under the Statistics menu.\n\n167\n00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,830\nWhen you go to conversations, it breaks\nit down based on source and destination.\n\n168\n00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,770\nSo, address A and address B.\n\n169\n00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,415\nNow, I can go under IPv4 and I can sort by\nbytes and I can say who was top talker?\n\n170\n00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,312\n10.1.230.30.\n\n171\n00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:00,335\nWho were they talking to?\n\n172\n00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:02,640\n168.61.129.78.\n\n173\n00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,490\nI can see that communication happening.\n\n174\n00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,910\nHost A talking to B and\nI can see the primary direction, right?\n\n175\n00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:17,130\nSo, bytes from A to B was pretty high,\nbytes from B to A was pretty low.\n\n176\n00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,748\nSo it was mostly A sending data to B,\nit's just somebody uploading.\n\n177\n00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:27,720\n10.1.230.30 uploaded 27\nmegabytes of data to host B.\n\n178\n00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,750\nI can see that right here,\nnow I know who's consuming my bandwidth or\n\n179\n00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,880\nwho generated the most,\nor where that data went.\n\n180\n00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,570\nShould 10.1.230.30 have been sending\ndata out to that public host?\n\n181\n00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,010\nI don't know,\nmaybe this is an Edward Snowden event and\n\n182\n00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,900\ntheir uploading ton of\ndocuments I don't know, right?\n\n183\n00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,620\nI need to go and look at that information.\n\n184\n00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,210\nAnd if you right-click it,\nyou'll see Apply as Filter.\n\n185\n00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,380\nAnd so we can go in here and we can say\napply that as a filter to my traffic.\n\n186\n00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,580\nAnd I'll do A to B, and\nit's going to apply that to my capture.\n\n187\n00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,070\nAnd so in the background now,\nlet me just close that.\n\n188\n00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,690\nGet out of the way.\n\n189\n00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,640\nThere we go.\n\n190\n00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,290\nNow we can go back here and\nI'm seeing the capture of that data.\n\n191\n00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,100\nWhat did they send?\n\n192\n00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,400\nWell, it was TCP traffic, right.\n\n193\n00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,890\nSo I can see that TCP traffic right here.\n\n194\n00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,450\nAnd then I can go down and\nI can start to try and\n\n195\n00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,430\nbreak that down and\nfigure out what was happening.\n\n196\n00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,920\nUnfortunately in this case,\nit was SSL, so it's encrypted traffic.\n\n197\n00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,100\nSo I don't necessarily\nknow what the heck it was.\n\n198\n00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,800\nBecause it's encrypted, right?\n\n199\n00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,740\nBut we can poke through it,\n\n200\n00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,980\nat least get some IP information on it,\nmatch it with a time.\n\n201\n00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,680\nI can go and find 10.1.230.30,\nfind that machine and look at the logs and\n\n202\n00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,000\nsee who was logged in at that time.\n\n203\n00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,020\nAnd now I can start to find out what they\nwere doing and what they transmitted.\n\n204\n00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,460\nMaybe I've got security cameras\nI can match this up with and\n\n205\n00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,870\nall that stuff, right?\n\n206\n00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,110\nBut the conversation list\nis what lets us get here.\n\n207\n00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,220\nThat's how we can start to find out\nwhere that traffic was going to or\n\n208\n00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,170\nwhere it was coming from,\nand breaking it down.\n\n209\n00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,080\nAll right, now, with the endpoints, and\nthe conversation list, you'll also see,\n\n210\n00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,620\nI went to Endpoints and\nConversations right here.\n\n211\n00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,830\nDown a little bit later,\nyou'll see Conversation List and\n\n212\n00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,680\nEndpoint List down here too.\n\n213\n00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,010\nWhat these are, are like shortcuts.\n\n214\n00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,160\nWhen I went to Endpoints,\nI really just went into Endpoints and\n\n215\n00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,170\nI jumped right into IPv4 to get there,\nright?\n\n216\n00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,510\nIf I went under Statistics and Endpoint\nList I could have gone to IPv4 and\n\n217\n00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,540\nit would have taken me straight in there.\n\n218\n00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,030\nSo instead of loading up all of\nthose tabs I just go straight for\n\n219\n00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,960\nthe data that I want.\n\n220\n00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,420\nIt's the same data, but\nit's like quickly applying a filter.\n\n221\n00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,811\nIf you're dealing with\na massive capture log,\n\n222\n00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,778\nif you've captured 24 hours of data and\n\n223\n00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:44,659\nyour log file is hundreds of gigs in size\ngoing into the regular end point mapping.\n\n224\n00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:47,987\nWhen you go to Statistics and Endpoints,\nor Statistics and Conversation,\n\n225\n00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:51,650\nit may take it a while to load because\nit's loading all of those protocols.\n\n226\n00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,560\nBut if you go down here to the lists,\nyou can filter it down and\n\n227\n00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,430\nit might speed things up a little more.\n\n228\n00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,400\nI say might, because if the bulk of\nyour traffic is from that one protocol,\n\n229\n00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,500\nthen it's not going to\nspeed things up very much.\n\n230\n00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,230\nBut if you're looking for\n\n231\n00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,490\nsomething very precise that helps\nyou jump right in and get to it.\n\n232\n00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,710\nAll right, the last one I wanna talk about\nis this guy right here, the IO Graph.\n\n233\n00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,730\nThis is the input output graph and\nit gives you pretty pictures.\n\n234\n00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,810\nIf you've ever dealt with management,\nyou know that they like pretty pictures.\n\n235\n00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,640\nSo here's a chance where we\ncan jump in and create that.\n\n236\n00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,610\nWe can create a graph where we can\nshow people things like what our total\n\n237\n00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,640\nbandwidth consumption was and so on.\n\n238\n00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,150\nSo when we look at it here,\nI see by default just graph one and\n\n239\n00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,350\nit has no filter.\n\n240\n00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,620\nSo this is mapping all of my network\ntraffic across the time of that capture.\n\n241\n00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,830\nNow that capture only ran for\nabout two and a half minutes.\n\n242\n00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,740\nRight?\nSo I'm just seeing two and a half minutes.\n\n243\n00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,690\nIf I had ran the capture for an hour or\na day, this would be a much longer chart.\n\n244\n00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,720\nIt would have a different time\nscale on it to accommodate that.\n\n245\n00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,550\nBut I can add in more graphs to it.\n\n246\n00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,100\nRight?\n\n247\n00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,980\nSo for example, Graph 1,\nthat's gonna be my total.\n\n248\n00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,350\nBut Graph 2, maybe I want that just\nto be that one particular host.\n\n249\n00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,319\nSo in here I can put in a filter and\n\n250\n00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:14,055\nsay ip addr equals 10.1.230.30.\n\n251\n00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:18,420\nSo now I've got that punched and\nit's going to apply it.\n\n252\n00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:25,900\nNow I'll get a red line and I can see my\ntotal bandwidth compared to that one host.\n\n253\n00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,500\nHere's that one host's contribution.\n\n254\n00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,525\nAnd I can see that in the first\nminute of that capture,\n\n255\n00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,610\n10.1.230.30 was sending a lot.\n\n256\n00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,700\nBut in the second minute and going on,\nit flatlined, it stopped communicating.\n\n257\n00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,270\nSo it uploaded what it was uploading,\nand then it stopped.\n\n258\n00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,980\nWe can see all that right here and\nwe can generate the pretty picture.\n\n259\n00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,090\nNow, that may be useful to you.\n\n260\n00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,240\nFor me, I usually only use these when I\nneed to relate information to management.\n\n261\n00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,130\nThey like pictures,\nthey hate spreadsheets.\n\n262\n00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,990\nSo you generate things like this and\nyou can kinda demonstrate it easily.\n\n263\n00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,110\nYou can say, hey, if they're telling you\nthe network's slow, we need to upgrade.\n\n264\n00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,170\nYou can say, well, not really if you look,\non average we're below our maximum.\n\n265\n00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,760\nAnd here's the bulk of our traffic.\n\n266\n00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,630\nIt's within the limits and so we're fine.\n\n267\n00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,160\nThere's not anything too\ncrazy that we have to do.\n\n268\n00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,140\nBut you can tweak this and\nchange it however you need.\n\n269\n00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,990\nYou've got all sorts of different\nstuff you can customize here.\n\n270\n00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,830\nIt's kind of nice.\n\n271\n00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,510\nSome of it,\n\n272\n00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,630\na lot of this stuff is smoothed out\nto make it look a little nicer.\n\n273\n00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,060\nIf you turn that off,\nthe lines get a lot more jagged and sharp.\n\n274\n00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,090\nBut otherwise, you can put in filters\nto designate whatever traffic you want.\n\n275\n00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,910\nI did a particular IP address.\n\n276\n00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,870\nI might want to do something\nlike just HTTP, right?\n\n277\n00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,760\nAnd notice I just turn the graph off and\n\n278\n00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,070\nturn the graph back on\nagain to get it to list it.\n\n279\n00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,673\nAnd so there's all of the HTTP traffic.\n\n280\n00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:42,148\nThere's not much.\n\n281\n00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,710\nTcp port equals 443.\n\n282\n00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,010\nLet's do SSL traffic.\n\n283\n00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,930\nAll right?\nSo\n\n284\n00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,030\nnow it's gonna lay out all the SSL\ntraffic that was sent at that time.\n\n285\n00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,360\nYou just use filters to map it.\n\n286\n00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,380\nI'll see SSL's responsible for\nthe majority of it.\n\n287\n00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,280\nAll right, so that's the IO graph.\n\n288\n00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,910\nBetween those different options, and\nthat was all under the Statistics screen.\n\n289\n00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,370\nBetween all of those,\n\n290\n00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,460\nthat usually gives you the information\nyou need to get started.\n\n291\n00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,590\nTo find your target.\n\n292\n00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,970\nTo find who it is that you\nneed to be analyzing further.\n\n293\n00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,450\nAnd once you've got that target,\n\n294\n00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,950\nthat's when you start digging into\ntheir packets and going further, right?\n\n295\n00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,650\nBut like I said, there is a lot\nmore under the Statistics menu.\n\n296\n00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,570\nYou'll see most of these\nare just aliases or\n\n297\n00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,590\nbreakdowns where you can jump right in and\ncapture certain things.\n\n298\n00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,550\nThe flow graph is kinda neat, I find it's\nnormally a little too cluttered for me.\n\n299\n00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,460\nBut, you know, it can go in and\nmap together so\n\n300\n00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,470\nyou can start to see those conversations.\n\n301\n00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,430\nThere's different things in here\nthat are of marginal utility,\n\n302\n00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,550\nsome of them are terribly useful.\n\n303\n00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,700\nIt just depends on whether\nit fits your scenario.\n\n304\n00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,550\nAll right.\nSo\n\n305\n00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,660\nthat's pretty much a highlight\nright there of the statistics and\n\n306\n00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,970\nreporting inside of Wireshark.\n\n307\n00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,140\nIt's pretty neat stuff and\nit helps you find your target faster,\n\n308\n00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,480\nso that's always a good thing.\n\n309\n00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,020\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed that video.\n\n310\n00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,580\nStay tuned.\n\n311\n00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,780\nWe've got more Wireshark videos coming up,\ntons of other features that are in there.\n\n312\n00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,450\nIt's a really powerful product.\n\n313\n00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,388\nAll right, I'll see you then.\n\n314\n00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:08,639\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
