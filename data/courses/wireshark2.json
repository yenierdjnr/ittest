is,\nhow to use it, and\n\n4\n00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:12.220\nperhaps what kind of network protocol\nanalyzers are available to us, well,\n\n5\n00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.430\nthen you're in the right spot.\n\n6\n00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.020\nWe really are gonna be taking a look at\nhow to use this utility to benefit you in\n\n7\n00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.200\nyour network to analyze the different\ntypes of traffic depending on where\n\n8\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.020\nyou place this within your network, and\n\n9\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.980\nwhat machine do you really wanna focus\nit on or in fact, your entire network.\n\n10\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.874\nSo, let's go ahead and hand this off to\nRonnie Wong because he's gonna really\n\n11\n00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:36.654\nexplain what we'll be looking\nat within these series.\n\n12\n00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:41.209\n&gt;&gt; All right, as we get started and taking\nlook at using Wireshark, we, of course,\n\n13\n00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:45.236\nwanna make sure that you understand\nthe very basics of how to get set up and\n\n14\n00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:47.613\nhave, not only the knowledge, but also,\n\n15\n00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:51.927\nof course, a few of the skills that you\nneed to get started in capturing data.\n\n16\n00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:54.700\nAnd, of course,\nseeing what you really need.\n\n17\n00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.570\nSo, what we're gonna begin with,\nof course,\n\n18\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.600\nis just a simple installation\nof Wireshark as well.\n\n19\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.410\nWe're gonna talk about what Wireshark is,\nbut then, of course,\n\n20\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.520\nwe'll install Wireshark.\n\n21\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.070\nI'm gonna show you how to install it,\n\n22\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.330\nnot only in Windows which is by far\nthe most popular way to install it.\n\n23\n00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.329\nWe'll also do it on the MacBook 2 and\n\n24\n00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.400\nthen, we'll also show you how you can\ninstall it in a Linux distro as well.\n\n25\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.759\nFrom that point, we would jump in to\njust showing you how to do a basic\n\n26\n00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.530\ntype of packet capturing, which is just\ngetting all the data onto your machine.\n\n27\n00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.790\nFrom that point, you can use it to analyze\nthe amount of data that you have captured.\n\n28\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.910\nSo we're gonna perform a simple type\nof data capture available for us.\n\n29\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.090\nThen, of course, now that you know\nhow to do those basic things,\n\n30\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.670\nit's the interface that can be really\nconfusing at times because there are so\n\n31\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.060\nmany different options.\n\n32\n00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960\nWe're gonna walk you through\nthe most basic of the interface so\n\n33\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.340\nthat you understand what you're seeing and\nwhat the layout is, and of course,\n\n34\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.830\nhow you can get access\nto some of the tools.\n\n35\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.220\nAnd the beginning area is making sure,\nof course, that we can start and\n\n36\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.500\nstop the capture as we need to.\n\n37\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.690\nOf course, with all the data\non our machines at this point,\n\n38\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.750\nthe problem that we have is simple,\nis now we have a gigantic virtual haystack\n\n39\n00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.200\nof all of these different\nsleevers of data that we have.\n\n40\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.400\nHow is it that we begin to pinpoint or\n\n41\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.280\nfind that one needle in\na haystack that we need?\n\n42\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.860\nWe'll talk a bit about using different\nfilters that will help us to begin to\n\n43\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.970\nwhittle down that haystack to\nreally isolate and focus down\n\n44\n00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.350\non the packets that we're really trying\nto take a look at as well, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.460\nNow, even though you think we\nshould be done at that point, well,\n\n46\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.130\nthere are advanced features that we can\nalso talk about too, which of course,\n\n47\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.400\nis being able to capture the conversation\nof the data between two machines, right?\n\n48\n00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.840\nSo not only seeing one side of a capture,\nbut\n\n49\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.660\nactually being able to see if the data can\nflow on both sides of the capture as well.\n\n50\n00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.660\nWe'll take a look at doing that, as well\nas, of course, using some of the expert\n\n51\n00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.330\ninformation tools that we'll see, that are\nalso built into Wireshark to help us to\n\n52\n00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.040\nkind of pinpoint in the unusual\ntraffic that we're analyzing.\n\n53\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.039\nEspecially for errors and for warnings\nthat are going on in our systems or for\n\n54\n00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.554\nproblems, we'll also be able to\nuse that to help us to focus them.\n\n55\n00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:18.618\nAnd then, of course,\nlastly we'll start setting it up here for\n\n56\n00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:23.320\ntaking a look at the statistical\ninformation that we can also find out.\n\n57\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.550\nWe'll take a look at the most\ngeneral types of statistics and\n\n58\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.770\nthen we'll move into the realm\nof protocols specific types of\n\n59\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.730\nstatistics that we can\nalso take advantage of.\n\n60\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.100\nBut, if you say, hey, I haven't\nreally worked with Wireshark before,\n\n61\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.510\nthis is a great place for you to begin.\n\n62\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.360\nIf you need a refresher,\nthis is a great place for you to begin.\n\n63\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.420\nAs this series is really about\nthe foundation of learning about it,\n\n64\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.220\nwe think that this will really help you,\nespecially if you're getting started in\n\n65\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.580\nit, to begin to use it, and\nto feel more comfortable with it.\n\n66\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.960\nThis series has the potential,\nof course, of going on and\n\n67\n00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.920\nactually developing later content\nwhich will add on to the end of this\n\n68\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.880\nparticular short series of shows to\nprobably do more scenario types of\n\n69\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.550\nexamination of data as it goes\nacross our interfaces too.\n\n70\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.770\nSo, check back every once in a while as\nyou're watching through these series, and\n\n71\n00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.320\nyou might see one, two,\n\n72\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.620\nor maybe even three or four different\nepisodes start adding in and\n\n73\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.000\nfilling out Wireshark to help us to make\nit the best possible show that we can.\n\n74\n00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.096\nBut at least this will get you\na great start and a beginning.\n\n75\n00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:34.046\nSo, if you are ready to actually start\ntaking that journey, get ready for\n\n76\n00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:37.501\nthat very first episode, and\nCherokee and I will see you there.\n\n77\n00:04:37.501 -->

your Wireshark show.\n\n7\n00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.740\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.470\nIn this episode we will be introducing\nyou to version 2.2.4 with Wireshark.\n\n9\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.290\nToday in studios we have Ronnie Wong\nto help us cover this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.820\nNow, thank you for\njoining us today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.200\nNow, we see this topic,\nit says what is Wireshark?\n\n12\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.272\nI almost feel like I should be saying\nit in a Jeopardy question format.\n\n13\n00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:36.220\nAre we gonna be playing\nsome kind of game today?\n\n14\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, to a point,\nit's sort of like a game, right?\n\n15\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.640\nWireshark is a great utility that\neverybody in networking should get at\n\n16\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.960\nleast the most basic familiarity with\nbecause you can learn a lot by discovering\n\n17\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.580\nmore about your network traffic\nthan you really think that you can.\n\n18\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.909\nSo when we first start off, with the idea\nhere of networking, most of us do end up,\n\n19\n00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.658\nand we've taken any type of instructor-led\nclass we've learned about the OSI model.\n\n20\n00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:09.705\nWe understand how certain devices end up\nworking together, and all that is some\n\n21\n00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:15.080\nprerequisite knowledge that you will\nhave to have as you work with Wireshark.\n\n22\n00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.540\nBut overall though, even though we\nmight understand the theory behind it,\n\n23\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.690\nmost of us don't get to see it\nactually apply in action nor\n\n24\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.780\nget to see the interactions that\nend up on our networks as well.\n\n25\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.610\nWireshark essentially helps to\nreveal a lot of that information,\n\n26\n00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.620\nnot through the theory and knowledge\nof just connecting devices together.\n\n27\n00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.230\nBut we can actually take the traffic that\ngoes on between two communicating devices\n\n28\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.890\nand applications and be able to see\nthe interactions that happen with them.\n\n29\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.030\nSo it is a great utility and tool for\nanybody in networking to make\n\n30\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.210\nsure that you at least have some grasp of\nthis tool and the scope and the nature.\n\n31\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.360\nSo that way if somebody says,\nI need to find this out.\n\n32\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.500\nIs there a possible way we can do that?\n\n33\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.550\nWell, more than likely for you to\nfind out some experiences like that,\n\n34\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.570\nsuch as why a server may be acting\nslowly across the network, or\n\n35\n00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.080\nwhy connections are being dropped,\nWireshark can\n\n36\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.570\nhelp you to be able to troubleshoot\nthings like that if you need to.\n\n37\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.239\nSo that is why we're actually taking\na little bit of time to focus in on\n\n38\n00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.505\nthe notion of Wireshark itself.\n\n39\n00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:27.239\nBut when it comes down to what is\nWireshark, it's really kind of\n\n40\n00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.690\na mini Swiss Army knife of\nnetworking utilities that we have.\n\n41\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.466\nNow by that, I really do mean that it has\na couple of utilities that are kind of\n\n42\n00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:37.826\ncombined together as one.\n\n43\n00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:40.093\n&gt;&gt; It can get a little\nconfusing sometimes,\n\n44\n00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:43.130\nif you hear the term packet capture or\nsniffer.\n\n45\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.700\nRonnie, is there some way that you can\nkind of just break that down for us, and\n\n46\n00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.040\nexplain the difference here?\n\n47\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.230\nOr between the different tools,\nwe hear packet analyzer.\n\n48\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually is a little bit\nconfusing when you're first beginning and\n\n49\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.430\nyou hear those terms like\njust put a packet sniffer, or\n\n50\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.400\nsniff the traffic a little bit.\n\n51\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.870\nYou have different imagery\nif you're like me and\n\n52\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.670\nyou came from a different background.\n\n53\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.353\nDoes network traffic smell in some way?\n\n54\n00:03:04.353 --> 00:03:05.872\nWell, to a point.\n\n55\n00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:08.926\n&gt;&gt; For me, I always think of like we\nwere talking about even before the show,\n\n56\n00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:10.320\nis it hardware, is it software?\n\n57\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.846\nWhich angle are you going here?\n\n58\n00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:15.761\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually it's both when it\ncomes down to the very realization.\n\n59\n00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.358\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea of what Wireshark is,\n\n60\n00:03:18.358 --> 00:03:19.962\nit's a couple of those utilities.\n\n61\n00:03:19.962 --> 00:03:22.061\nLike I said,\nthink about a mini Swiss Army knife.\n\n62\n00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.484\nNow, it's not the complete, thick,\n\n63\n00:03:24.484 --> 00:03:28.092\ngigantic 64-tool Swiss Army\nknife of all networking.\n\n64\n00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:31.912\nBut it at least contains some of the most\nvaluable tools that we normally need to do\n\n65\n00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:34.732\nso that we can see the traffic\nas it goes across the network.\n\n66\n00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:39.025\nAnd so that begins what what we\ncall some type of packet sniffer,\n\n67\n00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:42.214\nas well as what we call a packet analyzer,\ntoo.\n\n68\n00:03:42.214 --> 00:03:44.386\nNow when we combine\nboth of those together,\n\n69\n00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:47.930\nwe end up getting what we call\na protocol analyzer altogether.\n\n70\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.680\nSo let's break down\nthe individual components just for\n\n71\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.810\na moment to make sure that\nwe understand this, right?\n\n72\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.490\nWhen it comes down to what\nwe call a packet sniffer or\n\n73\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.440\na packet capture utility of some sort,\nwhat we're actually saying here is that\n\n74\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.020\nit really helps us to be able\nto see the data on the network.\n\n75\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.950\nNow, the problem that we have in reality,\nright?\n\n76\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.570\nIf you were to pull out my\nwire right here to my network\n\n77\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.200\nadapter on my machine right now,\nyou can't see anything, right?\n\n78\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.020\nIt doesn't show you anything.\n\n79\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.050\nThe only thing that you could possibly\ndo right now in the earliest days of\n\n80\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.810\nnetworking is that you could\nhook it up to an oscilloscope.\n\n81\n00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.720\nAnd then you'd see some sine wave.\n\n82\n00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.280\nYou'd see a little bit of blips and\nstuff like that going across.\n\n83\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.835\nTo you and me,\nthat's not very readable, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:36.835 --> 00:04:40.980\nIt really doesn't give us anything,\nexcept it's fascinating to watch.\n\n85\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.040\nAnd then when somebody explains to you a\nlittle bit about what these actually mean,\n\n86\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.900\nthen you're kind of a little bit more\nfascinated by the very fact of it.\n\n87\n00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.610\nBut that all begins with\nsome utility that we have\n\n88\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.380\nthat can help us to see those blips and\nthose sine waves and\n\n89\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.150\nsome of those different\nthings that we have in place.\n\n90\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.073\nPacket-capturing utilities,\nwhether they're hardware-based or\n\n91\n00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:05.180\nsoftware-based, essentially do that for\nus.\n\n92\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.633\nAn oscilloscope is essentially\na packet-capturing type of utility to\n\n93\n00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:10.752\na point, right?\n\n94\n00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:13.940\nIt allows us to see\nthe information going across.\n\n95\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.930\nAnd if that oscilloscope is hooked\nup to some type of printer,\n\n96\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.560\nwe can now go ahead and\nsee those blips going across, as well.\n\n97\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.701\nAnd then be able to analyze that later on.\n\n98\n00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:26.377\n&gt;&gt; Maybe make some correlations about\ndifferent types of communications, but\n\n99\n00:05:26.377 --> 00:05:27.930\nit's not really detailed.\n\n100\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for an engineer,\n\n101\n00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.560\nit might be enough that he could go,\nhere's where you're experiencing issues,\n\n102\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.252\nbut for Ronnie Wong, there's just-\n\n103\n00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:34.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No way.\n\n104\n00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:37.150\nI'd just go all right,\nthat means nothing to me.\n\n105\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.820\nThere's nothing that we have.\n\n106\n00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.370\nBut it has to begin somewhere.\n\n107\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.620\nAnd the somewhere that we\nbegin is by capturing or\n\n108\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.096\nby making sure that we can see\nthe data going across something.\n\n109\n00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:52.160\nPacket-capture utilities, especially in\nnetworking data, what they do is that they\n\n110\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.630\npretty much watch the NIC, the network\ninterface card, on your network.\n\n111\n00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.340\nAnd whatever traffic flows across\nthat interface it says, hey,\n\n112\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.770\nlet me go ahead and\nmake a capture of that.\n\n113\n00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.700\nIn other words, capture those\npackets that are going across.\n\n114\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.390\nAnd let me print them out somewhere.\n\n115\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.390\nNow, when we talk about\nprinting them out somewhere or\n\n116\n00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.880\nsaving them somewhere where do we mean?\n\n117\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.170\nNormally at this point we're\nprobably just talking about RAM, but\n\n118\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.420\nthese utilities can have it where you\ngo ahead and just print it to a file.\n\n119\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.250\nWhich means to save it into a file and\n\n120\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.240\nthen you can examine the data\na little bit later on.\n\n121\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.190\nSometimes it might print\nit directly to the screen.\n\n122\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.790\nWhen you take a look at it, well then\nyou can actually see the information.\n\n123\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.280\nAnd some of them do it live-time for\nyou, where, as soon as it captures,\n\n124\n00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.300\nit sends it to the screen.\n\n125\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.470\nNow, it also depends on a couple of other\nconfigurations that have to happen.\n\n126\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.400\nBut overall though,\nthat's what a packet-capture utility does.\n\n127\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.610\nIt monitors the NIC for all of the actual\ndata that's forming across the interface.\n\n128\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.380\nSo the thing about any communications\nthat you have that might be going to your\n\n129\n00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.920\nmachine is probably gonna come\nacross that network interface.\n\n130\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.900\nSo things like TCP connections,\nUDP types of connections.\n\n131\n00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.300\nIf you're using Telnet or SSH, or you're\nconnecting to a web server, you're gonna\n\n132\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.420\nbe able to see the conversation that's\nhappening between those two machines.\n\n133\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.390\nAnd that's gonna be very important for us.\n\n134\n00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.490\nNow, the problem that we have is that it\ncan be a tremendous amount of data, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.360\nSo when you start talking about this\nidea of that tremendous amount of data,\n\n136\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.750\nit becomes now,\na little bit more difficult to spot.\n\n137\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.860\nSo there are other utilities out\nthere that are really more of that\n\n138\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.660\npacket sniffing type of\nutility such as TCPDUMP.\n\n139\n00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.410\nLet me show you an example of just a basic\npacket sniffer that's been around forever\n\n140\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.750\nand a day, and one of the nicest utilities\nthat's also been around, which is TCPDUMP.\n\n141\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.280\nSo let's take a look at my machine.\n\n142\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.870\nI can run TCPDUMP.\n\n143\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.711\nLet's see if I have to do anything here.\n\n144\n00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:50.105\nI'll just try it anyways.\n\n145\n00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:51.961\nSudo tcpdump.\n\n146\n00:07:53.876 --> 00:07:56.796\nAnd then I'll do the -S, I think.\n\n147\n00:08:00.263 --> 00:08:02.780\nHopefully, I can type that in correctly.\n\n148\n00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.340\nNow it's gonna begin capturing and\n\n149\n00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.330\nwe start seeing a lot of the data\nthat comes across in this.\n\n150\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.590\nNow this one has some options\nwhich again show you a lot, but\n\n151\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.720\nnotice how fast it's going across.\n\n152\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.250\nAnd I can have this where\nit prints out to a file and\n\n153\n00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.855\nI can examine it a little bit later on,\nbut this is where it really begins, right?\n\n154\n00:08:20.855 --> 00:08:24.550\nIs making sure that we can get as\nmuch as data as we possibly can.\n\n155\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.100\nSo the idea of capturing packets\nis really the foundation\n\n156\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.280\nof what we can do in terms of\nthe beginning of using analysis.\n\n157\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.960\nAnd that's what Wireshark really helps us\nto do, well let me stop this right now.\n\n158\n00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.719\nAnd when I do so, you'll end up seeing\nthat it captured, well, quite a bit here.\n\n159\n00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:44.899\nSo about 1,405 packets,\n5,657 received by the filter,\n\n160\n00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:49.683\n208 packets were ended up dropped, so\nI get a little bit of analysis here.\n\n161\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.786\n&gt;&gt; But overall, though, I really don't\nknow what all this stuff really means\n\n162\n00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:59.284\nat this point without having some\nadditional way to be able to filter it\n\n163\n00:08:59.284 --> 00:09:01.051\ndown to be able to-\n&gt;&gt; Sift through all this information.\n\n164\n00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:01.941\n&gt;&gt; To sift through it.\n\n165\n00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.670\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n&gt;&gt; So it is, it's a ton of data.\n\n166\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:09.630\nAnd once you get it into a file, even\nthen it's gonna take you a long time So\n\n167\n00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.590\nwith TCP dump it gives you\nthe ability even on the fly.\n\n168\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.970\nI said you can add some different options,\nI had the end there using dashes, and\n\n169\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.080\nI, and s, and vv, and\nwhatever else that might be there.\n\n170\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.595\nThat would really help you to limit it but\nat the same time still require some\n\n171\n00:09:25.595 --> 00:09:30.485\ninterpretation and not very easy to spot\nwhen doing something like this as well.\n\n172\n00:09:30.485 --> 00:09:35.830\nAnd that's what I wanted to say when\nit comes down to packet capturing,\n\n173\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.819\nit really is a lot but,\nthat's the foundation that we begin with,\n\n174\n00:09:40.819 --> 00:09:45.718\nonce we have that in mind where\nWireshark also steps it up a notch is\n\n175\n00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:49.930\nthat it also becomes a packet analyzer for\nus.\n\n176\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:54.780\nNow, you can take the term packet in\na couple of different ways, right?\n\n177\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.056\nWhen you break down packet for\na packet analysis of some sort,\n\n178\n00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:02.277\nyou can take the official terms, and\nwhen you start talking about networking,\n\n179\n00:10:02.277 --> 00:10:06.200\nremember that networking when\nwe start sending data, right?\n\n180\n00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.033\nChunks of data that we can begin to say,\nhey,\n\n181\n00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:10.655\ncan we transport our network begins\nwith what we call a segment?\n\n182\n00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:13.128\nAnd that's that layer four\nof the OSI model, and\n\n183\n00:10:13.128 --> 00:10:16.685\nthen that layer three is a packet,\nand then that layer two is a frame and\n\n184\n00:10:16.685 --> 00:10:18.880\nthat's what we end up putting on the wire.\n\n185\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.633\n&gt;&gt; Sure, higher protocol data units.\n\n186\n00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:24.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, PD,\ngood job there I forgot all about that.\n\n187\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:29.980\nSo this idea but, what we're normally\ntalking about is even though it can do\n\n188\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:35.430\nthat, the whole goal is, the idea of\nthat encapsulation of sorts, right?\n\n189\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.347\nSo, a packet analyzer, which is what\nWireshark also does, is it now can take\n\n190\n00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:44.860\nthe combined information that we\nlearned from the sniffer, right?\n\n191\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:51.280\nAll tha data and now put it into chunks\nand data that you and I do understand,\n\n192\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.410\nsuch as O segments, packets, and\nof course, also frames, and we can\n\n193\n00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:03.170\neven dive into each one of those elements\nand get a little bit more information out.\n\n194\n00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.670\nWhen you just take a regular\npacket sniffer, right?\n\n195\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.120\nIt dumps all of it for us and I get\na representation of what it says, well,\n\n196\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.180\nhere's really just a summary\nof what all that stuff is, but\n\n197\n00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.500\nthe packet analysis part, right?\n\n198\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.860\nThe packet analyzer part\nis really where an ads and\n\n199\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.580\nwe called dissectors to really put\nit all into a small, manageable and\n\n200\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.625\neven human readable chunks for\nus together.\n\n201\n00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:30.960\nSo that then once we have that, we can now\nbreak it down and have it show as those\n\n202\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.634\nsimple much more individualistic parts,\nand we can even see some of those elements\n\n203\n00:11:35.634 --> 00:11:38.998\ninside of that which we are gonna\nsee throughout this show.\n\n204\n00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:42.781\nBut at the beginning here, that's what\nwe want to make sure of is that we\n\n205\n00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:45.116\nunderstand, at least in the overall idea,\n\n206\n00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:49.080\nwhy we would choose something\nlike a Wireshark over tcpdump.\n\n207\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.620\nIs because it gives us both,\n\n208\n00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.760\nit gives us the ability to capture\nthose packets, gives us the ability to\n\n209\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.680\nkind of put all the data into something\nthat's a meaningful form for us.\n\n210\n00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.960\nAnd that's what we want to\nmake sure we understand.\n\n211\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.910\n&gt;&gt; It really can draw things together and\ngive that meaning,\n\n212\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.660\nbecause when you have\nbeen studying networking,\n\n213\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.920\na lot of these concepts are really\nintangible or theoretical.\n\n214\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.304\nSo when we use a tool like Wireshark,\nand you can see those PDUs,\n\n215\n00:12:15.304 --> 00:12:19.882\nthose protocol data units, and different\nprotocols operating at different levels of\n\n216\n00:12:19.882 --> 00:12:24.351\nthe OSI model, and you're seeing the TCP\nhandshake, and things like that happen.\n\n217\n00:12:24.351 --> 00:12:28.689\nIt really starts to just adhere and\nsolidify these concepts that you might be\n\n218\n00:12:28.689 --> 00:12:33.045\nhaving problems with understanding\nat least, for me, it's pretty cool.\n\n219\n00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:37.350\nYou look at that, and we were just joking\nabout PDUs, but are talking about it.\n\n220\n00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.050\nRonnie, there's a little mnemonic\nthat can help us remember that,\n\n221\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.320\nhave you ever heard of it?\n\n222\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:41.820\n&gt;&gt; No, I have not.\n\n223\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.720\nWhat is it?\n\n224\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.960\n&gt;&gt; Some people fear birthdays.\n\n225\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.110\n&gt;&gt; Some people fear birthdays, all right.\n\n226\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.660\n&gt;&gt; Starting at four, going down.\n\n227\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n228\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.540\nSo segment is some, I'm assuming.\n\n229\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then P for people.\n\n230\n00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.000\n&gt;&gt; Packet, yup.\n\n231\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.970\n&gt;&gt; Or packets.\n\n232\n00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.552\nAnd then the other one would be frames.\n\n233\n00:12:58.552 --> 00:13:00.790\n&gt;&gt; And then-\n&gt;&gt; Binary or bits.\n\n234\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.315\n&gt;&gt; Yep, bits, yeah.\n\n235\n00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:04.460\n&gt;&gt; And so the d, everything from\nthere on up would just be the data.\n\n236\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.010\nBut I guess, you'd have to add some d word\nto your pneumonic to help you with that\n\n237\n00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.080\npart, the top three.\n\n238\n00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, but yeah,\nthat's really good to think about, so\n\n239\n00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.020\nnow that we have Wireshark, right?\n\n240\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.450\nWhen we combine both a packet sniffer and\na packet analyzer together,\n\n241\n00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.310\nthat is what now we call\na protocol analyzer, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.400\nSo the combination of both,\n\n243\n00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.170\nright, gives us the ability to now\nactually have what we call protocols\n\n244\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:36.050\nthat they're now broken up into, we can\nsee things like TCP and UDP packets.\n\n245\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:40.350\nWe can start seeing,\nnot just at the breakdown of it,\n\n246\n00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.900\nnot just blips and signals here, but\nsomething actually meaningful for us.\n\n247\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.400\nNow the reason why is\nbecause now we can use\n\n248\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.385\nthe power of Wireshark to string together\nthose elements that are common and\n\n249\n00:13:52.385 --> 00:13:54.890\nWireshark helps us to\nbe able to see those.\n\n250\n00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.460\nFor example,\nif you're looking at DNS traffic, it'll,\n\n251\n00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.780\nas a protocol analyzer, hey, DNS traffic\nlet's go and color those to blue,\n\n252\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.750\nyou might go, why do I care about that?\n\n253\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.820\nBecause it helps you to separate that out.\n\n254\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.310\nAnd HTTP traffic is green, so these\nare default things that you can change.\n\n255\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.350\nBut overall, though, you have\nthe ability to be able to find that out.\n\n256\n00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.700\nAnd that's where the protocol analyzer\nreally does make its strengths, instead of\n\n257\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.860\nyou having to go, yeah, this belongs with,\nI think it belongs with this here.\n\n258\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.230\nIt just highlights it and\nmake it easier for you to sport that, and\n\n259\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.390\nthe reason whether we need that, right?\n\n260\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.215\nIs because most of the time if you\nthink about them, when we're trying to\n\n261\n00:14:36.215 --> 00:14:39.990\ntroubleshoot something, when we are trying\nto identify a certain type of traffic or\n\n262\n00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.280\ntrying to figure out\nan issue that's going on.\n\n263\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.019\nWell, all the data is fine, but then once\nwe get all the data, it's now looking for\n\n264\n00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:49.648\nthe needle in the hay stack.\n\n265\n00:14:49.648 --> 00:14:52.396\nThe protocol analyzer helps\nus to be able to zoom in and\n\n266\n00:14:52.396 --> 00:14:54.180\nfind that much more efficiently.\n\n267\n00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.180\nAnd that's why we would choose to\nuse a tool like this, instead.\n\n268\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.340\nSo it also then puts it out into\na format that's easy to understand.\n\n269\n00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.200\nSo Wireshark is by far the world's\nmost powerful, or popular,\n\n270\n00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.800\nI should say,\ntool that is available to us.\n\n271\n00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.270\nSo much so that if you go to\ntheir website, they tell you that\n\n272\n00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:18.010\nright now they're experiencing\n500,000 downloads a day.\n\n273\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:18.693\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n274\n00:15:18.693 --> 00:15:22.750\n&gt;&gt; That is quite a bid of a download so\nit shows how popular it is.\n\n275\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.410\nAnd what a common, and\nwhat a most awesome utility it is\n\n276\n00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.610\nthat people are having to\ndownload this every single day.\n\n277\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.069\n&gt;&gt; And, Ronnie, this is a free utility.\n\n278\n00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:34.964\nSo just taking advantage of that, you\ncould easily add a new skill set to your\n\n279\n00:15:34.964 --> 00:15:37.717\nresume, if you're out on the job market,\n\n280\n00:15:37.717 --> 00:15:42.385\nbecause it's such a well-known\nproduct that network admins and system\n\n281\n00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:47.464\nadmins are going to be able to spot that\nwhenever you go for the hiring process.\n\n282\n00:15:47.464 --> 00:15:50.543\nAnd if you think about these\nare the same tools alternatively and\n\n283\n00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:53.573\nwe spoke about this before,\nRonnie that attackers are using.\n\n284\n00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:58.146\nBut let's get for\nboth sides of the fence there so.\n\n285\n00:15:58.146 --> 00:15:58.682\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n286\n00:15:58.682 --> 00:16:02.423\nIt's great for analysis tools and that's\nwhere hackers get their tools from their\n\n287\n00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:05.472\nPeople that develop this because\nthey run into an issue and they go,\n\n288\n00:16:05.472 --> 00:16:06.343\nhow do we fix this?\n\n289\n00:16:06.343 --> 00:16:11.090\nWell, Wireshark itself was developed\nby a guy that was experiencing those\n\n290\n00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.700\nissues from the very beginning.\n\n291\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.340\nAs the man works his name is Gerald Combs.\n\n292\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.440\nHe said I need to develop this tool\nthat really helps us to be able to\n\n293\n00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.840\nfind all of this information,\nbut faster and quicker.\n\n294\n00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.770\nBut he developed it as an open source\nproject and now it's become that very,\n\n295\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.850\nvery popular tool for us.\n\n296\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.680\nNow you might be wondering like\nif Wireshark is out there,\n\n297\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.230\nare there any other tools that\nare similar or like this?\n\n298\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.640\nThere are plenty of them out there but\nmost of them don't have the same thing\n\n299\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.780\nthat Wireshark has behind it, which is\na very loyal, loyal open source community.\n\n300\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.320\nDevelopers volunteer time and\nefforts but I'm not gonna say recently,\n\n301\n00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.180\nbut fairly recently, everything's relative\nwhen you start talking about this.\n\n302\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.060\nI'm gonna say in the last five or\nten years Riverbed technologies they're\n\n303\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.470\nthe the ones that have become\nthe official sponsor of Wireshark.\n\n304\n00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:07.100\nReally providing the money to support and\ndo everything that it needs to do.\n\n305\n00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.620\nBut they also allow the community of open\nsource people to really try and help and\n\n306\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.760\ndevelop the coding as well.\n\n307\n00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.440\nIt really is kind of neat and everything\nthat it does in the support of it.\n\n308\n00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.452\nSome of the other tools that you might\nhave heard of that were trying to be along\n\n309\n00:17:22.452 --> 00:17:26.536\nsimilar lines here, would be something\nlike Microsoft's Network Monitor.\n\n310\n00:17:26.536 --> 00:17:28.916\nI think the latest version was 3.4.\n\n311\n00:17:28.916 --> 00:17:31.828\nBut it really is fairly simple and\n\n312\n00:17:31.828 --> 00:17:36.612\nnot as detailed in it's\nusage compared to Wireshark.\n\n313\n00:17:36.612 --> 00:17:40.508\nThat means that it's limited in its\nfunctionality and what it can do.\n\n314\n00:17:40.508 --> 00:17:45.707\nIf you're gonna choose a tool, even though\nif people go yeah use Network Monitor 3.4,\n\n315\n00:17:45.707 --> 00:17:48.441\nthat's not gonna give you\nthe same advantages or\n\n316\n00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:51.790\nthe same up to dateness\nas Wireshark is today.\n\n317\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:56.580\nNow you wanna go to really extreme\nhigh end, and you go in that\n\n318\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.690\ndirection you can go to those companies\nthat specialize in the stuff like Flute.\n\n319\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:08.220\nThey have their tool, Flute Network\nInspector, that is also a Windows product.\n\n320\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.100\nThey can give you insanely detailed\nwith graphs, charts, everything.\n\n321\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.300\nThey can do everything that you\nwant to as far as the visualization\n\n322\n00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.730\nof everything goes.\n\n323\n00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.160\nBut that's super expensive.\n\n324\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they don't give\ntheir products away for free.\n\n325\n00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not but\nif your network needs it that's one thing.\n\n326\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:33.450\nBut most of the time if you're like me,\nnetwork administration, routers, systems.\n\n327\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.150\nBasic kind of meat and potatoes in\nterms of networking Wireshark's\n\n328\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.720\ngonna give you one of those tools that\nis really gonna be beneficial for\n\n329\n00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.700\nyour entire career, especially when\nit comes down to troubleshooting\n\n330\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.370\nissues that end up happening.\n\n331\n00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:53.120\nAnd so most of us, we don't have to\ngo the thousands of dollars route,\n\n332\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.880\ninstead we can use Wireshark,\nwhich is something that we can\n\n333\n00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.860\nhave on our own machines and\nthat will also help us out too.\n\n334\n00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.400\nAnother advantage of Wireshark\nthat's also available to us,\n\n335\n00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.340\nwhich is really great,\nis that it's not limited by a platform.\n\n336\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.020\nLike the Fluke of Network Inspector,\nyou have to run it on Windows,\n\n337\n00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.370\nand that sounds,\nokay big deal I'm already on Windows.\n\n338\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.870\nBut not every single\nshop is just on Windows.\n\n339\n00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.200\nYou might have an environment\nwhere Linux is more popular.\n\n340\n00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.859\nGod forbid, but even Mac is more popular.\n\n341\n00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:27.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I say that and\n\n342\n00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:30.180\nthat's what we pretty much just about are.\n\n343\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.388\nExcept our traitor over here.\n\n344\n00:19:32.388 --> 00:19:33.957\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n\n345\n00:19:33.957 --> 00:19:34.730\n&gt;&gt; I'm joking, not yet.\n\n346\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.810\nBut she's going there, yup.\n\n347\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:37.850\nYou will have that.\n\n348\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.250\nBut you do have this sense,\nthat it needs to be more diverse.\n\n349\n00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:47.610\nWell for Wireshark, they went ahead and\nthere's not only support for Windows.\n\n350\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.621\nAnother words in you can run it on\nWindows, but you can also run it on Linux.\n\n351\n00:19:50.621 --> 00:19:56.374\nThose two additions were really built\nup from kinda the very beginning,\n\n352\n00:19:56.374 --> 00:20:00.900\nand then because Mac became\nmore popular they even ported\n\n353\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.634\nsomething from Linux over to Mac\nbecause it was a BS max BSD.\n\n354\n00:20:05.634 --> 00:20:09.316\nYou might still see some of those\nremnants around on earlier versions, but\n\n355\n00:20:09.316 --> 00:20:13.115\nnow today at least in the latest version\nyou probably don't even have to worry\n\n356\n00:20:13.115 --> 00:20:14.180\nabout it.\n\n357\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.030\nAnd we'll talk about that\nduring the installation, but\n\n358\n00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:21.210\njust kind of realize that there\nare different options available.\n\n359\n00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.840\nWhether you're running a Mac or\nwhether you're running a Linux machine,\n\n360\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.930\nwhether you're running Windows, Wireshark\nwill actually help us do that, too.\n\n361\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if this piece of\nsoftware is platform independent or\n\n362\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.900\nwell, considering the ones that you just\nspoke of, are there any other system\n\n363\n00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.280\nrequirements or things that I should\nbe aware of before I try to install?\n\n364\n00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, there are a couple of them.\n\n365\n00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.090\nOverall though, the great thing is it\ndoesn't actually have any gigantic\n\n366\n00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.120\nsystem requirements for\nthe machines to run.\n\n367\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.560\nIt's a relatively small piece of software,\nand\n\n368\n00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.670\nit doesn't need a gigantic CPU or\na ton of RAM.\n\n369\n00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.450\nBut it does need some.\n\n370\n00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.920\nBut there's no real hardware\nrequirements for making it run and\n\n371\n00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.570\nin today's networks it probably\ndoesn't really require much at all.\n\n372\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.050\nIt used to be where a software like\nthis might have actually said,\n\n373\n00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:16.650\nyou need to 256 megs of RAM,\nand 15 megabytes of free space.\n\n374\n00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.940\nMost machines handle that fairly well.\n\n375\n00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.160\nBut Wireshark the real requirement here\n\n376\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.160\ncomes down to of course\nthe physical NIC itself.\n\n377\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.280\nThe great thing is most of the NIC on\ncomputers today will allow you to operate\n\n378\n00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.160\nin a mode that will be beneficial if\nyou're going to be using Wireshark,\n\n379\n00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.527\nwhich is what we call\npromiscuous mode is the key.\n\n380\n00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:41.151\nThe NIC has to support what\nare called promiscuous mode.\n\n381\n00:21:41.151 --> 00:21:41.838\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n382\n00:21:41.838 --> 00:21:44.940\n&gt;&gt; Now if you don't know what that means,\nthat's kinda the problem here.\n\n383\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.860\nLet's kind of imagine a little bit of\nnetwork traffic here as it comes into\n\n384\n00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.200\nmy machine.\n\n385\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.430\nWell if my machine gets\ninformation that's destined for\n\n386\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.170\nCherokee's machine by accident, it\nshouldn't happen, but let's say it does.\n\n387\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.260\nLet's say it's something like that.\n\n388\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.870\nWell, essentially my NIC just goes,\nI'm not even gonna worry about it.\n\n389\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.290\nI'm just gonna drop that traffic,\ncuz it's not destined for me.\n\n390\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.270\nWell that means that the NIC itself\njust says, I'm not looking for it.\n\n391\n00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.670\n&gt;&gt; You lost it.\n&gt;&gt; I don't care about it, yeah,\n\n392\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.880\nwe'll just drop it, no big deal.\n\n393\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.870\nPromiscuous mode allows us instead to say\nlet's just go ahead and make a, if we want\n\n394\n00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:26.670\nto we can even see that data and be able\nto make a capture of it if we choose to.\n\n395\n00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.950\nTo go ahead and do so.\n\n396\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:34.390\nI can then put my machine in a situation\nwhere if I'm running Wireshark on\n\n397\n00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:41.140\nmy machine, I can capture more data than\nthat has just destined for my own machine.\n\n398\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.980\nBut your NICs have to\nsupport in promiscuous mode.\n\n399\n00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.920\n&gt;&gt; And that's kind of something\nlike we were talking about.\n\n400\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.230\nWe, before this show Ronnie, when we were\nlooking at those alpha cards on Amazon and\n\n401\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:55.380\nif you think about it how many\ncompanies or individuals use wireless?\n\n402\n00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.560\nAnd we have like all these signals\nfloating around our heads and\n\n403\n00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.900\nit's crazy popular now.\n\n404\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.150\nThe chances of being able to\ncapture some of those management\n\n405\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.880\nframes that are sent in plain text and\nthen we can go ahead and craft.\n\n406\n00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.886\nAnd that's where you hear\nterms like injection and\n\n407\n00:23:09.886 --> 00:23:11.500\nmanipulation and things like that,\n\n408\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.250\nbut that's essentially what we're doing\nhere when we run in that promiscuous mode.\n\n409\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.130\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n410\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.446\nAnd that's actually another neat feature\nsince you mentioned the idea of wireless.\n\n411\n00:23:19.446 --> 00:23:24.879\nIs that early types of devices like this,\nthese they might have allow\n\n412\n00:23:24.879 --> 00:23:30.748\nyou to only capture based on the physical\nNIC itself in terms of a wired connection.\n\n413\n00:23:30.748 --> 00:23:33.554\nBut Wireshark doesn't care one way or\n\n414\n00:23:33.554 --> 00:23:39.349\nanother as long as you're wireless NIC\nhas the ability also to send that data.\n\n415\n00:23:39.349 --> 00:23:43.240\nWe've also ended up looking at not only\nthe alpha cards a little bit before\n\n416\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.507\nthe show but Wireshark's parent kind of\nsponsor, they produced their own, and\n\n417\n00:23:47.507 --> 00:23:50.352\nwe were looking at it,\nit was pretty expensive here.\n\n418\n00:23:50.352 --> 00:23:54.138\nBut they have a called an Air P Cap Card,\nand it's exactly like it sounds.\n\n419\n00:23:54.138 --> 00:23:56.378\nI mean, it's wireless or air.\n\n420\n00:23:56.378 --> 00:23:58.109\nPcap means packet capture,\n\n421\n00:23:58.109 --> 00:24:02.227\na network adapter that they can allow\nyou to plug in through the USB.\n\n422\n00:24:02.227 --> 00:24:03.830\nAnd that was several hundred dollars.\n\n423\n00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:04.970\n&gt;&gt; Almost 700.\n\n424\n00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.090\n&gt;&gt; More than likely,\nit's probably worth it, okay?\n\n425\n00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.920\nWhen it comes down to what we normally\nneed to do on the network, it's either, we\n\n426\n00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.910\ntry and just work off of our own wireless,\nand hope that we capture everything.\n\n427\n00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.980\nOr we actually have this special dedicated\ndevice that's designed to do it which,\n\n428\n00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.160\nif you're in this realm of\nbeing a network analyst,\n\n429\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.320\nit may be worth every single dime.\n\n430\n00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.840\nI'm not gonna say it's not worth it at\nall, but whether you're talking about\n\n431\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.350\nthe alpha one or whether you're talking\nabout something like this, it's probably\n\n432\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.090\nworth every single penny if this is what\nyou're gonna be doing full time, okay?\n\n433\n00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.780\nSo it really has to do with that idea that\npromiscuous mode more than anything else.\n\n434\n00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.670\nAs you start capturing data,\nif you capture it live, right?\n\n435\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:49.550\nThe only real requirement is to understand\nthat if you just leave it on 24\n\n436\n00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:55.270\nhours a day, there is gonna come a point\nwhere you may run out of hard drive space.\n\n437\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.740\nIn theory it shouldn't happen,\n\n438\n00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.250\nespecially with as big as a hard\ndrives are today, but you never know.\n\n439\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.880\nBecause it is, it's making a copy of every\nsingle thing that's hitting your nick, and\n\n440\n00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.520\nsending it into a file,\nwhich is gonna fill up on your hard drive.\n\n441\n00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.460\nOr if you're trying to send\nit just in Wireshark and\n\n442\n00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.930\nyou've got it running in the background,\n\n443\n00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.210\nit's gonna send it to your display which\nmeans it's gotta keep it all in RAM.\n\n444\n00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.080\nMore than likely, you're gonna run\nout of RAM at some point in time.\n\n445\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.480\nEither way it's gonna end\nup stopping the capture.\n\n446\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.310\nOverall, though, you just have to\nthink about some of these things.\n\n447\n00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:31.243\nBut the great thing is, if you are really\ninterested then, in at least getting\n\n448\n00:25:31.243 --> 00:25:35.452\nthe nature of beginning through\nunderstand how to use Wireshark.\n\n449\n00:25:35.452 --> 00:25:39.711\nYou're in a great place, cuz that's what\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna show you\n\n450\n00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:43.044\nkind of the very basics of getting\nstarted and using Wireshark,\n\n451\n00:25:43.044 --> 00:25:47.980\nas well as the utilities that, they're\nreally, filters are kind of the key thing.\n\n452\n00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.490\nBut then we're gonna actually get into\na little bit of deeper things as well,\n\n453\n00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.730\ntalk about where they're actually used,\nmaybe in some case scenarios instead.\n\n454\n00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.020\nAnd see where that leads us in the future.\n\n455\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.690\nSo the great thing is, this is where\nwe're gonna start off as right here, and\n\n456\n00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.920\nwe're gonna take a look at installing.\n\n457\n00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.900\nBut at this point I think I've actually\nran out of time by continuing the talk so\n\n458\n00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.460\nthis is a good point for\nus to kind of stop.\n\n459\n00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.095\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, I mean we were\ntalking about a lot of exciting stuff,\n\n460\n00:26:13.095 --> 00:26:16.166\nWireshark is the coolest utility and\nthat's a great introduction, Ronnie.\n\n461\n00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:19.915\nSo thank you so much for that, but we do\nhave a lot more information to cover.\n\n462\n00:26:19.915 --> 00:26:22.398\nI can't wait to see where to get it,\nhow to install it, and\n\n463\n00:26:22.398 --> 00:26:23.476\nhow to use this utility.\n\n464\n00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:27.183\nSo thank you so much for joining us today,\nand thank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n465\n00:26:27.183 --> 00:26:30.690\njoining as well, but stay tuned,\nwe have more Wireshark headed your way.\n\n466\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.700\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n467\n00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.280\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n468\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

00:00:08.139\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.013\nYou're watching ITProTv.\n\n5\n00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:13.948\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Wireshark series.\n\n6\n00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:16.221\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:20.219\nIn the previous episode, Ronnie and\nI spoke about what Wireshark is and\n\n8\n00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.163\ngive you a little bit of a history.\n\n9\n00:00:22.163 --> 00:00:25.269\nIn this show, we'll really be\nlooking at where to install and\n\n10\n00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.193\nhow to install the piece of software.\n\n11\n00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:30.014\nWith us today,\nwe have Mr Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n12\n00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:31.318\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:32.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.757\nAs we continue on learning a little\nbit more about Wireshark and\n\n15\n00:00:35.757 --> 00:00:37.767\nthe latest edition that's out there.\n\n16\n00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.448\nWhat we want to do, of course,\n\n17\n00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:43.220\nin this episode is to make sure that\nyou can get it on to your machines.\n\n18\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.159\nIt's nice to know that of course\nit can do everything, but\n\n19\n00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.239\nsometimes the install is not the most\nchallenging part, but it is something that\n\n20\n00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.259\nwe want to make sure that everybody knows\nwhere to get Wireshark from as well as to\n\n21\n00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:57.211\nmake sure that we walk through\nthe installation process.\n\n22\n00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:00.027\nThere's a couple of things that\nyou may not be familiar with,\n\n23\n00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.493\nif this is your first time running in\nwhether or not you should install it, so\n\n24\n00:01:03.493 --> 00:01:05.793\nwe want to make sure that\nyou understand that too.\n\n25\n00:01:05.793 --> 00:01:09.964\nWe're gonna take a look at installing\nWireshark on all three of the different\n\n26\n00:01:09.964 --> 00:01:12.225\nplatforms that it actually can support.\n\n27\n00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:15.710\nWe're gonna take a look at\ninstalling inside of Windows,\n\n28\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.348\nwe're gonna also take a look at\nit installing inside Mac OS.\n\n29\n00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:22.730\nI'm running El Capitan,\nwe'll make sure you get it there.\n\n30\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.636\nAnd then we'll take a look at installing\nit inside of a Linux distro as well.\n\n31\n00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:30.704\nSuch as DBM, because that's the one I have\nrunning on my computer at the same time.\n\n32\n00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:36.210\nSo we'll take a look at all three, try to\ngive you that idea of putting it there.\n\n33\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.900\nReally, as far as the difficulty,\nnot super difficult at all.\n\n34\n00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.960\nBut you wanna pay attention\nis kind of the key here.\n\n35\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.630\nAnd don't take it flippantly.\n\n36\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.360\nThere's some times where it's just,\nhe's click, click, click, click, next,\n\n37\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.300\nnext, next, next.\n\n38\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.420\nAnd that'll probably work just fine, but\n\n39\n00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.880\nmake sure you understand\nwhat you're installing.\n\n40\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.390\nSometimes if you don't realize it,\n\n41\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.570\nespecially in the Linux of it, you may\ngo all right, I'm gonna install this.\n\n42\n00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.700\nAnd then I turn my computer\nover to Cherokee or\n\n43\n00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.770\nshe logs in and it doesn't give\nher the ability to run Wireshark.\n\n44\n00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.220\nThat's when we have to worry\nabout it a little bit more.\n\n45\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.260\nSo we'll talk about at least that\nelement too, that we have to get by.\n\n46\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, you mentioned a couple\nof different operating systems,\n\n47\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.600\nwhich one are we going\nto be looking at first?\n\n48\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.120\n&gt;&gt; Of course natively, it was designed for\nWindows, so that's kind of the first one\n\n49\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.020\nthat we wanna make sure that when we start\ninstalling that we know how to do this.\n\n50\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.210\nMost of us understand\nhow to install software.\n\n51\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.370\nSo I know this seems\nlike baby steps to you.\n\n52\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.440\nJust bear with use and make sure that\nwe kind of go through the process and\n\n53\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.000\nunderstand where we will go.\n\n54\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.510\nNow as far as obtaining Wireshark.\n\n55\n00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.300\nYou can get it in many different places,\nokay?\n\n56\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.480\nSo let me give you a for instance.\n\n57\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.380\nI use a network simulator or\nan emulator, I should say.\n\n58\n00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.028\nThat is called GNS3.\n\n59\n00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:53.062\nThis is a router simulator, so\nI can build very small networks,\n\n60\n00:02:53.062 --> 00:02:57.917\ncuz limitation to my machine allows me to\ndo what I want to be able to do to verify\n\n61\n00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:01.532\nthat Cisco routers are running\nthe way that they should.\n\n62\n00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:05.006\nOr if I need to verify configurations, I\ncan do that without having to actually go\n\n63\n00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:08.900\nand find a router and spinning it up and\nmaking sure everything is operating.\n\n64\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.010\nBut even in GNS3 today,\n\n65\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.300\nit gives me the ability to\ninstall it along with Wireshark.\n\n66\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.030\nSo that way,\n\n67\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.100\nI can even show the capture between\ntwo of my virtual routers the ability\n\n68\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.720\nto actually have Wireshark capture\nthe data that goes in between them.\n\n69\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.900\nSo there are times where you don't\ngo directly to Wireshark's website\n\n70\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.250\nto be able to have to download it and\nthen try and\n\n71\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.880\nfigure out how is it going to\nintegrate in with my software.\n\n72\n00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.410\nSo don't mistake that.\n\n73\n00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.550\nDon't think that every single time\nthat you do this you have to get it\n\n74\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.800\nas a separate package.\n\n75\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.340\nYou can.\n\n76\n00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.840\nThat's what we're going to be\ndoing in terms of our install.\n\n77\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.980\nBut you may end up finding out that it\nis integrated into programs that you're\n\n78\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.720\nrunning as well.\n\n79\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.064\nCase, also has another system that they\nalso have, that's also integrated into.\n\n80\n00:03:58.064 --> 00:04:03.197\nSo you name it, there's several pieces\nof software out there that may integrate\n\n81\n00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:08.342\nWireshark directly into everything that\nis actually put together with, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:12.378\nSo that way they don't have to worry about\nit too much, without you having to go\n\n83\n00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:15.942\nagain, click on it, and then figure\nout how to make it run together.\n\n84\n00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:18.144\nSo you can get it for free that way.\n\n85\n00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:21.872\nThere are sometimes where\nyou may see somebody say,\n\n86\n00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:25.500\nhere's our network analyzer utility.\n\n87\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.210\nAnd it really is just kind\nof a front-end shell and\n\n88\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.190\nthen they have Wireshark\nin the background.\n\n89\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.230\nSo somebody could make you pay for it.\n\n90\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.930\nNot necessarily, it shouldn't be, but\nthere are people that may make you pay for\n\n91\n00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.490\nit as well if they put\ntheir own twist on it too.\n\n92\n00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.350\nSo just kind of realize that because\nopen source people can develop it and\n\n93\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.300\npull it into their product too.\n\n94\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.510\nSo you can get it in many different ways,\nbut the easiest way if you're not sure and\n\n95\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.300\nyou're just trying to learn\nabout Wireshark at this point,\n\n96\n00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.430\ninstalling it direct, or downloading it,\nexcuse me, from their website.\n\n97\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.540\nThat's probably the easiest\nthing that they've done.\n\n98\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.580\nLet's show you what we're talking about.\n\n99\n00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.860\nAnd I'm gonna go to my Windows machine,\nif I can find it.\n\n100\n00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.640\nThere we go.\n\n101\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.450\nOkay, so here on my Windows machine,\nI went ahead and downloaded it,\n\n102\n00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.110\nto make it easier.\n\n103\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.694\nSometimes, because they're experiencing\nlike 500,000 downloads per day,\n\n104\n00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:17.285\nIt doesn't matter how small it is,\nit can take a little bit of time.\n\n105\n00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:20.300\n&gt;&gt; And the URL for the Rodney,\nis that just Wireshark.org?\n\n106\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.940\n&gt;&gt; It really is, so\nI went ahead and typed it in.\n\n107\n00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.595\n&gt;&gt; Look at you.\n\n108\n00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:24.300\n&gt;&gt; Wireshark.org.\n\n109\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.510\nYes.\n\n110\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.502\nAnd from that point, of course,\nit will bring you to their Wireshark page.\n\n111\n00:05:28.502 --> 00:05:30.510\nNow, Wireshark has an incredible,\n\n112\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.520\ndedicated community, people that\nsupport this thing, that love it.\n\n113\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.850\nThey even have something\nthey call SharkFest.\n\n114\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.970\nSo if you want to actually find how\nto use Wireshark to the nth degree,\n\n115\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.440\nSharkFest is probably the way to go, okay?\n\n116\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.500\nIf you wanted to do that.\n\n117\n00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.200\nAnd this time it looks like it's,\nSharkFest Europe instead.\n\n118\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.540\nSo you have a lot of options there.\n\n119\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.590\nMaybe you're planning\nyour European vacation-\n\n120\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know, what do you think?\n\n121\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.029\nIT Pro TV will send us to Europe?\n\n122\n00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.269\n&gt;&gt; I don't mind asking.\n\n123\n00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:02.374\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think I'll try and do that and\n\n124\n00:06:02.374 --> 00:06:03.622\nsee what happens there.\n\n125\n00:06:03.622 --> 00:06:06.933\nBut at least at this point,\nright, there it is, Wire Shark.\n\n126\n00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:11.529\nNow you can see where this, everybody\ndesigns web pages for something different,\n\n127\n00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.430\nbut they know something\nright away about wire shot.\n\n128\n00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.940\nWhat most people want is what, look this,\n\n129\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.834\nyou want to talk about a big you can't\nmiss button for downloading, I don't know.\n\n130\n00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:23.813\n&gt;&gt; I even like the other button\nnext to it, look at it, learn.\n\n131\n00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:27.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Learn, Go Beyond,\nyou name it they have more, right?\n\n132\n00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:32.410\nSo here, you can see this is their kind of\nsponsor company that Riverbed technology\n\n133\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.560\nthat I mentioned in\nan earlier episode here.\n\n134\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.255\nAnd they do, they have gigantic, just\ngreat technology that they've integrated\n\n135\n00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:44.470\nin, along with Wireshark to make\neverything work the way that they want to.\n\n136\n00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.228\nBut the download is kind of the key\nthat we have in place here,\n\n137\n00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:49.936\nokay, is what we wanna do.\n\n138\n00:06:49.936 --> 00:06:52.560\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwe got a question here in the chat.\n\n139\n00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.410\nAnd it says, if Wireshark and\n\n140\n00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.110\nGNS3 are installed independently,\ncan you still capture packets in GNS3?\n\n141\n00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.190\nIt's been a long time\nsince they've used that.\n\n142\n00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.660\nAnd I know you had mentioned it,\nbut I don't know.\n\n143\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you still can.\n\n144\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.860\nSo it will still do a separate install,\nand you can still face it that way.\n\n145\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.700\nBut when you launched GNS3, you'll still\nbe able to right-click on a link and\n\n146\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.410\ntell it that you want to capture\nthat link when you build your GNS3.\n\n147\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.120\nSo, but when you do that, right?\n\n148\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.400\nToday GNS3, it's kind of updated at least\nto version one point whatever it is now.\n\n149\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.160\nIt may be at two for all I know.\n\n150\n00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.380\nBut yes, you are still gonna be using\nWireshark on a regular basis there.\n\n151\n00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.440\nSo let's go back down to\nour download here, and\n\n152\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.510\nmake sure that everything is right, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.437\nThey've also done something\ngreat with their website, too.\n\n154\n00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:43.254\nSo just like when sometimes you have\nto go and choose which one you want,\n\n155\n00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:47.751\nif I click on this download,\nsince I'm inside a Windows machine,\n\n156\n00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:52.730\nnotice it automatically brings me to\nthe download list and it just gives me\n\n157\n00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.346\na little hint about which one I\nprobably want to install if I do this.\n\n158\n00:07:57.346 --> 00:08:02.246\nNow notice there is a difference\nbetween a 64 bit and 32 bit installer.\n\n159\n00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:05.701\nThis is the one they recommend by default,\nwhich is the 32-bit.\n\n160\n00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:09.692\nI downloaded the 64-bit already, so that's\nwhat I'm not gonna worry about doing.\n\n161\n00:08:09.692 --> 00:08:12.240\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And you can see that the latest\n\n162\n00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.393\nStable Release here,\nat least updated as of January 23, 2017.\n\n163\n00:08:17.393 --> 00:08:22.090\nSo that's a few weeks back from\nthe recording of this show, for right now.\n\n164\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.059\nBut all role though it gives you\na hint about which one if you\n\n165\n00:08:26.059 --> 00:08:29.720\nare not sure which one to do,\nit says do this.\n\n166\n00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.716\nSo if you are not sure whether you are on\n32-bit machine or 64-bit, go with the 32,\n\n167\n00:08:34.716 --> 00:08:36.050\nthat is what they mean.\n\n168\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.920\nBut if you know you are on a 64-bit,\ndownload that one if you want to.\n\n169\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.740\nSo what you downloaded.\n\n170\n00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.470\nRemember that,\ndepending on the busyness of the say,\n\n171\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:51.010\neven though this is a relatively\nsmall download, it can take a little\n\n172\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.100\nbit of time because they don't have\na ton of bandwidth that they can do.\n\n173\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.479\nBut let me see here what,\n\n174\n00:08:56.479 --> 00:08:59.850\nwhat the size of the download\nactually turned out to be here.\n\n175\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.620\nSo this one was just right about 47 megs.\n\n176\n00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:09.440\nSo it's not huge, but it is something\nthat, that you have to think about.\n\n177\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.760\nIf it's really slow, just let it\nkind of take its time to do it.\n\n178\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.620\nSo that's why I went ahead\nbefore the show and I said,\n\n179\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.610\nlet me download this before\nit gets really busy here.\n\n180\n00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Look at this,\ntime management skills, right?\n\n181\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.815\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah, and\nif I was in New Zealand,\n\n182\n00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:22.520\nit would only be 4:30 in the morning.\n\n183\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.928\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you might not think\n\n184\n00:09:23.928 --> 00:09:27.210\nit would be that busy but\noverall, though, we do have that.\n\n185\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.670\nSo with the download in place.\n\n186\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.700\nAll we have to do now is\nsimply follow it through.\n\n187\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.450\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n188\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.490\ntake a look at following through\non the installation process.\n\n189\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.568\nAnd it's not very difficult.\n\n190\n00:09:37.568 --> 00:09:40.390\nI'm gonna right-click and\nrun this as administrator.\n\n191\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.750\nNow you don't have to because it\nalready has that little symbol on it.\n\n192\n00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.692\nYou can see it has that shield that says,\nhey, this is UAC protected essentially,\n\n193\n00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:50.970\nsaying are you sure?\n\n194\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.415\nBecause we're gonna make monumental\nchanges to the system in the background\n\n195\n00:09:54.415 --> 00:09:56.410\nmake sure that this comes up.\n\n196\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.330\nVerify that this is the proper version.\n\n197\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.090\nIf you install it and it doesn't work,\n\n198\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.758\ncheck your machine make sure you're\nrunning the proper OS version.\n\n199\n00:10:05.758 --> 00:10:10.790\nIf I right-click on my Windows, I go\nup to System here, what I'm looking for\n\n200\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:16.074\nis right smack dab here in the middle\nwhere it says 64-bit operating system,\n\n201\n00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:20.740\n64-bit processor there and\nI know that everything is good.\n\n202\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.260\nNow, will a 32-bit work?\n\n203\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:22.840\nYes.\n\n204\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.320\nOkay, but remember that the 64-bit\ninstaller won't work if you're only\n\n205\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.650\nrunning a 32-bit in addition of Windows.\n\n206\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.180\nSo that will not work for you, but this\nway, we'll actually work the other way.\n\n207\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.460\nSo here, we're going to Run\nthrough a fairly common installer.\n\n208\n00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.340\nI'm going to click Next.\n\n209\n00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.500\nAnd of course, make sure,\nI know that this sounds funny, but\n\n210\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:49.110\ndo read through your particular\nend user licensing agreement.\n\n211\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.674\nWe joke about it at times, but the very\nfact is, you do need to pay attention\n\n212\n00:10:53.674 --> 00:10:57.090\nto this as you continue to\nmove throughout your career.\n\n213\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.065\nI would say that I read\nevery single word of this,\n\n214\n00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:01.040\nbut I'd be lying to you if I do that.\n\n215\n00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.615\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But yes.\n\n216\n00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:03.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Please make sure you go back through\n\n217\n00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.240\nhere and understand that what they're\ntelling you is you can use this, okay.\n\n218\n00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.616\nBut in the end,\ndon't sue us is something happens,\n\n219\n00:11:09.616 --> 00:11:11.240\n[LAUGH] is what they're telling us.\n\n220\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.660\n&gt;&gt; The last word I see is damage [LAUGH].\n\n221\n00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.050\n&gt;&gt; Yep, is way out there, yep.\n\n222\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.690\nSo, now here's where you can also\nchange some of the different things\n\n223\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.360\nare available to you as well.\n\n224\n00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.150\nWireshark, of course,\nis a main application that we need.\n\n225\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.090\nBut there is even a text based version,\nokay, of the protocol analyzer.\n\n226\n00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.650\nSo if I select TShark here,\nnotice I'm trying to hover.\n\n227\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.856\nBut if you go down to\nthe description part,\n\n228\n00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:39.430\nit says text based network\nprotocol analyzer.\n\n229\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.660\nNow, what the heck is that about?\n\n230\n00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.846\nWell even though you and I are actually\ngoing to look at it as far as\n\n231\n00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:48.570\nthe capturing, and pretty utility that\nit is, it doesn't need all of it.\n\n232\n00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.770\nIt really can operate just on\nregular text basis if we want it to.\n\n233\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.395\n&gt;&gt; Well you just showed us tcpdump,\nthat was a command line interface,\n\n234\n00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:55.770\nin the previous episode.\n\n235\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I mean, it really doesn't.\n\n236\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.850\nSo it doesn't really need all the fancy\nstuff in the background if we\n\n237\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.620\njust wanted to do that, as well.\n\n238\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:09.950\nThere's the classic user interface, versus\nthe main new user interface as well.\n\n239\n00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.930\nPlugin and Extensions, as much as\nyou do not think that these help,\n\n240\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:18.700\nthis is about the main engine of WireShark\nand how it does it's job and duty.\n\n241\n00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.720\nSo here, right, as information passes\nup through the capture utilities\n\n242\n00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.280\nit ends up dumping it\ninto the core engine.\n\n243\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.260\nThe core engine is where we can\napply Plugins and Extensions.\n\n244\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.840\nAnd the Dissector Plugins, all this stuff,\nis really what helps us to separate out\n\n245\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.570\nthe traffic and put it into\ncategories that we can recognize too.\n\n246\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.790\nFrom there, of course, there are\nadditional tools that you have available.\n\n247\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.020\nSome of these I'm not gonna actually\nadd in because well Androiddump\n\n248\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.720\nis probably not something\nI want on Windows.\n\n249\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.090\nAnd then there's User's Guide,\n\n250\n00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.920\nall that can be helpful\nespecially if you're new to this.\n\n251\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.390\nSo usually for most of us we'll leave\nit at default install, click Next.\n\n252\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.290\nFrom this point this is all about how\nyou want to interface with it, right?\n\n253\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.660\nDo I want to create another\nWireshark desktop icon?\n\n254\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.415\nNotice I can do that.\n\n255\n00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:13.067\nIt's kind of funny that,\nby default, they don't want you,\n\n256\n00:13:13.067 --> 00:13:14.700\nthey don't do this anymore, right?\n\n257\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.300\nAt one time in Windows,\neverything created a desktop.\n\n258\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.200\n&gt;&gt; It was forcing you, exactly.\n\n259\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you kind of, or it would just\nturn on and you could turn it off.\n\n260\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.780\nBut now it's just saying,\n\n261\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.310\ndesktop icons are kind of passe\nat this particular point in time.\n\n262\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.630\nI say that, and there's say,\neverybody that's watching,\n\n263\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.480\nthey look at their desktop and\nyou've got 100 icons.\n\n264\n00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.520\nI'm not trying to say that there's\nsomething wrong with that.\n\n265\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.840\nBut you can see where they're saying,\nyeah,\n\n266\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.390\nI don't wanna add to the clutter is\nwhat they're saying at this point, okay?\n\n267\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:45.500\nAlso on the regular file extensions\nthis is really a good thing, okay?\n\n268\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.310\nThe reason why is that Wireshark\nnot only can interpret data\n\n269\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.750\ndue to the way it captures information.\n\n270\n00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.340\nBut if you have another type of packet\ncapturing software that you have and\n\n271\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.170\neven another type of\nprotocol analyzer software.\n\n272\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.330\nNotice all these different\nextensions that are out here, okay?\n\n273\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.310\nIt will allow you to take\neven their captured data and\n\n274\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.365\nmake it show up in WireShark.\n\n275\n00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.200\nSo this is really good information for\nus that we have.\n\n276\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.810\nClick Next.\n\n277\n00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.250\nFrom this point you can\nchange the location.\n\n278\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.940\nI'm just gonna leave it at\nthe default select Next, and\n\n279\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.710\nthis is where it becomes important if\nyou have never installed this before.\n\n280\n00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.980\nI've installed this for years and\nyears, and I know what this is, right.\n\n281\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.090\nWhen PCAT, this is the packet\ncapturing for Windows, okay.\n\n282\n00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.310\nSo this is one of the main\ncomponents that is monitoring,\n\n283\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.410\nof course your net,\nto do the capture that it needs to.\n\n284\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.860\nAnd it's from that capture that will get\nsent up into the engine of WireShark to\n\n285\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.190\ndo some of the stuff that we need to do,\nthe disectors and everything else.\n\n286\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.710\nSo, if you already have it running,\nit may actually sense and go,\n\n287\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.140\nyou already have this running,\ndo you want to either install this,\n\n288\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.840\nwhich might be an older version, or\ndo you want to run the newer version?\n\n289\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.900\nI always recommend that you try and\nrun the newest version as possible.\n\n290\n00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.030\nBut not everybody does but just kind of\nremember that this is what happens here.\n\n291\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.700\nSo, if you already got it installed it\nwill tell you that and if you say, yes,\n\n292\n00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.470\nlet me install this version again it will\ninstall right on top and you will be fine.\n\n293\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.580\nSecure?\n\n294\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.560\nAnd now here is something\nthat is new inside.\n\n295\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.120\nNow, I don't want to say on 2.24\nbecause I had it on 2.02 version.\n\n296\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.190\nInstall USB packet cap, okay, Pcap.\n\n297\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.710\nUSP is required to capture USB traffic\nshould USBPcap be installed here?\n\n298\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.640\nAnd they say it's experimental.\n\n299\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.100\nWell, this actually depends on whether or\nnot you actually have like a USB NIC.\n\n300\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.670\nWell, guess what?\n\n301\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:46.835\nOn my MacBook Pro right here that\nI'm running there is no build-in\n\n302\n00:15:46.835 --> 00:15:51.539\nneck which means I actually am\nusing a USB type of neck here and\n\n303\n00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:53.958\nallows me to be able to do this.\n\n304\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.271\nNow even though it's experimental\nit worked just fine so\n\n305\n00:15:57.271 --> 00:16:00.177\nI don't have any problems\nin putting that one on.\n\n306\n00:16:00.177 --> 00:16:04.744\nBut, if you're not exactly sure make sure\nyou take a note here, and of course if you\n\n307\n00:16:04.744 --> 00:16:08.480\nwant to take a look at more details\nbehind it you can select that.\n\n308\n00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.440\nI think I've clicked on it\na couple of times here.\n\n309\n00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.470\nAnd it tells you that it runs, this one\nlooks like Open Source USB capture for\n\n310\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:23.890\nWindows, and\nit even supports Windows 8 and XP as well.\n\n311\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.510\nSo it's not the newest utility in the\nworld, but they have added it in for you.\n\n312\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.940\nSo you can learn more about it from there,\nif you choose to.\n\n313\n00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nhopefully you're still not using Vista,\n\n314\n00:16:32.546 --> 00:16:34.508\nthey just ended that extended support for\nit recently, so.\n\n315\n00:16:34.508 --> 00:16:38.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's all right,\nkeep running it, there's no big deal, no-\n\n316\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.929\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If you're part of that, what,\n\n317\n00:16:40.929 --> 00:16:44.560\n8.4% of the market users that\nare still actually running Vista.\n\n318\n00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.240\n&gt;&gt; And you may be for all you know.\n\n319\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So it just really depends there.\n\n320\n00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.180\nNotice that it went through part\nway of the installation, and\n\n321\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.370\nthen it's at this point,\nit wants to add in that Win Peak Cap.\n\n322\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.910\nSo you're running an installer\ninside of an installer here.\n\n323\n00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.140\nGo ahead and click Next, and\n\n324\n00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.350\nmake sure of course that you review\nthe End user licensing agreement.\n\n325\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.080\nAutomatically started it up at that's\nalways a good thing if you know that\n\n326\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.970\nyou're going to be running\nWireshark at any moment's notice.\n\n327\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.820\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and add that in there and\nlet it do what it needs to,\n\n328\n00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.290\nand that will finish up.\n\n329\n00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.318\n&gt;&gt; Is that another EULA?\n\n330\n00:17:18.318 --> 00:17:19.091\n&gt;&gt; It is, there's always another EULA.\n\n331\n00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:22.604\n&gt;&gt; So we actually have a comment\nin the chat, from Robert, and\n\n332\n00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:25.680\nhe says that there's a link there.\n\n333\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.499\nThere was someone,\na company that had put a $1,000 reward for\n\n334\n00:17:29.499 --> 00:17:31.710\nwhomever had read the actual EULA, and\n\n335\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.534\nit was claimed four months after\nthey had released that statement.\n\n336\n00:17:35.534 --> 00:17:36.661\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n337\n00:17:36.661 --> 00:17:38.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you just don't know.\n\n338\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.748\n&gt;&gt; So\nif that's not I don't know what else is.\n\n339\n00:17:40.748 --> 00:17:43.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nsometimes you will see stuff like that.\n\n340\n00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.915\nNow I just had that USBPcap fail on this\ninstallation, and more than likely it's\n\n341\n00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:53.040\ncuz I'm running Windows 10 and\nnot Windows 8 or Vista here.\n\n342\n00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.820\nSo it may not have installed that\nportion at all, for all I know, but\n\n343\n00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.740\nwe'll see here in a moment.\n\n344\n00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.470\nClick Next, and now it says he,\nwhat do you want to do.\n\n345\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.710\nAnd this is the most important part,\nright?\n\n346\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.130\nWe want to reboot this now or\ndo we want to reboot later?\n\n347\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.050\nNow why is that important?\n\n348\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.660\nBecause it is now modifying the network\nadaptor on the computer itself.\n\n349\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.013\nSo it's saying hey I need to make\nsure that it all recognize and\n\n350\n00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:17.896\ndoes everything that I want to do.\n\n351\n00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:21.171\nI'm gonna click Finish and\nallow that to go ahead and\n\n352\n00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:23.860\nreboot for my Windows machine.\n\n353\n00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.340\nNow, while I'm doing that, right?\n\n354\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.340\nWe're not just going to hang here and\njust try and talk it through.\n\n355\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.850\nWe're gonna continue on with\nthe install processes as well\n\n356\n00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.050\nwhich means is we gonna move\non to another machine instead.\n\n357\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.240\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo our Linux install at the same time.\n\n358\n00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.610\nAnd the reason I was gonna do Mac next but\n\n359\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.570\nthat's my physical host machine, these\nare virtual machines that are running.\n\n360\n00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.590\nSo let's move on to this one, and\n\n361\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.130\nthen my host machine will\nalso reboot in the very end.\n\n362\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.510\nSo you see it's not really difficult,\nit does take a little bit of process, and\n\n363\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.320\nmost of us are probably gonna\nclick through, no big deal, but\n\n364\n00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.270\nit does require that reboot.\n\n365\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.720\nNow, here at the very end though, okay,\nwe also have to actually think about this.\n\n366\n00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:12.161\nOn this one Cherokee I don't\nactually have Wireshark pulled up,\n\n367\n00:19:12.161 --> 00:19:16.904\nand even if I did If I\ncan spell WireShark.\n\n368\n00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:25.480\nLet's see here, even like this, so here it\nis saying webpage looks exactly the same.\n\n369\n00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.600\nIf I click on download Cherokee,\n\n370\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.020\ndo you notice something that's actually\nmissing in their stable releases here?\n\n371\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.956\n&gt;&gt; Hmm, let's see, 32 bit,\n64 bit, Mac OS 10.6.\n\n372\n00:19:35.956 --> 00:19:37.026\n&gt;&gt; I'm running Linux DVM.\n\n373\n00:19:37.026 --> 00:19:38.809\n&gt;&gt; Source code, okay.\n\n374\n00:19:38.809 --> 00:19:40.718\n&gt;&gt; The beta.\n&gt;&gt; So I don't see a package for\n\n375\n00:19:40.718 --> 00:19:43.390\nthat, just the raw source code there.\n\n376\n00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, you don't see a package,\nright, you don't see an install, or\n\n377\n00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.795\nyou don't see anything like that.\n\n378\n00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:48.550\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n379\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.280\nSo that means yeah you're not gonna use us\nif you're trying to install on like Linux,\n\n380\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.460\nyou're gonna go to your own\npackage manager to do so\n\n381\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.720\nis what you're gonna end up doing.\n\n382\n00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I don't wanna\ncompile that source code.\n\n383\n00:19:58.765 --> 00:19:59.887\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n384\n00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:04.303\nI'm not gonna worry about that either so\nyou can do it in a couple of ways, but\n\n385\n00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:08.080\nhere we're simply going to\ndrop in to the terminal.\n\n386\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.812\nIf I can get to it.\n\n387\n00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:18.519\nSo once I'm actually in the terminal,\n\n388\n00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:22.326\nit's at this point I can go and\n\n389\n00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:27.961\ntype in sudoo app-get install Wireshark,\n\n390\n00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:32.850\nnow it's gonna sk me for my password.\n\n391\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.180\nNow it says you can't do it that way,\nlet me go to my super user account.\n\n392\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.220\nSupervisor, if I can actually type\nin the password it would help.\n\n393\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.327\nYou know, I'm typing in too many Ps.\n\n394\n00:20:52.722 --> 00:20:55.790\nThere we go, so now,\nlet's see if I can do that.\n\n395\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.790\nDo apt-get install and\nthen Wireshark, easy enough,\n\n396\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.940\nat least it should be Wireshark,\nif I can spell.\n\n397\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.320\nAnd now let's gonna ask,\nafter I selected that right.\n\n398\n00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.240\nI went to of course the package\nmanager for the VN and here it is.\n\n399\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.510\nIt starts actually download and says,\nhey are you sure you wanna do this?\n\n400\n00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.270\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\n\n401\n00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.280\nOnce we get to this point,\nare there any other steps or\n\n402\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.180\nconfiguration settings\nwe should be aware of?\n\n403\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.300\nIf you're in the middle of the install\nride and it may not actually finish or\n\n404\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.520\ndo it what we want it to do.\n\n405\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.680\nYou may get a hint that you\nmay have to run some updates\n\n406\n00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.800\nbefore you can do the install.\n\n407\n00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.840\nSo back on my screen, that's what we're\nactually going to take a look at here,\n\n408\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.110\nIf I press Y and see what can happen.\n\n409\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.520\nAnd now there it goes,\nit's beginning its install and\n\n410\n00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.370\nwe'll see what happens here, right?\n\n411\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.460\nSo there comes a point where it says that,\nit normally gives you that point where it\n\n412\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.750\ngoes yeah, I don't see everything, go\nahead and make sure you run your updates.\n\n413\n00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.780\nRun your updates, start the install\nprocess again with the app Git,\n\n414\n00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:57.470\nyou should be fine, so that's exactly\nwhat we're taking a look at here.\n\n415\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.940\nNow at this point, notice it's telling\nyou something here, that it says, hey,\n\n416\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.130\nwe're configuring Wireshark common.\n\n417\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:10.430\nIt says, should non-super users\nbe able to capture packets.\n\n418\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.730\nWell, remember what that means,\nis like if you don't,\n\n419\n00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:17.420\nit means you always have to login\nas well the super user, right?\n\n420\n00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.020\nSo for us,\nwe're instead going to say, Yes.\n\n421\n00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.070\nOkay, so if I want that to happen,\nI want to make sure that that happens here\n\n422\n00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.280\nthen I can run that and\nthen we are up and ready to go.\n\n423\n00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.910\nAnd now it says it's processing\neverything else that we have available.\n\n424\n00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.190\nNow once everything is done at this\npoint you may have to log off and\n\n425\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.560\nlog back in, especially if you were\nthe one that was not a super user.\n\n426\n00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.900\nThat could be able to run this but\njust kind of realize that that is part of\n\n427\n00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:49.330\nthe installation process when it comes\ndown to something for Linux instead.\n\n428\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.890\nSo don't go to the Wireshark website and\ngo, I don't find my Linux install I guess\n\n429\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.080\nI can't run it on Linux,\ngo to your package manager.\n\n430\n00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.104\nYou should be able to find it if you're\nnot sure take a look on the internet as\n\n431\n00:23:01.104 --> 00:23:03.936\nshowed you on here on the BM coz that's\nthe one that's the one that I had\n\n432\n00:23:03.936 --> 00:23:06.339\ninstalled but you may have to do yam,\nyou may have to do RPM.\n\n433\n00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:10.320\n&gt;&gt; Just depending on what\nversion you're using.\n\n434\n00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.270\n&gt;&gt; Right so either one right RH wherever\nthe one is for red hart I can't remember.\n\n435\n00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.380\nSo just can't remember when you start\ndoing this right you may run and\n\n436\n00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.230\nencounter issues like\nthat Now our last one\n\n437\n00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.530\nis fairly simple here\nwhich of course is MacOS.\n\n438\n00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:28.670\nNow this one used to be a little more\ndifficult, not a ton more difficult.\n\n439\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:35.270\nAnd the reason why is that Wireshark in\nthis original ability to install on Mac,\n\n440\n00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:40.560\nyou could do it but it was ported over\nfrom essentially Linux is what it was.\n\n441\n00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.140\nSo when you try to run it, it look like\na Linux Dialog Box and it gave you al of\n\n442\n00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.980\nthe stuff here, and then it didn't\nactually work the way that it needed to,\n\n443\n00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.920\nso you had to download something else.\n\n444\n00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.974\nBecause the I had a different,\n\n445\n00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:59.267\nMac OS had a different package manager\nfrom the way that the Linux 1 would tell.\n\n446\n00:23:59.267 --> 00:24:04.340\nSo you had to install something like,\nthe Apple ports type of installer.\n\n447\n00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.089\nOr package manager, and\nthen everything would be good.\n\n448\n00:24:07.089 --> 00:24:10.792\nBut the great thing is,\nnow inside of Windows though,\n\n449\n00:24:10.792 --> 00:24:15.217\nyou can go directly to the download link,\nand now notice it says,\n\n450\n00:24:15.217 --> 00:24:20.090\nMac OS X or later, and\nthen you can download that DMG file.\n\n451\n00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:25.120\nOnce you do that, you simply double-click\non it, and now it begins to open.\n\n452\n00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.250\nAnd it will give you,\nof course, this link here.\n\n453\n00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.255\nYou simply double-click on this again and\n\n454\n00:24:31.255 --> 00:24:33.310\nit will lead you through\nthis guided installation.\n\n455\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.350\nSo the great thing is,\nit means they've kind of,\n\n456\n00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.678\ninstead of just putting it over from\nLinux which some things would then work,\n\n457\n00:24:41.678 --> 00:24:46.600\nsome things wouldn't, it allows you to\ncontinue through without having to worry\n\n458\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.010\ntoo much about anything\nelse that will happen.\n\n459\n00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:54.410\nI'm gonna leave it in its\ndefault installation, provide,\n\n460\n00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.046\nof course,\nmy password to install the software.\n\n461\n00:24:58.046 --> 00:25:00.546\nAnd there it goes,\nit begin to write everything and\n\n462\n00:25:00.546 --> 00:25:02.824\nit tells you that\neverything was successful.\n\n463\n00:25:05.242 --> 00:25:08.240\nAnd from here if I do wireshark,\n\n464\n00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.357\nI should see the installation pop up,\nand there we go.\n\n465\n00:25:13.357 --> 00:25:17.611\nSo all three of those install processes,\neven though they're fairly simple,\n\n466\n00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:21.260\nyou can find where they might\nbe a little bit tricky at times.\n\n467\n00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.457\nIf you're running an older version of\nmacOS, you may up finding out that hey,\n\n468\n00:25:26.457 --> 00:25:30.000\nI might you still have to do\nthat package manager, but\n\n469\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.746\nwith the newer update, it shouldn't\nhappen, but I can only say that.\n\n470\n00:25:34.746 --> 00:25:35.499\nIt shouldn't happen.\n\n471\n00:25:35.499 --> 00:25:39.527\nBut if you do, there's plenty of guides\nout there that will help you to install\n\n472\n00:25:39.527 --> 00:25:43.554\nWireshark on the Mac, if you happen to\nstill find one of those old ported copies\n\n473\n00:25:43.554 --> 00:25:46.933\nthat you chose to run instead of\nthe newest one that is available.\n\n474\n00:25:46.933 --> 00:25:50.979\nSo take the time and that way,\nregardless on what machine you're on,\n\n475\n00:25:50.979 --> 00:25:53.250\nit's really gonna help you out.\n\n476\n00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.554\nYou might be wondering like,\nis it really worth it to do,\n\n477\n00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:57.090\nI really need to install on all three?\n\n478\n00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.100\nIt depends on your network, right?\n\n479\n00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:03.621\nWhat you're gonna find out, especially\nwhen we start capturing data in Wireshark,\n\n480\n00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:07.761\none most important thing is that you have\nto be able to do is know where to capture\n\n481\n00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:08.350\nthe data.\n\n482\n00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:13.630\nSo you might find out that you\ngo from a particular LAN of some\n\n483\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.640\nsort that's all 100% Windows machine and\nyou don't even have your laptop with you.\n\n484\n00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.440\nYou've got to be able to install it there.\n\n485\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.790\nThen you might end up moving in to\na completely Unix environment or Linux\n\n486\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.320\nenvironment, and you might actually have\nto install there, and you might actually\n\n487\n00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.190\ngo in to a Apple environment, where you\nmight actually install it there as well.\n\n488\n00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.560\nSo it depends on where you actually\nhave to monitor traffic and\n\n489\n00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.990\nget the most bang for\nthe buck at that point.\n\n490\n00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:41.500\nBut at least now, you can have a basis\nof beginning the install process and\n\n491\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.400\nknow what to do from that point.\n\n492\n00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.180\nBut this is a good place for\nus to kind of stop.\n\n493\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.637\nBecause our next particular option then,\nor next step here,\n\n494\n00:26:49.637 --> 00:26:54.223\nof course, is just capturing packets and\nwe wanna make sure that we get into that,\n\n495\n00:26:54.223 --> 00:26:58.356\nand we'll talk about that idea of\nthe process of where to capture as well.\n\n496\n00:26:58.356 --> 00:27:00.828\nBut that's not for this show,\nthat's for another one.\n\n497\n00:27:00.828 --> 00:27:03.256\n&gt;&gt; That's all right,\nwe got a good head start, and\n\n498\n00:27:03.256 --> 00:27:07.475\nnow we're going to continue to see how to\nuse this tool in a production environment.\n\n499\n00:27:07.475 --> 00:27:10.345\nSo thank you so much, Ronnie, for\njoining us today, and thank you,\n\n500\n00:27:10.345 --> 00:27:11.155\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n501\n00:27:11.155 --> 00:27:15.325\nBut we have a lot of information in\nstore for you, so please stay tuned.\n\n502\n00:27:15.325 --> 00:27:17.725\nThat's gonna go ahead and\nwrap things up for this show.\n\n503\n00:27:17.725 --> 00:27:19.495\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee

00:00:11.963\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Wireshark series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.500\nIn this episode, we will be looking\nat how to utilize the utility.\n\n6\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.040\nAnd we'll be looking at\nhow to capture packets.\n\n7\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.680\nWith us today in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.150\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.169\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n10\n00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.251\nas we continue on to learn\nmore about Wireshark.\n\n11\n00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:33.769\nAnd how we can effectively use it.\n\n12\n00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.750\nSince we started off talking\nabout Wireshark as being,\n\n13\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.415\nreally, a packet sniffer\nat the very beginning,\n\n14\n00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:43.040\nwe will of course want to begin with\nthis idea of capturing packets.\n\n15\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.361\nAnd then on another episode we'll\ntake a look of course at filtering or\n\n16\n00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:49.310\ndisplaying the packets in\nthe way that we want to.\n\n17\n00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.980\nBut right at the beginning when we start\ntalking about the idea of capturing\n\n18\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.510\npackets, we wanna know\none fundamental rule.\n\n19\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.610\nEspecially when you're doing this for\nproduction and\n\n20\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.870\nnot just for testing it out, right?\n\n21\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.930\nIs that when we start capturing packets,\nplacement of where you turn on Wireshark\n\n22\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.280\nis gonna be essential and important for\neverything that you actually end up doing.\n\n23\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.131\nSo that's what we really wanna\nmake sure that we emphasize.\n\n24\n00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:19.012\nLet me show you what I'm talking about\nhere as far as a simple network diagram\n\n25\n00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.260\ngoes, this will hopefully help us out.\n\n26\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.320\nSo in this particular diagram, I'm showing\nkind of a fairly common topology here.\n\n27\n00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.070\nWhere I might have wireless users.\n\n28\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.250\nI, of course, have people that\nhave their own work stations.\n\n29\n00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.472\nThat I have servers on this network.\n\n30\n00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:37.350\nUsually connected to a router.\n\n31\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.272\nMaybe, possibly connected\nto a branch office as well.\n\n32\n00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:45.523\nThe key here is to understand that\nwhen you start to capture data,\n\n33\n00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:50.510\nit can appear differently depending\non where you capture the data.\n\n34\n00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.960\nAnd how you also capture data is also key,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.490\nSo once it's installed and\nyou decide to do this, placement is key.\n\n36\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.980\nWhat you want to do is,\n\n37\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.970\nwhen you start to actually understand\nthat you may need to run Wireshark.\n\n38\n00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.380\nUsually it comes from a user indicating\n\n39\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.160\nthat something is not\nthe way that it should be.\n\n40\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.871\nThe network is slow, or\nI'm not able to receive this,\n\n41\n00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:20.405\nor I'm only getting something partially,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n42\n00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:24.758\nYou always want to try and\nrun Wireshark as close as you\n\n43\n00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:29.610\ncan to whoever is actually\ngiving that particular report.\n\n44\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.490\nSo let's say for\ninstance here that the end user sitting on\n\n45\n00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.430\nthis particular network,\nthey are saying that from their desktop\n\n46\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.750\nthey're not getting access to\nfiles the way that they need to.\n\n47\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.590\nWell, you can run Wireshark from this\nparticular location or very close.\n\n48\n00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.735\nSo as close as you can,\nyou want to be able to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:55.749\nThe reason why is that you always want\nto take a look at whatever's gonna be\n\n50\n00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.700\ncaptured when you do the analysis from\nthe standpoint of where the user is\n\n51\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.287\ncomplaining about, okay?\n\n52\n00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:04.290\nSo you get their full\nperspective on what's happening.\n\n53\n00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.450\nIf there are wireless, you want to come\ndown here and maybe run it on your own,\n\n54\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.144\nand make sure you're\nconnecting in the same way.\n\n55\n00:03:11.144 --> 00:03:14.980\nIf they're wireless and you decide\nto run it on a wired par network,\n\n56\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.041\nnot saying it won't work, okay,\nyou still might get the same issues.\n\n57\n00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:22.640\nBut you won't understand what\nit is the issue actually is.\n\n58\n00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.260\nSo make sure you realize that, that at\nsome point here you wanna make sure that's\n\n59\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.050\nit's as close to where the issue\nis actually occurring is the key.\n\n60\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.610\n&gt;&gt; What, Ronnie,\nif this was an issue affecting many users?\n\n61\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.353\nSuch as, maybe I was experiencing echo or\njitter within a VoIP phone system,\n\n62\n00:03:37.353 --> 00:03:39.038\nwhere would I place that utility?\n\n63\n00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:42.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's one of those things\nwhere you have to actually figure out,\n\n64\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.468\nis it happening to every user or not?\n\n65\n00:03:44.468 --> 00:03:45.751\n&gt;&gt; On that segment.\n&gt;&gt; Once you do,\n\n66\n00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:50.534\nyep, you actually want to make sure then\nat that point you can capture it on that\n\n67\n00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:53.310\nparticular segment that you want.\n\n68\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.350\nNow, by doing that, how can you do that?\n\n69\n00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.090\nThere's a couple of options\nthat you have ahead of you.\n\n70\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.060\nAnd we actually did talk about this in\nour cyber security show that we did, but\n\n71\n00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.930\nyou have really two options.\n\n72\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.540\nIf that switch is something like\na Cisco switch, it makes sense.\n\n73\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.860\nWe can just simply run SPAN and\ndo that ability to do port mirroring.\n\n74\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.480\nAnd try and say, hey, on this VLAN,\nI wanna make sure for\n\n75\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.140\nthe voice traffic, right,\nthat all that also gets sent over.\n\n76\n00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.960\nAnd I can run Wireshark on the device that\nthen all the packets that it possibly can\n\n77\n00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.990\nis mirrored over to my particular\ndevice that I'm running Wireshark on.\n\n78\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.964\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; When you do something like that,\n\n79\n00:04:31.964 --> 00:04:34.807\nthat will work, but\nyou may also cause network slow down.\n\n80\n00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:38.893\nAnd that's because you're causing that\nswitch to now have to generate duplicate\n\n81\n00:04:38.893 --> 00:04:40.200\ncopies, right?\n\n82\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.110\nOf everything that's going across\nevery other port in that VLAN,\n\n83\n00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.570\nsending it to one port.\n\n84\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.820\nAnd it's gonna cause time\nissues because it is,\n\n85\n00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.840\nit's duplicating every bit of traffic\nthat it can and sending it over.\n\n86\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.414\nYou may also get dropped packets,\nyou may also do that.\n\n87\n00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:58.971\nA better way, if possible,\nif you can do this of course,\n\n88\n00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:03.980\nmay cost a bit more expense, but\nit's to provide a network tap instead.\n\n89\n00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.646\nWhich doesn't cause any slow down.\n\n90\n00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:11.552\nThat's an inline device, in which you\nnow also plug into the switch itself,\n\n91\n00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:15.263\ninto that segment, and try and\ncapture the data that way.\n\n92\n00:05:15.263 --> 00:05:17.275\nSo that is a possibility.\n\n93\n00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:21.430\nYou wanna capture just about all the data\ngoing across the network, usually.\n\n94\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.334\nYou can run it as close to\nsomething like the firewall, or\n\n95\n00:05:24.334 --> 00:05:26.281\nto your router as possible, as well.\n\n96\n00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:30.067\nNow of course, in your branch offices\nyou may end up figuring out that for\n\n97\n00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:34.410\nyou to be able to get everything that\nyou need to in terms of capturing.\n\n98\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.310\nYou may find out where you do have\nto run this in multiple locations.\n\n99\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.330\nNot necessarily simultaneously.\n\n100\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.890\nBut to be able to get a picture of\neverything that you need to get a nice,\n\n101\n00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.330\ncomprehensive picture.\n\n102\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.650\nPlacement is the key in\nterms of packet capturing.\n\n103\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.450\nAnd that's what we wanted to\nmake sure that we emphasize here\n\n104\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.820\nright at the beginning, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.170\nSo the great thing is now\nthat Wireshark is installed,\n\n106\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.470\nthat now means we can\nperform a packet capture.\n\n107\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.449\nAnd just when you think, it's easy enough,\nI can see we just press a button and\n\n108\n00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.640\nit starts capturing packets.\n\n109\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.510\nYeah, that's as easy as it gets.\n\n110\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.990\nBut there are some options that you and\nI definitely need to consider.\n\n111\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.780\nEspecially in the newer version.\n\n112\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.597\nMost of the older versions it's\nbeen kinda the same format and\n\n113\n00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:19.660\nlayout that you've seen earlier.\n\n114\n00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.580\nBut now in the newer versions it's changed\nup just a little bit beginning with 2.0.\n\n115\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.124\nSo in our particular version we're gonna\nactually see some of these options that\n\n116\n00:06:27.124 --> 00:06:29.587\nwe're talking about when we\nbegin to capture packets.\n\n117\n00:06:29.587 --> 00:06:32.610\nSo let's switch on over to my machine now.\n\n118\n00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.475\nAnd let's begin here, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:38.985\nSo with my machine I want to launch\nup Wireshark at the very beginning.\n\n120\n00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:48.297\nAnd when I do so, I am brought to\nthis particular interface, right?\n\n121\n00:06:48.297 --> 00:06:53.870\nAnd it's not glamorous, it's not exciting,\nthere's not a lot of color to this.\n\n122\n00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.680\nBut it really is as basic and\n\n123\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.520\nas stripped down as it gets,\nwhich tells you something here.\n\n124\n00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.210\nThat they're trying to, instead of\nimpress you with a bunch of graphics and\n\n125\n00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.080\ntrying to help you out by leading\nyou step by step on everything.\n\n126\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.550\nThey're really saying, if you want to\nget started on the capture, it's simple.\n\n127\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.030\nTake a look at the available\nnetwork adapters that you have.\n\n128\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.140\nAnd, Cherokee, I don't know if you can,\nI'm hoping you can see this.\n\n129\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.000\nCuz it really is small on my screen, but\nI zoomed in so that we can see it here.\n\n130\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.550\nBut you can see that I have four\ndifferent network interfaces.\n\n131\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And you might find that out.\n\n132\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.950\nYou might find out that your machine\nthat you're on does have multiple\n\n133\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.510\ninterfaces that are there.\n\n134\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.930\nBut it's relatively generic, but\nyou can see that right here,\n\n135\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.397\nI only have one plugged in.\n\n136\n00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:35.978\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n137\n00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:37.285\nthe way that you can tell\nthat is that little tiny-\n\n138\n00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:38.960\n&gt;&gt; You see that traffic there.\n\n139\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.416\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that little tiny kind of\nblip that's going across the screen.\n\n140\n00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:44.352\n&gt;&gt; It's like a little heart rate\nmonitor or something, yeah.\n\n141\n00:07:44.352 --> 00:07:48.536\n&gt;&gt; That would be the worst heart rate in\nthe world, is what that would be, [LAUGH].\n\n142\n00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:50.768\nThat would be better than any of one,\nor three, or two, but you're right.\n\n143\n00:07:50.768 --> 00:07:51.870\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.800\n&gt;&gt; At the same time,\n\n145\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.035\nthat would be something disconcerting for\n\n146\n00:07:55.035 --> 00:07:57.903\nyour doctor if your heart\nrate looked like that at all.\n\n147\n00:07:57.903 --> 00:08:00.353\nSo here It's simple, right?\n\n148\n00:08:00.353 --> 00:08:03.964\nYou just select that and\nyou are off and you're ready to go.\n\n149\n00:08:03.964 --> 00:08:10.760\nBut in a real production environment, you\ndon't want to just do this all the time.\n\n150\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.660\nYou can, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.390\nIt's probably not gonna hurt anything.\n\n152\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.390\nBut remember that when you\nstart doing this stuff live,\n\n153\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.120\nyou're only really getting a momentary\npicture of what you're taking a look at.\n\n154\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.780\nAnd there are more options that\nare available that you should understand\n\n155\n00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.240\nbefore you begin to capture.\n\n156\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.940\nNow it doesn't mean you have to.\n\n157\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.310\nYou can simply run the capture and\ngo, okay, I'm done, no big deal.\n\n158\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.650\nAnd that would be the end of our show.\n\n159\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:32.830\nSo have a good day.\n\n160\n00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.950\n&gt;&gt; What was the point of all that?\n\n161\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.266\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\nYeah, so what was the point?\n\n162\n00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:36.630\n[LAUGH] So overall though.\n\n163\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.830\nBut that's that simple, it really\nis that simple for us to do that.\n\n164\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.920\nBut there are options on these interfaces\nthat we definitely want to take a look at.\n\n165\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:52.050\nSo here on the, let me zoom in\na little bit, if I click on capture\n\n166\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:57.960\nnotice I have capture options and that is\nkey for what we want to have in place.\n\n167\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.740\nIf I select that, that will bring up\na nice little dialogue box window for us.\n\n168\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.880\nAnd now we can see input\nside as well as output side.\n\n169\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.500\nAnd we'll talk about\nthe output here in a moment.\n\n170\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.170\nBut on the input,\nwe're starting to see which one of these.\n\n171\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.520\nAnd the key, also, is making sure\nthat whatever mode that you're in.\n\n172\n00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.490\nIf you are unchecked on promiscuous mode,\n\n173\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.110\nthat's probably not a good thing\nif you're doing a capture.\n\n174\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.300\nBut if you find out that you have\na network adapter and the promiscuous mode\n\n175\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.470\ncannot be checked, more than likely\nyou're not gonna be able to capture data\n\n176\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.910\non that particular interface except for\nwhat's being absolutely destined for you.\n\n177\n00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.810\nAs far as a destination address goes.\n\n178\n00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.430\nAlso, you can see where it gives you\nwhat they call a two megabyte buffer.\n\n179\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.930\nSo, this one, on the interface, it will\nbuffer up to two megabytes of text which\n\n180\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.830\nis quite a bit of text that comes in.\n\n181\n00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.063\nAnd the reason why we want to know is\nthat everything we're seeing, right,\n\n182\n00:09:58.063 --> 00:10:02.709\nour display, or our graphics card may not\nbe as fast as what this spinning out here.\n\n183\n00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:07.780\nSo it can buffer a bit before we get into\nwhat you're seeing there, all right?\n\n184\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.719\nNow, let's go ahead and take a look at the\noptions here, and then we'll go back for\n\n185\n00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:13.367\nthe output here for just a moment.\n\n186\n00:10:15.566 --> 00:10:17.698\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at the options, and\n\n187\n00:10:17.698 --> 00:10:19.550\nwe'll do it in the order\nthat they show here.\n\n188\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.270\nBecause it probably makes a little\nbit more sense to work this way.\n\n189\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.870\nWe can have what we call Display Options,\nokay?\n\n190\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.100\nDisplay Options are very important\ndepending on what you need.\n\n191\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.600\nNotice it says,\nUpdate list of packets in real-time.\n\n192\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.870\nWell, that means that as\nthe packets are coming in, and\n\n193\n00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.210\nI have it also displaying in my screen\non the capture filter, I'm saying,\n\n194\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.750\nas soon as it updates make sure\nyou also make a display of it.\n\n195\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.130\nWell, that means it's gonna take\nup more system resources to\n\n196\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.780\ndo something like this.\n\n197\n00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.120\nSo even though this is nice when I'm\ndoing something live and in real time for\n\n198\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.330\na brief amount of time I don't\nnecessarily have to do this.\n\n199\n00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.673\nIf I know that I'm gonna be\ncapturing the data and saving it for\n\n200\n00:11:01.673 --> 00:11:05.145\nsomething a little bit later on,\nokay I can just turn that off and\n\n201\n00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:08.838\nnot worry about what's being\ndisplayed right there in front of me.\n\n202\n00:11:08.838 --> 00:11:13.337\nAnd that will instead save some time for\nwhat else is going to be happening and\n\n203\n00:11:13.337 --> 00:11:18.070\nbe able to save some computer cycles\ninstead of sending it to the screen.\n\n204\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.680\nIt just sends it on to\nwhere I want it to go.\n\n205\n00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.280\nAlso notice the automatically\nscroll during live capture.\n\n206\n00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.420\nThis is what we'll see when we do the\ncapture where the data will look like it's\n\n207\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.314\njust scrolling across the screen.\n\n208\n00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:34.415\nOnce again that has to go\nthrough the CPU processor itself\n\n209\n00:11:34.415 --> 00:11:38.970\nwhich means it's taking\nup more cycles on things.\n\n210\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.850\nAnd doesn't necessarily have to do that.\n\n211\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.260\nBut you wanna see it,\nthat's what you have there too.\n\n212\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.870\nAnd then of course,\nextra capture information dialog.\n\n213\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:51.150\nA lot of times when you do end up\ncapturing data, normally you can hover\n\n214\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:56.180\nover a particular packet and it will give\nyou a little tool tip that will display.\n\n215\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.400\nIf you don't need that, well again,\njust uncheck that if you don't want to.\n\n216\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.470\nNow the big part of something else, and\nyou've seen that a lot of this as far as\n\n217\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.550\nthe options go, it really is about\nperformance more than anything else too.\n\n218\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.970\nThe same thing with name\nresolution as a big part.\n\n219\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.670\nThe only one that they have checked here\nout of the three options that we have\n\n220\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.960\nis of course just the MAC address.\n\n221\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.970\nThe reason why is because that's a fairly\n\n222\n00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.760\nlimited in comparison to\nthe other two options, right?\n\n223\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.080\nWhen you take a look at the MAC address,\nwhich is a 48-bit\n\n224\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.450\nbinary address all together,\nreported in hexadecimal, normally.\n\n225\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.750\nOne of the first 24 bits\nare vendor identifiers, right?\n\n226\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.990\nSo let's say that there\nare 20,000 vendors out there.\n\n227\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.200\nI don't even know how many that there are.\n\n228\n00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.300\nBut that's just really a static\nlist of 20,000 vendors, right?\n\n229\n00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.070\nSo when they look that up, they can\nactually say, this is an Intel NIC, or\n\n230\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.230\nthis is a Broadcom or\na Dell or HP, whatever it is.\n\n231\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.520\nFairly quickly because that's\nthe fairly small list in comparison.\n\n232\n00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.940\nSo they can resolve the name of the net\nvery easily, very quickly from a fairly\n\n233\n00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:11.630\nsmall list but notice these other two\nhere, as far as the network names go.\n\n234\n00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:16.392\nWell every network name\nin theory can be unique.\n\n235\n00:13:16.392 --> 00:13:21.597\nNot everybody does kind of\nthe standard very drab naming\n\n236\n00:13:21.597 --> 00:13:27.010\nconvention like I do,\nClient01 and Client02.\n\n237\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:31.000\nSome people are very creative and they\ncan name every single one differently.\n\n238\n00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.560\nWell remember if that happens,\nwhat has to happen here right.\n\n239\n00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.670\nIs gonna be some type of\nreverse look up right?\n\n240\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.680\nFor DNS, that's when we take a name,\nand we resolve it to an IP address.\n\n241\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.550\nBut, a reverse look up, right, takes\nan IP address, which is what comes in\n\n242\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:50.390\non the capture itself, and\nresolves a name for us instead.\n\n243\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.870\nWell, that's what this is doing, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.970\nAnd if it has to actually look it up,\nit means it has to go and ask somebody,\n\n245\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.950\nif it doesn't know what it is.\n\n246\n00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.120\nAnd that has to do it for every single\nname that comes across the network.\n\n247\n00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.875\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, these settings aren't\nreally set in stone, so to speak.\n\n248\n00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:08.208\nBecause I've noticed some of them,\nespecially on the left-hand side,\n\n249\n00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:11.100\nwhere you see the automatically\nscroll during live.\n\n250\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.290\nThe actual interface has the ability for\nyou to pause and stop that scrolling.\n\n251\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.190\nBut we can come back and\nchange these at other times too, right?\n\n252\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, yup, they're all options.\n\n253\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.166\nThat's why they're there.\n\n254\n00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:23.894\nBut this is something that you may wanna\nconsider depending on the way that\n\n255\n00:14:23.894 --> 00:14:25.090\nyou're doing this.\n\n256\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.010\nAnd also the idea of the transport names.\n\n257\n00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.640\nAnd that's layer four on the OSI model,\nright?\n\n258\n00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.710\nThis is kinda layer three here and\nthis one is layer two.\n\n259\n00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.100\nKinda follow that OSI model\ntraining that you have.\n\n260\n00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.830\nLayer four is all about the protocols,\nright?\n\n261\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.810\nSo if something comes on in port 443,\nwhat you and\n\n262\n00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.690\nI don't tend to go, yeah,\neverything goes on port 443.\n\n263\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.735\nWe say what, HTTPS.\n\n264\n00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:47.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n265\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.180\n&gt;&gt; Well the same thing here,\nif it comes in on port 80,\n\n266\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.830\nit's saying I want the report\nto display what, HTTP, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.160\nIf it's on port 23,\nI'm gonna report telnet.\n\n268\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.430\nIt makes sense.\n\n269\n00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.950\nBut it says look, doing that takes time.\n\n270\n00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.970\nBecause I have to look that up,\nI have to be able to do that.\n\n271\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.740\nAnd port center generated like that.\n\n272\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.500\nIt can take a little bit of time.\n\n273\n00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.870\nSo here they've let these two off.\n\n274\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.370\nNow this one because it's fairly static,\nremains the same, leave it on.\n\n275\n00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.760\nBut if you don't need it,\ndon't worry about it, uncheck it.\n\n276\n00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.150\nNow there's some other things\nthat you also have in place too.\n\n277\n00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.930\nAnd this is where it get a little bit\nmore unusual for the majority of us.\n\n278\n00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.500\nNow and we're learning about it.\n\n279\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.770\nWe don't care anything about these\nthings especially down here but\n\n280\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.910\nyou definitely need to in a real\nenvironment as you continue to\n\n281\n00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.346\nmove forward in your capturing\nexperience what you do.\n\n282\n00:15:36.346 --> 00:15:42.673\nStop capture automatically after and\nthat's what you want to make sure of.\n\n283\n00:15:42.673 --> 00:15:46.828\n&gt;&gt; Well, earlier you spoke\nabout utilizing disk space.\n\n284\n00:15:46.828 --> 00:15:49.387\nIf we were just to continually\nlet our captures run so\n\n285\n00:15:49.387 --> 00:15:52.993\nwould this be a setting that I might want\nto check out if I was concerned with\n\n286\n00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:54.871\nthat sort of disk space utilization?\n\n287\n00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.922\n&gt;&gt; That could be one of\nthe concerns overall when you start\n\n288\n00:15:57.922 --> 00:16:01.186\ntaking a look at this if you\nhave a limited amount of space.\n\n289\n00:16:01.186 --> 00:16:06.041\nOverall though, you also are concerned\nabout how many captures you're running at\n\n290\n00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:07.950\none, in a day, right?\n\n291\n00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.500\nSo, if you wanted to,\nyou could actually run where you go, look,\n\n292\n00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.450\nI want this to,\nbecause I just want to do a sampling.\n\n293\n00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.370\nI can add this stop after 10,000 packets.\n\n294\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:21.490\nSo that way I don't have to go,\ndid I leave my Wireshark running?\n\n295\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.440\nNow I'm going out to lunch and I can\njust start it right before lunch and go,\n\n296\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.980\nokay, after 10,000 packets or\n100,000 packets stop the capture.\n\n297\n00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.180\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So we can set it up like that.\n\n298\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.880\nWe can also say,\nabout the idea of files here too.\n\n299\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.640\nNow notice this, it says files.\n\n300\n00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.210\nNow what is that about?\n\n301\n00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.980\nWell, files is the number of files I\nwanted to break it into if I choose to.\n\n302\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.040\nSo I can set it up where what we can\n\n303\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:53.000\ndo here is say that a file is actually\nequal to, let's say a certain size.\n\n304\n00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.540\nSo it could be where it's kilobytes,\nmegabytes,\n\n305\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.470\nor gigabytes here, that I could say\nthat that's the idea of 1 file.\n\n306\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:05.300\nSo if it hits, let's do the idea of\nmegabytes, cuz that's the easiest.\n\n307\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.480\nLet's say if it hits 200 megabytes,\nwhich is still fairly large for a file.\n\n308\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.990\nSo let's do 20 megabytes instead.\n\n309\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.950\nSo if I say 20 megabytes, and\n\n310\n00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:16.590\nit's capturing the data,\nI can tell I want it save as a file.\n\n311\n00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.480\nAnd then the second one can begin and\n\n312\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.770\nwhen it gets to 20 megabytes\nit'll save another file.\n\n313\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.070\nAnother 20 comes in, it will save to\na third file, that way I can go back and\n\n314\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.830\nexamine all three of those files\nknowing exactly what size it is or\n\n315\n00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.970\nI can tell how many hours do\nI want a file to actually be.\n\n316\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.700\nSo I can set up capture for\nan hour and then create a new file.\n\n317\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.040\nWell, why might I do that?\n\n318\n00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.280\nI might be trying to analyze traffic\nfrom that particular standpoint, for\n\n319\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.680\nlet's say a six hour period.\n\n320\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.550\nDuring the work day, I want to see it at\nthe top of every single hour as I do this.\n\n321\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.810\nSo I can say after one hour,\ncreate another file for me.\n\n322\n00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.590\nOkay, after two hours,\ncreate another file.\n\n323\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.480\nThat way, I can actually see\nit throughout the entire day.\n\n324\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.470\nAnd instead of trying to look at it over\nsix hours, that's a huge amount of file.\n\n325\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.480\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great I mean,\nyou're looking at your traffic analysis,\n\n326\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.300\nthis seems like a very helpful tool.\n\n327\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nall of those options are available, and\n\n328\n00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.850\nthey are things that we would normally\nconsider, especially inside of a network.\n\n329\n00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.810\nWhere I might not remember to\nkeep there and monitor and\n\n330\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.000\neverything else that we have to.\n\n331\n00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.650\nNow, here's another one, where we talked\nabout capture to a permanent file.\n\n332\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.880\nSo, this one,\neven though it has those same options,\n\n333\n00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.440\nit's telling me how it's gonna do it.\n\n334\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.760\nThis is how we set it to a file itself.\n\n335\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.120\nSo you can leave blank.\n\n336\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.000\nIf you want a temporary file,\nyou can actually assign a name to it.\n\n337\n00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.600\nYou can tell it what format and\nthis one really doesn't matter,\n\n338\n00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.890\nbecause, too much,\nI shouldn't say it doesn't matter.\n\n339\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.687\nBut because Wireshark can interpret just\nabout every type of file format that\n\n340\n00:18:46.687 --> 00:18:50.410\nthere is for\nthe outputs of what we have available.\n\n341\n00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.200\nIt doesn't really matter if you're doing\nthis in Wireshark if you're sending it to\n\n342\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.390\nanother machine.\n\n343\n00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.540\nOr to another one it might.\n\n344\n00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.730\nBut if you wanted to create another one,\n\n345\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.170\nremember it says create a new\nfile automatically after that.\n\n346\n00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.950\nAnd doing the same things here.\n\n347\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.080\nSo the same issue, but\n\n348\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.190\nnow it's saying, look,\nthis is how you're telling it to do this.\n\n349\n00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.290\nBut if you want to create it and give it\na file name, this is where you go and\n\n350\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.020\nyou actually assign it there.\n\n351\n00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.430\nThey also have what's\ncalled a ring buffer.\n\n352\n00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.240\nNow have you heard about circular logging,\nthis is the same concept and idea.\n\n353\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.740\nSo instead of you running it for\n\n354\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:29.230\nsix hours, it just continues to go and\ngo and go and go.\n\n355\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:35.070\nAnd now you come in for tomorrow,\nand you have 23 hours later,\n\n356\n00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.350\nyou have 23 different files\nat 20 megabytes a piece, and\n\n357\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.740\nit's just continuing to capture and\ncapture.\n\n358\n00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:46.340\nWell the idea of using a ring buffer\ninstead, says look, let's say that after\n\n359\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.800\nsix of these, I'm gonna start\noverwriting the first one again.\n\n360\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.390\nSo it never gets passed out to now where\nyou're filling up your hard drive or\n\n361\n00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.520\nwhere you're worried about\nwhatever your storage is.\n\n362\n00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But it's allowing you to do that.\n\n363\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.630\nAnd then once that first one is up, it\nwill start writing over to the second one,\n\n364\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.130\nthird one and fourth one.\n\n365\n00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.650\nSo you have this continually going\non if you don't really need it.\n\n366\n00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.450\nThis is really used throughout the entire\nindustry for many different things but\n\n367\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.620\nin terms of the capture, this is one of\nthe great things that you have in place.\n\n368\n00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.430\nNow why is that important, because a lot\nof times capture is not necessarily you\n\n369\n00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.240\nstaring at it while things are happening.\n\n370\n00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.845\nYou running it-\n&gt;&gt; Doing things-\n\n371\n00:20:24.845 --> 00:20:27.000\n&gt;&gt; Yep, doing things, multitasking,\n\n372\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.020\nlike what Cherokee has been saying, and\ndoing other things while this is going on.\n\n373\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.880\nSo you can turn off all of those\nkinda fancy display features,\n\n374\n00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.520\njust let it do its job, and then come\nback and examine it later if you want to.\n\n375\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.690\nThat's normally how you\nmight end up doing this.\n\n376\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.180\nNow, not all the time, right.\n\n377\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.020\nIf you're really there\nto get the job done,\n\n378\n00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.720\nit may be where you focus fully in on\nthis, but sometimes if you're like me\n\n379\n00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.620\nyou kinda forget cuz you are having to\ndo six or seven things at one time.\n\n380\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.030\nThis is probably one of the ways\nyou can make that happen.\n\n381\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:01.924\nAnd by turning off all those other\noptions, I'm going to not save anything.\n\n382\n00:21:01.924 --> 00:21:03.552\nLet me see if I can close that.\n\n383\n00:21:03.552 --> 00:21:06.443\nHow do I get out of this thing?\n\n384\n00:21:06.443 --> 00:21:09.880\nAll right, yeah, I was trying not to,\nlet me see if I can just close out.\n\n385\n00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.510\nThere we go.\nI was trying not to save anything.\n\n386\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.060\nI didn't wanna save\nanything at this point.\n\n387\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.928\nSo, once everything is done and you chose\nyour options and you do that, right?\n\n388\n00:21:17.928 --> 00:21:21.940\nThat really doesn't concern you if\nyour gone, this the first time on it,\n\n389\n00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.480\nyou just overload it with all these stuff,\nits gonna be helpful later on, okay?\n\n390\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.410\nIt might not be helpful right away,\nbut at the very beginning here, and\n\n391\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.230\nthis is again the latest version 2 2 4.\n\n392\n00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.540\nI'm just gonna slide\nthe interface that I have and\n\n393\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.070\nthere's a couple of options\nthat we have from there.\n\n394\n00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.030\nI can double click on it or\nI can select here and\n\n395\n00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:48.620\ngo up to the little tiny wire shark\nsymbol and select that at the same time.\n\n396\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.461\nSo I'm simply gonna do\n\n397\n00:21:49.461 --> 00:21:51.551\nit the way I normally do it\nwhich is to double click on it.\n\n398\n00:21:54.775 --> 00:21:57.420\nI don't know,\napparently I did change some options.\n\n399\n00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.880\nThat's fine, we'll see what ends\nup happening, is what we'll do.\n\n400\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.020\nNow when we start to take a look,\nI am now capturing the data.\n\n401\n00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:10.270\nAnd we're gonna explain the rest of\nthis in another episode for right now.\n\n402\n00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.330\nBut this is the beginning of what we call,\nof course, our packet capture.\n\n403\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.810\nDown here in the lower, on the lower\n\n404\n00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:23.090\nportion of this screen I'm really trying\nto center in on this bar right here, okay.\n\n405\n00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.150\nYou wanna make sure that\nyou know what's going on.\n\n406\n00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:29.440\nSo notice it says Ethernet\n0 live capture in progress.\n\n407\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.960\nI thought ours was supposed to be 3,\n\n408\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.270\nbut it looks like data is coming in and\nit still continues to come in.\n\n409\n00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.180\n&gt;&gt; I think it was 0.\n\n410\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.620\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and then over here on\nthe right hand side, there we go.\n\n411\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.340\nThis is what we are really looking for.\n\n412\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.700\nYou can see how many packets that\nmy capture already has taken on.\n\n413\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:52.250\n4,900 so far but notice this also\ndisplayed that same amount of data.\n\n414\n00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.530\nSo remember what that means, right?\n\n415\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.130\nThat it's capturing the data but\n\n416\n00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.470\nit's also having to send it\nto the display that you saw.\n\n417\n00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.870\nUp here at the top.\n\n418\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.390\n&gt;&gt; So currently a 0% packet loss there.\n\n419\n00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 0% packet loss.\n\n420\n00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.045\nSometimes you can have where,\nI guess a little bit out of sync but\n\n421\n00:23:07.045 --> 00:23:09.190\noverall though it's sending so\nmany packets.\n\n422\n00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.690\nNotice that it's not scrolling\nacross the screen anymore.\n\n423\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.480\nIt's just too much but\n\n424\n00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:18.780\nif I continue to kinda click on this,\nI can see this color coded window.\n\n425\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.920\nAnd you can see now,\nI can move about halfway down here and\n\n426\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.410\nit's slowly creeping up\non the right hand side.\n\n427\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.630\nDo you see that Cherokee?\n\n428\n00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.777\nI don't know if you can see that bar\n\n429\n00:23:27.777 --> 00:23:28.690\nboxes-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n430\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.880\n&gt;&gt; Slowly creeping up now and that's\nbecause it continues to send more and\n\n431\n00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.730\nmore packets into that window and it's now\nstarting to creep up just a little bit.\n\n432\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.340\nSometimes you can see it\nreally fast [CROSSTALK]\n\n433\n00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.149\n&gt;&gt; Little crazy and\n\n434\n00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:43.847\nthat's why I mentioned that setting\nfrom before because sometimes you need\n\n435\n00:23:43.847 --> 00:23:45.300\nto just stop that scrolling.\n\n436\n00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:49.160\nBecause if you're looking for something,\nyou can manually scroll instead of like\n\n437\n00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.320\ntrying to fight with\nthe scroll bar on that side.\n\n438\n00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.227\nI find that part pretty handy.\n\n439\n00:23:54.227 --> 00:23:56.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is going to be\na lot of that that you see.\n\n440\n00:23:56.845 --> 00:24:00.713\nNow there is only one other option that I\nwanted to Make sure that I mentioned that\n\n441\n00:24:00.713 --> 00:24:01.591\nI forgot to do it.\n\n442\n00:24:01.591 --> 00:24:05.779\nBut at this point because we never know\non a live capture on a rural network here\n\n443\n00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:07.583\nwhat you might end up showing, so\n\n444\n00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:11.644\nI'm kind of glad that it's actually\nkinda just showing just a little bit of\n\n445\n00:24:11.644 --> 00:24:15.086\ndisplay messages here nothing\nreally detailed or deep at all.\n\n446\n00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.844\nI'm going to stop the capture.\n\n447\n00:24:16.844 --> 00:24:20.427\nBecause it could be where, now here it is,\nI'm flashing up the information,\n\n448\n00:24:20.427 --> 00:24:22.480\nso let's just stop it for right now.\n\n449\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.133\nBut I wanna go back and see if I can\nfind that option that I wanted to do,\n\n450\n00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:29.153\nwhich is right there, okay?\n\n451\n00:24:29.153 --> 00:24:33.997\nNotice that there is one option here,\nwhich I didn't mention.\n\n452\n00:24:33.997 --> 00:24:36.457\nAnd I remembered it after I closed out.\n\n453\n00:24:36.457 --> 00:24:40.010\nI was like, I forgot to talk\nabout a capture filter, okay?\n\n454\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.610\nThere's a couple of different filters,\nand they mean different things.\n\n455\n00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.774\nAnd let me make sure I can show you\nwhat I'm talking about as well.\n\n456\n00:24:47.774 --> 00:24:51.787\nAll right, so let's do it this way so\nthat we can see it.\n\n457\n00:24:51.787 --> 00:24:53.035\nHere, all right,\n\n458\n00:24:53.035 --> 00:24:57.797\nnow this one, notice it says Capture\nfilter, you see that, Cherokee?\n\n459\n00:24:57.797 --> 00:24:58.318\nIt says Capture filter.\n\n460\n00:24:58.318 --> 00:24:59.301\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n461\n00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:02.111\n&gt;&gt; But then at the top here.\n\n462\n00:25:02.111 --> 00:25:02.970\n&gt;&gt; Display filter.\n\n463\n00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.031\n&gt;&gt; Do you see another one\nthat says display filter?\n\n464\n00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:06.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They are not the same, okay?\n\n465\n00:25:06.895 --> 00:25:07.632\n&gt;&gt; I know, I just found out.\n\n466\n00:25:07.632 --> 00:25:08.568\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n467\n00:25:08.568 --> 00:25:11.190\nthese are not the same options here.\n\n468\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:15.430\nAnd you do need to be careful,\nokay, when you start to do stuff.\n\n469\n00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.200\nSometimes there is stuff that you want\nto make sure that doesn't come across\n\n470\n00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.730\nas far as being reported into Wireshark.\n\n471\n00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.080\nSo,let's take, for an example, if I'm\nrunning Wireshark on my computer and\n\n472\n00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.680\nI'm plugged into your network.\n\n473\n00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.240\nI may not wanna see my traffic,\n\n474\n00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.890\nokay cuz that's not really\nwhat I care about seeing.\n\n475\n00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.490\nI wanna see everybody else's traffic.\n\n476\n00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:36.330\nWell, I may think, hey,\n\n477\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.310\nthis is the way to go is I enter what\nwe call a capture filter at this point.\n\n478\n00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.950\nCapture filter just says,\nfilter it out before you capture.\n\n479\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.540\nIn other words, just block it.\n\n480\n00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.500\nDon't send it into Wireshark itself.\n\n481\n00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.540\nNow, you might go, yeah,\nthat's the way to go.\n\n482\n00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.920\nIt is, except that that can be\na performance hindrance as well,\n\n483\n00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.710\nbecause it's saying make the decision,\n\n484\n00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.630\nhere's the stuff that I want you to\nnot actually even try and capture.\n\n485\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.880\nWell, what does it have to do to do that?\n\n486\n00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.920\nHas to detect it first.\n\n487\n00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.340\nSo if it detects it, you're saying\ndetect it, drop it, don't send it in.\n\n488\n00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.107\nBut a display filter though.\n\n489\n00:26:12.812 --> 00:26:14.775\n[SOUND] I did it again, all right,\n\n490\n00:26:14.775 --> 00:26:18.153\nlet me just close that out\nbefore I get in trouble, okay?\n\n491\n00:26:18.153 --> 00:26:21.890\nA display filter though, is different.\n\n492\n00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.828\nA display filter says, look I'm taking\nall of it in, just like a regular packet\n\n493\n00:26:26.828 --> 00:26:30.531\nsniffer would do, but\nthen if I want to display something.\n\n494\n00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:34.274\nSo, let's say ARP here\ncuz that's actually easy.\n\n495\n00:26:34.274 --> 00:26:36.250\nNow it didn't say what?\n\n496\n00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.004\nDon't send it into it, but just do what?\n\n497\n00:26:39.004 --> 00:26:40.851\n&gt;&gt; Filter it.\n&gt;&gt; Just filter out the display.\n\n498\n00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:43.290\nThis one is much faster, okay?\n\n499\n00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.950\nSo, the recommendation, the best practice,\neven from the lady that actually does\n\n500\n00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:52.760\na lot of teaching on Wireshark,\nsays use display filters a lot.\n\n501\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.690\nUse capture filters sparingly.\n\n502\n00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.670\nNot saying you can't do it, but\n\n503\n00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.980\njust kinda realize that they are two\ndifferent options that are available.\n\n504\n00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.990\nAnd this depends on the performance\nthat you need at the time.\n\n505\n00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.578\nMost of the time we're\non a hurry to do this.\n\n506\n00:27:05.578 --> 00:27:08.743\nBut it does, you have to kinda slow\ndown before you can get faster.\n\n507\n00:27:08.743 --> 00:27:13.379\nAnd that is also a key here too in terms\nof what we are actually capturing at\n\n508\n00:27:13.379 --> 00:27:14.219\nthis point.\n\n509\n00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:18.123\nNow, once you get that of course,\nit means we need now to go all right, so\n\n510\n00:27:18.123 --> 00:27:19.852\nnow that all this data's here,\n\n511\n00:27:19.852 --> 00:27:23.971\nremember that the data in its natural\nform doesn't look like this, right?\n\n512\n00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:27.554\nThe closest that it really looks like\nto you and I is that little, tiny,\n\n513\n00:27:27.554 --> 00:27:31.094\nsquiggly line that we saw that\nCherokee said looked like a heartbeat.\n\n514\n00:27:31.094 --> 00:27:34.766\nIt really does,\nit's really more of a signal form.\n\n515\n00:27:34.766 --> 00:27:38.230\nBut this is what Wireshark,\nright, in terms of the capture.\n\n516\n00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:41.954\nIt not only captures that, it then\ndoes that packet analysis, it says,\n\n517\n00:27:41.954 --> 00:27:45.328\nlet's put it into something that\nmakes it easier to understand.\n\n518\n00:27:45.328 --> 00:27:46.816\nAt least this point here.\n\n519\n00:27:46.816 --> 00:27:51.521\nThat is what you're seeing the capture\nof all the data right here, but\n\n520\n00:27:51.521 --> 00:27:56.093\npost it in a way that makes a little\nbit more sense to us to what we see.\n\n521\n00:27:56.093 --> 00:27:59.415\n&gt;&gt; Could you imagine if they just\nleft that third field at the bottom?\n\n522\n00:27:59.415 --> 00:28:01.649\nAnd then had you sift through\nthe binary information?\n\n523\n00:28:01.649 --> 00:28:03.461\nAnd that's how the computers see it,\n\n524\n00:28:03.461 --> 00:28:07.034\nso yeah, that would be a lot of work to\ntry to figure out what was happening.\n\n525\n00:28:07.034 --> 00:28:07.900\n&gt;&gt; That's true, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n526\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.375\n&gt;&gt; Once you start seeing ascii code and\n\n527\n00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:13.255\nthe hex code here, you better believe it\nit becomes a little bit more challenging.\n\n528\n00:28:13.255 --> 00:28:16.010\nBut the great thing is it\ndoes interpret it for us.\n\n529\n00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.508\nAnd that is when we actually need to\ndo a little bit more of the packet\n\n530\n00:28:19.508 --> 00:28:20.388\nanalysis part.\n\n531\n00:28:20.388 --> 00:28:24.179\nBut at least on the capture part, you've\ngone through some of those different\n\n532\n00:28:24.179 --> 00:28:25.910\noptions that are available to you.\n\n533\n00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.463\nYou understand\nthe importance of placement,\n\n534\n00:28:28.463 --> 00:28:31.740\nwhich you'll know better\nbecause it's your own network.\n\n535\n00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.311\nRather than mine,\nthe single one that I drew up here.\n\n536\n00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:37.835\nAnd you'll actually kind of be able\nto play around and understand.\n\n537\n00:28:37.835 --> 00:28:41.531\nBut always remember that\nwhen you're trying to do\n\n538\n00:28:41.531 --> 00:28:45.500\nthis as far as a real issue\nsolving tool goes, right?\n\n539\n00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.520\nYou want to place as close as you can\nto the person that's experiencing\n\n540\n00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.615\nthe difficulties or saying that\nthey're experiencing the difficulties.\n\n541\n00:28:52.615 --> 00:28:55.129\nCuz you want to always see\nit from that perspective.\n\n542\n00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:56.649\nIt is easy to make a judgement,\nand go nope.\n\n543\n00:28:56.649 --> 00:28:59.201\nWell, from where I am\neverything looks great.\n\n544\n00:28:59.201 --> 00:29:02.457\nWell, that's great but from where they\nare it may not look the same way.\n\n545\n00:29:02.457 --> 00:29:04.473\nSo make sure you take that in hand, and\n\n546\n00:29:04.473 --> 00:29:06.957\nyou can begin just\ncapturing the data as well.\n\n547\n00:29:06.957 --> 00:29:09.265\nNow, of course we are not\ngonna leave you there,okay?\n\n548\n00:29:09.265 --> 00:29:13.420\nWe are gonna start taking a look at\nthe data that we've also captured as well.\n\n549\n00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.890\nAnd try and make some semblance and\n\n550\n00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.020\nunderstanding of that and\napply some more filters to it, and\n\n551\n00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.480\nthat's really kind of the more powerful\nnature of what we see Wireshark doing.\n\n552\n00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.620\nBut here is, at least, the very beginning.\n\n553\n00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.790\nWhich is understanding the capture and\n\n554\n00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:31.000\noptions that are available,\nso make sure you start there.\n\n555\n00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.920\n&gt;&gt; There really are a lot\nof different options.\n\n556\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.450\nAnd thank you for taking the time\nto show us that today Ronnie.\n\n557\n00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.930\nAnd I think for you guys,\nif you're at home or\n\n558\n00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.600\nat work, the best thing to do at\nthis point in time, go ahead and\n\n559\n00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.480\nexamine those different options,\neven the interface.\n\n560\n00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.200\nYou're able to change the look,\nthe layout, the feel.\n\n561\n00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.270\nAnd you saw all those options\nthat Ronnie showed you, so\n\n562\n00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.450\ntake the time to really just dig in there.\n\n563\n00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.400\nBut we do, like Ronnie said,\nhave more information headed your way, so\n\n564\n00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:53.990\nstay tuned.\n\n565\n00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.790\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n566\n00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.540\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n567\n00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.490\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n568\n00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.164\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on

help\n\n8\n00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.060\ndecipher all the different buttons and\ngadgets in the layout.\n\n9\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.420\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n10\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.480\nhaving me back as we continue to learn\na little bit more about Wireshark.\n\n12\n00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.810\nGetting started.\n\n13\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.182\nWhere we picked up on or where we left\nfrom last time is that we really showed\n\n14\n00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:39.800\nyou how to do the basics\nof a packet capture.\n\n15\n00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.526\nAnd I know I probably said\nthe term data capture.\n\n16\n00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:44.294\nI probably use them interchangeably.\n\n17\n00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:48.070\nBut if your having technical\ndifficulties understand that.\n\n18\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.540\nI really meant the idea of packet capture.\n\n19\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.330\nWhich is kinda of the correct\ntechnical term here.\n\n20\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.890\nBut overall though, we really just\nshowed you how to do a basic capture.\n\n21\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.060\nRemember that when you capture all\nthe information, you now have a chance,\n\n22\n00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.400\nof course,\nto have a display inside of WireShark.\n\n23\n00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.553\nBut if you're brand new\nto using WireShark,\n\n24\n00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:08.021\nit might be a little bit hard to\nunderstand what you're taking a look at.\n\n25\n00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:09.809\nAnd I tried to not focus in on that,\n\n26\n00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:13.020\ncuz I knew we were gonna do\nan entire episode on this.\n\n27\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.610\nSo that's why I wanted to\nkind of a skip over that.\n\n28\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.780\nSo I was trying to lead you away from\nfocusing in too much on the details, and\n\n29\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.060\njust focussing in on what we wanted to\nwhich was you can start a basic capture.\n\n30\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.156\nJust about anybody can, and now we\nare going to take a look at why this is\n\n31\n00:01:27.156 --> 00:01:29.942\nimportant and\nwhat the breakdown actually is.\n\n32\n00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:34.356\nAnd also of course how we can customize\nit to make it more usable for\n\n33\n00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:37.530\nwhat we want to do each and every day.\n\n34\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.430\nSo the great thing is,\n\n35\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150\nwe can get started right away by\nsimply taking a look at my machine.\n\n36\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.390\nAnd that way we'll get started here, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.970\nRemember that in every\nversion of Wireshark,\n\n38\n00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.455\nwhether you're running it on Mac or\non Windows, it'll look fairly similar.\n\n39\n00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:54.035\nI'm not gonna say, well,\nit will always look identical.\n\n40\n00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:55.942\nSo, I'm just gonna stick\nwith the Windows interface,\n\n41\n00:01:55.942 --> 00:01:58.839\nbecause that's probably the majority of\nus that's using Wireshark at this point.\n\n42\n00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:59.655\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n43\n00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:04.365\n&gt;&gt; But, let's go ahead and start\ntaking that idea of the capture first.\n\n44\n00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:07.965\nRemember that, for us,\nwe are going to capture based on data.\n\n45\n00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:13.060\nAnd this is the only interface that I see\na little bit of blip of data going across.\n\n46\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.660\nNow, I kinda emphasized this in our\nlast episode where I showed you.\n\n47\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.540\nAnd I said in all reality, right?\n\n48\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.670\nThis is really representation of what is\ncoming across the interface its self.\n\n49\n00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.926\nWhich is just a bunch of blips or\nelectrical signals that come across.\n\n50\n00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:32.734\nBut I also wanna show you something else,\nlet me close out of Wireshark for\n\n51\n00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:34.650\na moment and then I'll relaunch it.\n\n52\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.994\nNow the reason why I'm doing this is\nI want us to pay attention to some of\n\n53\n00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.042\nthe words that are scrolling by,\nright when I relaunch Wireshark,\n\n54\n00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.825\nif it actually ever comes back up here.\n\n55\n00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:49.203\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is right here in the middle,\n\n56\n00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:51.820\nnotice where it says\nregistering dissectors.\n\n57\n00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.744\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, dissectors is kind of the key\n\n58\n00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:59.369\nelement, is kind of where we see\nthe power of Wireshark coming in.\n\n59\n00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:04.304\nAnd what I mean by that is that, is there\ninside of the core engine of Wireshark,\n\n60\n00:03:04.304 --> 00:03:09.560\nthat it takes all of the signal that's\ncoming across the network interface.\n\n61\n00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.080\nAnd then changes it to a,\n\n62\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.020\nI don't wanna say change it, represents\nthat signal in stuff that you and\n\n63\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.460\nI will have a chance at least visibly\nto understand and also be able\n\n64\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.580\nto make some details of it, in other words\nto make it a little bit more meaningful.\n\n65\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.960\nBut when it does it,\n\n66\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.330\nit reports it in three separate\nfashions at the very beginning.\n\n67\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.320\nSo that's what I wanna do,\nto make sure that we understand.\n\n68\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.560\nSo when you see the loading of the\ndissectors there, that's what it's doing.\n\n69\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.120\nIt's saying, here's all the ways that\nwe can take whatever's coming in, and\n\n70\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.200\nput it into different locations and\nplaces dissecting the data so\n\n71\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.810\nthat we understand what\nit really means for us.\n\n72\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.460\nSo, let me take that Ethernet 0 again and\n\n73\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.770\nI'm simply gonna double-click\non the interface.\n\n74\n00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.920\nAnd now, notice here is pretty\nmuch what we call a default look.\n\n75\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.660\nNow, how do I know that this\nis the default profile?\n\n76\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.740\nWell, if I take a look in\nthe lower right-hand corner,\n\n77\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.670\nlet me float down over here.\n\n78\n00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.225\nI'll actually see that it tells me,\nlet me see if I can zoom in there.\n\n79\n00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:10.530\nIt says Profile Default.\n\n80\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.760\nSo there is going to be this view\nthat we end up seeing right here,\n\n81\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.630\nthat tells us, here's the basic\nstuff that we're looking at.\n\n82\n00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.183\nSo in the Wireshark layout that you see,\nwe can take a look at a lot,\n\n83\n00:04:23.183 --> 00:04:26.920\nand what we're gonna focus in on\nof course is the main interface.\n\n84\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.390\nBut let's go through just some details\nright here at the very beginning.\n\n85\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.980\nUp at the top is just a regular,\nstandard type of menu system, that you\n\n86\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.370\nhave available to you, and anything\nthat you can do in Wireshark of course.\n\n87\n00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.010\nYou'll come up here to the menu and\n\n88\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.270\nyou can start using all these\ndifferent things that are available.\n\n89\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.740\nNow, some of these go beyond my skill set,\nsuch as all the telephony stuff.\n\n90\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.700\nI don't know anything about telephony,\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n91\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.190\nWireless, I can kind of handle, and,\nof course, some of the networking stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.930\nBut overall,\n\n93\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.100\nthough, anything that you can do, this\nis every tool that's available for you.\n\n94\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.830\nAs you start using Wireshark more and\nmore, you are going to be, depend less on\n\n95\n00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.540\ntrying to find everything, and\nnotice that they have another toolbar for\n\n96\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.130\nus, which is really kind of\nthe quick start type of toolbar.\n\n97\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.020\nIf I want to begin a capture on a packet,\nI could just have it default to here and\n\n98\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.380\njust click on the little shark fin,\n\n99\n00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.300\nand notice it will start it,\nI can stop a capture.\n\n100\n00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.630\nI can even restart a current capture,\nif I want to.\n\n101\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.700\nAnd of course I have options and\n\n102\n00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.630\nmost of these are grayed out because I'm\nin the middle of a capture currently, so\n\n103\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.480\nI don't have any way of\nchanging some of this stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.580\nBut you can continue\nto go through here and\n\n105\n00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.030\nsee some of these different utilities and\ntools.\n\n106\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.750\nOne of the neat ones for us right,\nso let's say that you can't see it,\n\n107\n00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.330\nI know that by default on Wireshark\nthe font is really small.\n\n108\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.604\nNotice that they have these two\nlittle magnifying glasses, right?\n\n109\n00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Very helpful.\n\n110\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.258\n&gt;&gt; If I select that plus sign,\nyou can now see where I can, look at that!\n\n111\n00:05:56.258 --> 00:06:01.200\nThat'll actually scroll in a little bit so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n112\n00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.569\nSo that's great for guys like me,\nwhose eyesights are incredibly terrible.\n\n113\n00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.998\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, some of the people here\nprobably make fun of me because I say I\n\n114\n00:06:07.998 --> 00:06:11.713\ndon't wanna wear my glasses\nbecause I might seem like a nerd,\n\n115\n00:06:11.713 --> 00:06:12.398\nbut\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n116\n00:06:12.398 --> 00:06:14.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go figure, right?\n\n117\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.240\n&gt;&gt; So there it is.\n\n118\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.710\nI'm zoomed all the way out to\nkind of the normal 100% of view.\n\n119\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.130\nIf I now click on that plus sign,\n\n120\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.812\nnotice I can make that look just\na little bit easier on the screen there.\n\n121\n00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:26.540\nSo I don't always have to zoom in, but\n\n122\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.710\nnotice the rest of the menu bar\ndoesn't actually zoom in for me.\n\n123\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.150\nI'm gonna just put it back down to what\nI believe is close to that 100% mark.\n\n124\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.210\nI may actually be off just a little bit.\n\n125\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.225\nBut that'll make it work for\nwhat we want to do, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:39.225 --> 00:06:41.170\nSo that's fairly easy.\n\n127\n00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.340\nFrom that point, I have,\nof course, a display filter.\n\n128\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.050\nNow we're gonna get into\ndisplay filters and\n\n129\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.210\ncapture filters in the next show,\nour next episode or so.\n\n130\n00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.790\nBut just realize that there's a bunch\nof tools that are available right here\n\n131\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.920\nin front of us.\n\n132\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.060\nNow, the reason why that's important is\nbecause that's where we will be going to\n\n133\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.400\nmanipulate and change things the way that\nwe normally want to be able to see them,\n\n134\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.620\nall those tools up there\nthat are available.\n\n135\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.000\nBut right off the bat,\n\n136\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.560\nas you now see all the information\ncoming in on this interface.\n\n137\n00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.902\nI can see that I don't have\na lot of traffic coming in.\n\n138\n00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:17.500\nIf I take a look at\nthe bottom on the status bar,\n\n139\n00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.910\nI've just got about a thousand\npackets coming in right now.\n\n140\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.786\nAnd that's because I've separated myself\nout so I wouldn't show you all of our\n\n141\n00:07:25.786 --> 00:07:29.807\nproduction network traffic going\nacross the my interface here.\n\n142\n00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:33.192\nI actually put us on the network that's\ndirectly connected out to the Internet,\n\n143\n00:07:33.192 --> 00:07:35.480\nprobably not the best bet for\nmy laptop at this point but\n\n144\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.299\nthat's what we have available to us here.\n\n145\n00:07:37.299 --> 00:07:40.854\n&gt;&gt; But you do wanna consider that\nbecause we could accidentally be showing\n\n146\n00:07:40.854 --> 00:07:44.780\ninformation because Wireshark is\nreally inspecting all that traffic.\n\n147\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.045\nInformation that might just\nbe those little nuggets\n\n148\n00:07:48.045 --> 00:07:50.351\nthat the bad actors are looking for.\n\n149\n00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:54.361\n&gt;&gt; It really is true that there is\na lot of things that can show up here.\n\n150\n00:07:54.361 --> 00:07:56.835\nBut right here,\nthis is what we wanna focus it on.\n\n151\n00:07:56.835 --> 00:08:00.834\nIf there's anything that is overwhelming\nIt's taking a look at something like this\n\n152\n00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:05.110\nfor the first time, and not understanding\nwhat it is that you're seeing, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.550\nSo let's break this down in these three\ndifferent pane's that you see right here.\n\n154\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And notice that the first one up here,\n\n155\n00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.020\nthis is what we call our packet list,\nokay?\n\n156\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.090\nThe packet list, essentially is\ntaking what I was showing you,\n\n157\n00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.410\nthat kind of squiggly line, right?\n\n158\n00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.750\nAnd then using those dissectors and\n\n159\n00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.140\nbreaking it down and\nshowing us just a list\n\n160\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.610\nof just some of the details that they\nwant us to see right at the beginning.\n\n161\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.310\nSo it's just a list of informational\nbits here that you see.\n\n162\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.820\nThe time from the time\nof the original capture.\n\n163\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.720\nSo notice it begins at 0 0 0.\n\n164\n00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.210\nAnd the next one that came in\nis as 10,000th of a second or\n\n165\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.430\nsomething like that and\nit just continues to go up in time.\n\n166\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.670\nSo you can see now where\nit actually does that and\n\n167\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.150\nthis is from the beginning\ntime that you captured it.\n\n168\n00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.260\nSo packet number one, and\nthis is arbitrarily a sign of course but\n\n169\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.790\nit really is about the sequence of\nthe packet and the way that they arrived.\n\n170\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.710\nSource and destination address\nthe protocol that it see all of\n\n171\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.180\nthis information is from those dissectors\nthat we end up seeing there too.\n\n172\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.860\nThe length of that particular frame or\n\n173\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.240\npacket that it comes in,\nas well as a little bit of info.\n\n174\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.400\nIn other words, descriptive\ninformation that Wireshark says\n\n175\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.420\nI can describe this briefly.\n\n176\n00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.560\nSo for example, this very first packet,\nit's just application data.\n\n177\n00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.420\nNow that doesn't mean much to you and\nme because that's just to summarize\n\n178\n00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.750\npiece of information, but\noverall though it's enough to let us know\n\n179\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.030\nif I need to pay attention to it right\naway or maybe I'm not so worried about it.\n\n180\n00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:41.920\nBut that just shows you all of the packets\nthat are going across that interface.\n\n181\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.510\nNow once we get to that point,\nEvery packet, of course,\n\n182\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.870\nhas more information\nthan that inside of it.\n\n183\n00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.410\nAnd that's when you get into\nwhat we call the packet details.\n\n184\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.050\nI'm gonna slide this up by\nhovering between on that bar and\n\n185\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.870\nthen clicking on it.\n\n186\n00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.800\nAnd now we start getting more information\ninside of the actual details here.\n\n187\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.180\nNow when you start to take a look\nat this you can be done on\n\n188\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.920\nany one of these things\non the packet list.\n\n189\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.660\nSo if I select this notice that the\ndetails changes, if I do it again you can\n\n190\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:18.210\nsee where each one of these the detail\npane actually change the information\n\n191\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.970\nthat you see available to you and\nthat's kind of a big deal.\n\n192\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.920\n&gt;&gt; Now Lonnie I knew depending on\nthe packets that you're clicking on.\n\n193\n00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.760\nSome of them have additional\ninformation than the others.\n\n194\n00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.450\nLooking at the OSI model,\nlooking at that extra info.\n\n195\n00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.520\nHow does that relate or correlate there?\n\n196\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.370\n&gt;&gt; This actually correlates directly for\nthose that are really interested in\n\n197\n00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.740\nunderstanding the idea or\nseeing at the first time.\n\n198\n00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.270\nThe OSI model in work in and in action.\n\n199\n00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.600\nThis is the place where you\ncan see that happening.\n\n200\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.960\nBecause all this information right here\nreally does correlate to the OSI model.\n\n201\n00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.280\nIf you think about it,\nit really does make sense, right?\n\n202\n00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:01.550\nSo if I take a look here on the frame,\nnotice it says bytes on a wire.\n\n203\n00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.130\nWell those bytes, they are actually\nrepresented down here, too, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.660\nBut bytes on a wire,\nthat's layer one, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.660\nWe talk about bits or bytes, that's layer\none data and that's all you see there.\n\n206\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.450\nEven though it says frame number 4,\nit's just saying, hey,\n\n207\n00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.000\nhere's how we kind of separate it out.\n\n208\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.590\nThe 54 bytes on a wire, 432 bits and\n432 bits here on interface 0.\n\n209\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.940\nInterface 0, well that's actually\nthe physical part of the interface.\n\n210\n00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.430\nThat is layer one of the OSI model.\n\n211\n00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:38.550\nNotice here, Ethernet 2, well if\nyou take a look at the information,\n\n212\n00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.670\nand we of course have even more\ninformation, which I forgot to mention.\n\n213\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.645\nIf I select the arrow on the left\nhand side, I can drop that down.\n\n214\n00:11:45.645 --> 00:11:46.430\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n215\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.640\nnow, you can see even more information.\n\n216\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.910\nNotice that none of this is really\nabout the data that is coming across.\n\n217\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.000\nEven though I just selected one of these\npackets up here that is about that.\n\n218\n00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.090\nBut everything is all about the physical\narrival of the packet itself.\n\n219\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.590\nTime change from the previous\ncaptured frame displayed.\n\n220\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.020\nFirst time reference.\n\n221\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.120\nLet's see,\nany other information you wanna show?\n\n222\n00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.215\nSo notice that it actually gives\nyou more and more details.\n\n223\n00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:18.755\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, I could imagine,\nif I were to select a different,\n\n224\n00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:21.175\nif I had a filter and\nI put in ARP traffic, and\n\n225\n00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:25.125\nI went to look at the information\nassociated with a particular ARP frame,\n\n226\n00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:29.675\nthere, it would have less information\nthan maybe an HTTP packet?\n\n227\n00:12:29.675 --> 00:12:30.725\n&gt;&gt; It's very possible.\n\n228\n00:12:30.725 --> 00:12:32.385\nIt's all dependent on size, right?\n\n229\n00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:35.425\nSo on that basic layer one,\n\n230\n00:12:35.425 --> 00:12:38.540\nhere, It just depends on how many\nbits that we have available.\n\n231\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.870\nBut layer 2 has that idea\nof the MAC address, and\n\n232\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.080\nthat is where we start associating\nnow with source and destinations.\n\n233\n00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:53.210\nSo notice this now sending us to layer 2,\nand then Layer 3 information, IP protocol.\n\n234\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.200\nSo there's your network layer.\n\n235\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.260\nSo you have your physical layer,\n\n236\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:01.200\nyou have your data link layer information\nand now at layer 3 you have your\n\n237\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.160\nnetwork layer information on your\nsource and destination IP address.\n\n238\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.260\nRemember that each one of these expanding\nout to give a little bit more information.\n\n239\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.000\nAnd then of course from that point your\ntransmission control protocol, TCP.\n\n240\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:22.220\nThat is the transport layer for\ninformation that you're also seeing coming\n\n241\n00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.590\nacross where we get port numbers as\nwell as strings and segment links.\n\n242\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.720\nEverything that you can think about\nthis is where those dissectors now\n\n243\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.410\nhave taken the information\nthat's coming in and\n\n244\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.410\nput it into some more meaningful data for\nus that makes a little sense.\n\n245\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.940\nNow notice that I've\nhighlighted Ethernet 2 and\n\n246\n00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.040\ndown here underneath where we\nactually do get what are called\n\n247\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.720\npacket bytes that go across the wire,\nthat information is highlighted as well.\n\n248\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.230\nSo if I select, say, something down here,\nnotice it jumped down and it showed me at\n\n249\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.350\nlayer four, it showed me that I selected\nthe sequence number that also came in.\n\n250\n00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.060\nIf I click over here it\nshows me the source port.\n\n251\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.980\nSo all of the information that we see,\nit really does, in the raw\n\n252\n00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.350\nformat that we have, that comes from bits,\nit changes it into what we call,\n\n253\n00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.120\nof course, hexadecimal values or\nascii values, over here.\n\n254\n00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.310\nIf you see this information and you can't\nread it, well that just means yeah,\n\n255\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.390\nit's not really meant for you.\n\n256\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:24.020\nThis is that idea of this signal coming\nacross the interface that you get,\n\n257\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.080\nand then it's translating it here.\n\n258\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.710\nAnd then from this point\nit translates it up\n\n259\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.270\nto give you all of this\navailable information.\n\n260\n00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.630\nWireshark then takes it and\ncan interpret it and\n\n261\n00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.530\ngive you a summary of\nthat information as well.\n\n262\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.670\nSo, all of this interface is really,\n\n263\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.490\neven though it looks like three\ndifferent pieces of information.\n\n264\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.730\nIt's really all the same information,\nbut just different facets of it.\n\n265\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.690\nSo, the same thing when you take\na look at a particular object and\n\n266\n00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.170\nyou turn it a little bit this way,\nturn it a little bit that way.\n\n267\n00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.500\nThis is what you're getting to.\n\n268\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.690\nSo some of this might be more helpful for\nother people than you and I,\n\n269\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.000\nsome of it may actually\nbe very helpful for me.\n\n270\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.990\nSo usually for me I'm looking for\nthis information and\n\n271\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.780\nthis information up here,\nespecially on the source and destination.\n\n272\n00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.090\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie,\nI also see Profiles, alright?\n\n273\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.980\nWe're talking about profiles,\nhow can we create different profiles\n\n274\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.690\ndepending on different looks or\nfeels that are more easy for us to follow.\n\n275\n00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.270\n&gt;&gt; Well let's talk about this\nidea of creating profiles and\n\n276\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.400\nwhy we want to, first.\n\n277\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n278\n00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.310\n&gt;&gt; Most of the time, when we first begin\nworking with Wireshark, it's easy to say,\n\n279\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.540\nI don't need to see that information.\n\n280\n00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.510\nAnd then you begin to change a few things.\n\n281\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.010\nOr I don't like the color that's coming\nin, and you begin to change that.\n\n282\n00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.830\nNext time that you launch it up or\n\n283\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.470\nsomebody launches it up on that machine,\nthey look at it and go, what happened?\n\n284\n00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.113\nThis isn't the way that I left\nit when I got to this thing.\n\n285\n00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that can become annoying, right?\n\n286\n00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.270\n&gt;&gt; Imagine that, yeah.\n\n287\n00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.413\n&gt;&gt; All of us do it, right?\n\n288\n00:15:50.413 --> 00:15:52.607\nWe've all seen it where\nwe've tried to sit down.\n\n289\n00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:57.219\nAnd it is, it's kind of weird how used to\nyour setup, the way that you like things.\n\n290\n00:15:57.219 --> 00:15:59.068\nThe problem-\n&gt;&gt; Humans, they really don't like change,\n\n291\n00:15:59.068 --> 00:16:00.092\nthey're creatures of habit.\n\n292\n00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:02.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we really don't.\n\n293\n00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.899\nSo at this point,\nthat means that if you leave it that way,\n\n294\n00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:07.074\nsomebody else has to deal\nwith your changes and\n\n295\n00:16:07.074 --> 00:16:10.331\nmore than likely when you come back,\nthey'll have changed it back.\n\n296\n00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:13.394\nOr they'll have figured out what to do and\nthey've changed all that stuff.\n\n297\n00:16:13.394 --> 00:16:16.240\nWell, this is where it\nbecomes problematic, right?\n\n298\n00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.840\nBecause you may have actually said,\nI need to see this type of\n\n299\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.390\ninformation next to this information,\nand create it the way that I want to.\n\n300\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.385\nBut not everybody needs\nto see it like that.\n\n301\n00:16:25.385 --> 00:16:27.320\nAnd they go,\nlet them get on their own machine.\n\n302\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.800\nThat's one way to solve the issue,\ndon't worry about profiles ever.\n\n303\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.850\nBut it could be though that\nCherokee is a consultant\n\n304\n00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.000\non doing network analysis to help\npeople troubleshoot different issues.\n\n305\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.510\nWell, now she has 10 or\n15 different customers.\n\n306\n00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.530\nBut each customer, she needs to see the\ndata in a little bit of different detail.\n\n307\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.445\nDoes that mean that Cherokee goes to\none shop and then goes, before I can.\n\n308\n00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:53.053\nYeah, I have to do this and\nthis, yeah, let me do that.\n\n309\n00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:53.829\n&gt;&gt; Let me get my other laptop.\n\n310\n00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:55.485\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n311\n00:16:55.485 --> 00:16:56.780\nI should have done this\non the other laptop.\n\n312\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.110\nThat's right, yeah I should\nhave actually remembered that.\n\n313\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.060\nBut instead, what she can do,\n\n314\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.660\nis she can create different profiles for\nmany reasons.\n\n315\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.405\nOne is the exact situation that I told you\nwhere she actually creates a different\n\n316\n00:17:08.405 --> 00:17:11.110\nprofile for\nevery customer that she helps support.\n\n317\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.679\nThat's very possible and that way we can\nset up the way that the look and feel,\n\n318\n00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:18.439\nthe preferences that we\nhave available to us.\n\n319\n00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:19.385\nThe capture filters,\n\n320\n00:17:19.385 --> 00:17:22.740\nthe coloring rules, trying to make\nsure I say everything that I need to.\n\n321\n00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.430\nMake sure that we can do that and\nthat way, it's set up.\n\n322\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:32.280\nWhen she walks into that shop,\nshe can then select that profile and\n\n323\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.950\nbegin to do the capture\nthe way that she needs to.\n\n324\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.200\nNext on the list, the following day,\nshe doesn't have to reset everything and\n\n325\n00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.310\nstart all over.\n\n326\n00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.580\nAnd if you're like me, you get\nfrustrated when somebody does that.\n\n327\n00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.109\nAnd what I do is, I just uninstall it and\ninstall the software again.\n\n328\n00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:48.910\nOr find where it says reset to default and\nthen I'm fine.\n\n329\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.400\nBut we don't have to do that.\n\n330\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.847\nAnd if you are gonna be working in\nWireshark a lot, one of the greatest\n\n331\n00:17:54.847 --> 00:18:00.450\nefficiencies that you can have is the idea\nhere of creating different profiles.\n\n332\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.460\nThe great thing about profiles is\nyou can change all that stuff and\n\n333\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.990\nthen as you work in that, that's fine,\nit will keep those changes.\n\n334\n00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.710\nBut then you can change it back to\nanother one such as the default.\n\n335\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.452\nAnd that way you're no longer actually\napplying that same set of preferences or\n\n336\n00:18:17.452 --> 00:18:19.658\ncolor rules or filters or anything.\n\n337\n00:18:19.658 --> 00:18:22.400\nAnd then you're fine and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n338\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.434\nSo it is really helpful for\nyou then to create profiles.\n\n339\n00:18:26.434 --> 00:18:32.206\nWireshark, at least in the more modern\nversion, I'm gonna say even 2.2.4 here,\n\n340\n00:18:32.206 --> 00:18:37.420\nit's got no limitation on the number\nof profiles that you can create.\n\n341\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.300\nSo this means you don't have to\nworry like some things do, right?\n\n342\n00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.250\nWhere you have a limit of-\n&gt;&gt; Five users\n\n343\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, five profiles or\n\n344\n00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.443\nfive different users, or\nfive different companies.\n\n345\n00:18:46.443 --> 00:18:48.790\nWhich five do I really need to keep?\n\n346\n00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.040\nWhat if you had ten different things or\nlet's do it this way.\n\n347\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.561\nSo let's say that Cherokee does actually\nsupport ten different customers.\n\n348\n00:18:55.561 --> 00:19:00.258\nBut she also has a special profile\nthat she likes to use just for\n\n349\n00:19:00.258 --> 00:19:05.520\ndoing some network troubleshooting\nin a specific way, okay?\n\n350\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.620\nWell she can actually create\nanother profile for that.\n\n351\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.900\nSo she's not limited by the number\nof profiles she can make.\n\n352\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.190\nAlso, and\nwe're not going to do this part, but\n\n353\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:19.160\nif we choose to,\nsince Cherokee mentioned another laptop,\n\n354\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.670\nit doesn't mean that she has to go and\ncreate the profiles on the other laptop.\n\n355\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.790\nShe can also end up taking the file where\nthe profiles are, because they're simple\n\n356\n00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:33.580\ntext files, copying them into the root\nfolder where those profiles reside.\n\n357\n00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.400\nAnd now, even on her other laptop,\nshe can have those same profiles that\n\n358\n00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.830\nare traveling with her,\neven on another laptop.\n\n359\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.290\nSo it really can be very helpful, and\n\n360\n00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.640\nit is something that we should at\nleast understand the basics of,\n\n361\n00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.250\nas we go through and\ntake a look at doing what we need to do.\n\n362\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.370\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna be looking at this?\n\n363\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.050\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna show you\nto how to create a profile.\n\n364\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:53.859\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're gonna do.\n\n365\n00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.482\nSo I'm not gonna do\nanything super fancy here.\n\n366\n00:19:55.482 --> 00:19:56.147\n&gt;&gt; I haven't done that.\n\n367\n00:19:56.147 --> 00:19:59.229\n&gt;&gt; But at least at the very beginning\nwe'll take a look at doing this,\n\n368\n00:19:59.229 --> 00:19:59.790\nall right?\n\n369\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.700\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at creating a profile.\n\n370\n00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.519\nHere, as far as I know,\nis the default profile.\n\n371\n00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:11.050\nAnd the way that I can always verify\nthat is in the lower right-hand corner.\n\n372\n00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:15.860\nNow, it's strange, I didn't really\nfind the option in the menu.\n\n373\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.420\nCuz I thought, of course they probably\nput it up in the menu by this point.\n\n374\n00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.790\n&gt;&gt; But no,\nit's still in the lower right-hand corner.\n\n375\n00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.500\nSo what we want to do is, want to\nright-click in the lower right-hand\n\n376\n00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.300\ncorner, and notice I have three\noptions that are highlighted.\n\n377\n00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.320\nLet me see if I can zoom in to make\nthem a little bit better for us to see.\n\n378\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.260\nThere we go.\n\n379\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.280\nWe have Manage Profiles, we have New, and\n\n380\n00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.820\nwe have the ability to\nSwitch to another profile.\n\n381\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.690\nNow, right now currently there\nare three profiles, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:48.650\nSo if I select Manage Profiles,\nzoom out just a little bit,\n\n383\n00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:53.250\nyou can see where it's the Default, and\nthen there's one based on Bluetooth, and\n\n384\n00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.040\none that is called Classic here.\n\n385\n00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.450\nVery important if you ever want to\ncopy them, is to know the location\n\n386\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.330\nof where this profile folder is,\non your machine especially.\n\n387\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.100\nBecause if you wanna copy these profiles,\nlook at that,\n\n388\n00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.355\nit actually says,\nProgram Files\\Wireshark\\profiles.\n\n389\n00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:11.960\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then you do this.\n\n390\n00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.368\nIf Cherokee wanted to\ncreate her networking ones,\n\n391\n00:21:14.368 --> 00:21:16.727\nshe could actually call\nit Cherokee Networking.\n\n392\n00:21:16.727 --> 00:21:21.576\nAnd then as she creates that profile it's\ngonna create a file right there in those\n\n393\n00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:22.860\nlocations.\n\n394\n00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.319\nThen she can copy that and\ngo to a different\n\n395\n00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:25.239\n&gt;&gt; Just import it to another system.\n\n396\n00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:25.861\n&gt;&gt; Import it to another system.\n\n397\n00:21:25.861 --> 00:21:26.489\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n398\n00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:28.610\n&gt;&gt; And you're ready to go, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:33.010\nSo it really is kind of helpful in\nsome of the things that you can do.\n\n400\n00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.170\nBut the switch between them,\nthat is the key right?\n\n401\n00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.470\nIf you know that you're gonna be\ntroubleshooting some of the different\n\n402\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.930\nthings, or I don't like this default view,\nI can select Classic.\n\n403\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.380\nAnd now you can see it doesn't\nreally look a lot different, but\n\n404\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.100\nlook at how small everything is too.\n\n405\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.820\nSo this changes everything for you.\n\n406\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.460\nSo this is what they call the Classic\nview instead, that gives you\n\n407\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:58.310\nall the information that they want instead\nof whatever the default was set to.\n\n408\n00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.477\nIf I right-click on the Profile in\nthe lower right-hand corner again and\n\n409\n00:22:01.477 --> 00:22:03.740\nI switch back to Default,\nwell, there you go.\n\n410\n00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.560\nIt changes, everything's back to\nthe way that I originally had it set.\n\n411\n00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.700\nThe key, at least best practice probably\nis, don't mess with the Default profile.\n\n412\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.270\nBut can you?\n\n413\n00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.040\nYes, okay.\n\n414\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.750\nIf you wanna change it, and\nyou don't care what anybody else thinks-\n\n415\n00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.707\n&gt;&gt; Create a custom profile and\n\n416\n00:22:17.707 --> 00:22:18.500\nthen modify that one.\n\n417\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n418\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.510\nCreate it, use this as a template,\nand then modify it.\n\n419\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.890\nAnd that's what we're gonna do.\n\n420\n00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.360\nSo let's take a look in the lower\nright-hand corner again.\n\n421\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.230\nAnd then I'm gonna right-click\non Profile and select New.\n\n422\n00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.550\nWhen I do this,\nI've got a couple of different things.\n\n423\n00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:37.050\nBut notice that even from the New,\nit's asking me for a New profile name,\n\n424\n00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.510\nit says Created from the default settings.\n\n425\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.883\nSo it essentially copied the default and\nnow is saying,\n\n426\n00:22:42.883 --> 00:22:45.040\nlet's give this a new name for right now.\n\n427\n00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.630\nAnd we'll call this one,\nlike we said, Troubleshooting.\n\n428\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.734\nOr actually, let's do ITProTV.\n\n429\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:57.998\n&gt;&gt; You're changing your mind?\n\n430\n00:22:57.998 --> 00:22:59.894\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I hate doing that but\nI do it anyways.\n\n431\n00:22:59.894 --> 00:23:03.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we'll just call it ITProTV.\n\n432\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.050\nOn that point I click OK.\n\n433\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.120\nOnce I do that, I need to verify\nthat I have selected that profile.\n\n434\n00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.349\nSo down in the lower\nright-hand corner again,\n\n435\n00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:15.380\nyou'll see right here\nwhere it says ITProTV.\n\n436\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.290\nAt least I think that's what it says.\n\n437\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.380\nYup, ITProTV.\n\n438\n00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.670\nSo now I can start modifying my\nparticular profile if I want to.\n\n439\n00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.750\nSo at this point, there's a couple\nof things that we may choose to do,\n\n440\n00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.240\nsuch as the size.\n\n441\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.148\nI may choose to go ahead and\nenlarge the font size.\n\n442\n00:23:35.026 --> 00:23:41.050\nAlso, I can come up here to,\nwhere is my Tools there?\n\n443\n00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:45.190\nNot Tools,\nthe colors is what I'm looking for.\n\n444\n00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.690\nLet me see where I can, there it is.\n\n445\n00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.072\nI was hoping to actually find the colors.\n\n446\n00:23:51.886 --> 00:23:54.978\nAnd I can find the color,\nwell, no I can't.\n\n447\n00:23:54.978 --> 00:23:55.778\nThere we go.\n\n448\n00:23:55.778 --> 00:23:56.348\nThere it is.\n\n449\n00:23:56.348 --> 00:23:57.696\nI was like where are the colors here.\n\n450\n00:23:57.696 --> 00:24:01.370\nIt's View and then Coloring Rules,\nthat's what I was looking for.\n\n451\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.410\nAnd it's in here that\nI may find something.\n\n452\n00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:09.010\nAnd this is kind of nice because it\nshows you what the default colors are.\n\n453\n00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.100\nLet's say that I don't like\nthis checksum error being this\n\n454\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.690\nkind of black with red background.\n\n455\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.470\nI don't have to actually turn that on.\n\n456\n00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.720\nI can just take that off if I wanted to.\n\n457\n00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.440\nAnd notice you can also export and\n\n458\n00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.000\nimport these into another\nsetting if you want to as well.\n\n459\n00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.440\nYou can even create your own here-\n&gt;&gt; That looks like a good opportunity for\n\n460\n00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.940\na screenshot if you're studying 'till\nlike you memorize the different colors.\n\n461\n00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually something\ngood to think about here.\n\n462\n00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.970\nSo you can do that, and of course\nif you wanted to you can now create\n\n463\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.520\nsome different filters that you can apply.\n\n464\n00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.210\nBut you name it, just changing something\nlike that can be fairly helpful.\n\n465\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.930\nLet's see if I can do something that will\nactually show up a little bit easier here.\n\n466\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.440\nAs I try to just do something, let's see.\n\n467\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.200\nBad TCP, let's do that one too.\n\n468\n00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.180\nAnd then we'll take ARP, and\nwe'll just decolorize that.\n\n469\n00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.480\nAnd click OK.\n\n470\n00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.110\nNow notice that we did, it actually took\naway like the art color you see where it's\n\n471\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.910\nkind of grayed out up here and\nstopping and you know, all that stuff.\n\n472\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.140\nWell, now that's what's happening\nis your profile is now set.\n\n473\n00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.580\nYou don't have to worry about saving it or\nanything else.\n\n474\n00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.430\nBut if I switch profiles from this point.\n\n475\n00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:19.670\nSomebody else is using the machine.\n\n476\n00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.700\nNotice it goes back to\nthe default profile again.\n\n477\n00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.250\nAnd now if ARP actually continues on,\nit should kind of show up and\n\n478\n00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.780\ndo some of the other things that\nyou see right there and available.\n\n479\n00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.070\nSo it's just that simple.\n\n480\n00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:34.290\nWe don't have to worry then about,\ndid I leave it unchanged?\n\n481\n00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.408\nDid I not Changing those profiles-\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's gonna kill me.\n\n482\n00:25:37.408 --> 00:25:38.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; While you switch it very easily, yeah,\n\n483\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.640\nvery quickly.\n\n484\n00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.920\nHopefully not, but overall though,\nyou can understand if you're\n\n485\n00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.410\nusing somebody else's machine and go,\nI don't like the way that they do that.\n\n486\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.090\nWell, create a profile, and\nthen change it if you want to, and\n\n487\n00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.510\nswitch it back when everything\nis actually ready to go, right?\n\n488\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.500\nSo, that's all you have to do.\n\n489\n00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.550\nAnd switch everything back,\nselect ITProTV, and there you go.\n\n490\n00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:03.000\nNotice didn't have to go back through and\nchange the font size, remove colors,\n\n491\n00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.100\nadd colors in,\nyou do this on your own profile, and\n\n492\n00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.640\nnow you can show it in a little bit\nbetter light, add in your own filters and\n\n493\n00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.075\nthen you know that you can do things.\n\n494\n00:26:12.075 --> 00:26:13.070\nSo this is very good,\n\n495\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:17.430\nespecially when you realize that, when\nyou start truly needing to capture data.\n\n496\n00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.950\nSome of the things you really need\nto filter out is your own data.\n\n497\n00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.420\nBecause you don't really care\nabout seeing that so much.\n\n498\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.660\nYou need to make sure that you're actually\nseeing the data that you want to see.\n\n499\n00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.130\nSo it is open and available to you.\n\n500\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.560\nBeing able to understand what you\nsee inside of the layout itself,\n\n501\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.470\nas far as the interface goes,\nis kind of key.\n\n502\n00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.090\nAnd then, of course, being able to create\nprofiles to match what you need to do\n\n503\n00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.740\nis also going to help you to\nbecome much more effective.\n\n504\n00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:46.030\nAnd then you're going where did I remember\nto change that or did I not change it?\n\n505\n00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.280\nYou can do a lot of different things\nthat will really help you to get\n\n506\n00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.560\nfaster and better.\n\n507\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.850\nBut now you have at least\na couple of different tools\n\n508\n00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.030\nto be able to use Wireshark, right?\n\n509\n00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:59.668\nYou now know how to do a basic\nkind of of a packet capture, okay,\n\n510\n00:26:59.668 --> 00:27:04.427\nwhere you just saying hey, this is how big\nit's gonna go up continue let mine run.\n\n511\n00:27:04.427 --> 00:27:09.087\nWe're now up to 2,500 different packets,\nor a little bit under 2,600\n\n512\n00:27:09.087 --> 00:27:13.471\npackets that's fine, but you now can\nalso create different profiles, you\n\n513\n00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:18.334\ncan manipulate the interface that you see,\nand that's just gonna help you to make it\n\n514\n00:27:18.334 --> 00:27:22.978\nfeel more customized and more comfortable\nwith what you want to do as well okay.\n\n515\n00:27:22.978 --> 00:27:26.730\nSo that's actually a pretty good rounded\nportion there of some of the things that\n\n516\n00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:31.870\nwe need to do but we still have a gigantic\nhaystack that we have to get through and\n\n517\n00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.000\nwe're not there though we're rushing\nfinding exactly what we need but\n\n518\n00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.520\nwe'll tackle that in\nan upcoming episode as well.\n\n519\n00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do have a lot of information\nto cover, but at least we got started with\n\n520\n00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.330\nthe inner workings of using that interface\nso thank you for coming in today.\n\n521\n00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.760\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n522\n00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.170\nBut stay tuned, we're gonna be looking\nat some filters coming up next.\n\n523\n00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.220\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n524\n00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.210\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n525\n00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:55.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n526\n00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.663\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n527\n00:27:58.663 --> 00:28:04.615\n[MUSIC]\n\n528\n00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:08.182\nThank you for watching ItPro TV\n\n",

Welcome to your Wireshark's Theories.\n\n4\n00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.510\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.850\nIn this episode we'll\nbe looking at filters.\n\n6\n00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.080\nWe've all ready briefly mentioned\ndifferent types of filters such as capture\n\n7\n00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.510\nand display filters.\n\n8\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.000\nBut with us today in studios, we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.960\nRonnie Wong to really dive deep and\nexplain the difference.\n\n10\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.500\nAnd how we can examine these filters.\n\n11\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.220\nThank you or joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.300\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back\nas we continue on now to and\n\n13\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.780\ndo what we really want Wireshark to do,\nright?\n\n14\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.900\nCapturing all the packets.\n\n15\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.910\nBeing able to see everything.\n\n16\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.720\nIt can be overwhelming, and\nthat's kind of the key, right.\n\n17\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.100\nSo regular packets sniffing,\nthat's where everything begins.\n\n18\n00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.470\nWe have to be able to see\neverything that we wanna see.\n\n19\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.520\nBut at the same time,\nit shows us not only that but more.\n\n20\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.050\nSo it's not that the data isn't in there,\nit's just so\n\n21\n00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.480\nmuch data, more than you actually have.\n\n22\n00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.340\nAnd more than you really want to see.\n\n23\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.960\nAnd this is the reason why we actually\nhave to use something like what we call\n\n24\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.980\ndifferent filters to help us out.\n\n25\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.090\nCurrently for us,\n\n26\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.420\nif we were to take the idea of just\ndoing a packet capturing over time.\n\n27\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.380\nIt can flood our particular\nnetwork adapter so\n\n28\n00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.330\nmuch so\nthat it's just too much to look at.\n\n29\n00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.150\nSo what we're looking for, of course, then\nis that proverbial needle in a hay stack.\n\n30\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.800\nAnd the way that we find it, right,\nis by using different types of filters\n\n31\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.430\nthat are available to\nus inside of Wireshark.\n\n32\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.380\nNow before we do that, right, you need to\nunderstand that there's some impact on\n\n33\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.010\nusing a certain type of filter rather\nthan another type of filter, as well.\n\n34\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.980\nSo let's talk about the two concepts here,\nCherokee, for just a moment, as well.\n\n35\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.677\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I'm really curious to see why\none would choose one type of filter\n\n36\n00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:51.547\nover the other.\n\n37\n00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:52.058\nWhat are we looking at?\n\n38\n00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:54.749\n&gt;&gt; When you start to take a look\nat that idea of the filters,\n\n39\n00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.580\nthere's really two basic types of\nfilters that we use in Wireshark.\n\n40\n00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.146\nOne of course is what's called\na capture filter, okay.\n\n41\n00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:05.540\nAnd then the other one is what\nwe call a display filter.\n\n42\n00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.130\nNow the great thing is\nthe name really gives it away\n\n43\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.790\nabout when a filtering happens, okay.\n\n44\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.050\nWhen do we start filtering the data\nto show what we want it to show\n\n45\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.460\nwhen it happens?\n\n46\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.600\nSo when we start to think and\nwe start to talk about it,\n\n47\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.980\nit's very easy to get confused\nif you don't understand that.\n\n48\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.754\nSo capture filter,\nhopefully the name makes sense here,\n\n49\n00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:33.520\nis that it happens when\nthe capture takes place.\n\n50\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.159\nNow when we start using capture filters,\n\n51\n00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.220\nthis is as we turn Wireshark on and\nwe tell it that we want to capture.\n\n52\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.560\nWe go ahead and we list the filters\nthat we want to be able to see.\n\n53\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.810\nAnd the rest of the traffic,\nessentially, will not be captured.\n\n54\n00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.980\nNow, you have to think about\nthe implications of what that means\n\n55\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.570\nwhen I say that the rest of\nthe traffic is not captured.\n\n56\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.142\nLater on, if you choose to go back through\nnow that you've used display filters,\n\n57\n00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.410\nand go hey, I need to see this.\n\n58\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.990\nI know that it's part of\na capture that I did.\n\n59\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.050\nIt may not be, because when you choose\na filter in terms of a capture filter,\n\n60\n00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.000\nit says, I'm really only gonna capture\nthese things that I wanna capture.\n\n61\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.240\nThe rest of it is no longer there.\n\n62\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.140\nSo you can't rewind the tape.\n\n63\n00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.050\nYou can't go back, there's no history\ninvolved in a capture filter.\n\n64\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.130\nAnd that itself can be where\nnow you've lost information\n\n65\n00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.690\nthat you thought that you had before.\n\n66\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.120\nSo that could be a bad thing.\n\n67\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.750\nSecondly, though, when you start\nthinking about the fact that it has to\n\n68\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.780\nfilter before it captures it.\n\n69\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.530\nIt means there's two process that have\nto go on before the capture, right?\n\n70\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.980\nOne, it has to apply a filter as\nit's entering in the interface.\n\n71\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.160\nTake a look at it and go,\nyeah, this is in the filter.\n\n72\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.840\nLet's let it pass through.\n\n73\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.990\nTwo, another packet comes in and\nit looks and\n\n74\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.570\ngoes hey, this is not part of the filter,\nwe have to drop it.\n\n75\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.480\nSo every single packet that\ncomes through your interface\n\n76\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.880\nhas to face that type of filter.\n\n77\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.340\nSo if you use multiple capture filters,\nit goes through,\n\n78\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.420\njust like on access control,\nthat's where it looks.\n\n79\n00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.200\nAnd goes, hey, it meets this condition,\nor it doesn't.\n\n80\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.070\nBut it has to go through\nthat list to do so.\n\n81\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.380\nAnd whatever the first one that matches,\nit doesn't have to actually do the rest.\n\n82\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.770\nBut at the same time,\nit has to be able to do that.\n\n83\n00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.438\nSo if you have 1,000 packets coming\nin over just even a minute time.\n\n84\n00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:38.100\nThat means that your particular capture\nfilter, right, Wireshark that runs,\n\n85\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.530\nit had to at least make those two or\nthree decisions on every single packet.\n\n86\n00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.920\nThat's a lot of CPU compute cycles.\n\n87\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.770\n&gt;&gt; It sure is, Ronnie.\n\n88\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.180\nAnd right before this show,\nwe actually took a break.\n\n89\n00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.122\nAnd then when we came back, you noticed\nthat your system had locked up.\n\n90\n00:04:52.122 --> 00:04:55.310\nWas that a symptom of what\nyou're speaking about now?\n\n91\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, to a point, and that's because\nthere are inside of the default profile,\n\n92\n00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.530\nthere are some capture filters\nthat have been set up for us.\n\n93\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.720\nAnd I just noticed it then.\n\n94\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.400\nBut know the way that I\nhave my system set up,\n\n95\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.220\nis I've got two different virtual\nmachines running in the background.\n\n96\n00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.770\nAnd this one actually has fairly\nlimited amount of RAM in it.\n\n97\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And also the hard drive is not that\n\n98\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.900\nbig, so it started filling it\nup relatively quickly instead.\n\n99\n00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.660\nSo it got around 6,000 maybe\n7,000 packets and said, I'm done.\n\n100\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.540\nI'm not gonna do anymore.\n\n101\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.833\nAnd that's because I probably ran out\nof RAM at that point and said, yeah,\n\n102\n00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:30.250\nlet's stop that.\n\n103\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.940\nSo it didn't actually try to\nshutdown the entire machine.\n\n104\n00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.910\nBut you will see information like this.\n\n105\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.160\nSo it's very important that we\nunderstand where we go and see this.\n\n106\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.580\nAnd how we can also apply these different\ntypes of filter to what we see.\n\n107\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.900\nSo remember that that's the key, right?\n\n108\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.830\nThe best recommendation as you go and\nyou start and you start reading more and\n\n109\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.490\nmore about Wireshark.\n\n110\n00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.710\nIs that, you know, make sure that if you\nuse capture filters, use them sparingly.\n\n111\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.110\nDon't try and create a whole list\nof them if you don't have to.\n\n112\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.760\nBecause it is, it's a burden on the NIC,\nit's a burden on the CPU.\n\n113\n00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.040\nBecause it has to do all that\nbefore it actually says, okay,\n\n114\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.420\nI'm gonna choose to let\nthat traffic come through.\n\n115\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.230\nSo where in the world do we go, and\n\n116\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.350\nwe start to set up the idea of using\nsome type of filter like this.\n\n117\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.530\nAnd then we're gonna do a couple\nof examples to help us out.\n\n118\n00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.680\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here,\njust briefly right at the beginning, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.420\nThe great thing is if you first launch\na Wireshark just in this basic install,\n\n120\n00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.610\nwhich is what I have here.\n\n121\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.262\n&gt;&gt; I see that word capture-\n&gt;&gt; You can see-\n\n122\n00:06:37.262 --> 00:06:37.838\n&gt;&gt; Is that an indication?\n\n123\n00:06:37.838 --> 00:06:39.030\n&gt;&gt; To a point, right?\n\n124\n00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.163\nBut the actual keyword is right here,\nall right?\n\n125\n00:06:42.163 --> 00:06:42.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n126\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.270\n&gt;&gt; Enter a capture filter, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.420\nSo, right there, you can see, and it looks\nlike there are no other filters right now.\n\n128\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.990\nBut let's see if I click on that little\ndrop down on the right hand side.\n\n129\n00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.510\nNothing, it doesn't look like I\nhave any capture filters set up.\n\n130\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.690\nSo this thing should allow\neverything to come through.\n\n131\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.320\nNow you do have to be careful\nwhen you start to take a look.\n\n132\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.310\nIf I click on Capture up here at the top,\non the menu bar.\n\n133\n00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.680\nNotice that there's also this,\nwhere it says Capture Filters.\n\n134\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.110\nAnd if I select that option, now you can\nstart seeing where it says, all right,\n\n135\n00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.640\nhere is some of the stuff that I actually\nalso want to allow to come in as well.\n\n136\n00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:32.012\nSo this one where it has a MAC\naddress of 00:5e, here you go.\n\n137\n00:07:32.012 --> 00:07:34.990\nOkay, you might actually\nsee something like that.\n\n138\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.150\nNow Cherokee, I don't if that MAC address,\n\n139\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.820\ndo you know what that MAC address\nis about, right there, that 00:5e?\n\n140\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.660\nIt's a special type of MAC address.\n\n141\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.211\n&gt;&gt; Well that's your OUI, and\n\n142\n00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:47.200\nit's probably going to be referencing\nsome type of virtual machine.\n\n143\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.870\nYou've mentioned you're\nrunning virtual machines here.\n\n144\n00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:56.480\nSo it doesn't look like a Microsoft, but\nI don't know the format of a VM OUI.\n\n145\n00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.282\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is not.\n\n146\n00:07:57.282 --> 00:07:58.143\nIt's kind of weird.\n\n147\n00:07:58.143 --> 00:07:59.672\nThis is actually one for\n\n148\n00:07:59.672 --> 00:08:03.426\na multicast Address is what\nit's actually designed for.\n\n149\n00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:04.657\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it's kinda weird,\n\n150\n00:08:04.657 --> 00:08:06.500\nit's saying I wanna see multicast traffic.\n\n151\n00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.460\nThat's what it's essentially saying, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.970\nSo it's weird, but it lets you know that.\n\n153\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.720\nAll right, so a capture filter,\nI'm gonna say multicast traffic,\n\n154\n00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.470\nif it comes in, let's see it.\n\n155\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Make sense?\n\n156\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.140\nOkay, so\nyou start seeing some other ones, too.\n\n157\n00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.050\nNow notice this one here, Ethernet.\n\n158\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.030\nWell, that makes sense,\nwe wanna see Ethernet traffic, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.160\nBut now you start seeing\na negative of that filter as well,\n\n160\n00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.650\nwhere it says, no broadcast, no multicast.\n\n161\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.730\nNow, notice the order that it's in,\nwell this one says, hey allow it, but\n\n162\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.670\nthis one is saying, don't allow it.\n\n163\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.980\nSo which one would actually come through?\n\n164\n00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.500\nWell-\n&gt;&gt; If I-\n\n165\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.040\n&gt;&gt; The first one.\n\n166\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.600\n&gt;&gt; Think about yeah,\n\n167\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.670\nthe way that the firewalls are set up,\nthat's always gonna be one that kind of\n\n168\n00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.790\noverrides the other, right? So- &gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n169\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.890\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what will end\n\n170\n00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:48.720\nup happening.\n\n171\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.490\nSo, you start seeing a bunch\nof this stuff, okay?\n\n172\n00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.410\nSo, they already have some of that setup\nthat you and I don't have to worry about.\n\n173\n00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.770\nNow, if you want to see everything,\njust kind of get rid of these things here.\n\n174\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.480\n&gt;&gt; And\nhow do we change that priority level?\n\n175\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.470\nAre we able too?\n\n176\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.880\n&gt;&gt; Not easily, yes, you can change this,\n\n177\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.690\nI’m not exactly sure on this version,\nthere you go, I can click and drag it up.\n\n178\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.790\nThere used to be, I think, left and\nright or up and down arrows.\n\n179\n00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Where you could change it but\n\n180\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.270\nnow at this point, it looks like\nI can drag down if I want to.\n\n181\n00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.840\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n182\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.800\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, yep, see,\nthat actually did move it.\n\n183\n00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.360\nI wasn't sure exactly because\nI was used to looking for\n\n184\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.430\nsomething that would allow\nme to move that around.\n\n185\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.670\nBut that's some of the stuff you\ncan do right away to help you out.\n\n186\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.820\nNow, most of us, we don't tend to\npay attention to the default ones.\n\n187\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.940\nWe leave it alone because,\n\n188\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.060\nwell, we expect that Wireshark\nwill work right out of the box.\n\n189\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.380\nSo, what we end up doing is working right\nhere the majority of the time, okay?\n\n190\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.570\nSo notice we didn't start a capture yet,\nright?\n\n191\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.280\nAnd that makes sense,\nbecause the capture filter begins when?\n\n192\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.930\nIt begins before the capture\nif you think about it, right?\n\n193\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:53.080\nAs information hits the NIC it now has to\nsay all right, here's my list of filters\n\n194\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.860\nand now as traffic comes through let\nme filter it against that list here.\n\n195\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.280\nSo there's a couple of demonstrations that\nwe want to make sure of that we can do.\n\n196\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's say that what I want to do is I\n\n197\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:09.980\nwant to see only traffic from or\nto a specific host, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.410\nSo here it is, Cherokee, you know that\nthis is the one machine that you believe\n\n199\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.700\nthat you need to see all the traffic\ngoing to it or coming from it.\n\n200\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But not anything else.\n\n201\n00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.370\nWhat you can go ahead and\nput it right in here and\n\n202\n00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:28.790\nsay host and then select your IP address.\n\n203\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.592\nSo let's say this is my IP address,\non my machine here.\n\n204\n00:10:34.789 --> 00:10:39.550\nAnd from that point, you can start\ncapturing as well, if you wanted to.\n\n205\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.370\nSo I don't know why it didn't take it.\n\n206\n00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:47.240\nLet's see, it might not like it here but\nit should be able to, but it didn't.\n\n207\n00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.010\nIt didn't look it wanted to take it.\n\n208\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.190\nLet me see if I can go up here instead.\n\n209\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.597\nThat's kind of unusual.\n\n210\n00:10:52.597 --> 00:10:59.161\nSo I can click here, too, and say, Hosts,\n\n211\n00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:05.125\nsorry, I was trying to think\nof what I wanted to do.\n\n212\n00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:10.300\n10.0 47, 102 and then it's here,\n\n213\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.540\nthat you can also enter\nthat filter as well.\n\n214\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.820\nSo, notice this one where it says host.\n\n215\n00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.250\n10, 0, 47, 102.\n\n216\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.870\nSo, this time it took it out as okay,\nwhy did it turn red?\n\n217\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.440\nIt decided not to take it.\n\n218\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.010\nSo, I can add that in there as well\nfrom that point that traffic should now,\n\n219\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.700\nas we go through.\n\n220\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.530\nNow it's just waiting and you start seeing\nsome of the stuff like the spanning tree\n\n221\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.680\nstuff that's in the background cuz mine's\nactually at the end of the list, right?\n\n222\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.640\nBut now you'll start seeing just a few\nthings that are coming across and\n\n223\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.740\nnotice that that's what\nhappening there at 1.07.\n\n224\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.550\nSo that's actually going from me and\n\n225\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.350\nthen hopefully traffic that\ncomes back to me as well.\n\n226\n00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.210\nThose are the only ones and\n\n227\n00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.400\nyou'll see that at this point\nlike I did in a previous episode.\n\n228\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.790\nLook at the number of packets here.\n\n229\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.070\nIs not a lot I'm down to the 29.\n\n230\n00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.170\nAt this point I'm normally up to\nlike 500 or 600 by this point too.\n\n231\n00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n232\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.460\n&gt;&gt; But you were a real employee,\n\n233\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.140\nwell not that you're a fake employee.\n\n234\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.120\nBut if you were doing work and\nyou're going to different systems,\n\n235\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.470\nnavigating to certain website.\n\n236\n00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.970\nYou would see a lot more traffic there.\n\n237\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right, that's exactly what we end\nup seeing but this is just an example.\n\n238\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.330\nNow can you do the same thing for\nan entire network if you wanted to?\n\n239\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.850\nYes, so you can set a particular\nnetwork up again two or from.\n\n240\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.800\nSo let's say that you have a branch\nnetwork that you were trying to say, I\n\n241\n00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.500\nwanna make sure that everybody connecting\nis connecting from that branch network,\n\n242\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.420\nand you knew what the IP address was, you\nwanna make sure that you can do that too.\n\n243\n00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.970\nJust thinking about in map,\nif you were to scan the entire network and\n\n244\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.150\nthe syntax for that.\n\n245\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.630\nWould we be able to use a subnet mask or\nranges there for\n\n246\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.690\nthe syntax in this tool as well?\n\n247\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.370\n&gt;&gt; You can,\nit really is a little bit more,\n\n248\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.540\nyou'd probably have to add in a little bit\nmore than what you'd expect to add in.\n\n249\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.710\nSo, you do, you end up using the word net,\nand then you can actually do that.\n\n250\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.780\nSo let's show you another\nexample right here.\n\n251\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So here I can give a name, and\n\n252\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.470\nwe'll say no, oops.\n\n253\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.060\n&gt;&gt; Can you zoom in a little bit?\n\n254\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.770\nI'm blind over here [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, it's possible, let me,\n\n255\n00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:07.810\ngive me a second, oops.\n\n256\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.530\nHold on, I've just added in a couple\nof new filters that I didn't want to.\n\n257\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.080\nLet me zoom in.\n\n258\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.858\nWell, maybe, there we go.\n\n259\n00:13:16.858 --> 00:13:23.072\nNow let's say that I don't want or\n\n260\n00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:29.722\nonly network 10.0.47.0.\n\n261\n00:13:29.722 --> 00:13:35.536\nAnd then if I wanted to, I could\nsay slash 24 and then as over here,\n\n262\n00:13:35.536 --> 00:13:40.432\nyou do the same thing, but\nthis time you just say net, and\n\n263\n00:13:40.432 --> 00:13:43.910\nthen you would give it 47.0/24.\n\n264\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:49.930\nSo that's another filter that we can also\nadd in that will again have just that one.\n\n265\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.410\nNow this is strange, right?\n\n266\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.190\nIt's a little bit of counter\nintuitive when you say,\n\n267\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.220\nwhen you only listed like what we did,\nhost and net, you're saying to and from,\n\n268\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.370\nso it's a little bit counter intuitive\nthe way that we would normally do it.\n\n269\n00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.650\nWhich we would put an and\noperator in there, right,\n\n270\n00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.155\nto and our source and destination,\nbut this actually does it all.\n\n271\n00:14:10.155 --> 00:14:12.085\n&gt;&gt; To get that ingress,\nand ingress traffic?\n\n272\n00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:12.755\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n273\n00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:15.085\nwill I have to be\nconcerned with the mount?\n\n274\n00:14:15.085 --> 00:14:19.645\nBecause, you showed us how many\npackets that you were accumulating.\n\n275\n00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:24.405\nBut now if I'm looking at a wide scope\nthere, is my systemgonna handle this,\n\n276\n00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:25.405\nam I gonna crash.\n\n277\n00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:26.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have to.\n\n278\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.280\nFigure out your system right if you only\ngive the system 256 megs of ram probably\n\n279\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.420\ndepends on how many devices\nare on that network as well.\n\n280\n00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.750\nAnd this one max 256 depends on also\nwhere you capture the traffic too.\n\n281\n00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.540\nSo, you have to pay attention.\n\n282\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.810\nI'm just gonna add another one.\n\n283\n00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:47.097\nNow, what if you only wanted it\nfrom that machine coming out?\n\n284\n00:14:47.097 --> 00:14:48.455\nWell you can do it on our sources as well.\n\n285\n00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:57.507\nOnly Source network 10.0.47.0/24 and\n\n286\n00:14:57.507 --> 00:15:06.153\nthen from this one you do src net10.0.47.\n\n287\n00:15:06.153 --> 00:15:09.490\n&gt;&gt; So now we're just capturing that egress\ntraffic from our particular network.\n\n288\n00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes, nice terms, egress.\n\n289\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Egress.\n\n290\n00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:14.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there we go.\n\n291\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.555\nSee I don't know all the fancy\ntechnically terms here.\n\n292\n00:15:16.555 --> 00:15:18.110\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n293\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:23.640\n&gt;&gt; And then, of course,\nthe other way, only destination.\n\n294\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.908\nOops, I have to, my spelling is terrible,\nespecially when I type and talk.\n\n295\n00:15:27.908 --> 00:15:32.830\n&gt;&gt; Mark has, in the chat here,\na developer question for you Ronnie.\n\n296\n00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.730\n&gt;&gt; That should be interesting.\n\n297\n00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.750\n&gt;&gt; He says he found the syntax\nof the capture filter and\n\n298\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.950\nthe display filter to\nnot always be the same.\n\n299\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.820\nIs there a reason why?\n\n300\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:46.090\n&gt;&gt; I think it's just the way that they\nwrote them, because one was written\n\n301\n00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.880\npreviously to the other, and\nI think that they kind of advanced it.\n\n302\n00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.133\nBut they realized that the earlier filters\nworked the way that they wanted it to, so\n\n303\n00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:54.483\nthey never changed them.\n\n304\n00:15:54.483 --> 00:15:56.836\nI don't know why they chose\nnot to change everything.\n\n305\n00:15:56.836 --> 00:16:00.711\nSo you'll see some of the archaic\nthings like that end up happening.\n\n306\n00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:04.161\nEven now, as they've updated the language,\n\n307\n00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:09.031\nif you kind of also end up using\nthe old one, it will still take it.\n\n308\n00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:12.795\nSo if you already learned how\nto do it like in version 1.01 or\n\n309\n00:16:12.795 --> 00:16:15.283\n0.96 whenever it actually came out,\n\n310\n00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:20.090\nyou'll probably see that you can still\nuse those same types of filters.\n\n311\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.480\nIn the display filter,\nit's the same way that you'd do it today,\n\n312\n00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.140\neven though they might have modernized\nsome of the syntax as well, okay?\n\n313\n00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.087\nSo yeah, I'm not exactly sure\nwhy they chose to do that.\n\n314\n00:16:30.087 --> 00:16:36.899\nHere, Destination network 10.0.47.0.24,\nokay.\n\n315\n00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:39.747\nSo you can see where you\ncan separate those out.\n\n316\n00:16:39.747 --> 00:16:44.473\nRemember that the top one here is the same\nas if I chose where I could type in\n\n317\n00:16:44.473 --> 00:16:46.486\nsource net and then the word and\n\n318\n00:16:46.486 --> 00:16:51.120\nover here and then I could have\npasted this one right in after it.\n\n319\n00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.860\nSo you can still use that, and\nthat's probably more intuitive for us.\n\n320\n00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.050\nA lot of this, I can't remember which one.\n\n321\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.699\nIt's either,\nthis is where I get a little bit confused.\n\n322\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.900\nOne of the two, okay.\n\n323\n00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.900\nThe destination or the capture filters.\n\n324\n00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.140\nYou can still use the same things\nthat you learned like in TCP dump\n\n325\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.430\nto filter down the traffic if you want to.\n\n326\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.860\nSo that same terminology and\n\n327\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.305\nthe same syntax that works in\nTCP dump will also work here.\n\n328\n00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:18.757\nSo if you learned it in one, it's fairly\neasy to port over and do it here too.\n\n329\n00:17:18.757 --> 00:17:22.025\n&gt;&gt; That's cool that they do support\ndifferent platforms and those deprecated,\n\n330\n00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:23.320\ndid I say that right, Ronnie?\n\n331\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.184\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I assume so, sure.\n\n332\n00:17:24.184 --> 00:17:25.343\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah,\nanother fancy word there.\n\n333\n00:17:25.343 --> 00:17:27.256\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very, very fancy.\n\n334\n00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:32.285\nNow, one or\ntwo other things that we want to do.\n\n335\n00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:33.685\nWhat about a port number, right?\n\n336\n00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:37.148\nYou want to be able of\ncourse to see everything but\n\n337\n00:17:37.148 --> 00:17:39.519\na particular port if you want to.\n\n338\n00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:42.904\nSo let's take for an example that we go,\nall right, DNS traffic,\n\n339\n00:17:42.904 --> 00:17:45.388\nthat's just flooding my\nscreen on the display.\n\n340\n00:17:45.388 --> 00:17:49.860\nI just don't wanna see it anymore,\ncuz that's not really relevant to what you\n\n341\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.068\nwant, well,\nI can add in another capture filter here.\n\n342\n00:17:53.068 --> 00:17:57.624\nSo let's say this one, All but DNS and,\n\n343\n00:17:57.624 --> 00:18:01.250\nlet's do this, ARP, as well.\n\n344\n00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.710\nSo now I'm doing a combo.\n\n345\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.060\nWe've kinda done separate ones before.\n\n346\n00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:11.442\nSo what I can do is say,\nport not 53 and not,\n\n347\n00:18:11.442 --> 00:18:16.967\nlet's do ARP, oops, It doesn't like that,\n\n348\n00:18:16.967 --> 00:18:20.285\nso maybe I can't do that.\n\n349\n00:18:20.285 --> 00:18:20.802\n&gt;&gt; Lower case.\n\n350\n00:18:22.042 --> 00:18:23.905\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n351\n00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:25.290\n&gt;&gt; I think.\n\n352\n00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.380\n&gt;&gt; We'll see, not arp.\n\n353\n00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.360\nThere it goes, thank you.\n\n354\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.280\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why.\n\n355\n00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.390\nLike you said there, with the syntax,\nit's a little fuzzy sometimes lower case,\n\n356\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.730\nupper case [LAUGH].\n\n357\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.510\n&gt;&gt; But the great thing is,\nit shows you, right?\n\n358\n00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.710\nIf it's in red,\nyou know that you typed it in wrong.\n\n359\n00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that does help.\n\n360\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.303\n&gt;&gt; So here you go.\n\n361\n00:18:42.303 --> 00:18:46.661\nSo the first three, right,\neven though this is actually the same as\n\n362\n00:18:46.661 --> 00:18:51.470\na combination like this one,\nnotice that I can enter in either one.\n\n363\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.050\nSo as long as you type it out and\nit's green, you're probably fine.\n\n364\n00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.554\nIf you don't, you'll do that too, okay?\n\n365\n00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:02.986\nNow, what if you only need to\nsee unicast traffic, okay, and\n\n366\n00:19:02.986 --> 00:19:08.320\nyou wanna drop all of the broadcasts and\nall of the multicast, okay?\n\n367\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.090\nSo only, oops, only unicast traffic.\n\n368\n00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.220\nAnd this is very good,\nespecially if you're looking for\n\n369\n00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.510\njust a conversation between two\nparticular hosts, if you want to do this.\n\n370\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.000\nSo if you just say not, there it goes.\n\n371\n00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.487\nNot broadcast, not multicast there.\n\n372\n00:19:25.487 --> 00:19:27.438\nAnd you are ready to go, okay?\n\n373\n00:19:27.438 --> 00:19:31.468\nAnd so even if we can make all these,\nthe recommendation is don't do it,\n\n374\n00:19:31.468 --> 00:19:34.120\nokay, if you don't have to do this.\n\n375\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.390\nThe reason why is, again,\nit takes a bit of processing power for\n\n376\n00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.130\nit to filter all of this before it\nactually sends it to someplace.\n\n377\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.557\n&gt;&gt; To run through and\nunderstand this complete list.\n\n378\n00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:46.020\nSo it's taking those computing resources.\n\n379\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.694\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n380\n00:19:46.694 --> 00:19:49.750\nSo if you need to remove them,\nfairly simple then.\n\n381\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.740\nSo just like I'm gonna do,\nI just simply select it and\n\n382\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.620\nthen I can remove them as well.\n\n383\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.660\nSo that is just a very\nsimple demonstration\n\n384\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.530\nof using something like\nthe capture filters.\n\n385\n00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.655\nI didn't save them cuz I don't\nwanna save them cuz knowing me,\n\n386\n00:20:05.655 --> 00:20:09.200\nI'll forget that they're there and then\nI'll wonder why the traffic goes away.\n\n387\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.010\nSo best practice, use capture filters\nsparingly is pretty much the key.\n\n388\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:21.860\nThe preferred way of doing this is just to\nsay, flood the entire interface, right?\n\n389\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.720\nLet it capture all of\nthe traffic that you need.\n\n390\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.240\nBecause it is designed to handle\nsuper high speeds anyways,\n\n391\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.157\nsend it on in there, okay.\n\n392\n00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.010\nGet everything that you need and\n\n393\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.100\nthen filter out the content\nthat you want to see.\n\n394\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.250\nSo that way you know that\nyou've got everything, okay?\n\n395\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.400\nAnd that you're not mistakenly\nfiltering out stuff that you\n\n396\n00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.320\nthought that you would've gotten, okay?\n\n397\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.040\nSo there are two different ways, right?\n\n398\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.390\nIt's that glass is half full and\n\n399\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.690\nthe glass is half empty kind\nof perspective that you have.\n\n400\n00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.750\nSome people go, no,\n\n401\n00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.940\nI wanna set all the filters in place,\nand I only want what comes in\n\n402\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.600\nto be just a small amount of subset of\ndata that I really want to examine.\n\n403\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.640\nOther people say, look,\ngive me everything and\n\n404\n00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.730\nthen I'll slowly whittle away and\nfigure out what I need to see.\n\n405\n00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:16.070\nBy doing that, you have a better and\nmore complete picture of things instead.\n\n406\n00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:20.039\nAnd you may even be able to do it quicker\nbecause you are just saying, just give me\n\n407\n00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:23.893\nall the data and then I can use display\nfilters to essentially whittle away and\n\n408\n00:21:23.893 --> 00:21:26.168\nfind that needle in\nthe haystack that I need.\n\n409\n00:21:26.168 --> 00:21:27.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, that makes sense.\n\n410\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.105\nI mean, if you're trying to figure out why\na particular type of traffic isn't making\n\n411\n00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:34.392\nits way through your network, you might\nwanna see what type of traffic is.\n\n412\n00:21:34.392 --> 00:21:37.945\nIf maybe there's a setting with a higher\nprecedence for that type of traffic.\n\n413\n00:21:37.945 --> 00:21:42.313\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the big advantage of this as well\nis that now that I've captured everything,\n\n414\n00:21:42.313 --> 00:21:47.650\nI go ooh, I need to see that other data,\nI have it, it's already captured.\n\n415\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.350\nSo it gives me the ability, even on\nthe fly as I'm capturing information,\n\n416\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.490\nif I choose to, to just say continue\nto capture, but let me go ahead and\n\n417\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.114\nstart filtering it out here.\n\n418\n00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:57.430\nI didn't need to filter it out there?\n\n419\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.170\nJust remove the filter and then you\ncan go ahead and continue to capture.\n\n420\n00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.490\nAnd then put another filter in its place.\n\n421\n00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.900\nCuz you're not getting\nrid of any of the data.\n\n422\n00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.940\nYou're simply saying,\njust display this portion of the data,\n\n423\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.920\njust display that portion of the data,\nand that might give you a better and\n\n424\n00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.960\nmore complete picture\nthe way that you want to.\n\n425\n00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.220\nSo display filters are set to essentially\nwork really after the capture happens,\n\n426\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.750\nokay, as it's coming in if you want to.\n\n427\n00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:27.240\nMost of the time, what I do,\nof course is I get the capture in terms of\n\n428\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.330\nthe size of the capture that I want and\nI just put into a file,\n\n429\n00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.030\nand then I come back later on and\nI run my display filters against that.\n\n430\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.363\nAnd that's normally what helps us out\nto be able to see that as well, okay.\n\n431\n00:22:38.363 --> 00:22:44.194\nNow, the great thing is, right here on the\ntoolbar itself or on the main interface,\n\n432\n00:22:44.194 --> 00:22:49.880\nwe have the ability to enter in\nthe display filters right here at the top.\n\n433\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.150\nYou can see that it allows\nme to type it right here.\n\n434\n00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.833\nSo the great thing is, if you already\nknow some of the basic syntax.\n\n435\n00:22:55.833 --> 00:23:00.313\nAnd I think this where your former\nknowledge if you have it from TCP dump or\n\n436\n00:23:00.313 --> 00:23:04.647\nsome of the other types of packet\nfiltering that you've done before,\n\n437\n00:23:04.647 --> 00:23:07.740\nthe syntax generally ends\nup working right here.\n\n438\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.910\nWe're not gonna do a lot of these,\nbecause you can actually create these, and\n\n439\n00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.990\nthere's a lot of them already prebuilt for\nyou to be able to filter out.\n\n440\n00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:19.613\nYou of course can filter by protocols,\nyou can filter by IP addresses overall.\n\n441\n00:23:19.613 --> 00:23:24.006\nAnd so we're just gonna do a simple couple\nof them, because there's plenty for,\n\n442\n00:23:24.006 --> 00:23:25.598\nI mean, we can spend hours and\n\n443\n00:23:25.598 --> 00:23:29.060\ntalk about every single possible\ntype of display filter I want.\n\n444\n00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.090\n&gt;&gt; But there are some cool cheat sheets\n\n445\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:31.859\nonline-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n446\n00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:35.020\n&gt;&gt; At Wireshark's website to help you\nout with those to see what's available.\n\n447\n00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.751\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n448\n00:23:35.751 --> 00:23:37.910\n&gt;&gt; And, I mean,\nthere's just so many of them.\n\n449\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.490\nBecause there's so\nmuch different traffic out today.\n\n450\n00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.130\nHard to know every single one of them.\n\n451\n00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:46.110\nBut the basic meat and potatoes one that\nnormally, that I'm looking for, right,\n\n452\n00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.080\nis going to be just simple IP addresses\nis what I'm looking for again.\n\n453\n00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.289\nSo the same thing that we\ntalked about in the capture,\n\n454\n00:23:52.289 --> 00:23:53.821\nwe can do kind of the same thing here.\n\n455\n00:23:53.821 --> 00:23:58.266\nI can do an IP, and the nice thing is,\nthey already got some examples.\n\n456\n00:23:58.266 --> 00:24:00.382\nSo let's say that I want this one, but\n\n457\n00:24:00.382 --> 00:24:02.971\nIt's giving me an address\nthat I don't want.\n\n458\n00:24:02.971 --> 00:24:06.772\nWell, I can go ahead instead and\nput in mine, here.\n\n459\n00:24:06.772 --> 00:24:09.280\nSo, lets do 101.\n\n460\n00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.757\nAnd now, if I wanted to,\nI can filter that out and\n\n461\n00:24:11.757 --> 00:24:16.390\nyou can see that currently in my display,\nit went ahead and started filtering it.\n\n462\n00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.470\nI am still capturing packets.\n\n463\n00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.650\nYou can see this.\n\n464\n00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.605\nBut now if we take a look\nbehind my head though, okay?\n\n465\n00:24:22.605 --> 00:24:27.612\nAll right, so we'll actually end up\nbeing able to see this where it says\n\n466\n00:24:27.612 --> 00:24:33.382\nonly 13 of the 1274 packets as of this\npoint that's coming in is displayed.\n\n467\n00:24:33.382 --> 00:24:35.600\n&gt;&gt; Just showing for\nthat particular IP address.\n\n468\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.343\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just for that one IP address.\n\n469\n00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:43.110\nAnd if all of a sudden I go,\nit wasn't 101 I was looking for,\n\n470\n00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.752\nit was 102, I can change that,\npress Enter and\n\n471\n00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:51.524\nnow you can see where it changed\nit automatically here to 621 or\n\n472\n00:24:51.524 --> 00:24:55.296\nabout 47.9% of the packets\nthat have come in.\n\n473\n00:24:55.296 --> 00:24:59.550\nWell, and that makes sense this is the IP\naddress that my machine's actually on.\n\n474\n00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.350\nThat we can also go ahead and\nuse that to help us out, as well.\n\n475\n00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:08.480\nNow, what if we wanted to make sure\nthat we didn't see my IP address?\n\n476\n00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.540\nThe guy that's actually doing the capture.\n\n477\n00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.420\nBut I wanted to see everything else?\n\n478\n00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.725\nWell, this is where we have to apply\nsome of the older ancient syntax, right?\n\n479\n00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:20.465\nBy putting in, of course,\na bang symbol or the exclamation point.\n\n480\n00:25:20.465 --> 00:25:22.210\nLet's see if I can zoom in here and type.\n\n481\n00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.902\nThere we go, a little bit easier.\n\n482\n00:25:24.902 --> 00:25:29.206\nFrom this point here I\nneed to do a parentheses.\n\n483\n00:25:32.013 --> 00:25:36.380\nAnd this is where the spacing and the\nsyntax absolutely has to take place there.\n\n484\n00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.500\n&gt;&gt; And what are you specifying\nwith those parentheses?\n\n485\n00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, once you're doing this\nyou're actually saying that hey,\n\n486\n00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.956\nhere is essentially the not function,\nright?\n\n487\n00:25:42.956 --> 00:25:44.969\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, the exclamation point in this\n\n488\n00:25:44.969 --> 00:25:47.981\ntype of syntax is really saying not-\n&gt;&gt; You're excluding that IP, okay.\n\n489\n00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:51.603\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you're excluding it, yep,\nyou're negating what you're doing here.\n\n490\n00:25:51.603 --> 00:25:55.108\nSo, now I'm saying hey,\nI don't wanna see my own traffic.\n\n491\n00:25:55.108 --> 00:26:00.026\nNow, if I scroll down and\nsee here you can now see where\n\n492\n00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:04.617\nit says look, all the other traffic 52.5%,\n\n493\n00:26:04.617 --> 00:26:10.250\nalmost 53%,\nof the traffic isn't even about me.\n\n494\n00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.280\nSo now, this is us getting to that point\nwhere we are finding that needle in\n\n495\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.520\nthe haystack, right?\n\n496\n00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.180\nI've eliminated all\nthe traffic that I've generated\n\n497\n00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.110\njust by plugging in with my laptop.\n\n498\n00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:26.190\nNow, I've kind of gone down to that point\nwhere I'm only looking at 50% traffic.\n\n499\n00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.040\nWe start adding in now some\nadditional filters in there.\n\n500\n00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.630\nAnd this is where we\nstart to whittle away and\n\n501\n00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.680\nfind that one needle that\nwe're really looking for.\n\n502\n00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.510\nSo, being able to do a combination\nof the capture filters\n\n503\n00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.760\nas well as display filters\nare really going to show us,\n\n504\n00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.710\nor at least get us in that ballpark,\nof what we're starting to take a look at.\n\n505\n00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.930\nNow, sometimes you can also\nfilter in a different way too.\n\n506\n00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.830\nSo, let me show you one last option here,\nokay?\n\n507\n00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.838\nSo, I've just taken away the entire\ndisplay from this point.\n\n508\n00:26:57.838 --> 00:27:00.231\nI can right click.\n\n509\n00:27:00.231 --> 00:27:02.087\nAnd if I now show you the menu,\n\n510\n00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:06.810\nnotice that there are some other\noptions as far as the filter goes.\n\n511\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.260\nNotice I can select this where\nit says Apply as a Filter.\n\n512\n00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.960\nSelected, Not Selected, and, or.\n\n513\n00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.650\nOr I can prepare it as a filter as well.\n\n514\n00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.612\nSo, this one we can see\njust a little bit more.\n\n515\n00:27:18.612 --> 00:27:22.844\nYou can even take a look at a conversation\nfilter, depending on what we're looking\n\n516\n00:27:22.844 --> 00:27:28.140\nat, whether Ethernet, in other words layer\ntwo or layer three information, or to UDP.\n\n517\n00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.430\nSo, there are multiple ways\nwe can create filters, not\n\n518\n00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.880\nnecessarily all about learning the syntax\nbut you do have that ability to do so.\n\n519\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.640\nAnd this one is just a display filter.\n\n520\n00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.750\nI was trying to remember what it was but\nyeah, it's just a display filter.\n\n521\n00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.850\nIt's not a capture filter at this point.\n\n522\n00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.820\nSo, you'll still be able to see that,\n\n523\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:51.300\nand then it will paste it right here\nin the bar just like what we did here.\n\n524\n00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.285\nAnd once we have that up and available,\n\n525\n00:27:53.285 --> 00:27:57.850\nit will give us essentially what we need\nto help eliminate that a little bit more.\n\n526\n00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.532\nSo, you may not remember everybody's IP\naddress like what we were doing here, but\n\n527\n00:28:01.532 --> 00:28:04.732\nyou may be able to spot the one\nthat you have as it goes across.\n\n528\n00:28:04.732 --> 00:28:06.125\nLet me filter by this one.\n\n529\n00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:08.661\nSimply right click on it, select and\ngo filter or eliminate it.\n\n530\n00:28:08.661 --> 00:28:09.683\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n531\n00:28:09.683 --> 00:28:11.604\n&gt;&gt; And you'll be able to do that.\n&gt;&gt; Just eliminating a couple steps.\n\n532\n00:28:11.604 --> 00:28:12.620\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n533\n00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.722\nSo, those are kind of some of the\ndifferent options that you have available.\n\n534\n00:28:15.722 --> 00:28:21.840\nNow, did we really even scratch\nthe surface of how in depth this can go?\n\n535\n00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.740\nNot really.\n\n536\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.160\nThis is really just to get you prepared\nto be able to do some of this.\n\n537\n00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.545\nAnd we may do a little bit more on this in\na couple of later episodes as we develop\n\n538\n00:28:30.545 --> 00:28:32.176\nthis show as it comes along.\n\n539\n00:28:32.176 --> 00:28:32.715\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n540\n00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:37.150\noverall though at least we'll get\nyou started in understanding that.\n\n541\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.970\nGetting the information to\nyour machine is one thing.\n\n542\n00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:44.317\nStarting to make it show only what you\nwant it to show is really when you start\n\n543\n00:28:44.317 --> 00:28:47.563\nto use the power of Wireshark\nthat's available to you.\n\n544\n00:28:47.563 --> 00:28:49.232\nAnd that's what we want to get to.\n\n545\n00:28:49.232 --> 00:28:50.027\n&gt;&gt; And I think we will.\n\n546\n00:28:50.027 --> 00:28:52.215\nWe do have a lot more to cover,\nso stay tuned.\n\n547\n00:28:52.215 --> 00:28:56.670\nWe're gonna be capturing more data in\nthe next series, or show I should say.\n\n548\n00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.467\nBut thank you so much for\ntuning into today.\n\n549\n00:28:58.467 --> 00:29:01.633\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis show, my name is Cherokee Boose.\n\n550\n00:29:01.633 --> 00:29:02.494\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:39.870\nNow, when we started off right, and\nwe talked about the idea capturing all\n\n12\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.820\nthe packets that come in on the interface,\nwell, we expect to see some traffic,\n\n13\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.190\nbut what we're normally looking for,\nthough, is what we call a conversation.\n\n14\n00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.840\nAnd usually, the problem that we have is\nthe conversation is not between my machine\n\n15\n00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.660\nand the problem machine nor between\nthe problem machine and my machine.\n\n16\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.990\nIt normally is between the problem machine\nand, of course, or another machine, okay?\n\n17\n00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.130\nSo at one point in time,\nin terms of networking,\n\n18\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.600\nit was fairly simple to be able\nto capture data like that.\n\n19\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.370\nAnd that was because 20, 30 years ago, we\nwere all using hubs inside of our network.\n\n20\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.070\nNow, 30 years ago,\nI might be a little bit far,\n\n21\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.620\nbut we were all essentially\nusing a hub to connect in.\n\n22\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.265\nNow, remember that what a hub is just\na simple connectivity device, and\n\n23\n00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:28.160\neverybody plugs into it.\n\n24\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.210\nSo if Cherokee and\nI were plugged into a hub, and you were\n\n25\n00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.880\nalso plugged into the same hub, even if\nCherokee was sending data directly to me,\n\n26\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.550\nessentially, you or Nick would also get\na copy of that traffic as well, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.150\nThat's because that's\nthe way that hubs function.\n\n28\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.770\nSo it might be that your particular NIC\nwould get a copy of that data, that was\n\n29\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.530\nreally only between Cherokee's machine and\nmine, but you'd still get a copy of it.\n\n30\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.100\nNow, most of the time,\n\n31\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.510\nthe NICs were fairly easy in\nthe way that they did things.\n\n32\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.400\nThey'd go, okay, it doesn't belong to me.\n\n33\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.430\nIf I'm not the destination, I'll just\ndrop the packet, no big deal, okay?\n\n34\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.454\nSo that's pretty much\nwhat we expect to see.\n\n35\n00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:13.163\nNow, the problem that we have, though,\nis in today's switch networks,\n\n36\n00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:16.323\nwe can't even get a hint of that anymore,\nright?\n\n37\n00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:19.828\nSo Cherokee, when we start talking\nabout the hub and a switch,\n\n38\n00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:24.740\na switch's differentiation is a little bit\nharsher, because a switch only does what?\n\n39\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.880\nIt really only connects\ntwo ports together, right?\n\n40\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's gonna be, hold on\na second, our contingent domain there.\n\n41\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.070\nWe've really eliminated that, and\nwe've created our individual zones.\n\n42\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down\nto it each port, essentially,\n\n43\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.980\nonly directly connects to\nanother port on the switch.\n\n44\n00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.756\nSo I have a five-port switch, or\na six-port switch, eight-port switch.\n\n45\n00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:48.990\nIf I'm sending from port number\none to port number eight,\n\n46\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.590\nthe port number two through seven,\nthey don't even see the traffic.\n\n47\n00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.020\nSo, me just taking my computer\nwith Wireshark on it, and\n\n48\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.000\nplugging into port number five, doesn't\nmean I can capture the traffic between\n\n49\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.820\nport number one and\nport number eight, okay?\n\n50\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.842\nSo that's where we have some problems\nin terms of using Wireshark to\n\n51\n00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:14.141\ncapture what data between what we\nthink that we need to capture, okay?\n\n52\n00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.977\nSo let's make sure that we understand what\ntypes of data we are normally going to\n\n53\n00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:23.173\nend up seeing when we plug Wireshark\ninto a switched network, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:24.385\nSo let's take a look at my machine.\n\n55\n00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:27.975\nI just wrote down four different words\nhere to make sure that I remembered what\n\n56\n00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:30.180\nthey were more than anything else here.\n\n57\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.200\nThere's four possible types\nof traffic that you and\n\n58\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.400\nI will see if we take our machine, and\nwe plug Wireshark directly into it.\n\n59\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.540\nThe first and foremost is broadcast, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.120\nWell, broadcast is when you take a look\nat the way that a switch functions.\n\n61\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.200\nWhen a switch receives a broadcast\ninto the switch from a single port,\n\n62\n00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.830\nit automatically floods it out every other\nport, except for the one it came in on.\n\n63\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.080\nThat's just the way\nit's designed to do it.\n\n64\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.550\nSo it knows how to do that, and\n\n65\n00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.900\nit sends it out to a broadcast type\nof MAC address, is what it does.\n\n66\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.141\nSo usually, you might end up seeing where,\n\n67\n00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:13.230\nlet me see if I can do this here,\nthe MAC address turns out to be all Fs.\n\n68\n00:04:15.137 --> 00:04:17.579\nOops, let me do one more.\n\n69\n00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.600\nIt doesn't look as [LAUGH]\nbold as I expected it to look.\n\n70\n00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.660\nI don't know why.\n\n71\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.830\nThere we go, a little bit better.\n\n72\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n73\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.633\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so normally, it turns out\nto actually look like all Fs here.\n\n74\n00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:32.885\nNow, you might see it actually written\nin two, and then with dashes or\n\n75\n00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:35.048\ndots in between,\nwhether it might be colons.\n\n76\n00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:36.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, colons.\n\n77\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.450\n&gt;&gt; So you might have that,\n\n78\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.800\nbut this is normally where you will\nsee the destination Mac address.\n\n79\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.470\nIt will be there, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.664\nBut in a Multicast, though, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:45.664 --> 00:04:47.401\nA Multicast traffic is\ndesigned to do this.\n\n82\n00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:51.220\nLet's take that eight-port switch for\nan example, right?\n\n83\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.640\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; If Cherokee's machine sends out\n\n84\n00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.334\na Multicast, it might only began to\npush number two, four and six, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:00.120\n&gt;&gt; Only members of that Multicast group?\n\n86\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nonly members of that Multicast group.\n\n87\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.630\nAll right, Cherokee,\ngo ahead, all right, cool.\n\n88\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.840\nSo when we have something like that,\n\n89\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.790\nit doesn't disturb every single\nport on that switch, but\n\n90\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.120\nwe might be part of that Multicast\ngroup where we also get that traffic.\n\n91\n00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.190\nAnd if we do that, that normally\nmeans that that particular Multicast,\n\n92\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.260\nit has a destination MAC address\nusually of something like this.\n\n93\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.460\nAnd this is what we were talking\nabout in the earlier episode here\n\n94\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.240\nwhere it's 5E, oops, I can't, E.\n\n95\n00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.087\nAnd then it's anything else that follows.\n\n96\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.090\nSo normally for us,\nit goes from 5E01, or actually 00,\n\n97\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.800\nall the way through 5E, and\nthen all Fs, here is what it can go to.\n\n98\n00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.510\nSo that's a Multicast address.\n\n99\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.378\nAnd so I tricked Cherokee last time\nwhen we did the display filter or\n\n100\n00:05:54.378 --> 00:05:59.025\ncapture filter and say, hey, does that\nMAC address look a little bit strange?\n\n101\n00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.430\nWell, it's the ending of the 5E\nthat always gives it away for me.\n\n102\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.654\n&gt;&gt; The broadcast is easy to remember.\n\n103\n00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:04.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, broadcast is easy.\n\n104\n00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:05.262\n&gt;&gt; Why didn't you ask me about that one?\n\n105\n00:06:05.262 --> 00:06:07.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this one is so much, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.344\nNow, the other one is a little\nbit harder to identify, and\n\n107\n00:06:11.344 --> 00:06:14.521\nthat is because of what we\ncall is an Unknown Unicast.\n\n108\n00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:18.128\nNow Cherokee, have you ever heard\nof an Unknown Unicast for this?\n\n109\n00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:21.940\n&gt;&gt; Unknown Unicast, no, I don't know.\n\n110\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.858\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not that it's uncommon,\nbut most of us don't know about this,\n\n111\n00:06:25.858 --> 00:06:28.591\nbecause we don't think about\nit in this term, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:30.798\nBut think about a couple things\nthat can happen on a switch, right?\n\n113\n00:06:30.798 --> 00:06:31.462\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n114\n00:06:31.462 --> 00:06:34.060\n&gt;&gt; I know that if I\nwanted to send data from\n\n115\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.600\nmy machine over to Cherokee's machine,\nthe switch says what?\n\n116\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay, wait.\nI have an idea.\n\n117\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.088\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; I could be totally wrong here.\n\n118\n00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:42.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n119\n00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.790\n&gt;&gt; If it doesn't have that MAC\naddress already in the cam table or\n\n120\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.760\nthat memory table in the switch.\n\n121\n00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.010\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n122\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.342\nSo remember-\n&gt;&gt; I remember when Cisco,\n\n123\n00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:51.406\na little bit about that now,\nokay, all right.\n\n124\n00:06:51.406 --> 00:06:52.838\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, see.\n\n125\n00:06:52.838 --> 00:06:55.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's where we\nnormally hear about it is Cisco.\n\n126\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.180\nSo that's why I said we're not trying to\nimpress you with Cisco knowledge, but\n\n127\n00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.240\nI didn't wanna bring in\nmore than we have to.\n\n128\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.140\nSo we just talk about the idea\nof an Unknown Unicast.\n\n129\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.303\nIt is possible that Cherokee's machine\nsends something out to a MAC address\n\n130\n00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:13.914\nthat's not already inside of the MAC\naddress table on that switch.\n\n131\n00:07:13.914 --> 00:07:15.490\nVery possible, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.819\nNow, the switch still has to\nmake a decision with that, and\n\n133\n00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.100\nit's only got three decisions it can make.\n\n134\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.230\nForward the data to whatever\nother port it wants to go to,\n\n135\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.390\nflood the data out every other port,\nor drop it.\n\n136\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.010\nAnd that's pretty much\nall that it has there.\n\n137\n00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.930\nAn Unknown Unicast says it's\nnot in my MAC address table but\n\n138\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.430\nthe way that the switch works.\n\n139\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.910\nOr I like to give it human\ncharacteristics here.\n\n140\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.770\nThe way that a switch works is it goes,\n\n141\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.890\nlook, I don't see it in\nmy MAC address table.\n\n142\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.170\nBut overall, though,\nCherokee is sending it there,\n\n143\n00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.190\nwhich means she might know\nsomething that I don't.\n\n144\n00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.507\nAnd it plugged in,\nit's just not responding now.\n\n145\n00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:59.744\nSo all I have to do is get that\nparticular device to respond.\n\n146\n00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:03.140\nThe easiest way to do this is\nto flood out every other port.\n\n147\n00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.090\nAnd then maybe it will actually\nreturn a response to that as well.\n\n148\n00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.618\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie,\nif the switch is able to find that device,\n\n149\n00:08:10.618 --> 00:08:14.221\nwill it then add the information\nto its memory table there?\n\n150\n00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:15.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really will.\n\n151\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.490\nSo because of the way that\nthe switch does think that\n\n152\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.730\nCherokee's computer knows more\nthe network than it does.\n\n153\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.410\nIt just assumes that when it\ndoes that flooding out everyone\n\n154\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.070\nthat somewhere along the line it's gonna\nget the response of that MAC address.\n\n155\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.020\nAnd if it's out there,\nit will go ahead and\n\n156\n00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.875\nadd that back into the MAC address table.\n\n157\n00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:36.515\nAnd if it does that\nthen everything's good,\n\n158\n00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:40.315\nfrom that point on it will be unicast\ntraffic and we're ready to go, okay.\n\n159\n00:08:40.315 --> 00:08:44.705\nSo it can do that, but if it's not there,\nit will just continue to try and\n\n160\n00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:49.845\nflood it out every port until your\nmachine says, I'm gonna stop sending.\n\n161\n00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:56.365\nAnd ultimately though, if I am plugged\nthen to that 8-port switch with my machine\n\n162\n00:08:56.365 --> 00:09:00.444\nand I'm running Wireshark, The only other\nthing that I should get is a Unicast,\n\n163\n00:09:00.444 --> 00:09:01.988\nokay now that makes sense, right?\n\n164\n00:09:01.988 --> 00:09:03.516\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Unicast is directly from one\n\n165\n00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:06.910\nMac address to another Mac address and\nthat's what we have here.\n\n166\n00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.210\n&gt;&gt; So this is just a specific Mac address,\nnow this one's not so\n\n167\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.425\nmuch to find as much\n\n168\n00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:13.380\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n169\n00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:20.196\nSo this is just a unique Mac address,\nif I can spell unique MAC address.\n\n170\n00:09:20.196 --> 00:09:26.380\n[LAUGH] All right, now this is important.\n\n171\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.180\nThe reason why this is important is\nbecause if anything I remember getting\n\n172\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.780\nwrong at the beginning is I\nremember plugging my laptop in.\n\n173\n00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.780\nAnd then going all right, so\nI can't see anybody else's traffic,\n\n174\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.390\nwell, that's exactly right.\n\n175\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.840\nBecause that's what\na switch is designed to do,\n\n176\n00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.760\nit's designed to only show\nyou traffic that's what?\n\n177\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.980\nThat's either destined for you,\nokay, or leaving from you.\n\n178\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.559\n&gt;&gt; That's the whole point of it.\n\n179\n00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:50.447\n&gt;&gt; The ingress and the egress.\n\n180\n00:09:50.447 --> 00:09:51.655\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the ingress and the egress.\n\n181\n00:09:51.655 --> 00:09:52.510\n&gt;&gt; To reduce the traffic, right?\n\n182\n00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.093\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's to reduce the amount\nof traffic that you end up seeing.\n\n183\n00:09:56.093 --> 00:09:59.626\nSo it makes sense, but\nI'm running Wireshark for\n\n184\n00:09:59.626 --> 00:10:03.740\nspecific reasons Charity\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you're trying to capture that.\n\n185\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.750\nYou really need to do things\na little different way.\n\n186\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.180\nSo if you gotta think about that, right?\n\n188\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.540\nSo just plugging in to that switch,\n\n189\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.970\nit's not what will prior\nlead you to the end result.\n\n190\n00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:20.140\nAnd that's why we call this show\nthe idea here of course of capturing\n\n191\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.780\nunicast traffic.\n\n192\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.629\nThere's a couple of things that you may\nhave to do before you can capture somebody\n\n193\n00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:29.317\nelse's unicast traffic, cuz that's\nnormally what we're doing, right?\n\n194\n00:10:29.317 --> 00:10:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Well number one is permission,\nright Ronnie?\n\n195\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.140\nYeah?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, well ideally, yeah,\n\n196\n00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:34.790\nabsolutely.\n\n197\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.320\nYeah, you don't want to do this\nwithout somebody's permission here.\n\n198\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.440\nBut if you're hired as\na consultant to try and\n\n199\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.150\nfigure this out you probably\nhave their permission.\n\n200\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.370\nBut yes, let somebody know that you\nare capturing their data if you need to.\n\n201\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:50.010\nThat is always good but\njust kind of think about this idea right?\n\n202\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.830\nIs that now, you need to go right so\n\n203\n00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:57.970\nif I can't do that on a switch because I'm\nplugging that one port then what can I do?\n\n204\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.550\nAnd there's several options\nthat you have available here.\n\n205\n00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.230\nAny switch network not all of them\nare the greatest options in the world some\n\n206\n00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.240\nof them are great but some of them are\ncostly so it's that balance that you have\n\n207\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.180\nto kind of you know take in hand there and\nlet's talk about each one just briefly.\n\n208\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; So one of the things that I could do\n\n209\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.190\ndepends on whether or not you\nare allowed to do this or not, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.070\nIs that if you suspect that\none machine on your network so\n\n211\n00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:30.340\nlet's say it's Cherokee, and she's plugged\ninto port number eight on that machine,\n\n212\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.630\nin theory I can just go ahead and do this,\nI can find a little four port hub, okay.\n\n213\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.280\nI can plug that four port hub you\nknow into the wall socket and\n\n214\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.000\nthen take Cherokee's network\nadaptor cable Plug it into the hub.\n\n215\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000\nI can plug mine into the hub and\nthen plug hers into the switch.\n\n216\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.940\nPlug that hub directly into the switch.\n\n217\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.732\n&gt;&gt; And you're just daisy-chaining\nthat right into the switch.\n\n218\n00:11:53.732 --> 00:11:58.585\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and now I've got essentially\ntwo devices plugged into a hub that's\n\n219\n00:11:58.585 --> 00:12:00.870\nthen plugged into a switch.\n\n220\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.980\nSo let me see if I can make that a little\nbit more clear for us instead here.\n\n221\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.090\nSo we'll do a little of\ndynamic drawing right.\n\n222\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.770\n&gt;&gt; On the fly.\n&gt;&gt; On the fly here.\n\n223\n00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.210\nNot always the greatest thing for\nme, but we'll go ahead and try it.\n\n224\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:19.090\nSo let's say that this switch\nhere represents a switch, and\n\n225\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.810\nwe'll take this device, whatever it is and\nwe'll say that that represents a HUB for\n\n226\n00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.720\nus, and\nnow if I can find a couple of laptops.\n\n227\n00:12:29.807 --> 00:12:32.100\nAnd that will help us out here, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.789\nSo what we're saying is that if originally\nCherokee was plugged directly into\n\n229\n00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:42.878\nthe switch, now we take that direct\nconnection into the switch and\n\n230\n00:12:42.878 --> 00:12:44.207\nwe plug into the hub.\n\n231\n00:12:44.207 --> 00:12:49.335\nThen we take Cherokee's machine and\nwe plug that into the hub,\n\n232\n00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:54.570\nand then we take mine, and\nalso plug that into the hub as well.\n\n233\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.090\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's gonna be because my\nmachine is also receiving that broadcast,\n\n234\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.160\nbecause like you just mentioned,\nthat hub's gonna flood out of all ports,\n\n235\n00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.330\nregardless if I really want\nthat information or not.\n\n236\n00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.320\nThat's true, yeah, you're actually gonna\nget everything that comes across here.\n\n237\n00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.230\nIf now, I turn on Wireshark, right?\n\n238\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.725\nWell, what is the nature of\nthe hub as data is now sent\n\n239\n00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:22.933\nthrough here to Cherokee's machine, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:22.933 --> 00:13:24.970\nWell, if data is coming here to Cherokee's\nmachine You've got to remember that what\n\n241\n00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:30.600\nthe hub will do is that a copy\nof it will go to Cherokee, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.780\nBut at the same time, oops, if I can\nmake this happen, a copy of it will also\n\n243\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:42.370\nget sent to well, me, from the way that\nthe hub actually ends up working, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.050\nSo the hub actually just\nrepeats the data out every\n\n245\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:51.000\nother port, and\nthat is what will end up happening.\n\n246\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.237\nSo from the hub, I'll get that, so this\nis where I could turn on Wireshark and\n\n247\n00:13:56.237 --> 00:14:01.416\nnow see that whoever Cherokee is\ncommunicating with, if there is a server.\n\n248\n00:14:01.416 --> 00:14:07.180\nOr let's just put a desktop on the other\nside of this, [BLANK AUDIO] So\n\n249\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:13.580\nthere is the data link and now this\nguy is also plugged in here, okay.\n\n250\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.520\nSo if we can do something like\nthis,it really does allow\n\n251\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.260\nus to see that traffic now between\nCherokee's machine and this one as well.\n\n252\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:28.690\nNow there are or limitations behind this\nthing that we have to worry about, okay?\n\n253\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:34.490\nThe caveat here is purely simple, usually\nthese hubs are like 10 megabit hubs, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.369\nSo if I have a 100 megabit nic, and\nthis guy sending a 100 megabytes and\n\n255\n00:14:38.369 --> 00:14:41.923\nyou're now going through 10 megabytes\nWill it capture a lot of it?\n\n256\n00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.590\nCould drop a lot of it too?\n\n257\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.860\nYeah cuz it can bottom that\neasily as we do this, so\n\n258\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.680\nthis is not the best, but, will it work?\n\n259\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.920\nProbably.\nIt will probably work\n\n260\n00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.890\nthe majority of the time for\nwhat we normally need to do.\n\n261\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.540\nThis is something simple,\nideally, instead of a hub here,\n\n262\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.120\njust like I have,\nwe could put in a network tap.\n\n263\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:08.570\nNetwork taps normally are at least\ninterface speeds gigabit speeds,\n\n264\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.580\nor high and\nthis allows us just the same thing.\n\n265\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.090\nWe don't have a bottleneck in\nplace everything will work\n\n266\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.340\ndo exactly what we need to do.\n\n267\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.910\nWhen that narrows up is just functions and\npass through and sends a copy of that\n\n268\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.420\ntraffic to me at the same time as\nactually gone Jacky no bomb make it all.\n\n269\n00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.650\nSo you have a hub you have a network\ntap a bit more expensive but\n\n270\n00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.590\nat the same time it actually works\nThe only thing that you'd have to\n\n271\n00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.530\ndo of course is get it\nphysically in place.\n\n272\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.120\nSo there are limitations even with\ndoing that to remember, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.890\nThe other option is what we call\nEnciso World Cup Span, right?\n\n274\n00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.994\nThe idea of that ability to go ahead and\n\n275\n00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:50.817\ncopy traffic that's coming off of one\nport and send it to another port.\n\n276\n00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:55.490\nNow this will work, but it can cause some\nlimitations on your particular switch,\n\n277\n00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.210\ndepending on the model\nof switch that you have.\n\n278\n00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.446\nSo, if you're doing this and\nyou have a really busy network,\n\n279\n00:16:01.446 --> 00:16:05.679\nit can cause a bottleneck, cuz it has to\nstop essentially all the traffic and make\n\n280\n00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:10.360\na copy of it, and then send it to that\nother port, is what we'd have to do, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.260\nSo that's what we're talking about\nwhen we start to take a look, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.010\nSo those are kinda the three\nways that we can deal with this.\n\n283\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.600\nEach one of those will\nessentially give me that\n\n284\n00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.740\nidea of the unicast traffic that we have.\n\n285\n00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.980\nSo let's see if we can\ntest this out as well.\n\n286\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.720\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, if I was using\na non Cisco piece of equipment,\n\n287\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.760\nwould that just be called port mirroring,\nor?\n\n288\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Port mirroring, you might hear\ndifferent terminology for it.\n\n289\n00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.400\nBut spam is kinda the one\nthat we're doing,\n\n290\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.880\ncuz I have a Cisco switch right here.\n\n291\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But overall, though, yeah.\n\n292\n00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.380\nPort mirroring is usually the terminology\nthat you'll also hear that's available.\n\n293\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.680\nSo, remember that if your network is busy,\neven though it will work,\n\n294\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.450\nit will cause a slow down in your network.\n\n295\n00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.240\nEspecially if you have a ton of\ntraffic going across that port.\n\n296\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.110\nNow, you do have to worry about\nplacement of the capture, too, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:57.240\nSo, if I wanna capture, let's say, all\nthe traffic in my entire network, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.400\nThe interface that I\nreally want to capture,\n\n299\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.080\nessentially, is the one that\nis going to the router, okay?\n\n300\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.410\nBecause everybody goes\nthrough there to get outside.\n\n301\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.506\nSo, if I wanna capture that traffic,\nthat's exactly where I would actually\n\n302\n00:17:10.506 --> 00:17:13.696\nnormally put that in and\nthen we would be over and done with.\n\n303\n00:17:13.696 --> 00:17:18.250\nThis is great if I only wanna capture\ndata going to and from this one, okay, or\n\n304\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.660\nmy machine.\n\n305\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.500\nBut overall though,\nyou wanna capture everybody's,\n\n306\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.660\nit's probably gonna be\nthis one right here.\n\n307\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.210\nThen I'm gonna send the copy of that\ndata over to, well this port here.\n\n308\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.700\nAnd that way I'll also get a copy of it.\n\n309\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.460\nNow this is not something you\ncan do inside of Wireshark.\n\n310\n00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.180\nThat's the other limitation too.\n\n311\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.510\nIt requires you to have\na little bit more skill.\n\n312\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.852\nThose devices,whether\nit is a Cisco switch or\n\n313\n00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:46.185\nwhatever type of switch it is,to be able\nto implement this type of mirroring, okay.\n\n314\n00:17:46.185 --> 00:17:50.678\nSo the great thing about the Cisco switch\nis that it is relatively easy to do so\n\n315\n00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:53.788\nunless you can't type like\nI can't type very well.\n\n316\n00:17:53.788 --> 00:17:58.721\nSo let's see if I can get into\nthis switch here,that I have to\n\n317\n00:17:58.721 --> 00:18:01.450\nkinda plug back in my connector.\n\n318\n00:18:03.753 --> 00:18:05.320\nRestart that connection there it is.\n\n319\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.732\nSo I'm now in switch one.\n\n320\n00:18:06.732 --> 00:18:08.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n321\n00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.400\n&gt;&gt; Now the good thing is I know\nthe port that I need to go to.\n\n322\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.160\nSo if I want to turn on port miring\nessentially for my Cisco switch here.\n\n323\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:23.610\nI just simply do monitor session 1 and\n\n324\n00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.432\nthen the source, interface,\n\n325\n00:18:28.432 --> 00:18:33.450\nfastethernet, if I can spell it, 0/1.\n\n326\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.530\nSo, this is where it's saying, hey,\n\n327\n00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.490\ncapture the information on\nthis particular interface.\n\n328\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.669\nSo, that's going to be my source.\n\n329\n00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:47.955\nThen I'm gonna hit my up arrow cuz it can\nessentially repeat the entire command and\n\n330\n00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:51.773\nchange this instead of\nsource to destination, and\n\n331\n00:18:51.773 --> 00:18:56.065\nthe interface that I'm\nplugged into is gonna be 0/2.\n\n332\n00:18:56.065 --> 00:19:00.240\nThat's where I'm telling it to send\na copy of that information to.\n\n333\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.300\nSo now that's what the switch will do.\n\n334\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.500\nIt will take all of the information\nthat's coming on port one, and\n\n335\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.820\nsend a copy of it over here to port two,\nis what we'll see.\n\n336\n00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.020\nSo on this particular network,\nover here, okay, I have Client01, and I\n\n337\n00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:21.940\nalso have another machine right over here,\nwhich is another server, okay?\n\n338\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.763\nNow if I go ahead and connect,\nlet's say I can connect to ITProTV,\n\n339\n00:19:26.763 --> 00:19:29.630\nlet's see if I can get that started.\n\n340\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.780\nWell now I've connected out to the\nInternet and remember that my machine is\n\n341\n00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.050\nactually plugged in to one of the switch\nports on this machine which is at port 02.\n\n342\n00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:42.810\nNow I can capture the data,\nif it wasn't plugged in to port 02,\n\n343\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.220\nwell then I wouldn't\nbe able to capture it.\n\n344\n00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.920\nIt'd just be on its own LAN,\nits own VLAN, or\n\n345\n00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.720\non its own ports so\nit's not sending any other data to it.\n\n346\n00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.370\nSo let's see what a difference\nthis makes on my machine then.\n\n347\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:02.911\nSo if I now run Wireshark We should\nsee something that we normally\n\n348\n00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.950\nwouldn't see if we weren't trying to do\nthis idea of the port mirroring here.\n\n349\n00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:12.167\nI need to find the correct\nnetwork adapter which I believe\n\n350\n00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:16.634\nis gonna be, let's see,\nit was 04 last time.\n\n351\n00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:24.130\nIt's not that one, it is,\nI think it's gonna be that one.\n\n352\n00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.230\nI could be wrong.\n\n353\n00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.020\nThere we go, okay.\n\n354\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.240\nSo this,\n\n355\n00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.600\nI have to guess at this point because\nI've done it a couple of times here.\n\n356\n00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.250\nNow let's take a look at something\nthat we normally wouldn't see, right.\n\n357\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.310\nRemember, that for\nus on the unicast traffic, right,\n\n358\n00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.400\nif we were just to plug into the switch.\n\n359\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.050\nThe only unicast traffic\nI should see is what?\n\n360\n00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.740\nEither from me-\n&gt;&gt; Your machine.\n\n361\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.220\n&gt;&gt; Or leaving me.\n\n362\n00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.360\nOkay, so ingress and egress as Cherokee\nlikes to use the fancy words here, okay.\n\n363\n00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n364\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.060\nnotice here on the very first, one, okay?\n\n365\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:02.452\nLook at this Cherokee, this is not to me,\nbecause I'm like 45.1.10 or\n\n366\n00:21:02.452 --> 00:21:06.708\nsomething, 10.0.45.110, but\n\n367\n00:21:06.708 --> 00:21:11.300\nnotice this is 65.152.108.11 and\n\n368\n00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.680\nthis is 10.0.47.102.\n\n369\n00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.480\nI shouldn't be seeing that\non my own switch port, okay?\n\n370\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.180\nExcept for the fact that I have\nthat port mirroring turned on.\n\n371\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.780\nI shouldn't do that.\n\n372\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.620\nHere's another one that we can also\nsee that's also not between me.\n\n373\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.170\nLook at this.\n\n374\n00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:32.070\nThere's another piece of traffic\nthat's actually not between me either.\n\n375\n00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.680\nSo if we want to capture things like this,\nwhich is,\n\n376\n00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.458\nessentially unicast traffic-\n&gt;&gt; All of those conversations happening on\n\n377\n00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:38.364\nthat particular switch.\n\n378\n00:21:38.364 --> 00:21:40.500\n&gt;&gt; That means we've got those\nthree choices here, okay?\n\n379\n00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The hub, not your best choice,\n\n380\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.400\nprobably.\n\n381\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.660\nAnd usually the reason why is we would,\n\n382\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.380\nlast time we probably saw\nhub was years ago, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.410\nSo that's probably not a great choice.\n\n384\n00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.010\nBut if you have one laying around,\nit may work in a pinch.\n\n385\n00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:57.890\nBut you probably don't wanna do this,\nespecially in a gigabit network, okay?\n\n386\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.400\nThe idea of using something like port\nmirroring will work, but remember,\n\n387\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.780\nthis will also end up causing just a few\nI don't want to say troubles, right, but\n\n388\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.130\nit will cause your switch to work harder\nbecause it has to make sure that every\n\n389\n00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.990\nsingle thing that's coming in on that\nport, but you can even do it differently.\n\n390\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:19.050\nCherokee, if I wanted to, I could take\nthe rest of the entire switch, and\n\n391\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.200\nsay I want all of those ports.\n\n392\n00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.050\nSo, I have a 48 port switch here.\n\n393\n00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.850\nI could take all the other 47 ports,\nand say what?\n\n394\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.420\nGoing to mirror that\ntraffic to this one port.\n\n395\n00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.990\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Then you'll over subscribe that port\n\n396\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.535\nlike crazy.\n\n397\n00:22:30.535 --> 00:22:31.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n398\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.740\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, if you think that, and\nthis is not the fanciest switching, right?\n\n399\n00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.552\nThese are fast Ethernet ports,\nbut that's 47 100 megabit ports.\n\n400\n00:22:38.552 --> 00:22:40.989\n&gt;&gt; Still,\nwhen you think of it exponentially, and\n\n401\n00:22:40.989 --> 00:22:44.503\nthat manner it's gonna be pretty\ntaxing on that one particular port.\n\n402\n00:22:44.503 --> 00:22:48.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 47 100 megabit ports, if\nthey're all working very quickly, right?\n\n403\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:54.047\nThat one port's only 100 megabits and\nI mean, that's 4,700 megabits,\n\n404\n00:22:54.047 --> 00:22:59.600\n4.7 gigs, you're trying to cram into\nthat tiny little pipe that you have.\n\n405\n00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.830\nIt's not gonna all fit very easily.\n\n406\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.540\nSo you have that option, but will it work?\n\n407\n00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.290\nYes, here on my network where I can\ncapture just a little bit of the data.\n\n408\n00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.260\nYou see it working right here, too.\n\n409\n00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.920\nIdeally though,\nif you had the money, okay,\n\n410\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.680\nit would be of course a network tap,\nthat you would plug in place.\n\n411\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.860\nAnd then you could capture all the data.\n\n412\n00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.120\nAnd by doing that, it actually doesn't\ninterfere with any of the traffic.\n\n413\n00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.976\nIt doesn't cause your switch to have to\nconsume more CPU, or cause any problems.\n\n414\n00:23:28.976 --> 00:23:32.130\nBecause it essentially works as a pass\nthrough and all you're doing is you're\n\n415\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.890\nreally seeing the data as it\nflows through that little tap.\n\n416\n00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.880\nSo it's an extra device and\n\n417\n00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.390\nyou can actually find these\ndevices just about everywhere.\n\n418\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.340\nThey are expensive but overall though,\nit gives you that ability to do so.\n\n419\n00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.304\nSo don't think that you don't\nhave the option to do this.\n\n420\n00:23:48.304 --> 00:23:51.271\nSo rather as a configuration,\nor an extra device,\n\n421\n00:23:51.271 --> 00:23:55.273\nif you need to capture unicast data\nthat is not destined just for you,\n\n422\n00:23:55.273 --> 00:23:58.654\nthose are at least some of\nthe methods that you can use, and\n\n423\n00:23:58.654 --> 00:24:03.550\nthat can get you started in Wireshark\nto see the data that you want to see.\n\n424\n00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.040\nNow from this point,\nyou can also add in filters,\n\n425\n00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.950\nwhich we've also talked\nabout in a previous episode.\n\n426\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:13.350\nTo really limit and see exactly what\nyou want to see turns a protocol or\n\n427\n00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.510\nmaybe even a specific source or\n\n428\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:20.120\ndestination address you're going to, but\nthis is what will get you to that point.\n\n429\n00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.260\n&gt;&gt; I know, and just looking at this from\neven a security standpoint it really makes\n\n430\n00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.670\nyou thing about your physical security\nbecause if someone were to gain\n\n431\n00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.910\naccess to your physical network, look at\nall the information they could obtain.\n\n432\n00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:31.780\nThat's quite a bit there, so.\n\n433\n00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.130\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n434\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.082\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there's no doubt.\n\n435\n00:24:34.082 --> 00:24:35.840\nAll right, do you have any\nother final thoughts Ronnie,\n\n436\n00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.920\nI think we're about out of time for\n\n437\n00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.430\nthis show but,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] Well, just think about it\n\n438\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.850\nright, sometimes it's not gonna show\nyou everything that you wanted to see.\n\n439\n00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:49.530\nBut, make sure that you have a solid\nunderstanding right, of how switches work.\n\n440\n00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.950\nEven a basic understanding of\nhow the router works as well.\n\n441\n00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.920\nAnd of course even how your\nNIC works just a little bit.\n\n442\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.050\nThat way you can just troubleshoot\nwhy your connections aren't showing\n\n443\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.070\nthe way that you want to.\n\n444\n00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.220\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Even before the show,\n\n445\n00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.890\nI had a problem just with my NICs,\ntrying to get them to kinda play along and\n\n446\n00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.860\ndo everything that I wanted to do and\nsetting it up in lab.\n\n447\n00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.480\nIt does, it takes a little bit of\ntime to get everything set up.\n\n448\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.310\nBut once you kind of understand it,\nit will become a rhythm for you.\n\n449\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.690\nAnd then you'll be able to plug right in,\nand\n\n450\n00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:20.693\nyou'll be working with Wireshark in no\ntime to show you the data that you need.\n\n451\n00:25:20.693 --> 00:25:23.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well thank you so\nmuch Ronnie, and thank you ladies and\n\n452\n00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.470\ngentleman for turning in.\n\n453\n00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:25.170\nBut stay tuned.\n\n454\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.960\nWe have more Wireshark headed your way.\n\n455\n00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.590\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis show, as your host, Cherokee Boose,\n\n456\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.390\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong,\n\n457\n00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.250\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n458\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:40.167\n[MUSIC]\n\n459\n00:25:40.167 --> 00:25:43.670\nThank you watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.914\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:10.837\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.837 --> 00:00:14.230\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Wireshark series.\n\n4\n00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.330\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.440\nSo far we've had a good introduction\nin how to use this product.\n\n6\n00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.210\nBut this episode,\nwe're really gonna just dive in there and\n\n7\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.030\nlook at some advanced features.\n\n8\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.220\nWith us today we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.960\nRonnie Wong to help us get\nthrough these advanced features.\n\n10\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.060\nSo exactly what are we gonna\nbe looking at here, Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to\nthe idea of using Wireshark and\n\n12\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.350\ngetting ready to start, right?\n\n13\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.170\nWe've already showed a lot.\n\n14\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.870\nAnd we've already showed you\nhow to at least install it,\n\n15\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.680\nhow to get started with making a capture,\nand\n\n16\n00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.500\nthen of course filtering which is one of\nthe most important things that we can do.\n\n17\n00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.820\nThat's when we start to be able to\nisolate down to that traffic that we\n\n18\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.040\nreally want to be able to capture,\nand then use that of course for\n\n19\n00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.460\nanalysis into whatever\nwe need it to point out.\n\n20\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.120\nBut a lot of times though,\n\n21\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.110\nwhat we also need is not just\nthe individual packets itself.\n\n22\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.360\nAnalyzing a particular packet works.\n\n23\n00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.260\nIt gives us what we might be able to break\ndown an individual component into, but\n\n24\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.660\nit doesn't give us the entire picture.\n\n25\n00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.110\nSo we also need to understand\nhow Wireshark can also show us\n\n26\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.210\nthe idea of the entire picture, as well.\n\n27\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.200\nSo let's think about a conversation,\nCherokee, just at the beginning.\n\n28\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.380\nIf you were to call somebody up and\nhave a conversation, it begins with words,\n\n29\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.670\nright, we use individual words.\n\n30\n00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.290\nBut if I were just to record individual\nwords and then record them and chop\n\n31\n00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.200\nthem up into one word at a time and then,\nnot assemble them in the proper manner.\n\n32\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.130\nWhat you would end up getting is just,\nwell a bunch of words, right.\n\n33\n00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.000\nAnd it doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n34\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.870\n&gt;&gt; Right, but Ronnie, don't we\nnormally follow some type of format or\n\n35\n00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.430\nhow does that go?\n\n36\n00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.170\nWhat is that conversation made of?\n\n37\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to just\na regular human conversation, right.\n\n38\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.640\nNormally it kind of is done the same\nway that a lot of times a computer\n\n39\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.620\ndoes it as well.\n\n40\n00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.180\nNow, let's go back to thinking a little\nbit about the idea of the communication\n\n41\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.520\nmodel that we think about here, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.237\nAnd the easiest one to think about of\ncourse, is the idea of the TCP handshake.\n\n43\n00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:16.145\nSo the very beginning of that is just\nabout the idea here of sending the very\n\n44\n00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.780\nfact that we want to communicate.\n\n45\n00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.300\nSo this is you picking up the phone and\n\n46\n00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.420\ndialing someone,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n47\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.090\n&gt;&gt; And then once they get that their\nparticular acknowledgment of that is when\n\n48\n00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.130\nthey pick up and they say hello.\n\n49\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.820\nAnd then, once they say that, you can kind\nof know that you're on the same page.\n\n50\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.910\nAnd from that point, you go hey, this is,\nand let's say I'm on the other end, hey,\n\n51\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.550\nthis is Ronnie.\n\n52\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.300\n&gt;&gt; For some reason, I always see Bob and\nSheila on diagrams online explaining TCP.\n\n53\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.360\nI don't know why.\n\n54\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.290\nWho's Bob and Sheila?\n\n55\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:43.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that they're out there.\n\n57\n00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.630\nBut the very fact is, since you and\nI are on this I would use you and\n\n58\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.040\nme as an example right.\n\n59\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.070\nSo here,\n\n60\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.690\nthat's where it begins, is that there\nhas to be some type of synchronization.\n\n61\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.490\nBut from that point,\nit really is not just,\n\n62\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.120\nnow that we've made the connection\nthat that's all that there is.\n\n63\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.390\nWe now start to send data,\nor we start to communicate.\n\n64\n00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.990\nAnd it's the message that we\nreally want to be able to see,\n\n65\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.860\nthat entire what we call conversation.\n\n66\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.450\nWell, computers chat as well, and that's\nkind of the key that we want to get to\n\n67\n00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.800\nwhen we start thinking about\nthe conversation between two computers.\n\n68\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.150\nCan we use something like Wireshark\nto help us to be able to do that?\n\n69\n00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.258\nAnd it really does have to,\nyou really do, excuse me.\n\n70\n00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:30.080\nYou really as someone that is now\nstarting to examine traffic and\n\n71\n00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.360\nstarting to take look at it for analysis.\n\n72\n00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.790\nYou have to have those basic concepts\ndown for the explanation right.\n\n73\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.610\nYou need to understand\nthat the TCP handshake and\n\n74\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.270\nwhat has to go on before computers\ncommunicate because that is the beginning\n\n75\n00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.640\nthat connection that conversation and then\nall those packets that flow afterwards,\n\n76\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.050\nhow do they know that that's all\nconnected to the same thing?\n\n77\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.080\nJust like the conversation\nbetween Cherokee and\n\n78\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.240\nI on the telephone call, right?\n\n79\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.810\nHow is it that all of those are really\na part of that one conversation.\n\n80\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.080\nWell when computers communicate we\nhave to understand that as well.\n\n81\n00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.460\nAnd that is the idea what\nwe would call a flow or\n\n82\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.730\nsome type of course of stream of\ntraffic between those two systems.\n\n83\n00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.380\nSo we need to be able to understand and\n\n84\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.420\nsee that because even though like\nI said at the very beginning\n\n85\n00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.020\nthat we can see individual packets and\nbreak them down, right?\n\n86\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.400\nWe showed you in Wireshark where you can\nactually see like an individual packet.\n\n87\n00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.604\nYou can break it down into all the layers\nof the OSI model that Wireshark\n\n88\n00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:27.700\nwill show you.\n\n89\n00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.900\nAnd even go down to see the hex values,\nand the ASCII values,\n\n90\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.220\nand essentially everything.\n\n91\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.600\nBut just looking at it packet by packet,\nit's difficult.\n\n92\n00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.140\nIt's not actually easy to work.\n\n93\n00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.660\nNow there are some\nlimitations in computers\n\n94\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.000\nthat we also have to think about.\n\n95\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.230\nAs humans, you and I can adjust, okay, to\nthe conversation and the message, right?\n\n96\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.735\nThere maybe sometimes just like Cherokee\ndid where she just gave me that verbal\n\n97\n00:04:55.735 --> 00:05:01.320\nmm-hm which can be okay if I understand\nlike what I just said and she's\n\n98\n00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.560\nagreeing with it but if she just said that\nwhere I was in the middle of talking.\n\n99\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.340\nI'm like what is she talking about, it\ndoesn't make any sense at that point but\n\n100\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.240\nthere may be times where,\nwhat I say, she responds to.\n\n101\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.470\nAnd then she just kind of\ngives me a paragraph or\n\n102\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.190\ntwo, or starts singing the middle of\na song, or whatever it might be, and\n\n103\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.320\nI can adjust that because, as humans,\nwe can adjust the size and\n\n104\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.240\nthe nature of what we hear and realize\nthat that's a part of the conversation.\n\n105\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.540\nWell remember that when we start\nsending packets or frames back and\n\n106\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.320\nforth between two computers,\nthere's normally a limitation.\n\n107\n00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.560\nIn other words, everything fits\ninto that particular limitation.\n\n108\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.890\nSo Cherokee,\nwhat do you think ends up happening here.\n\n109\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.020\nIf I have something, so\nlet's just take the idea,\n\n110\n00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.110\nabout 1,500 bites,\na little bit larger or so.\n\n111\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.210\nIf it's 900 bytes of information,\nthat fits nicely in that container.\n\n112\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.990\nThat's fine.\n\n113\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.300\nSend it over to you,\nyou get one packet, that's fine.\n\n114\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.760\nBut what if I have something like\n4,200 bytes of information but\n\n115\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.430\nmy container is only 1,500 bytes?\n\n116\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.000\nWell, now, what do we do with the rest of\n\n117\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.340\nthe conversation that we\nwere talking about having?\n\n118\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.780\nWith that computer,\nwhat about those other 3,000 bites or so?\n\n119\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.840\nWhat ends up happening there,\nwhat do you think?\n\n120\n00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, if our MTUs, our maximum\ntransmission units, are not able to handle\n\n121\n00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.680\nlarge frames, like we spoke about\njumbo frames in previous shows, but\n\n122\n00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.000\nthat's a special environment.\n\n123\n00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.580\nRegular equipment is limited, right?\n\n124\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.540\nSo we would need to fragment.\n\n125\n00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that idea of fragment,\n\n126\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.430\nthat's kind of where it becomes\nscary in the computer language land.\n\n127\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.220\nIn those particular pieces that we can't\nfit in to that nice neat container size,\n\n128\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.070\nwell then it has to break off the pieces\nit can't fit and put in its own container.\n\n129\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.050\nAnd then whatever doesn't fit\nin that one has to break off and\n\n130\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.000\nput it into another container.\n\n131\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.570\nWell now,\nwhen we start sending that information,\n\n132\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.650\nit no longer looks like a work,\nlet's say that for an example.\n\n133\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.923\nThis is kind of an unrealistic example but\n\n134\n00:06:58.923 --> 00:07:02.719\nlet's think about using just a regular\nword let's just put ITProTV.\n\n135\n00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:06.590\nAnd let's say that each one of those\nis as big as each our frames can get.\n\n136\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.020\nWell now, if I start to send that over to\nCherokee instead of her getting ITProTV,\n\n137\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.920\nshe actually gets an I in one of those\nframes, a T in one of those frame, a P,\n\n138\n00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.140\nan R, an O, and a T, and a T,\nand another V in those frames.\n\n139\n00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.280\nWell now that gets sent individually,\none at a time.\n\n140\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.935\nSo now, Cherokee,\ndoes that actually represent ITProTV?\n\n141\n00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:32.520\nSeven different words, or does that\nrepresent seven different letters?\n\n142\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.960\nWell how to computers know\nthe difference between those?\n\n143\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.880\n&gt;&gt; Sequencing.\n\n144\n00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Sequencing, but still at that time\nright, it becomes a little bit harder for\n\n145\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.142\nthe computer to guess it.\n\n146\n00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:42.658\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n147\n00:07:42.658 --> 00:07:45.236\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is why we have to understand that,\n\n148\n00:07:45.236 --> 00:07:49.738\nbecause it's all a part of that same\nconversation is what we want to see.\n\n149\n00:07:49.738 --> 00:07:52.592\nThe ability for\nthose two computers to communicate and\n\n150\n00:07:52.592 --> 00:07:55.770\nget the message fully across\nthe way that we want to.\n\n151\n00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.369\nIt's not just about sending packets\nacross, there's more to it.\n\n152\n00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:04.907\nBut Ronnie, it also makes a difference\nwith different types of transmissions,\n\n153\n00:08:04.907 --> 00:08:09.578\nright, because if we're talking UDP and\nyou're giving a story and you're saying\n\n154\n00:08:09.578 --> 00:08:14.182\nthe word IT ProTV, it wouldn't make sense\nif you said those letters transposed or\n\n155\n00:08:14.182 --> 00:08:18.480\njumbled because we would be like,\nwhat is Ronnie even talking about?\n\n156\n00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.944\nBut when we look at TCP,\n\n157\n00:08:19.944 --> 00:08:23.971\nit makes sense because of that connection,\nwe have the ability to\n\n158\n00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.650\nreorganize into the correct format,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n159\n00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.551\nyou can kinda reassemble it if it\nhappens to arrive out of order,\n\n160\n00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:33.570\nall that stuff, because of sequencing,\nnumbers can't it back together.\n\n161\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.860\nBut that's the reason, right, is that\nthere is a way that we can follow that,\n\n162\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.830\nbut it's more difficult for us to be able\nto think about that in terms of human\n\n163\n00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.420\nterms, but we need to be able to\nsee that in our computers, okay,\n\n164\n00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.480\nwhen we have that conversation\nbetween two separate computers.\n\n165\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we\n\n166\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.130\nreally wanna show right now,\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n167\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.903\n&gt;&gt; Is that inside of Wireshark, we have\nthe ability to do something like this,\n\n168\n00:08:55.903 --> 00:08:59.750\nto see entire conversations\nthat end up happening.\n\n169\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.280\nSo what I'm gonna do now\nis I'm going to flip on\n\n170\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.670\nover to my particular computer screen for\nright now.\n\n171\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.180\nI've been capturing packets for\na while now, this capture is not so\n\n172\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.890\nuseful for what I'm doing right now, but\nit is going to serve me some purpose\n\n173\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.488\na little bit later, so I'm gonna leave\nit running and doing what we need to.\n\n174\n00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:15.701\n&gt;&gt; The suspense!\n\n175\n00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:17.238\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know,\n\n176\n00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:20.380\nthe suspense of what's gonna be\nhappening a little bit later here.\n\n177\n00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.890\nBut overall though, let's say that I\nwanted to capture specific traffic, right,\n\n178\n00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.778\nbetween two devices.\n\n179\n00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:31.710\nSo I'm gonna use a demonstration that's\ngoing to allow me to use my computer and\n\n180\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.380\ncapture the information between me and\n\n181\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.160\nlet's say that I want to configure\nthe switch that's sitting right beside me.\n\n182\n00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.020\nSo normally if I do something like\nthis inside of a production network,\n\n183\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.030\nI'm not gonna use just a console cable,\nI don't want to go in to that networking\n\n184\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:51.640\ncloset where all those machines are up and\nrunning and it's loud as can be.\n\n185\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.020\nI don't want to bring my laptop in\nthere and then plug in a cable and\n\n186\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.660\njust do my commands.\n\n187\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.000\nOn a network though, what I'd like to\ndo instead is be able to connect in and\n\n188\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.310\ndo the same things across the network.\n\n189\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.880\nSo that's gonna require\nme to use either SSH or\n\n190\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.450\nsomething that you don't wanna use,\nwhich is Telnet, to do so, but\n\n191\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.840\nthat's the example we're gonna use,\nwe're gonna use Telnet.\n\n192\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.500\nNow please remember,\nokay, never ever, never,\n\n193\n00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.095\never, ever, ever, ever use Telnet\nin a production environment.\n\n194\n00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:26.495\n&gt;&gt; Like we've said before,\ndo as Ronnie says, not as Ronnie does.\n\n195\n00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:29.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a great example so\n\n196\n00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.210\nthat we could see it.\n\n197\n00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.924\n&gt;&gt; I'm just joking.\n&gt;&gt; So as long as it's what we're trying to\n\n198\n00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:34.733\nshow, that there is sometimes where\nit's going to be very useful,\n\n199\n00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:36.950\nsometimes it's not going to be as useful,\nbut here,\n\n200\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.010\nwe want to show the idea\nof the usefulness of it.\n\n201\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:39.650\n&gt;&gt; And why is that?\n\n202\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.810\nWhy wouldn't we, just a quick reminder.\n\n203\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.010\n&gt;&gt; Because of Telnet?\n\n204\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well because its unencrypted.\n\n205\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n206\n00:10:45.504 --> 00:10:48.897\nthat's really bad when you start putting\nstuff out onto network like that\n\n207\n00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:51.190\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not good to do that.\n\n208\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.100\n&gt;&gt; Even inside your own\nproduction network,\n\n209\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.420\nyou don't know who else has\na packet sniffer turned on.\n\n210\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:55.960\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n211\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.040\nthat's why you don't want\nto do anything like this.\n\n212\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.870\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; So just knowing\n\n213\n00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.520\nSSHs are secure alternative because\nthose communications are encrypted.\n\n214\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.090\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's it.\n\n215\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.060\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n216\n00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.640\nsee what can normally happen here if\nwe use something that's unencrypted.\n\n217\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.430\nAnd you might be wondering\nwhy would we ever do that?\n\n218\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.980\nCuz you might wanna spot that.\n\n219\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.130\nYou're not going to spot if someone\nis sending stuff that's unencrypted\n\n220\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:15.970\nto do this.\n\n221\n00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.250\nSo here, I've got a connection into my\nswitch and my regular network connection\n\n222\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.730\nis now connected to netswitch, so I should\njust be able to Telnet directly into it.\n\n223\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.563\nThe great thing is I\nhave Wiresharp turned on,\n\n224\n00:11:27.563 --> 00:11:30.510\nand it is still capturing\npackets as far as I can tell.\n\n225\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:36.400\nSo, all I have to do is go to my machine\nand I simply launch up the terminal.\n\n226\n00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.600\nFrom here, I can now Telnet into,\nlet's see,\n\n227\n00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.060\n10.0.47.2, I was trying\nto remember what that is,\n\n228\n00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:51.460\nokay, so let's see if it actually\nallows me to get in here.\n\n229\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.180\n&gt;&gt; And different pieces of software on our\nnetwork may be using communications that\n\n230\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.070\naren't encrypted and we're not really\naware of them because, for instance,\n\n231\n00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.290\nI know you've used Adobe Connect before,\nright?\n\n232\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Some of those communications\n\n233\n00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.740\naren't secure and\n\n234\n00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.926\nyou would think, you know, a company like\nthat would have it together at least.\n\n235\n00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:09.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But leaking that information a little\n\n236\n00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.940\nbit at a time can really do some\ndamage if you're a secure environment.\n\n237\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's try this out.\n\n238\n00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.410\nLet's say that somebody figures\nout how to Telnet into my switch.\n\n239\n00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.310\nLet's say it's Ronnie.\n\n240\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So he goes all right,\n\n241\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.670\nI'm just gonna try my user name, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.110\nNow let's talk about this idea of\nactually having a password here, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.480\nSo what if he doesn't know\nwhat the password is?\n\n244\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.390\nSo he, well there we go,\nhas an invalid password and after awhile,\n\n245\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.440\nit's gonna lock him out, okay.\n\n246\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.520\nIt's gonna kick him out,\nat least, I think it is.\n\n247\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.410\nSo now when you get back into this\nthing with a password I do know,\n\n248\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.700\ninstead and there it is.\n\n249\n00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.213\nI have now just successfully\nTelnetted into my switch,\n\n250\n00:12:47.213 --> 00:12:51.060\nI'm going to get into\nthe privilege mode here.\n\n251\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:58.070\nLet's say that I want to run something\nlike a show running - config.\n\n252\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.520\nNow I can see the entire configuration.\n\n253\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.540\nSo, there it is.\n\n254\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.120\nThere it is.\n\n255\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.722\nLook, I just found out\nwhat the password was.\n\n256\n00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:05.868\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Selfietime!\n\n257\n00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:06.413\n&gt;&gt; Selfietime!\n[LAUGH] So\n\n258\n00:13:06.413 --> 00:13:07.199\nwe know that Ronnie\nthere it is [CROSSTALK]\n\n259\n00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:09.620\n&gt;&gt; I knew it Ronnie.\n\n260\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.290\n&gt;&gt; There it is and so here it is.\n\n261\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.840\nI'm now just scrolling through and\n\n262\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.120\nI'm now seeing the entire configuration\nof what's available to me on that switch.\n\n263\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.320\nI can also do a show ip interface brief.\n\n264\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.550\nAnd now I can see, of course, every\ninterface and a status, whether it's up or\n\n265\n00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.380\ndown.\n\n266\n00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.440\nWe can actually see all that.\n\n267\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:35.298\nSo that's all the information that we see\nright there open and available to us.\n\n268\n00:13:35.298 --> 00:13:40.053\nNow if I go ahead and stop this right now,\nlet me go ahead and cancel this for\n\n269\n00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:45.900\njust a moment, let me exit out of this and\nthen, let's come back to our capture here.\n\n270\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.590\nNow, the problem that I have is simple.\n\n271\n00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:53.660\nI've got about 28,000 packets according\nto the bottom edge of the screen.\n\n272\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:58.290\nI'm going to use a display filter and\njust type in Telnet.\n\n273\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.160\nOnce I do that, that has now kind of\ndisplayed, and now I only have about 257\n\n274\n00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.050\nof those packets displayed and\nwe take a look just right behind my little\n\n275\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.460\nwindow there, you can see that,\nwhere it says 257 of those packets.\n\n276\n00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.100\nNow notice that this is all between my\nmachine which is on that same subnet, so\n\n277\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.540\nhere's my machine and\n\n278\n00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.000\nhere's the destination which is\nthe switch that I connected into.\n\n279\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.670\nAnd I can see that all those messages,\nessentially belong between me and\n\n280\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.900\nthe switch, right?\n\n281\n00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.980\nSo when I Telenet it in, it actually\nallowed me to make that connection first\n\n282\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.318\nand now it also exchanged the information\nacross that Telnet connection.\n\n283\n00:14:39.318 --> 00:14:43.865\nSo all of this that you see over here in\nthe info column, it says Telnet data.\n\n284\n00:14:43.865 --> 00:14:48.560\nIt essentially saw all of those\npackets coming across, okay.\n\n285\n00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.190\nNow, that's not bad cuz\nI can click here and\n\n286\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.630\nI can even take a look down here about the\nbits and bytes, it doesn't look like that\n\n287\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:59.830\nthere's really any super useful\ninformation that I can see.\n\n288\n00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.700\nSo this doesn't seem like\nthis is any more helpful\n\n289\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.380\nthan anything else I've shown you in\nthe previous captures that we've done, but\n\n290\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.190\nthere is a utility though,\ninside of Wireshark that can help us.\n\n291\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.990\nAnd all I have to do is select on any one\nof these now that I've filtered it down\n\n292\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.722\nusing the display filter.\n\n293\n00:15:19.722 --> 00:15:21.160\nLet me zoom in a little bit.\n\n294\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.890\nI can right-click on this thing and\nnow I can go to follow TCP stream.\n\n295\n00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:34.990\nIf I now select follow TCP stream,\nnow you can see something else, okay?\n\n296\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.490\nNow you will notice that there's two\ndifferent colors here that we actually end\n\n297\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:43.930\nup seeing, okay, and those two colors\nrepresent both sides of the conversation.\n\n298\n00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.308\nSo up here at the top where you can see\nwhere the Telnet started coming in and\n\n299\n00:15:48.308 --> 00:15:50.502\nthen the other side, the response.\n\n300\n00:15:50.502 --> 00:15:52.343\nSo the red at this point,\n\n301\n00:15:52.343 --> 00:15:58.146\nyou end up seeing is me sending data over\nto that machine, over to that switch.\n\n302\n00:15:58.146 --> 00:16:01.610\nThe blue is the switch\nresponding back to me.\n\n303\n00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.479\nSo here you can see where the blue,\nthis is what we saw at the very beginning,\n\n304\n00:16:05.479 --> 00:16:09.184\nhere's what came up once the Telnet\nconnection made its connection in.\n\n305\n00:16:09.184 --> 00:16:12.110\nAnd it turned on xterm.\n\n306\n00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.580\nMy side said, hey, turn on xterm here so\n\n307\n00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.190\nthat we can also get some\ninformation going on there.\n\n308\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.170\nAnd now here's where it\ngets a little bit strange.\n\n309\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n310\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n311\n00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.880\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n312\n00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.080\n&gt;&gt; Because of the password.\n\n313\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.110\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n314\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.920\n&gt;&gt; We don't want to be able\nto see that information.\n\n315\n00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.448\n&gt;&gt; But look at this, Cherokee,\nlook at this weird kind of thing here.\n\n316\n00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.889\n&gt;&gt; RRoonnnniiee?\n\n317\n00:16:31.889 --> 00:16:34.548\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n318\n00:16:34.548 --> 00:16:38.740\nBut if you see this, it doesn't make sense\nif this is your first time looking at it.\n\n319\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.320\nSo the great thing is, you'll know this.\n\n320\n00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.327\nIf somebody says-\n&gt;&gt; Back and forth there, yeah.\n\n321\n00:16:41.327 --> 00:16:42.821\n&gt;&gt; Why is it doing that?\n\n322\n00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:47.320\nIt is because I sent the letter R, and\nthis is where it gets strange, right?\n\n323\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.030\nWhen I sent that across Telnet\nusing the terminal that I did,\n\n324\n00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.950\nit sent it into the switch.\n\n325\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:58.990\nThe switch essentially is sending it back\nto me, so it displays on my screen, okay.\n\n326\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.970\nThat's what we're actually seeing, okay.\n\n327\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.530\nSo notice that that's what we're seeing\nhere is that it actually displayed that.\n\n328\n00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.670\nSo here I told you I didn't\nremember what the password was, so\n\n329\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.970\nI just typed in a bunch\nof random characters.\n\n330\n00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:14.020\nAfter a while,\nhere's what the switch responded to.\n\n331\n00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.450\nNow notice that when I typed\nin the user name I did know,\n\n332\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.030\nwhich was admin, that was fine.\n\n333\n00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.448\nIt still reported this in.\n\n334\n00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:24.840\nBut now notice something else here.\n\n335\n00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.090\nPassword, but notice that\nthe password that I typed in here.\n\n336\n00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:28.940\n&gt;&gt; All plain text.\n\n337\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.920\n&gt;&gt; But it's all me.\n\n338\n00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in other words,\n\n339\n00:17:31.363 --> 00:17:34.321\neven though it didn't show up\non my screen, I typed it in.\n\n340\n00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:38.542\nIf it had shown up on the screen, we\nwould also see the blue letters as well,\n\n341\n00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:40.640\nreporting it back to my display.\n\n342\n00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.160\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n343\n00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.390\n&gt;&gt; So, this is where it hit it, that's\nwhy you didn't see anything being typed,\n\n344\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.300\neven though I knew what\nthe password was as well.\n\n345\n00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.910\nAnd now you can see where\neennaabbllee showed up.\n\n346\n00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.250\nBut then when it asked me for\nthe password again, I just typed it in.\n\n347\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.610\nSo when you start seeing stuff like this,\n\n348\n00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.270\nthis is kinda that breakdown\nthat we were talking about.\n\n349\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:03.170\nThat sometimes the message is kind\nof broken up into smaller portions.\n\n350\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.830\nSometimes it's a lot.\n\n351\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.224\nSo once I did that show running config,\nwhich is strange, now notice the switch\n\n352\n00:18:09.224 --> 00:18:12.710\njust gives up and says,\nlet me tell you everything [LAUGH] okay.\n\n353\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.470\nSo this is where we say,\nthere's that character.\n\n354\n00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.170\nCan you believe that that's his password?\n\n355\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.250\nWeird.\n\n356\n00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.540\nSo there you go.\n\n357\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.680\nSo now you can see the entire conversation\n\n358\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.660\nof the data that went on here for\njust something that simple.\n\n359\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.800\nAnd just when you think it's the end,\nnotice again we now see\n\n360\n00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.750\nthe human interaction or\nthe client-side interaction.\n\n361\n00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.190\nAnd look at all the information\nthat it spewed back out to us.\n\n362\n00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.100\nSo it's something like this\nthat really will show you\n\n363\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.660\nif a connection has been made\nthe way that it needed to, okay?\n\n364\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.200\nNow, we're not completely done yet, okay.\n\n365\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.920\nSo this is very useful when you have\ntraffic that you can see like this and\n\n366\n00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.460\nit's totally unencrypted, okay.\n\n367\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.321\nBut you talked about the use of SSH,\nwhich is better, okay,\n\n368\n00:19:00.321 --> 00:19:02.992\nbecause nothing is actually encrypted.\n\n369\n00:19:02.992 --> 00:19:04.940\nSo what do you think will happen,\nCherokee,\n\n370\n00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.851\nif I now instead of using Telnet,\nshow SSH.\n\n371\n00:19:06.851 --> 00:19:10.085\nWhat do you think might happen?\n\n372\n00:19:10.085 --> 00:19:13.435\n&gt;&gt; I think that our information will\nbe encrypted or kind of garbled, so\n\n373\n00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:15.280\nwe won't be able to view that.\n\n374\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.120\nBut I also, like I had mentioned before,\nsome forms of software,\n\n375\n00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.210\neven if they use SSH, some information\nis still sent in plain text.\n\n376\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.060\nAnd you've gotta be careful\nof how that's coded,\n\n377\n00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.680\nbecause it could be important information.\n\n378\n00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.620\nFor instance, like the user\nnames were sent in plain text.\n\n379\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.800\nAnd just by knowing someone's user name,\n\n380\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.170\nit's still solving half of that\nequation from a hacker's perspective.\n\n381\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.801\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if that's actually true,\nthen.\n\n382\n00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:39.400\nSo [CROSSTALK] we'll see it right here.\n\n383\n00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.673\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhat are we going to be checking here?\n\n384\n00:19:40.673 --> 00:19:44.151\n&gt;&gt; So now, we are going to do\nthe same thing, but this time, so\n\n385\n00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:46.660\nsince it's still running.\n\n386\n00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.864\nThis time if I open.\n\n387\n00:19:47.864 --> 00:19:49.900\nI'm gonna see if I can try and\nopen up a new terminal.\n\n388\n00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.110\nThere we go.\n\n389\n00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.018\nSo now I'm outside.\n\n390\n00:19:52.018 --> 00:19:54.762\nGonna do a clear here, yup.\n\n391\n00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:55.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, so\n\n392\n00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.830\nwhat are we gonna do,\ndirectly SSH into this particular machine?\n\n393\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are.\n\n394\n00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.890\nWe're just gonna try and see exactly\nwhat end up happening here when we SSH.\n\n395\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.820\nAnd see what we come up with as results.\n\n396\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:11.626\nSo the great thing is, since Wireshark\nis still running in the background,\n\n397\n00:20:11.626 --> 00:20:16.523\nI should just be able to type in SSH and\nthen admin at this point and\n\n398\n00:20:16.523 --> 00:20:20.079\nget right back into that\nparticular machine.\n\n399\n00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:22.870\nAnd when I do so,\nit's gonna tell me something's wrong here.\n\n400\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:27.250\nNow, we did run into this issue and\nwe did figure out what was going on here.\n\n401\n00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.950\nAnd this is actually from one of our\nviewers on our live show right now.\n\n402\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.800\nHe said, hey,\nit doesn't support SSH version 1 anymore.\n\n403\n00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.040\nThe MacBook that I'm on doesn't do that.\n\n404\n00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.666\nAnd it's ironic,\nbecause it was just a couple of weeks ago,\n\n405\n00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:43.309\nwe were doing the cybersecurity show,\nit worked just fine.\n\n406\n00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:46.731\nBut I did, just two days ago, literally,\n\n407\n00:20:46.731 --> 00:20:52.320\nupdated to the newest OS on MacOS here,\nwhich they call Sierra.\n\n408\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.170\nAnd at least in that one,\nit's no longer available.\n\n409\n00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.607\nSo there's a couple of\nthings that I can do.\n\n410\n00:20:57.607 --> 00:21:01.990\nBut here is what I have to type\nin to make this work instead.\n\n411\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.870\nSo we tried it out and\nmade sure that everything worked so\n\n412\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:04.980\nthat we could show you this.\n\n413\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:11.483\nIt's still SSH, but now you have to go in\nand modify so that it accepts SSH here.\n\n414\n00:21:11.483 --> 00:21:15.630\nAnd you'll see that the command is\nbasically the same at the end, okay.\n\n415\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.140\nSo this is a modification.\n\n416\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.364\nNow, if I wanted to make sure\nthat this was done all the time,\n\n417\n00:21:20.364 --> 00:21:22.410\nright, this is where I\nhave to go back in and\n\n418\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.630\nmodify a few of the different algorithms\nthat are actually hosted inside.\n\n419\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.810\nBut for us, this is all that\nwe really need to do here.\n\n420\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:33.011\nNow, the great thing is, if this\ndoesn't work, which I know it will,\n\n421\n00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:37.640\nI have on hand here, ready to go,\nmy connection from my Windows machine.\n\n422\n00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.020\nBut I wanted to keep it consistent, so\n\n423\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.220\nwe'll stick right here and\nsee what happens from this point.\n\n424\n00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:46.350\nNow, notice it asked me for a password\nat this particular point in time.\n\n425\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:51.500\nI type in cisco123 and\nnow I'm inside of the switch.\n\n426\n00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.440\nThen cisco123 again.\n\n427\n00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.405\nWe can do the same commands.\n\n428\n00:22:01.513 --> 00:22:04.430\nAnd in a moment it should build\nmy entire running config.\n\n429\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.749\nRemember the first time that we did\nthis and we showed it in Telnet,\n\n430\n00:22:07.749 --> 00:22:10.020\nwe just saw everything\ninside of Wireshark.\n\n431\n00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.454\nAnd we're able to see\neverything here again.\n\n432\n00:22:12.454 --> 00:22:17.610\nAnd let me do one more just do make sure,\nso we'll do parity check here.\n\n433\n00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.680\nShow, and\nI think I did an IP interface brief.\n\n434\n00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:28.630\nAnd it's at this point I went ahead and\n\n435\n00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.220\nmade an exit,\nclosed out of that connection.\n\n436\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.041\nAnd now we can try and\nsee it inside of Wireshark.\n\n437\n00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:34.217\nAnd now see, let me go ahead and\ndo a cancel here.\n\n438\n00:22:34.217 --> 00:22:38.142\nAnd, it might not have actually captured\nany of that since I had it stopped at\n\n439\n00:22:38.142 --> 00:22:38.793\nsome point.\n\n440\n00:22:38.793 --> 00:22:40.750\nLet's see,\nI'm gonna have to do that again.\n\n441\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.680\nSo let's see, if I do SSH,\nno, there it is,\n\n442\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.340\nit did capture-\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\n\n443\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:45.955\n&gt;&gt; I was just trying to make sure,\nI was like-\n\n444\n00:22:45.955 --> 00:22:46.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n445\n00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.550\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, did it capture it or not?\n\n446\n00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.520\nBut I think it did.\n\n447\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.860\nThe nice thing, is that even though\nI didn't know if it had stopped it,\n\n448\n00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.920\ncuz I hit that mark, we can now see-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's check one of these streams.\n\n449\n00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.939\n&gt;&gt; There is the connection.\n\n450\n00:22:56.939 --> 00:22:59.360\nAnd now we can check the same thing.\n\n451\n00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.450\nSo hold on, let me see if I can\nzoom in just a little bit more.\n\n452\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.760\nThere we go.\n\n453\n00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.750\nSo now there it is.\n\n454\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.950\nIt's all between that and my machine.\n\n455\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.110\nI now apply the.\n\n456\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.380\nOops, let me zoom back out so\nwe can see it, this TCP stream.\n\n457\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.610\nAnd now let's take a look.\n\n458\n00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.280\nCherokee, I can see some\nof the information here.\n\n459\n00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.150\nRemember that there it is.\n\n460\n00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.585\nThe blue part is of course\nthe Cisco server itself or\n\n461\n00:23:28.585 --> 00:23:32.120\nthis switch saying, hey,\nhere's how I'm connecting.\n\n462\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.460\nAnd this is my MacBook connecting.\n\n463\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.369\nSo remember, the red is me.\n\n464\n00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:39.030\nAnd here is the negotiation that goes on.\n\n465\n00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.286\nHere's what the server\nsays it will support.\n\n466\n00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:47.070\nAnd then here is what mine says it\nwill now support and allow me to do.\n\n467\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:51.890\nBut, Cherokee, I'm not seeing anything\nelse in the rest of that conversation.\n\n468\n00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:57.776\nNotice that even the user name that I put\nin didn't even show up in any of this.\n\n469\n00:23:57.776 --> 00:24:01.170\nIt shows me the exchange of\nthe algorithms, or the negotiation.\n\n470\n00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.394\nBut I don't actually see anything.\n\n471\n00:24:03.394 --> 00:24:09.770\nSo even with the ability to follow\nthe stream, that TCP stream.\n\n472\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.820\nIt really does work, but\nsometimes it's not helpful.\n\n473\n00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.610\nSo, for example, if I have SSH turned on,\nit's not gonna be really helpful for\n\n474\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.120\nanything that I'm gonna do.\n\n475\n00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.230\nBut at least I know I can go in and\nfind that if I choose to.\n\n476\n00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.920\nSo if I think maybe I'm just mistaken,\n\n477\n00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.480\nI can select another one and\ngo back to Follow.\n\n478\n00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.920\nAnd let's see, yep, even right\nhere on another particular packet.\n\n479\n00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.120\nSo I know that I'm not\njust randomly picking one,\n\n480\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.610\nthat's what we're actually seeing here.\n\n481\n00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.460\n&gt;&gt; Can we zoom in a little bit?\n\n482\n00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.550\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; I just want to see what that looks\n\n483\n00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.290\nlike, a little bit closer to verify.\n\n484\n00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.135\nYep, there we go,\nwe can see some information.\n\n485\n00:24:44.135 --> 00:24:45.800\n&gt;&gt; And it's all about the key exchanges.\n\n486\n00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.110\nThat's pretty much what it's saying.\n\n487\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.560\nIt will support all this\nstuff that you see.\n\n488\n00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.460\nSo mine is sending them\nback anything else.\n\n489\n00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.435\nIt's like, all right,\nwhich one do you want to agree to?\n\n490\n00:24:53.435 --> 00:24:57.930\nCisco switch, and we'll use that\none is what it will end up saying.\n\n491\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.200\nSo it is neat.\n\n492\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.385\n&gt;&gt; Now you can sleep at night.\n\n493\n00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:02.740\n&gt;&gt; Yep, at least you hope you can sleep.\n\n494\n00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.830\nUntil something else was actually there,\nokay?\n\n495\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.010\nIt's just one of those things.\n\n496\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:11.520\nYes, you should be a little bit careful\nin any type of connection that you make.\n\n497\n00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.780\nBut realize,\nthis way you can verify, right?\n\n498\n00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.900\nIf you make a connection and\nyou're not sure if it's secure or\n\n499\n00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.990\nnot, you can at least go back in and\ncheck it here.\n\n500\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.640\nAnd now see, notice that my\nrunning-config didn't show up.\n\n501\n00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.980\nMy password or username didn't show up.\n\n502\n00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:30.200\nAll that was exactly what we were\ntaking a look at here when we were\n\n503\n00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.130\nfollowing that TCP stream.\n\n504\n00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.250\nBut there is more that we have to\n\n505\n00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.870\nthink about as far as some\nof the advanced features.\n\n506\n00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.280\nBut following the TCP stream, being able\nto see both sides of the conversation\n\n507\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.580\ncan help you out especially in\ntroubleshooting, when you go,\n\n508\n00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.810\nI know that I sent this.\n\n509\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:47.460\nAnd, well,\n\n510\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.440\nlet's try it again and see if you can\nget both sides of the conversation.\n\n511\n00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.220\nEspecially if the traffic is unencrypted,\nyou'll be able to see that.\n\n512\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.870\nWe just showed you, also, that if you\nend up using a secure type of protocol,\n\n513\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.190\nthen what you should get is what I got.\n\n514\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.710\nYou see the exchange of the algorithms,\nbut\n\n515\n00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.720\nnotice, none of the other data also\ncame through where I could inspect it.\n\n516\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.580\nSo that kind of tells you that it's\npretty much secured at this point, and\n\n517\n00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.616\nthat should bring a little\nbit of a relief to you.\n\n518\n00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:17.290\nIf somebody is saying,\nI don't know if this is secured or not.\n\n519\n00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.440\nWell that's how you can also verify and\ncheck it out for people as well.\n\n520\n00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, understanding how\nthose conversations work,\n\n521\n00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:28.030\nthe banter back and forth and\nknowing how to encrypt that information so\n\n522\n00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:32.610\none isn't able to eavesdrop,\nthat is just a great tool to keep in mind.\n\n523\n00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:37.045\nBut I think we do have a time limit here\nand it looks like we've reached that.\n\n524\n00:26:37.045 --> 00:26:39.346\nSo thank you so much for joining us today.\n\n525\n00:26:39.346 --> 00:26:42.226\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in but stay tuned,\n\n526\n00:26:42.226 --> 00:26:45.300\nwe do have some more Wireshark\ninformation headed your way.\n\n527\n00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.550\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n528\n00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:49.440\nRemember I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n529\n00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n530\n00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.625\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n531\n00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:59.160\n[MUSIC]\n\n532\n00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.427\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.380\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Wireshark series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.690\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.075\nIf you've been following along you'll\nnoticed that we've already taken a look at\n\n9\n00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:21.976\nsome advanced features but\nwe ran out of time.\n\n10\n00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:25.920\nSo we're gonna pick up right where we left\noff, and delve a little bit deeper into\n\n11\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.200\nsome of those advance features, that\nwe do have available within Wireshark.\n\n12\n00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.890\nWith us today we have\nMr Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n13\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.460\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back,\nespecially for this part two,\n\n15\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.830\ncuz we really didn't get super\nfar into what we wanted to,\n\n16\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.590\nas far as some of the advanced features.\n\n17\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.320\nBut we did get a pretty good way.\n\n18\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.630\nNow, don't get me wrong,\nthere are tons of them and\n\n19\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.800\nwe're just trying to show you\na sampling of a couple of them\n\n20\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.490\nthat will get you interested in\nusing Wireshark a little bit more.\n\n21\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.580\nSo, remember that in part one,\nright, we showed you, essentially,\n\n22\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.710\nhow to follow a conversation.\n\n23\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.690\nYou can do that now.\n\n24\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.300\nRemember, TCP stream is not\nthe only one that's available.\n\n25\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.710\nThere are other streams that\nare available out there, but\n\n26\n00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.320\nit just takes a little bit of time before\nyou can figure out what they really mean.\n\n27\n00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.720\nBut start out with the TCP stream because\nthat's probably the most useful for\n\n28\n00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.820\nmost of us.\n\n29\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.610\nBut as we continue to move forward into\nlearning more and more about Wireshark and\n\n30\n00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.360\nits features though, one of the key\nthings, especially for beginners, okay,\n\n31\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.030\nis to take a look at all that\ninformation that's going across.\n\n32\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.967\nSo, here it is, I'm trying to make sure\non my Wireshark right now it's up to\n\n33\n00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:34.456\n255,950 packets of the information\nthat's coming across.\n\n34\n00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:37.960\nSo that's a pretty good amount of packets.\n\n35\n00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.800\nWell, when you first launch it up and\nthe very first capture that you have and\n\n36\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.590\nyou leave it running like this,\nyou might be wondering, like, well,\n\n37\n00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.970\nwhat am I looking for now, right?\n\n38\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.510\nYou start to click through and\nyou start to go,\n\n39\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.320\nwhat of all this stuff am I looking for?\n\n40\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.240\nAnd it doesn't really seem to make sense.\n\n41\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.560\nEven if you selected one of them and\nnow you go, all right, so\n\n42\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.590\nnow I've selected something, well,\nI'm still maybe, if I'm a novice might\n\n43\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.820\nnot have a good understanding of how this\nstuff breaks down yet, or the protocols.\n\n44\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.130\nSo it can be a little bit\noverwhelming if we're not careful.\n\n45\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, one visual aid that we\nmight be able to rely on Ronnie,\n\n46\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.800\ndidn't we talk about different\ncolors in a previous episode?\n\n47\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.170\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that\ncolorizing the packets and\n\n48\n00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.470\nthe way that it does it is really helpful\nbecause it does separate out certain\n\n49\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.520\namounts of the way that the data looks.\n\n50\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.800\nSo if I click on View and\nthen I select on this Colorize rule\n\n51\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.330\nyou can now see some of the default\ncolors that will come across your screen.\n\n52\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.490\nSo for example, bad TCP and TCP reset and\n\n53\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.380\nSCTP abort,\nsome of this stuff you can see that and\n\n54\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.450\nthat's the way that you might be able\nto do this scan across those packets.\n\n55\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.850\nWhen you see something like right there,\n\n56\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.880\nthat stands out because it's such\na contrast with everything else.\n\n57\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.160\nThis black background with the red text,\n\n58\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.130\nit really kind of alerts you that\nyou may wanna pay attention to that.\n\n59\n00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.780\nSo I select that.\n\n60\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.230\nAnd then when I select it,\nI'm like, okay, great.\n\n61\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.260\nWhat else am I looking for\nnow that I've selected it?\n\n62\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.880\nI don't understand what\nelse is going on here.\n\n63\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.950\nWell, the great thing is that\ninside of Wireshark itself,\n\n64\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.290\nyou do have the advantage to be\nable to find more information.\n\n65\n00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.290\nNow, if you wanna do it manually,\nthis is what you do.\n\n66\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.736\nSo, Cherokee,\nall you have to do is look for\n\n67\n00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:24.185\nevery single packet that's out there that\nhas a black background and red text.\n\n68\n00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:25.072\n&gt;&gt; Good luck with that.\n\n69\n00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.913\nYou had, what, 225,000?\n\n70\n00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:28.397\n&gt;&gt; 256,000 packets now.\n\n71\n00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:29.256\n&gt;&gt; 56 now.\n[LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:30.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's starting to head\n\n73\n00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:32.390\nnorth a little bit.\n\n74\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.890\nSo let's say that there\nare several thousand of these.\n\n75\n00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.550\nEven if I find all of them,\n\n76\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.450\nright, it still may not allow me\nto make much sense of it, okay?\n\n77\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.358\nBut there are some tools that really help\nus to focus in on the very fact that\n\n78\n00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:49.922\nwe have unusual traffic,\nor maybe what we'll call,\n\n79\n00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:53.904\nunusual is probably the best thing,\nuncommon, unusual.\n\n80\n00:03:53.904 --> 00:03:58.140\nThose are kind of the terms that we want\nto use that Wireshark essentially keeps\n\n81\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.725\ntrack of.\n\n82\n00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:02.939\nIt says, hey, I'm keeping track of\nthese things that are one-offs or\n\n83\n00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.663\nthings that seem to indicate that\nthere may be some errors going\n\n84\n00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:10.970\non that may not be doing exactly\nwhat we want to be able to do.\n\n85\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.800\nSo don't let, and this is the key here.\n\n86\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.738\nHey, if this is your first\nkind of foray into Wireshark,\n\n87\n00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:19.313\ndon't let the overwhelming\nnumber of packets and\n\n88\n00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:23.437\nthe amount of information you see on\nthe screen overwhelm you at the beginning.\n\n89\n00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:25.635\nEspecially if you're looking for\nsomething and\n\n90\n00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:28.540\nyou're not exactly sure\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n91\n00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.720\nBut realize that there are tools available\nto you that can help to kind of focus in.\n\n92\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.870\nSo with the filters that\nwe've talked about such\n\n93\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.980\nas isolating it down to SSH and\ntelnet those are great, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.120\nThey will really help us out, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.150\nUsing the colors will\nreally help us out as well.\n\n96\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.880\nBut there's actually even more\ntools that are available.\n\n97\n00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.144\n&gt;&gt; Well, you peaked my interest, Ronnie.\n\n98\n00:04:52.144 --> 00:04:54.480\nWhat are those tools called and\nwhere can we find them?\n\n99\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so when it comes down to\ntaking a look at some of those tools,\n\n100\n00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.200\nwhat we want to be able to do is, all\nright, so what else could be happening and\n\n101\n00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.800\nhow are these things kind of grouped\ntogether in the way that we show them?\n\n102\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.830\nIn the lower right hand corner of the\nscreen you'll see a couple of different\n\n103\n00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.560\nnotifications here for us.\n\n104\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.090\nSo, right now I have it says wireshark\nen and some long string of numbers.\n\n105\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.310\nAnd I'm not so concerned about it but\n\n106\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.560\nthat's exactly what's\nbeing written right now.\n\n107\n00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.470\nSo here that entire capture\nis really being written and\n\n108\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.960\nI can save that capture if\nI choose to as default.\n\n109\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.700\nRight now that's kind of just a default\nname file that I have going on.\n\n110\n00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.410\nBut notice over here on the left-hand\ncorner if I hover over that red dot it\n\n111\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.400\nsays, error,\nhighest expert level information, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.840\nSo, it's saying,\nhey something else is going on here, and\n\n113\n00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.010\nthere's an error that actually appears.\n\n114\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.850\nYou may see this in multiple different\ncolours at different times, but\n\n115\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.370\nthat is an indication\nthat something else is,\n\n116\n00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.120\nI mean it may give you\nsome more information.\n\n117\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.310\nSo depending on what you select here,\nso let me see that click off and\n\n118\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.350\nthen it changes, no, so let's say that I\nleave it there and I can click on this\n\n119\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.212\nred dot, and what it will do it will bring\nup what we call the expert information for\n\n120\n00:06:08.212 --> 00:06:11.880\nus, the Wireshark expert information,\nand we'll see it here.\n\n121\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.120\nNow, let's say that you go I don't\nlike clicking on those buttons and\n\n122\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.900\nI don't care about that button here.\n\n123\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.032\nYou can get to it of course in another\nway, which is to click on Analyze.\n\n124\n00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:24.389\nAnd then if you follow along,\nif you happen to love those menus here.\n\n125\n00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:25.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a couple of\ndifferent ways to [CROSSTALK]\n\n126\n00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:26.197\n&gt;&gt; So that's under Analyze.\n\n127\n00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:28.109\nYep, a couple of different\nways to get the same thing.\n\n128\n00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:28.629\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n129\n00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.260\n&gt;&gt; Select it and there we are again.\n\n130\n00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.314\nSo it gives you that option\nwhich is fairly nice.\n\n131\n00:06:34.314 --> 00:06:37.500\nAnd at least, I like to have\nthe different options that are available.\n\n132\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.390\nBut I want us see what it's\nreally displaying for us.\n\n133\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.750\nAnd let me see if I can get this to a\npoint where we can kind of the five basic\n\n134\n00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.100\nitems that we have available, okay?\n\n135\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.090\n&gt;&gt; Notice how the expert\ninformation breaks down the packets\n\n136\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.510\nin a couple of ways.\n\n137\n00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.100\nFirst and foremost, it categorizes\nthem in five ways here, okay?\n\n138\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.740\nWe have what we call the severity,\nwe have the summary, the group,\n\n139\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.280\nthe protocol, and the count, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.630\nSo all those are fairly\nimportant pieces of information\n\n141\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.270\nthat may lead us to something\nthat we're looking for.\n\n142\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.610\nFor example, the idea of the count\nis how many times does this happen?\n\n143\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.220\nNew fragment overlaps old data.\n\n144\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:27.176\nThis maybe a possible retransmission here,\nso it says 37 times based on TCP.\n\n145\n00:07:27.176 --> 00:07:30.380\nWell, that might be something for\nus to look at.\n\n146\n00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.110\nAnd now if I select that\narrow that's pointing down,\n\n147\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.140\nnotice it shows me the individual\ntimes that it happened and\n\n148\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.300\nthe way it came across in the packet list,\ntoo.\n\n149\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.200\nSo this is where you can start\nseeing that information,\n\n150\n00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.550\nwhich is also very helpful for\nus to see, okay.\n\n151\n00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.807\nSo, let's break down these\ncategories just briefly so\n\n152\n00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:53.544\nthat we understand what we are looking at.\n\n153\n00:07:53.544 --> 00:07:55.711\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; When you start to take a look at\n\n154\n00:07:55.711 --> 00:08:00.450\nthe idea of the first column that you see\nright here, okay, that's what we call\n\n155\n00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.830\nthe different severity levels is what\nthey call it inside of Wiresharp.\n\n156\n00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.400\nSo, when you see the term error\nthat's a problem exist and\n\n157\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.850\nnormally you can see it in red and\nyou'll see that it\n\n158\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.730\nkind of tells you malformed packets\nfairly often is what you end up seeing.\n\n159\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.076\nAnd that means, hey,\nthis is data that really is bad,\n\n160\n00:08:19.076 --> 00:08:22.248\nit's probably not something you want\nto mess with, and so examine this.\n\n161\n00:08:22.248 --> 00:08:25.894\n&gt;&gt; Which is pretty universal through\nthe different systems we see that or\n\n162\n00:08:25.894 --> 00:08:29.033\nuniversal internationally as well so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n163\n00:08:29.033 --> 00:08:32.670\nyou can see that,\nas well as the protocols that is existing.\n\n164\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.650\nSo it's right over here,\nyou may go, all right.\n\n165\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.120\nSo what is happening, and these are all\ndealing with some type of malform packets\n\n166\n00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.118\nin terms of TCP, SSL, or\nthis quick here to be able to do that.\n\n167\n00:08:45.118 --> 00:08:48.899\nSo it may be something that leads you\nto examine it a little bit further.\n\n168\n00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:51.130\nAnd that's what expert information does.\n\n169\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.820\nIt gives you that ability not to\ndo a detailed analysis on it here.\n\n170\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.080\nBut it points you in\nthe right direction so\n\n171\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.280\nthat you know exactly what\nyou're looking for, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.990\nOr at least get close to\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n173\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.780\nAlso, you have warning, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.630\nA warning is the yellow one that we see.\n\n175\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.270\nLet me see if I can collapse\ndown some of these here.\n\n176\n00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.960\nAnd when you start seeing the idea\nof warning in that yellow,\n\n177\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.980\nthis is normally when we also\nhave unusual error codes, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.570\nSo think about here as saying look,\nthere may be danger here, so\n\n179\n00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.570\nmake sure you also pay attention.\n\n180\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.910\nAnd as I start seeing,\n\n181\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.010\nas far as the preponderance amount\nof information, notice the count.\n\n182\n00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.740\nUp here,\nyou add them all together that's 39, 43,\n\n183\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.900\nas far as the count for\nthese errors that go on, okay.\n\n184\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.125\nDon't get me wrong, that's quite a lot,\nbut compared to 265,000-\n\n185\n00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.070\n&gt;&gt; A lot less to look at.\n\n186\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Packets,\nthen it's a lot less to look at.\n\n187\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.576\nBut now underneath the errors,\nlet me scroll back over here.\n\n188\n00:09:49.406 --> 00:09:51.820\nI can now start seeing a few things here.\n\n189\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:59.417\nAnd if I examine all this I can see\none that stands out pretty good,\n\n190\n00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:06.122\nwhich is this one, Ignored Unknown Record,\nprotocol is SSL, 3199.\n\n191\n00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:08.570\nNow that may be something that's normal.\n\n192\n00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:13.160\nBut the very fact that there's\n3,200 of them may lead me to go,\n\n193\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.200\nmaybe I need to examine that\none a little bit more, right?\n\n194\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.230\nI can also of course take a look\nat some of the summary information\n\n195\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.190\nwhich is also a great column for\nus to able to figure this out too.\n\n196\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.400\nSo, it does help us to identify that.\n\n197\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.890\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, previously you've\nmentioned depending on how you configure,\n\n198\n00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.740\nwhat kind of device you\nhave Wireshark running on,\n\n199\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.520\nwhere you place it, we might see\nsome packets being lost and not.\n\n200\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.760\nSo would you consider this\nto be a cumulative tool\n\n201\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.780\nwhen we're sifting through and\nanalyzing our traffic in this manner?\n\n202\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, it really is.\n\n203\n00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.560\nRemember, that this is not designed to\nkind of say, here's where it actually is,\n\n204\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.820\nit's designed to give you that ability\nto say, I need to maybe focus here and\n\n205\n00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.110\nto take a look at what I'm\nreally taking a look at and\n\n206\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.280\nseeing if I can see the information here.\n\n207\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.940\nSo, it's more of a tip\nthan it is some type of\n\n208\n00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.390\nreally super in depth analysis tool.\n\n209\n00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:10.020\nWe also of course have notes, and\nthis is just notiful information and\n\n210\n00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.190\nyou also end up seeing\nerror codes as well.\n\n211\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.900\nSo notice you have duplicate\nACKs that are going on and\n\n212\n00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.050\nunderstanding this idea of duplicate ACKs.\n\n213\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:23.680\nWhen we did segment one, the part\none of this episode, we talked about\n\n214\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.160\nthe importance of understanding\nthe TCP communication method.\n\n215\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; When we start getting duplicate ACKs,\n\n216\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.790\nyou know that something\nmay not be completely set\n\n217\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.150\nthe way that you think\nit's supposed to be set.\n\n218\n00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.641\nSo just realize that you can see, so\n\n219\n00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:38.292\nI'm trying to see if there's\nanother one besides notes here.\n\n220\n00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:39.850\nI guess there's a lot of duplicate acts.\n\n221\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.747\nLet's see, let me scroll out a little bit\nmore so we don't get too seasick here.\n\n222\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.590\nNope, well all of them\nseem like a that's yeah,\n\n223\n00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.320\nthey're all seeming to\nbe notes at this point.\n\n224\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.757\nSo as I scroll on through, I'm trying\nto see if I can find, there we go.\n\n225\n00:11:56.757 --> 00:11:58.360\nNow, I was trying to get to this point.\n\n226\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.640\nNotice that there's also one called Chat.\n\n227\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.730\nNow for us, when we start taking a look\nat Chat this is generally workflow\n\n228\n00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.530\ninformation, this is what we'll see.\n\n229\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.030\nSo this idea of workflow information\njust tells you if things are actually\n\n230\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.710\nestablished and\ndoing things that they need to do.\n\n231\n00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:18.580\n&gt;&gt; So those are all the ones that you may\nalso see, so chat, warning, note, error.\n\n232\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.090\nThese are kind of the basics of\nvariable levels that you'll end up\n\n233\n00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.180\ndealing with when you\nstart to take a look.\n\n234\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.730\nNow in terms of group information,\n\n235\n00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.920\nyou've seen the majority of these down\nhere are centrally what we call sequences.\n\n236\n00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.690\nSequence is when\nthe Envirostruct itself detects\n\n237\n00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.730\nsome unusual sequencing\nnumbers that may be happening.\n\n238\n00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.960\nSo it could be where you\nskipped a sequence number or\n\n239\n00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.750\nso when things were\ngetting put back together.\n\n240\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.270\nOr you actually had\na retransmission of the packets\n\n241\n00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.980\nthat you also would end up seeing there,\ntoo.\n\n242\n00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.489\nLet me see if I could scroll\nback up toward the top here.\n\n243\n00:12:54.489 --> 00:12:57.940\nLet's see if there's anything else that\nshows up in that term of sequence.\n\n244\n00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.500\nThere we go, undecoded.\n\n245\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.330\nThis is a good one.\n\n246\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.160\nThat's a little bit more unusual.\n\n247\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.960\nUndecoded means Wireshark couldn't\nfigure out how to decode it, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.666\nSomewhere along the line,\neither dissector couldn't do it.\n\n249\n00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:15.940\nIt couldn't actually decode the\ninformation or it was actually encrypted\n\n250\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.930\nof some sort which makes sense on\nthis one here with it being SSL.\n\n251\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.650\nOr you might find out it just couldn't\ndo it at all such as this idea of QUIC.\n\n252\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.866\nNow if you just take a look\nit says dissector for\n\n253\n00:13:27.866 --> 00:13:31.970\nQUIC tags MIDS (Unknown)\ncode not implemented.\n\n254\n00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.240\nSo it let's you know so\n\n255\n00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.050\nthat the dissector just said,\nI don't know how to deal with this thing.\n\n256\n00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.330\nAnd if that's actually an issue,\nyou may have to do that.\n\n257\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.610\nThere's a few more.\n\n258\n00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.230\nThere's, of course, responses and I didn't\nsee anything like that as we come through.\n\n259\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.756\nProtocol, of course, means that it\nfound invalid types of information\n\n260\n00:13:48.756 --> 00:13:51.885\ninside of the protocol\nfields that is expecting.\n\n261\n00:13:51.885 --> 00:13:56.891\nSo there is a lot more to do when\nit comes down to examining the idea\n\n262\n00:13:56.891 --> 00:14:02.300\nof this information to give us\nexactly what we want as well, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.150\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So when you start to take a look.\n\n264\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.250\nProtocol, of course, TCP, UDP, Sync, SSL.\n\n265\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.200\nAnything like this,\n\n266\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.860\nif you're dealing with that specific\nprotocol make sure you pay attention, too.\n\n267\n00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:19.420\nOkay, so all of the information\nwe see right here in terms of\n\n268\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.280\npointing us to the right direction where\nwe're looking to identify traffic that may\n\n269\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.860\nbe causing issues on my network it can\nbe found right here in the expert info.\n\n270\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.130\nNow just when you don't\nthink that's enough,\n\n271\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:37.000\ncuz there always is a little bit more you\n\n272\n00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.828\ncan also pick information so, I'm gonna\nchoose one of these angry red ones here.\n\n273\n00:14:41.828 --> 00:14:45.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now as I go into the detail section\n\n274\n00:14:45.682 --> 00:14:50.711\nnotice that it actually expanded it out\nfor me cuz I was inside of it already.\n\n275\n00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:54.718\nUnder sequence analysis let me see\nof I can zoom in and now tells you,\n\n276\n00:14:54.718 --> 00:14:55.710\nthere it is.\n\n277\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.060\nSo there's the information that\nessentially got it to be listed\n\n278\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.490\nin the way that it did.\n\n279\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:06.570\nAnd it shows you previous segment not\ncaptured, common at capture start.\n\n280\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.990\nSo in other words, it's saying it didn't\ncapture it, but that's fairly common.\n\n281\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.950\nNotice it actually shows you\nseverity level and whether or\n\n282\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.430\nnot it's something that\nyou've got to worry about.\n\n283\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.430\nSo, it can give you a little bit more,\nwhereas the other one gives you a summary\n\n284\n00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.440\nbut it's aggregated in one place to\nreally give you that information.\n\n285\n00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.622\nSo, you can make this decision\nbased on what your next step is.\n\n286\n00:15:25.622 --> 00:15:27.340\n&gt;&gt; Do I need to investigate further.\n\n287\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.580\n&gt;&gt; That's it, so yeah.\n\n288\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.760\nPeople kind of take this as being\na primary step in their investigation,\n\n289\n00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.960\nit could be.\n\n290\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.670\nBut more than anything, right,\n\n291\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.680\nif you're at a loss of where to start, you\nmight start off with this expert info and\n\n292\n00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.510\ngo, wow, there's 5,000 packets\nthat are doing this error.\n\n293\n00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.825\nThat might lead you to go on, let me go\nand investigate that and see what happens.\n\n294\n00:15:48.825 --> 00:15:50.875\n&gt;&gt; Similarly,\nif you were in a Windows environment and\n\n295\n00:15:50.875 --> 00:15:53.402\nyou would hop into event viewer or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n296\n00:15:53.402 --> 00:15:57.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really can give\nyou that type of information.\n\n297\n00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.494\nBut putting together all those tools,\nright, remember that what I just said\n\n298\n00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:04.057\nat the beginning of this episode, these\nare not the only ones that are available.\n\n299\n00:16:04.057 --> 00:16:08.672\nBut they are two of the ones that can at\nleast get you started in using some of\n\n300\n00:16:08.672 --> 00:16:11.820\nthe more advanced features\ninside of Wireshark.\n\n301\n00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.080\nAnd from this point on, it gives you\nthe foundational tools that you'll need,\n\n302\n00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.200\nand you'll be able to come back to this\nand use this at any time in your career.\n\n303\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.820\nAs a novice, to just help you get started.\n\n304\n00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.790\nIf you're an expert, okay, what this\nwill do is even if you can identify\n\n305\n00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.240\nevery packet, it gives you the ability\nto become more efficient, all right,\n\n306\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.530\nbecause Wireshark is racing,\nlet me group them together for you and\n\n307\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.405\nthat way you can see\nthem a little bit easier.\n\n308\n00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:39.655\nSo take advantage of using\nthe expert tools here and the skills\n\n309\n00:16:39.655 --> 00:16:43.727\nthat will now help you to investigate\na little bit further along the line.\n\n310\n00:16:43.727 --> 00:16:45.772\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you so\nmuch for joining us to day, Ronnie.\n\n311\n00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:49.917\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\nlooking at what we have in our advanced\n\n312\n00:16:49.917 --> 00:16:53.047\nfeatures and\nreally investigating those expert tools.\n\n313\n00:16:53.047 --> 00:16:56.982\nHopefully they'll help you all out in\nthe future but that does wrap it up for\n\n314\n00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:58.430\nthis particular episode.\n\n315\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.510\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n316\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.440\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n317\n00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.350\n&gt;&gt;

Well thank you for having me back as\nwe take a look now at just kind of that\n\n16\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.450\nability to do some analysis as well.\n\n17\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.100\nAnd the analysis, even though we can talk\nabout breaking it down into the individual\n\n18\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.690\npackets and counting a little bit of it.\n\n19\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.796\nBut to see it in the whole of it, right?\n\n20\n00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:53.006\nThe idea of using statistical\nanalysis a little bit and\n\n21\n00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.720\nalso of course how it reports out\nto show what we need it to show.\n\n22\n00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.090\nThat's kind of the key to what we need,\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.582\nSo that's what we are gonna take a look\nat are a couple different things.\n\n24\n00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:05.916\nWe're gonna take a look\nat general statistics,\n\n25\n00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:10.323\nI am about to say Packet Tracer,\nWireshark really does show us.\n\n26\n00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:15.155\nAnd then of course then we can move into\nsome protocol specific type of statistics\n\n27\n00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.445\nthat we can also see.\n\n28\n00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:22.150\nWe'll also take a look at some I/O graphs\nthat Wireshark can produce for us as well.\n\n29\n00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.120\nSo this is not exactly the most\nin depth overview of it.\n\n30\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.711\nBut it will at least again get you started\nin realizing how powerful Wireshark really\n\n31\n00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:32.686\nis without needing to add\nin another additional tool,\n\n32\n00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:36.610\nif you'll take the time to learn just\na little bit more about it, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.522\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n34\n00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:40.474\nAnd we'll see where we are, and\n\n35\n00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:44.080\nthis is part of why I started\ngenerating this capture.\n\n36\n00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.535\nIn the last two or three episodes,\nand I'm trying to think,\n\n37\n00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:50.020\nit's probably the last two episodes that\nwe did, it's been running the whole time.\n\n38\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.510\nCuz I wanted to generate a good size and\namount of different packets.\n\n39\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.334\nSo currently I am up to 260,500 packets.\n\n40\n00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:00.304\n&gt;&gt; And we haven't crashed yet.\n\n41\n00:02:00.304 --> 00:02:03.148\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we have not actually crashed it yet\n\n42\n00:02:03.148 --> 00:02:04.930\nat this point, so we're fine.\n\n43\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.877\nSo I've gotten a good amount of data\nthat we can generate some statistics off\n\n44\n00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:11.870\nof is what the key is.\n\n45\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.741\nSo when we start to take a look at\nthis idea of statistical information.\n\n46\n00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:19.916\nIt's fairly intuitive as you look at\nthe top of the screen where it says,\n\n47\n00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:22.680\nStatistics and what we need to look at.\n\n48\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.118\nLet's take a look at a summary\nat the very beginning and\n\n49\n00:02:25.118 --> 00:02:27.774\nthen let's talk about what we\nfind inside of that summary.\n\n50\n00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:29.773\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If I click on Statistics,\n\n51\n00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:33.920\nyou'll notice there are a lot of\nstatistics that we can take a look at.\n\n52\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.117\n&gt;&gt; It's that so.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, going, all the way through and\n\n53\n00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:36.893\nyou'll see up here, these are kind of\nthe more general types of statistics.\n\n54\n00:02:36.893 --> 00:02:41.953\nAnd then when you get into\nthe Service Response Times,\n\n55\n00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:48.230\nthis now becomes a little bit more\nof some protocol specific types.\n\n56\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.795\nAnd then you can actually get\ninto exact single types of\n\n57\n00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:54.650\nprotocol statistics if you want to.\n\n58\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.200\nBut in general terminology, I wanna float\ndown here to iPv4 and iPv6 statistics.\n\n59\n00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.300\nNow right now even as of\nthe recording of this show,\n\n60\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.490\nthe world is starting to move toward iPv6.\n\n61\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.213\nBut its move is not like a sprint,\n\n62\n00:03:12.213 --> 00:03:17.472\nit's not a 100 meter dash to IPv6 and\nwe're still on IPv4.\n\n63\n00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:22.466\nSo normally, at least I know that in\nnetworks that I've been involved in,\n\n64\n00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:25.070\nIPv4 is still kind of the king.\n\n65\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.040\nSo if I wanna find out information about\nnetwork data that's going across those\n\n66\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.247\nmachines, it currently is gonna be IPv4.\n\n67\n00:03:31.247 --> 00:03:37.490\nAt this point, let's scroll out a little\nbit more so that we can see it over here.\n\n68\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.685\nNotice I can see for All the Addresses,\nPorts and Destination,\n\n69\n00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:47.854\nIP Protocol Types, Source and\nDestination Addresses as well.\n\n70\n00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:52.798\nSo I'm just slide just all the addresses\nfrom this point on for right now.\n\n71\n00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:57.296\nSo that we can see just kind of\na very somewhat, let me see.\n\n72\n00:03:57.296 --> 00:03:59.291\nEverything kind of locked up on me,\njust a bit there.\n\n73\n00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.806\nAll right, and\nI didn't wanna full screen it completely.\n\n74\n00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:03.156\nLet me see if I can just double-click.\n\n75\n00:04:03.156 --> 00:04:03.911\nThere we go.\n\n76\n00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.489\nAnd that would just fill\nup the screen instead.\n\n77\n00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n78\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.274\n&gt;&gt; Notice it gives me\nall the IP addresses.\n\n79\n00:04:09.274 --> 00:04:14.262\nNow this is not the most useful of\nthe ones that are available, but\n\n80\n00:04:14.262 --> 00:04:18.160\nif I was focusing in on\na particular IP address.\n\n81\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.117\nLet me see if I can find the IP\naddress for I don't know anything.\n\n82\n00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:25.070\nLet's start right here and\nsee this one, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.331\nActually this one looks good.\n\n84\n00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:32.011\nThere's 8,666 packets,\nI can see of course the rate and\n\n85\n00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:35.798\nthe percentage and\nthe birth rate, birth start.\n\n86\n00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:38.329\nThat's not really super useful to me, but\n\n87\n00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:42.300\nit is telling that we can see if\nwe want to be able to do that.\n\n88\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.550\nSo this one may be too general,\nit does not mean much.\n\n89\n00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.650\nBut if I were examining for\nthe idea what we call bursting,\n\n90\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.010\nthis might be what we choose to do.\n\n91\n00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.315\nSo let me select another one,\nlet me go back to Analyze.\n\n92\n00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:56.193\nOops, not Analyze, Statistics &gt; IPv4 and\n\n93\n00:04:56.193 --> 00:04:59.460\nlet's select Source and\nDestination Addresses.\n\n94\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.470\nWhich is probably a little bit more useful\nfor what we want to do instead here, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.083\nSo now if I collapse down these sort, no,\n\n96\n00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:13.101\nmaybe if I can collapse down the sorts\ninformation and destination addresses.\n\n97\n00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:15.800\nNow I can see the comparison of them.\n\n98\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.520\nAnd even with the summary that's available\nwe still essentially see the information\n\n99\n00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.990\nfrom all of them, but\nnow it's broken down by source.\n\n100\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.160\nSo if I want to know if Cherokee's\ncomputer is connecting out\n\n101\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.240\nto where I think maybe that it\nshouldn't be connecting to.\n\n102\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.585\nI could look down in this list and\ndo something.\n\n103\n00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:34.593\nNow on this machine, she doesn't, cuz\nshe's on a different network than I am.\n\n104\n00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:38.020\nI'm isolated from the rest of our\nproduction network right now.\n\n105\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.560\nBut this is what gives us\nthe ability to do this, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.260\nSo I could connect out and\nsee, for example,\n\n107\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.030\neverything on this 74.125 network.\n\n108\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.280\nCuz there seem to be a lot\nof different sources\n\n109\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.090\nthat are connecting through\nthere as far as the source goes.\n\n110\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.920\nOr if I'm looking for,\nwhere is data going to?\n\n111\n00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.268\nSo I might have a machine where I'm\nexpecting that everybody should be\n\n112\n00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:01.340\nconnected to this one machine.\n\n113\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.110\nI can then isolate that one and go, wait,\nthere should be at least 1,000 of these,\n\n114\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.580\nand there's only 3.\n\n115\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.010\nIn that way, we can start to isolate down\njust even simple things with that as well.\n\n116\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.620\n&gt;&gt; Now, once I identify a particular\nmachine that's on my radar and\n\n117\n00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.600\nI wanna investigate a little bit further.\n\n118\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.080\nAm I able to generate reports from\na particular parameter like that?\n\n119\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.630\n&gt;&gt; You definitely can, so\nlet's take a look at how we can do that.\n\n120\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.687\nAnd I click on, I'm gonna do the wrong\none, Statistics &gt; IPv4 Statistics.\n\n121\n00:06:31.687 --> 00:06:34.430\nI can select Destination and Ports.\n\n122\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.947\nThis time, there we go.\n\n123\n00:06:36.947 --> 00:06:41.530\nNow this may become of course a little\nbit more useful for this one machine.\n\n124\n00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.815\nI can see all the UDP ports and\nwhat I'm expecting to take a look at here\n\n125\n00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:51.950\nTrying to see if I can collapse\nthat down or move it around here.\n\n126\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.662\nLet's see,\nalways private cuz I'm zoomed in.\n\n127\n00:06:55.662 --> 00:07:00.960\nJust taking a little bit of time,\nI know why it's happening.\n\n128\n00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.735\nI forgot this.\n\n129\n00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:03.461\n&gt;&gt; What happened?\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at the full screen\n\n130\n00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:05.324\nthat way cuz I'm like,\nwhy is this not working?\n\n131\n00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:10.244\nYou'll notice of the still loading it's\nbecause I've got 260 plus thousand packets\n\n132\n00:07:10.244 --> 00:07:11.303\nfor to go through.\n\n133\n00:07:11.303 --> 00:07:14.181\nThat's what's happening is not\nreally liking what's going on.\n\n134\n00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:16.813\nBut it is moving is\nstarting to get there and\n\n135\n00:07:16.813 --> 00:07:18.741\nthen we should be able to see\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n\n136\n00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:19.993\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Yehey.\n\n137\n00:07:19.993 --> 00:07:21.093\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's going on here.\n\n138\n00:07:21.093 --> 00:07:23.000\nBut now I can start, there we go.\n\n139\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.208\n[LAUGH] I was like,\nwhy is this not working?\n\n140\n00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:26.887\nBut you can see this.\n\n141\n00:07:26.887 --> 00:07:30.781\nSo now I see, look,\nthere's a bunch of IPv6 traffic.\n\n142\n00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:35.920\nAnd then from here,\nthere of course are all these other ones.\n\n143\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.400\nNow you can see per IP address,\nlet me see if I can zoom in here.\n\n144\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.940\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; I can see some TCP information.\n\n145\n00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.409\nSomething went over on port 443\nas well as this other port.\n\n146\n00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:52.229\nI can also see UDP and 8.8.8 that is my\nDNS server that I also have hooked up.\n\n147\n00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:55.270\nAnd I can also see the different\nport connections as\n\n148\n00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.610\nwell as it's doing just\nregular TCP here too.\n\n149\n00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.420\nSo you can break it down just about\nhowever you want to, to generate and\n\n150\n00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.014\ndisplay some of\nthe information that you want.\n\n151\n00:08:05.014 --> 00:08:07.852\nUsually for\nus it means of course printing it out and\n\n152\n00:08:07.852 --> 00:08:11.000\nmaking sure that\neverything looks that way.\n\n153\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.130\nThe strange thing is,\nit's okay to look at but\n\n154\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.870\nmost of that summarized types of\ninformation about what we capture is\n\n155\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.400\nprobably better not if it's done live time\nbut if it's done, if we stop the capture.\n\n156\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.246\nSo at this point, I'm just gonna stop\nthe capture because with 261,000\n\n157\n00:08:27.246 --> 00:08:27.817\n&gt;&gt; I think you have enough.\n\n158\n00:08:27.817 --> 00:08:29.087\n&gt;&gt; I think I've got enough here.\n\n159\n00:08:29.087 --> 00:08:30.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now that I have that,\n\n160\n00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:35.143\nwe can now start taking look at a few\nother things that are available to\n\n161\n00:08:35.143 --> 00:08:40.071\nus without having to make the machine\ngenerate more as things are coming in to\n\n162\n00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:40.690\ndo this.\n\n163\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.940\nBut the summary, it's okay, but\n\n164\n00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.910\nit really doesn't display a lot of\nuseful information that we have.\n\n165\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.486\nSomething that may be a little bit more\nhelpful in terms of statistics is doing it\n\n166\n00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:55.053\nby the protocol hierarchy instead,\nif I've selected that.\n\n167\n00:08:55.053 --> 00:08:57.150\nLet me try it again.\n\n168\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.001\nProtocol Hierarchy it's\nstill generating down here,\n\n169\n00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:08.286\nit was like it's because I\nget such a huge file again.\n\n170\n00:09:08.286 --> 00:09:09.031\n&gt;&gt; Patience.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n171\n00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:10.157\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not my best strong suit here.\n\n172\n00:09:10.157 --> 00:09:15.410\nSo of course I now watch it\nlike 6 times in a row here.\n\n173\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.685\n&gt;&gt; Kind a little click copy.\n\n174\n00:09:16.685 --> 00:09:17.510\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n175\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.398\n&gt;&gt; Happens to the best of us.\n&gt;&gt; Now this is much more detailed and\n\n176\n00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:23.670\nmuch more information that we can see.\n\n177\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.380\nSo here I'm gonna zoom\nin just a little bit, so\n\n178\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.040\nthat we can see a little bit more here.\n\n179\n00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:32.840\nNotice it breaks it down\nby the protocol itself.\n\n180\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.410\nFrame, Ethernet,\nLogical-Link, you name it.\n\n181\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.080\nIf I scroll down, I can see so\nmuch more information.\n\n182\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.291\nI can see the percentage of packets\nversus the entire number of packets here.\n\n183\n00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:50.040\nI can break it down to the bytes,\nbits and mbytes, you name it.\n\n184\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.141\nIt can show me this amount of information,\n\n185\n00:09:53.141 --> 00:09:58.753\n96.3% we're of course IP version\n4 packets, UDP was about 4.5%.\n\n186\n00:09:58.753 --> 00:10:01.053\nSo now you can start breaking it down and\n\n187\n00:10:01.053 --> 00:10:05.180\nusing some analysis that you can do\noff the statistics to help you out.\n\n188\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:12.610\nThe majority of my traffic, notice 92%,\npretty much TCP types of traffic.\n\n189\n00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:18.380\nIt showed that Telnet and\nSSH that we did in earlier episodes too.\n\n190\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.823\nSo this is where you can start finding\nout just a little bit more useful\n\n191\n00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:27.037\ninformation by using something\njust like a protocol hierarchy or\n\n192\n00:10:27.037 --> 00:10:29.201\nto break it down when you need to.\n\n193\n00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:31.290\nNow, just when you think\nthat that's enough, right?\n\n194\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.990\nThere is of course, more details in here.\n\n195\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.950\nAnd we just want to go\nthrough a few of them.\n\n196\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.050\nThe other that you can also see\nare what we call conversations.\n\n197\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.730\nConversation to me, is probably a little\nbit more useful, if you're tracking\n\n198\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.290\nbetween what two machines that are trying\nto figure out how this stuff is going on.\n\n199\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.138\nSo let's say that we want to go to IPV 4,\nand\n\n200\n00:10:53.138 --> 00:10:58.442\nfrom this particular point here,\nlet me see, where is it?\n\n201\n00:10:58.442 --> 00:11:01.100\nThere it is,\nI was going to say where's my machine?\n\n202\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.324\nWhich is 10.47.100, so\n\n203\n00:11:05.324 --> 00:11:10.138\nnotice this is address A and address B.\n\n204\n00:11:10.138 --> 00:11:13.874\nThe number of packets,\nI can see the unit of transmission,\n\n205\n00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:16.400\nin other words the direction.\n\n206\n00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.694\nNotice that packets A going to B, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:24.349\nAnd then I can even see it in\nthe terms of the number of bytes,\n\n208\n00:11:24.349 --> 00:11:28.730\npackets from b to a as well and\nthe number of bytes.\n\n209\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.270\nAnd then of course,\nit's start and duration.\n\n210\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.970\nAnd you can even count the number\nof bits that break down that way.\n\n211\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.778\nSo if you're really looking for the amount\nof data, being able to break this down.\n\n212\n00:11:40.778 --> 00:11:44.398\nYou can also see it right there in\nthe conversation between just those two\n\n213\n00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:48.320\nmachines which helps you to isolate\ndown and figure out what you want to do.\n\n214\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.402\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; You wanna break\n\n215\n00:11:49.402 --> 00:11:52.310\nit down to TCP protocols instead?\n\n216\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.580\nNotice that you could even do that.\n\n217\n00:11:54.580 --> 00:12:00.089\nFor now I could see the like\nthe SSH connections in port 443 and\n\n218\n00:12:00.089 --> 00:12:02.649\ncontinue on of course in UDP.\n\n219\n00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:05.560\nThat is kind of more specific, right?\n\n220\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.248\nSo everything that we're doing has\nbeen working from the general to more\n\n221\n00:12:09.248 --> 00:12:10.042\nthe specific.\n\n222\n00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:15.268\nSo this particular view where we talk\nabout the conversations is also helpful,\n\n223\n00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:16.750\na little bit more too.\n\n224\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.990\nRemember that data has to\ngo between multiple devices\n\n225\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.580\nbefore it ever hits endpoints.\n\n226\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.180\nThe great thing is we also have\nstatistics based on endpoints\n\n227\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.390\nthat we can also take a look at.\n\n228\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.840\nAnd this is where we get,\nkind of a little bit more,\n\n229\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.810\nnot the super detail that we\nsaw in the conversations.\n\n230\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.636\nBut now this is just\nshowing you whether or\n\n231\n00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:42.333\nnot the data itself has arrived at\nthe endpoints the way that we want.\n\n232\n00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:45.752\nAnd we can even see a slight\nsummary up here at the top.\n\n233\n00:12:45.752 --> 00:12:50.612\nTCP 981 versus UDP it\nsays about 1,200 up here.\n\n234\n00:12:50.612 --> 00:12:56.419\nIPv6, I've got about 18 different\nendpoints that are out there for us to do.\n\n235\n00:12:56.419 --> 00:13:00.677\nAnd of course, IPv4,\n319 just regular Ethernet connections\n\n236\n00:13:00.677 --> 00:13:04.870\nnotice based on the Mac address,\nit's also available here too.\n\n237\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:12.210\nSo those are kind of the basic\nmore generic types of statistics,\n\n238\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.310\nthat we're probably gonna end up\nseeing when it comes down to using\n\n239\n00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.080\nthe statistical data available to us.\n\n240\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.107\nThat is not the only thing that\nwe should take a look at, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:22.107 --> 00:13:23.351\nInside of Wireshark,\n\n242\n00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:28.020\nwe also have the ability to take a look\nat graphing some of the information.\n\n243\n00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.648\n&gt;&gt; I was just about to ask you about that,\nbecause looking at all that text based\n\n244\n00:13:32.648 --> 00:13:37.662\nreport, it can be a little difficult to,\nat a glance, to grab some information.\n\n245\n00:13:37.662 --> 00:13:42.579\nSo you had mentioned that having that\nopen source code, I can only imagine\n\n246\n00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:47.280\nthat a lot of different third party\nvendors would be jumping on board.\n\n247\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.665\nBut if they already have\nsomething integrated, maybe not.\n\n248\n00:13:49.665 --> 00:13:52.216\n&gt;&gt; Well nope,\nthey do have it integrated in here and\n\n249\n00:13:52.216 --> 00:13:55.020\nyou can continue to add\nwhatever you want to.\n\n250\n00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.790\nBut the nice thing about\npeople that develop coding for\n\n251\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.552\nit, they make it pretty.\n\n252\n00:13:58.552 --> 00:13:59.848\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's the key, so-\n\n253\n00:13:59.848 --> 00:14:00.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:14:00.368 --> 00:14:03.415\n&gt;&gt; Even though this is more functional and\nit can be okay,\n\n255\n00:14:03.415 --> 00:14:05.810\nnotice that you can see\na couple of things.\n\n256\n00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.971\nHere, inside of what's been added on,\nright?\n\n257\n00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:11.580\nThis is all packets and\nthen TCP error packets.\n\n258\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.080\nAnd of course, they chose to try and color\nthem in colors that are almost identical.\n\n259\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.210\nSo you know how well that\nhelps when you start doing it.\n\n260\n00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.480\nSo here are TCP errors and\nthen all packets.\n\n261\n00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.561\nAnd it's very difficult to see, okay?\n\n262\n00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:27.690\nWhen you start to take\na look at all of them.\n\n263\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.460\nEspecially as tiny as it is,\n\n264\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.220\nthey've really tried to integrate\nthat in and the availability of it.\n\n265\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.179\nIf I want to add in an additional thing,\nI can select something else.\n\n266\n00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.045\nAnd I don't know why it chose\nto do just all packets.\n\n267\n00:14:41.045 --> 00:14:43.684\nIt wouldn't let me,\nit should let me be able to.\n\n268\n00:14:43.684 --> 00:14:46.428\nThere it goes.\nIt's starting to regenerate down here,\n\n269\n00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:47.960\nyou can see that.\n\n270\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.464\nSo it's from here,\nyou now select instead of all packets.\n\n271\n00:14:51.464 --> 00:14:54.240\nYou can now do whatever your filter is.\n\n272\n00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.967\nAnd this is where learning those display\nfilters is really going to help you out\n\n273\n00:14:58.967 --> 00:15:01.902\nIf you want to see just\nfour specific IP address or\n\n274\n00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:06.292\nMAC address or whatever it is,\nwhatever else you choose to add in there.\n\n275\n00:15:06.292 --> 00:15:09.559\nSo that is something else that you\ncan generate which is a nice chart.\n\n276\n00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:12.380\nNow you might be wondering\nwhy do I wann to see that?\n\n277\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.436\nWell sometimes it's not about you\nseeing as much as it is about somebody\n\n278\n00:15:16.436 --> 00:15:18.339\nelse that needs to see that data.\n\n279\n00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:22.440\nAnd that is because not everybody has the\ntechnical expertise that you're gonna end\n\n280\n00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.110\nup with as you continue to work more and\nmore with this.\n\n281\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.165\nBut for them to see what you're seeing,\nputting it into a graph or\n\n282\n00:15:29.165 --> 00:15:32.187\ninto a chart is probably\nthe best way to do that and\n\n283\n00:15:32.187 --> 00:15:36.460\nto relay the information so\nthat they understand what going on.\n\n284\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.880\nSo just realize that\nthe idea of the graphing and\n\n285\n00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.810\nthe reporting information that we're\nseeing will really help you out, okay?\n\n286\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.470\nNow before we close out of the show,\n\n287\n00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.410\nthose were like I said the more\ngeneric ones that are available.\n\n288\n00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.460\nBut there's just a couple of more that\nwe want to talk about just briefly.\n\n289\n00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.430\nAnd one is just the idea of\nservice response times, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:04.295\nService response times can really\nhelp you out when you suspect\n\n291\n00:16:04.295 --> 00:16:06.420\nslowness in your network.\n\n292\n00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.656\nNow when I mean something like that,\nbecause what happens is,\n\n293\n00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:13.970\nin terms of slowness, there's\na request that's made of the server.\n\n294\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.960\nHow long does it take for that request\nto be sent to the server, and then for\n\n295\n00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.880\nthe response to come back?\n\n296\n00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.650\nWell you can measure that, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.540\nThe problem that you and\n\n298\n00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.670\nI have in measuring is what tool\nthat we use to measure that, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.579\nWell here, you can see that\nthis one really does cover up\n\n300\n00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:36.082\nquite a few different types\nof connections for us.\n\n301\n00:16:36.082 --> 00:16:39.290\nAFP is an Apple file protocol or\nfile sharing protocol.\n\n302\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.947\n&gt;&gt; So if you really wanna get\nspecific this is where you go?\n\n303\n00:16:40.947 --> 00:16:42.290\n&gt;&gt; This is where you go.\n\n304\n00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.190\nRadius, if you're not sure if\nthe radius server's responding,\n\n305\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.320\ndiameter up there that you see.\n\n306\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.051\nAnd then look, SMB and SMB1 and\n2 are also available here too.\n\n307\n00:16:52.051 --> 00:16:56.290\nNow for us, in the Windows world, if we\ncreate a file share, it's gonna be what,\n\n308\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.280\nan SMB file share.\n\n309\n00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.209\nAnd someone says,\n\n310\n00:16:58.209 --> 00:17:01.822\nwell I'm not really connecting at\nthe speeds I thought I was connecting.\n\n311\n00:17:01.822 --> 00:17:05.691\nWell we can use this to help us to see\nwhat the response time is of a request\n\n312\n00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.490\nthat's sent, versus what comes back.\n\n313\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.250\nMeasure that over time between multiple\ncomputers and now you can tell whether or\n\n314\n00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.250\nnot it's just their computer or\nis it happening for everybody.\n\n315\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:20.500\nAnd that's what you are also looking\nat in something that you intend to do.\n\n316\n00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.753\nSo service response times,\n\n317\n00:17:21.753 --> 00:17:24.960\nusing those particular protocols\nthat you see listed there.\n\n318\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.300\nThose are kind of the ones\nthat say is the most popular.\n\n319\n00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.150\nAnd of course,\n\n320\n00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:35.510\nthat can be modify later on as we\ncontinue to go through more and more.\n\n321\n00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:41.880\nNow there's some other types that you may\nalso see as well that can be added in.\n\n322\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.390\nSo sometimes what you can end up\nseeing is that let me see where.\n\n323\n00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.250\nThey've actually got it\nunderneath Telephony now instead.\n\n324\n00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.500\nSo this used to all be underneath just\nthat response time stuff that you see, but\n\n325\n00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.280\nnow you can take a look at VoIP Calls.\n\n326\n00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.868\nNow I don't have any\nVoIP traffic going on.\n\n327\n00:18:00.868 --> 00:18:05.333\nBut you can take a look at the information\nthere if you want to take a look at their\n\n328\n00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:08.940\nparticular type of response\ntime statistics as well.\n\n329\n00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.510\nAnd then of course even\nmulticast streaming.\n\n330\n00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.762\nIf for some reason you're really hooked\non trying to figure out where the link CS\n\n331\n00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:18.610\nin terms of multicast traffic too.\n\n332\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:23.296\nSo all of those are combined together\nto really give you that particular\n\n333\n00:18:23.296 --> 00:18:27.512\ninformation that you need before\neven dig in to all the packets,\n\n334\n00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:30.185\nif you want to break them down in the way.\n\n335\n00:18:30.185 --> 00:18:32.200\nSo take advantage of that.\n\n336\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.432\nSo the tools that we've talked about here,\nas well as everything we've shown you on\n\n337\n00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:38.830\nthe show,\nshould help to get you established.\n\n338\n00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:43.038\nAnd ready to at least\nbegin to use Wireshark.\n\n339\n00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:46.960\nIt is gonna take a bit more time for\nyou to be dedicated to using it.\n\n340\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.740\nAnd the more that you use,\nthe better you are going to be at it.\n\n341\n00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.420\nThe more information that you would\nchoose to try and find with it.\n\n342\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.550\nYou'll become of course,\n\n343\n00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.310\na better user of it which will make\nyou much more efficient as well.\n\n344\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:02.027\nBut overall though,\nat least there you have kinda the basic\n\n345\n00:19:02.027 --> 00:19:05.809\nskill set that will get\nyou inside of a network.\n\n346\n00:19:05.809 --> 00:19:10.815\nBe able to start doing some capture and\na bit of analysis as well.\n\n347\n00:19:10.815 --> 00:19:14.315\n&gt;&gt; I definitely see how using these tools\ncan help you become more efficient.\n\n348\n00:19:14.315 --> 00:19:17.625\nEspecially if you know the exact type of\ntraffic that you really are looking to\n\n349\n00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:18.565\nhone in on.\n\n350\n00:19:18.565 --> 00:19:21.075\nSo thank you for taking the time for\nshowing us how to use this tool.\n\n351\n00:19:21.075 --> 00:19:23.993\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n352\n00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:27.600\nThat is gonna go ahead and wrap it up for\nthis show, but we're gonna sign off.\n\n353\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.824\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n354\n00:19:28.824 --> 00:19:29.408\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n355\n00:19:29.408 --> 00:19:31.022\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n356\n00:19:31.022 --> 00:19:38.907\n[MUSIC]\n\n357\n00:19:38.907 --> 00:19:41.090\n&gt;&gt;
