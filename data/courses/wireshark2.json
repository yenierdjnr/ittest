is,\nhow to use it, and\n\n4\n00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:12.220\nperhaps what kind of network protocol\nanalyzers are available to us, well,\n\n5\n00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.430\nthen you're in the right spot.\n\n6\n00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.020\nWe really are gonna be taking a look at\nhow to use this utility to benefit you in\n\n7\n00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.200\nyour network to analyze the different\ntypes of traffic depending on where\n\n8\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.020\nyou place this within your network, and\n\n9\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.980\nwhat machine do you really wanna focus\nit on or in fact, your entire network.\n\n10\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.874\nSo, let's go ahead and hand this off to\nRonnie Wong because he's gonna really\n\n11\n00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:36.654\nexplain what we'll be looking\nat within these series.\n\n12\n00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:41.209\n&gt;&gt; All right, as we get started and taking\nlook at using Wireshark, we, of course,\n\n13\n00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:45.236\nwanna make sure that you understand\nthe very basics of how to get set up and\n\n14\n00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:47.613\nhave, not only the knowledge, but also,\n\n15\n00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:51.927\nof course, a few of the skills that you\nneed to get started in capturing data.\n\n16\n00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:54.700\nAnd, of course,\nseeing what you really need.\n\n17\n00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.570\nSo, what we're gonna begin with,\nof course,\n\n18\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.600\nis just a simple installation\nof Wireshark as well.\n\n19\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.410\nWe're gonna talk about what Wireshark is,\nbut then, of course,\n\n20\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.520\nwe'll install Wireshark.\n\n21\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.070\nI'm gonna show you how to install it,\n\n22\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.330\nnot only in Windows which is by far\nthe most popular way to install it.\n\n23\n00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.329\nWe'll also do it on the MacBook 2 and\n\n24\n00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.400\nthen, we'll also show you how you can\ninstall it in a Linux distro as well.\n\n25\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.759\nFrom that point, we would jump in to\njust showing you how to do a basic\n\n26\n00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.530\ntype of packet capturing, which is just\ngetting all the data onto your machine.\n\n27\n00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.790\nFrom that point, you can use it to analyze\nthe amount of data that you have captured.\n\n28\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.910\nSo we're gonna perform a simple type\nof data capture available for us.\n\n29\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.090\nThen, of course, now that you know\nhow to do those basic things,\n\n30\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.670\nit's the interface that can be really\nconfusing at times because there are so\n\n31\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.060\nmany different options.\n\n32\n00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960\nWe're gonna walk you through\nthe most basic of the interface so\n\n33\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.340\nthat you understand what you're seeing and\nwhat the layout is, and of course,\n\n34\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.830\nhow you can get access\nto some of the tools.\n\n35\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.220\nAnd the beginning area is making sure,\nof course, that we can start and\n\n36\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.500\nstop the capture as we need to.\n\n37\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.690\nOf course, with all the data\non our machines at this point,\n\n38\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.750\nthe problem that we have is simple,\nis now we have a gigantic virtual haystack\n\n39\n00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.200\nof all of these different\nsleevers of data that we have.\n\n40\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.400\nHow is it that we begin to pinpoint or\n\n41\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.280\nfind that one needle in\na haystack that we need?\n\n42\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.860\nWe'll talk a bit about using different\nfilters that will help us to begin to\n\n43\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.970\nwhittle down that haystack to\nreally isolate and focus down\n\n44\n00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.350\non the packets that we're really trying\nto take a look at as well, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.460\nNow, even though you think we\nshould be done at that point, well,\n\n46\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.130\nthere are advanced features that we can\nalso talk about too, which of course,\n\n47\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.400\nis being able to capture the conversation\nof the data between two machines, right?\n\n48\n00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.840\nSo not only seeing one side of a capture,\nbut\n\n49\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.660\nactually being able to see if the data can\nflow on both sides of the capture as well.\n\n50\n00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.660\nWe'll take a look at doing that, as well\nas, of course, using some of the expert\n\n51\n00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.330\ninformation tools that we'll see, that are\nalso built into Wireshark to help us to\n\n52\n00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.040\nkind of pinpoint in the unusual\ntraffic that we're analyzing.\n\n53\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.039\nEspecially for errors and for warnings\nthat are going on in our systems or for\n\n54\n00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.554\nproblems, we'll also be able to\nuse that to help us to focus them.\n\n55\n00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:18.618\nAnd then, of course,\nlastly we'll start setting it up here for\n\n56\n00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:23.320\ntaking a look at the statistical\ninformation that we can also find out.\n\n57\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.550\nWe'll take a look at the most\ngeneral types of statistics and\n\n58\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.770\nthen we'll move into the realm\nof protocols specific types of\n\n59\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.730\nstatistics that we can\nalso take advantage of.\n\n60\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.100\nBut, if you say, hey, I haven't\nreally worked with Wireshark before,\n\n61\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.510\nthis is a great place for you to begin.\n\n62\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.360\nIf you need a refresher,\nthis is a great place for you to begin.\n\n63\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.420\nAs this series is really about\nthe foundation of learning about it,\n\n64\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.220\nwe think that this will really help you,\nespecially if you're getting started in\n\n65\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.580\nit, to begin to use it, and\nto feel more comfortable with it.\n\n66\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.960\nThis series has the potential,\nof course, of going on and\n\n67\n00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.920\nactually developing later content\nwhich will add on to the end of this\n\n68\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.880\nparticular short series of shows to\nprobably do more scenario types of\n\n69\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.550\nexamination of data as it goes\nacross our interfaces too.\n\n70\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.770\nSo, check back every once in a while as\nyou're watching through these series, and\n\n71\n00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.320\nyou might see one, two,\n\n72\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.620\nor maybe even three or four different\nepisodes start adding in and\n\n73\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.000\nfilling out Wireshark to help us to make\nit the best possible show that we can.\n\n74\n00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.096\nBut at least this will get you\na great start and a beginning.\n\n75\n00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:34.046\nSo, if you are ready to actually start\ntaking that journey, get ready for\n\n76\n00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:37.501\nthat very first episode, and\nCherokee and I will see you there.\n\n77\n00:04:37.501 -->
