00:00:14.968\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and I will be\nyour host for this this course overview.\n\n4\n00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:18.140\nAnd what we're going to be covering\nin this course overview is, well,\n\n5\n00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.760\nexactly what we're gonna be talking\nabout throughout these episodes.\n\n6\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.150\nWho is this target audience?\n\n7\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.969\nWho should be the ones that are watching\nthese shows in this series?\n\n8\n00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.666\nAnd do I need to know anything\nbefore we get started?\n\n9\n00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:33.870\nAnd any extra tidbits that I might have\nfor you as we go through everything.\n\n10\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.080\nThis series is broken up\ninto two main sections,\n\n11\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.430\nwe have our graphical elements and\nwe have automation.\n\n12\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.110\nIn our graphical elements section,\n\n13\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.690\nwe're going to be going over how to\ninsert images in to our Word document.\n\n14\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.210\nWe'll also be covering shapes and\nSmartArt.\n\n15\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.247\nWe'll also be creating and\ninserting tables and charts.\n\n16\n00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:58.297\nFor all of these different graphical\nobjects, we'll be learning how to format\n\n17\n00:00:58.297 --> 00:01:02.662\nthem, make them really pretty, maybe\nthrow some pink in there and some purple.\n\n18\n00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.960\nWe'll also talk about how\nto actually position and\n\n19\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.090\nword warp these in our document.\n\n20\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.889\nSo we know exactly where we want to\nhave them placed in relationship to\n\n21\n00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.471\nthe words on the page.\n\n22\n00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:18.149\nIn the automation section, we're gonna\nbe talking about creating templates.\n\n23\n00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.257\nAnd exactly what is a template, which I\nfeel is a misconstrued word sometimes if\n\n24\n00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:28.890\nwe're talking about the technical, correct\nway of using a template within Word.\n\n25\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410\nSo definitely stay tuned for\n\n26\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.055\nthat episode, so we can know that\nthe right way to be using it.\n\n27\n00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:39.310\nWe're also be talking about adding quick\nparts, and how the building blocks within\n\n28\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.462\nword can be really hardy to make\nus a more efficient user of Word.\n\n29\n00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:46.940\nWe're also gonna be reporting macros,\nall those steps that you have to do\n\n30\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.230\nall the time, record a macro, hit the play\nbutton and make your life a lot easier.\n\n31\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.660\nWe'll also be inserting linked objects\nin from Excel into our Word documents\n\n32\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.730\nto be able to pull that information and\ngenerate the content automatically.\n\n33\n00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.345\nAnd the all important mail merge,\nwhich is a lot of fun, and once you have\n\n34\n00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:09.900\nfigured out how to do those step by\nsteps it becomes a lot easier for you.\n\n35\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.230\nThe target audience,\n\n36\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.390\nany Office user would be the perfect\nperson to watch these episodes.\n\n37\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.050\nNow, when I say Office,\n\n38\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.000\nnotice that here it is capitalized\nmeaning that Office as Microsoft Office.\n\n39\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.192\nYou use Word on a daily basis\nto create documents for\n\n40\n00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:29.712\nanything that you use in your office work.\n\n41\n00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:34.694\nWhich might be a home office, could be a\nlarge office, could be a large university,\n\n42\n00:02:34.694 --> 00:02:39.070\nall the different levels of where\nyour physical office might be.\n\n43\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.280\nBut again, in relationship to\nthe Office products from Microsoft.\n\n44\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.300\nAnd this is for,\nI would say, upper basics,\n\n45\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.660\nto where you understand how to\ninsert text into a Word document.\n\n46\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.124\nSo you're comfortable with inserting text,\n\n47\n00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:58.040\nyou really just wanna kinda fancy up\nyour documents, and add some of those\n\n48\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.289\ndifferent elements that will kind of add\na little bit of flair to your document.\n\n49\n00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:06.660\nAnd as well making some of those tasks\nthat you do to be repeatable, and\n\n50\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.860\nmake it easier for\nyou in that automation section.\n\n51\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.380\nSo this would be more towards,\nI would say, your advance users.\n\n52\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.520\nThis is a continuation from\nour Word Essentials series so\n\n53\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.600\nI will be referring to that series as\nwell throughout these different episodes.\n\n54\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.347\nSo make sure you go check that\nout in our course library.\n\n55\n00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:27.860\nWhat do you need to know\nabout before we get started?\n\n56\n00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.060\nA foundational knowledge of Word, such as,\ndo you know how to format your text?\n\n57\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.371\nAre you familiar with styles?\n\n58\n00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:37.820\nCuz I love styles, and\nI'll be talking about them all the time.\n\n59\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.730\nSo make sure you have a foundational\nknowledge of how to create styles, and\n\n60\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.590\nhow to use styles effectively.\n\n61\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.370\nAs well as page layout elements, such\nas section breaks, page breaks, how to\n\n62\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.660\ncreate columns, and those are again,\ncovered in that Word Essential shows.\n\n63\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.450\nBasic knowledge of how to use your Windows\noperating system, how to go to your\n\n64\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.972\nfile explorer, how to open files,\nhow to save files and when to print.\n\n65\n00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:00.778\nAnd of course,\n\n66\n00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:04.693\nsome familiarity with other Office\nproducts will be helpful here as well.\n\n67\n00:04:04.693 --> 00:04:09.133\nIf you know how to use Excel pretty well,\nthen that will help you in Word, or\n\n68\n00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:13.592\nsay you know how to use Outlook or\nPowerPoint that could be helpful as well.\n\n69\n00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:17.568\nThere's a lot of things that\ncrossover between the products, so\n\n70\n00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:21.991\nif you know a little bit about one,\nyou know a little bit about the other.\n\n71\n00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:26.090\nAnd the last parts I like to talk\nabout are these extra tidbits.\n\n72\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.070\nThere's always more than one\nway to do something in Word.\n\n73\n00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.950\nSo if I might be explaining ways one and\ntwo,\n\n74\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.580\nthere might be ways three and four, that\nyou might know about that I didn't cover.\n\n75\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.946\nThat's just the way it works\nwithin these Office products,\n\n76\n00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:43.861\nthere's always different ways.\n\n77\n00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:46.917\nAnd it's one I still learn about it too,\nwhere like, I didn't know you could\n\n78\n00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:50.100\nright-click and use that option or\nI didn't know this shortcut did that.\n\n79\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.920\nSo just know that there will be\nmultiple ways that I might not cover.\n\n80\n00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.280\nUpdates happen, yes, it does.\n\n81\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.840\nSo as an Office 365 subscriber,\nthe product is always updating.\n\n82\n00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.840\nAnd at the time of the recording,\nI am on a specific version of whatever\n\n83\n00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.960\nthe update was at in\nthe Office 365 subscription.\n\n84\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.224\nSo you might see different buttons or\ndifferent options, or\n\n85\n00:05:16.224 --> 00:05:19.232\nthings might have changed\na little bit from the time that\n\n86\n00:05:19.232 --> 00:05:22.688\nI recorded these episodes to\nthe time that you're watching it.\n\n87\n00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:27.076\nAnd that also being said, the way that\nyour network is organized, let's say,\n\n88\n00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:31.465\nif you are in a large organization, you\nmight not get updates as frequently, or\n\n89\n00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:34.440\nmaybe they've turned them off altogether.\n\n90\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.840\nSo things might be a little bit different,\nso if there's some slight variations or\n\n91\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.260\nI'm showing you something that you\nsee in your documents, it's like,\n\n92\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.020\nI don't have this available to me.\n\n93\n00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.310\nThat is most of the reasons why it\nwon't be is cuz of the updates and\n\n94\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.800\nwhat version you're on.\n\n95\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.640\nOr your network settings to where\nmaybe they've put a group policy on to\n\n96\n00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.100\nwhere you're not allowed to\ndo this particular function,\n\n97\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.980\nbecause they have locked that down.\n\n98\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.170\nSo those things happen.\n\n99\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.701\nSearching for answers,\nthe oracle of the Internet is out there.\n\n100\n00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.134\nThere's a lot of great information that\nyou can search through whatever search\n\n101\n00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:16.248\nengine you feel like to say, hey,\nI wanna learn how to do x, y, z in Word.\n\n102\n00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:19.670\nYou will have a ton of different\nwebsites that will be able to guide you\n\n103\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.744\nin the right direction, and the Microsoft\nhelp files are always really helpful.\n\n104\n00:06:23.744 --> 00:06:26.961\nThat's probably one of the first\nplaces I would start, and\n\n105\n00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.000\nthen go on to other places.\n\n106\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.003\nAnd most importantly, have fun.\n\n107\n00:06:31.003 --> 00:06:33.743\nI know that this can get\nreally frustrating sometimes,\n\n108\n00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.620\nespecially if you're fighting and\nlike why won't it just move over?\n\n109\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.550\nI've been there, I understand.\n\n110\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.540\nBut that's where you need to just take a\nbreath, turn it off, go do something else,\n\n111\n00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.180\ncome back and then it's poof,\nit magically works.\n\n112\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.460\nSo just try to keep that attitude of hey,\n\n113\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.340\nif I don't get it right the first\ntime I'll try it again.\n\n114\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.090\nEspecially when you're watching these\nepisodes, just have a good time.\n\n115\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.390\nWe like to cut up here and there and\n\n116\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.140\nkeep it light, and\njust keep it fun for all of you.\n\n117\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.213\nSo I hope you enjoy, and I hope to\nsee you soon in some episodes soon.\n\n118\n00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:06.141\n[LAUGH] Have a good time.\n\n119\n00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:11.476\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.460\nYou're watching the Microsoft Word\n2016 advance show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.150\nI'm you're host Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.590\nAnd today, we're going to be diving\ninto well, actually images here, right?\n\n6\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.640\nAdding in, doing some basic imaging,\n\n7\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.420\nas well as some advanced imaging, and

images.\n\n13\n00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.735\nOne of my favorite subjects.\n\n14\n00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:41.910\nIt's probably next to topography and Word\nand Excel and PowerPoint and Photoshop.\n\n15\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.780\nSo its there in the gamut.\n\n16\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.580\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of kicking down\nthe line here a little bit.\n\n17\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.820\nBut no, images are very important for\nour docs, aren't they?\n\n18\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.335\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they are.\n\n19\n00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.595\nSo this is ways that we can\nenhance our word files.\n\n20\n00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:56.175\nNow sometimes yo might not need pictures.\n\n21\n00:00:56.175 --> 00:01:00.035\nBut a lot of times it helps\npaint a picture, tell a story.\n\n22\n00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:01.695\nYou know, talking about bunnies?\n\n23\n00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.665\nWhy don't you throw a picture\nof a bunny in there, right?\n\n24\n00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.955\nIf you have a thing about cats,\nthrow a picture about cats.\n\n25\n00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:09.415\nSo guess what all our images\nare going to be about?\n\n26\n00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:11.195\n&gt;&gt; Bunnies and cats, I'm assuming.\n\n27\n00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.155\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n28\n00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.065\n&gt;&gt; Well I am a genius.\n\n29\n00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:14.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n30\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.860\n&gt;&gt; You are extremely genius, Ronnie.\n\n31\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.925\n&gt;&gt; I do know the obvious.\n\n32\n00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:19.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can do that.\n\n33\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.760\nAll right, so Vonne,\nwe start taking a look in,\n\n34\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.750\nat the pictures in the basic course, we\nprobably went over some basic of imaging.\n\n35\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.070\nWhat are we taking a look at here?\n\n36\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Actually in the words essential,\nwe didn't do anything within there.\n\n37\n00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Mostly I'm lying to you.\n\n38\n00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We were there at the end and\nso.\n\n39\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that’s right.\n\n40\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.970\n&gt;&gt; And at the beginning of this is but yes\nwe're going to start at the beginning and\n\n41\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.560\ntalk about images.\n\n42\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.540\nAnd this particular episode we're just\ngoing to learn like the file types and\n\n43\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.170\nwhat is that resolution, PPI, because\nthese are things that, what I love to talk\n\n44\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.160\nabout and two, it’s just kind of that\nbase knowledge to have in the background.\n\n45\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.650\nWhile you're not necessarily going\nto become a graphic artist or\n\n46\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.530\na graphic designer from just this one\nepisode and in word as a product,\n\n47\n00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.700\nits a word processing program,\n\n48\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.000\nit's not a graphics manipulation\ntype product, its not Photoshop.\n\n49\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.930\nSo, it can't do all those things that\nthose other products can do, but\n\n50\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.420\nit actually can do a lot of it.\n\n51\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.260\nBut having,\n\n52\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.160\nat least, a base knowledge of what's\nthe difference between a JPEG and a GIF?\n\n53\n00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.810\nThat can really help you just\nfind those little things,\n\n54\n00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.880\nis like,\nthat's why that thing is doing that.\n\n55\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.730\nWhy do I have a white background?\n\n56\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.870\nOkay, now that always\nleads to the question of,\n\n57\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.880\nwell then how can I change it?\n\n58\n00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.200\nWell, there are some things\nthat we can do in Word, but\n\n59\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.110\nit would require you going on to\na different type of product that would be\n\n60\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.240\nable to do those types of things,\nlike Photoshop or even Paint.\n\n61\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.540\n&gt;&gt; Paint?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm actually going to\n\n62\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.060\nshow you a little thing to do-\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n63\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.760\n&gt;&gt; in Paint today.\n\n64\n00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.091\nGood old Paint in the operating system.\n\n65\n00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:44.706\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n66\n00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.838\nI have a PowerPoint presentation\nthat I have ready on my computer, so\n\n67\n00:02:47.838 --> 00:02:50.070\nlet's go ahead and get into this.\n\n68\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.005\nNow I don't really necessarily\nneed to run the slide show,\n\n69\n00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.820\nbecause I've got most of\nthe information on here.\n\n70\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.150\nAnd so I took this actually\nfrom my PowerPoint show,\n\n71\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.258\nmodified it a little bit to just\nkind of cover all the basics.\n\n72\n00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:07.290\nSo file yypes, we talk about file, I love\nto talk about file types but we kind of,\n\n73\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.620\nI don't want to say take it for granted\nbut its just like, there is a picture,\n\n74\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.850\ntake a picture with my camera or phone and\nthen I have it and then I send it to\n\n75\n00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.960\npeople, and I share it and I get pictures,\nand you think a picture's a picture.\n\n76\n00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.660\nKind of, but we've always been\ntalking about languages right?\n\n77\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.810\nWord talks in Word, Excel talks in Excel,\nfile types and whether it's ,docx or .doc.\n\n78\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.240\nWhat does that mean?\n\n79\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.440\nImages are the same way,\n\n80\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.800\nand when you're talking about pictures,\nyou're talking about raster information.\n\n81\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.550\nAll of photographs are made up of pixels.\n\n82\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So pixels that are in some sort of\n\n83\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.280\ngrid formation that goes ahead and\nmakes all of the colors and\n\n84\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.202\nthe things that we see on our screen.\n\n85\n00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:54.100\nWell of the different types that we have,\nJPEG\n\n86\n00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.660\nprobably would be the most common file\ntype that most people are familiar with,\n\n87\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.800\nbecause it's the most common for\njust regular photographs.\n\n88\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.150\nBecause it's that pixel\ninformation that's in there and\n\n89\n00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.030\nit has a lot of color support in\nthat particular file format and\n\n90\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.800\nthe other thing that I don't have on this\nslide, is that it uses compression to\n\n91\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.970\nstore the file, so it doesn't take\nas much room on our computer.\n\n92\n00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.730\nThat's the other thing we will talk\nabout as long with file types talk about\n\n93\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.220\nresolution and overall document\ndimensions or image dimensions.\n\n94\n00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.240\nThat makes a huge deal.\n\n95\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.300\nSo, our photos, and our pictures that we\ntake with our cameras, normally takes them\n\n96\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.750\nat a higher resolution, to be able to\ntransport it, and do whatever you want.\n\n97\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.370\nBut, I'm starting to get\na little bit ahead of myself.\n\n98\n00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.160\nBut, it's because I'm starting\nto blend them together.\n\n99\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.010\nSo, let's just stick with file types.\n\n100\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.990\nBut, JPEGs, that's the one you're going\nto be probably, most familiar with.\n\n101\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.650\nDo you know what jpg stands for, Ronnie?\n\n102\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.240\n&gt;&gt; I used to know, but\nI cannot tell you right now [LAUGH].\n\n103\n00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.150\n&gt;&gt; It is the joint\nphotographic experts group.\n\n104\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.870\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n105\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.300\n&gt;&gt; And while we see JPG, you actually\nhave the four letter extension as well,\n\n106\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.750\nwhich is JPEG, and it was just\na group of people that went ahead and\n\n107\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.650\ncreated this particular file format,\naround 1987 is what I saw on\n\n108\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.870\nWikipedia there, and it was a group that\nwent, and it talks about ISO standards.\n\n109\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.960\nThings that you know about\nin like the tech world and\n\n110\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.530\nstuff, so\nthat's where it kind of came around.\n\n111\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.510\nAnd then there is another file\nformat called the gif file format.\n\n112\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.150\nDo you know what that stands for?\n\n113\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.270\n&gt;&gt; Graphics image format?\n\n114\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much, yeah, yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.220\nGraphics image format.\n\n116\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.040\nSo that's the one that we had and\nit was created by a man named\n\n117\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.020\nSteve Willhite back in 1987,\nand also under CompuServe,\n\n118\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.230\nso just to let you know\na little bit of history.\n\n119\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.090\nAnd the GIF file format is where\nit only has so much color support.\n\n120\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.480\nIt's a small area, I believe it has 256\namount of colors that can be stored\n\n121\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.330\nin a .gif, versus I think 65,536 of .jpg\nand I actually think it's a lot more.\n\n122\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:08.760\nI think that's the next binary increment,\ntwo to the power of sixteen or whatever.\n\n123\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.390\nBut .gifs have a smaller color support,\nbut\n\n124\n00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.610\nit also supports transparency,\nas you can see, jpgs don't.\n\n125\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.700\nThis is one that was\nalways that ha moment for\n\n126\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.090\npeople, like like\nthe white box that you get.\n\n127\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.590\nAnd actually here I have it on\nthe next slide, this, where\n\n128\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.280\nsometimes you might get a photograph,\nor what you think is a photograph.\n\n129\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.468\nWell I guess, because it is, it's pixels.\n\n130\n00:06:30.468 --> 00:06:33.810\nIn a .gif,\nyou don't see anything around it,\n\n131\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.760\nit's got transparency, as opposed\nto a .jpg that gets the white box,\n\n132\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.630\nand that's what, yeah, I know what that\nwhite box thing is because that particular\n\n133\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.010\nfile format can't support transparency,\nbut GIF can.\n\n134\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.140\nSo that's was where I was like that's\nthe nice kind of differences between it.\n\n135\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.000\nNow, [LAUGH] just for\nanother little history lesson.\n\n136\n00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.780\nI pronounce it GIF.\n\n137\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.540\nDo you pronounce it GIF?\n\n138\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.800\n&gt;&gt; Probably, I pronounce it GIF as well.\n\n139\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.740\nWell, it's funny when the creator of this\nfile format was awarded the Webby and\n\n140\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.090\nI can't remember what year it was.\n\n141\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.970\nAnd he went up to accept the award\nof a Lifetime Achievement Award and\n\n142\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.930\nhe put in a tiny, in a GIF-\n&gt;&gt; JIF.\n\n143\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's not pronounced gif,\n\n144\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.210\nit's jif, like with a j.\n\n145\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.700\nAnd it was something in\nreferences to peanut butter,\n\n146\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.402\nlike choosy moms choose Jif like\nchoosy computer people choose JIFs.\n\n147\n00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:29.044\n&gt;&gt; JIFs.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n148\n00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:31.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that's from Wikipedia.\n\n149\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.340\nThat's where I read it, but\nI had always heard about it.\n\n150\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.055\nAnd it was this big\ncontroversy on the Internet.\n\n151\n00:07:38.055 --> 00:07:39.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which one is it?\n\n152\n00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.920\nAnd so the creator of the file\nformat said, no, it's this.\n\n153\n00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.300\nSo I thought that was fun.\n\n154\n00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.700\nSome other file formats that came along.\n\n155\n00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.270\nWe have the ping or the png.\n\n156\n00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.545\nThat's portable network graphic.\n\n157\n00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:53.556\nMm-hm.\n\n158\n00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.181\nNow this is the one where it's kind\nof like the best of both worlds.\n\n159\n00:07:57.181 --> 00:08:00.441\nIt acts like a jpeg with that\nlarge color support, but\n\n160\n00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:04.652\nit also acts like a GIF where it goes\nahead and has that transparency.\n\n161\n00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:09.440\nAnd even more than the GIF,\nit supports multi-level transparency.\n\n162\n00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.010\nAnd has an 8-bit transparency\nrather than a 1-bit transparency.\n\n163\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.459\nIt's like what is what?\n\n164\n00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:15.650\nWell, you're talking about bits now.\n\n165\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.180\n1-bit transparency,\nit's either transparent or it's not.\n\n166\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.892\nThere's no variance in between.\n\n167\n00:08:20.892 --> 00:08:25.250\nWith an 8-bit transparency you could\nhave varying levels of transparency.\n\n168\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.010\nBack on this you see\nthat this PNG right here,\n\n169\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.620\nit has a drop shadow and transparency.\n\n170\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.020\nYou couldn't have that with a GIF.\n\n171\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.681\nIt's either on or off.\n\n172\n00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.329\nSo it's either white or\nback or really it's on or off.\n\n173\n00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:38.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.260\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's what happened with the PNG file or\n\n175\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.821\nthe PNG is I just kind of took that out.\n\n176\n00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:47.786\nThat actually was created,\nmy Wikipedia said,\n\n177\n00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:52.330\nit's not my, the Wikipedia,\nsaid around 1996 and\n\n178\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.370\nit lists multiple authors as\nthe creators of the file format.\n\n179\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.300\nSo it wasn't just one particular person or\none company that did it.\n\n180\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.696\nAnd that's the one you see a lot when\nyou're working with Office products,\n\n181\n00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:08.784\nif you go to,\nwhen we insert images of online images,\n\n182\n00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:11.269\na lot of them are in\nthat .png file format.\n\n183\n00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:13.976\nSo you're seeing that\na little bit more often,\n\n184\n00:09:13.976 --> 00:09:17.836\nat least I have through all these\nyears of working with computers and\n\n185\n00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:21.376\nworking in computer graphics,\nthe .png has come a long way.\n\n186\n00:09:21.376 --> 00:09:23.180\nThen you have the .tiff file format.\n\n187\n00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.320\nWell, that is tagged image file format.\n\n188\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.564\nAnd when you type it in\nto your Google search,\n\n189\n00:09:28.564 --> 00:09:31.232\nit also is\nthe Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n190\n00:09:31.232 --> 00:09:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n191\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.257\nNow this file format was created in around\n\n192\n00:09:38.257 --> 00:09:43.840\n1986 by the company called Aldus,\nwhich is actually now Adobe.\n\n193\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.150\nAdobe bought that company.\n\n194\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.360\nSo, and\nit is very much embedded into print type,\n\n195\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.440\nlike printing on a piece of paper.\n\n196\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.450\nBecause it has no compression in a tiff,\nand\n\n197\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.400\nactually the type of compression that it\nwould have if it has it is an LZW which is\n\n198\n00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.700\na lossless compression as opposed\nto a lossy compression in the JPEG.\n\n199\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.601\nIf it says that's a little too high,\njust go, sounds great.\n\n200\n00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:07.572\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:10:07.572 --> 00:10:09.420\n&gt;&gt; But it's the way that where your\n\n202\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.930\nimages will print properly and\nit doesn't lose any information.\n\n203\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.380\nIt's also a way to try to get out,\n\n204\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:20.570\nI was reading about to try to make all\nthe scanners and all those print devices\n\n205\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.380\ntalking that same file format in\nthe sense to go ahead and get it all.\n\n206\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.960\nSo, tag image file format is where\nyou get that particular file format.\n\n207\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.630\nSo it comes from print.\n\n208\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.931\nLike I said right in here, and the one\nbehind my head, that's a .TIFF too.\n\n209\n00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:39.656\nYou can see that these are the different\ntypes of file formats that you might\n\n210\n00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:43.130\nencounter from time to time\nwhen working with images.\n\n211\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.720\nAll right, image size is another\none I could talk forever about, but\n\n212\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.100\nkeeping it short right in here,\nresolution.\n\n213\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.330\nNow, Ronnie, I know we've had this\ndiscussion before, and you know about.\n\n214\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.490\nBut when you hear the word resolution,\nin general terms,\n\n215\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.330\nwhat do you normally\njust equate that with?\n\n216\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.420\n&gt;&gt; I equate that with the viewable area.\n\n217\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what about qualitied?\n\n218\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.860\nIs that another word that\nmaybe comes into mind?\n\n219\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.930\n&gt;&gt; It does, the higher the resolution,\nthe better quality.\n\n220\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially with nowadays,\nall of our HDTVs and\n\n221\n00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:14.462\nif you have a higher resolution,\n\n222\n00:11:14.462 --> 00:11:19.653\nthat's what I always equate it to cuz they\nreally talk about this in televisions.\n\n223\n00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:23.110\nAnd when you're buying those types\nof devices and everything is bigger.\n\n224\n00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.515\nSo yes, the bigger the better.\n\n225\n00:11:24.515 --> 00:11:30.152\nAnd that is normally true if we're\ntalking about those particular devices or\n\n226\n00:11:30.152 --> 00:11:32.140\nhigher quality.\n\n227\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.550\nBut when we're talking about images,\n\n228\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.870\nspecifically, resolution is not\nalways the quality and clarity.\n\n229\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.790\nIt technically means pixels per inch.\n\n230\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:46.972\nHow many pixels per inch are in a file?\n\n231\n00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:49.662\nThe other thing to think about,\nthough, if we talk about inches,\n\n232\n00:11:49.662 --> 00:11:51.236\nwe're usually talking about paper.\n\n233\n00:11:51.236 --> 00:11:53.835\n&gt;&gt; Paper.\n&gt;&gt; We're not talking about screens\n\n234\n00:11:53.835 --> 00:11:54.890\nnecessarily.\n\n235\n00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.532\nSo that's where you get this\nwhole differentiation of how\n\n236\n00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:01.528\nmuch resolution I need.\n\n237\n00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:04.151\nAnd, have you ever encountered\nsomething like this over here on\n\n238\n00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.410\nthe right-hand side?\n\n239\n00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.740\nWhere you've taken a picture, you've\nmade it bigger and it does this, Ronnie?\n\n240\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.089\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do that on purpose\nwith my images on Facebook.\n\n241\n00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:16.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, this is where you\nhad a file that a lot of times people\n\n242\n00:12:16.463 --> 00:12:20.439\nthink is a lower resolution,\nwhich is, it could be true.\n\n243\n00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.768\nBut let me kind of throw\na wrench in there.\n\n244\n00:12:22.768 --> 00:12:25.200\nIt's not always about resolution, okay.\n\n245\n00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.620\nIt's really more about\nthe pixel dimensions.\n\n246\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.450\nAnd that's why I have\nresolution pixel dimensions.\n\n247\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.861\nWhile they work together,\nbecause how many,\n\n248\n00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:37.888\nif I have a file that is\n600 pixels by 400 pixels.\n\n249\n00:12:37.888 --> 00:12:42.930\nBecause photographs are in pixels,\nthat's what they live in.\n\n250\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:50.776\nBut the resolution, I could have a 600 by\n400 image that is a 300 ppi or a 72 ppi.\n\n251\n00:12:50.776 --> 00:12:54.028\nBut they're still 600 by 400 pixels.\n\n252\n00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:57.076\nThe amount of pixels hasn't changed.\n\n253\n00:12:57.076 --> 00:13:00.964\nIt really just depends on what\ndevice that I'm going to be making\n\n254\n00:13:00.964 --> 00:13:02.680\nthat go to if you wanna say.\n\n255\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.022\nWhere is it's final space?\n\n256\n00:13:05.022 --> 00:13:07.940\nAnd this is something like in\nprint that's really important.\n\n257\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.471\nAnd when I talk about print in this way,\nI'm talking about commercial printing,\n\n258\n00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:14.900\nlike you're sending this off to a print\nprovider that's gonna be printing this\n\n259\n00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.735\ninformation out.\n\n260\n00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:20.930\nSo they usually tell you,\nnot always, but 300ppi.\n\n261\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.920\nSo that's kind of the industry\nstandard for commercial printing.\n\n262\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.050\nAll of your graphics need to be\nin that particular resolution.\n\n263\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:34.835\nSo that way, and if you think about it, if\nthere's more pixels in a square inch, for\n\n264\n00:13:34.835 --> 00:13:40.395\nyou to be able to have a larger image on a\npiece of paper to be 5 inches by 4 inches.\n\n265\n00:13:40.395 --> 00:13:45.936\nYou're gonna need to have a lot more total\npixels to be able to get it to that size.\n\n266\n00:13:45.936 --> 00:13:49.258\nAnd so that's where all of\nyour cameras and phones,\n\n267\n00:13:49.258 --> 00:13:52.460\nit takes it at a much\nhigher pixel dimension.\n\n268\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.090\nSo that way,\nwhen you make the resolution bigger,\n\n269\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.600\nthen the overall document size in its\nprinted format would get smaller.\n\n270\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.710\nThe total number of pixels stay the same,\n\n271\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.720\nit's just that everything\njust kind of squashes down.\n\n272\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.820\nSo that's where you get the whole\nidea of having resolution.\n\n273\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.920\nAnd this is where somebody, or\nif you've got a picture and\n\n274\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.760\nyou try to make it bigger, and\nyou're like, that didn't work.\n\n275\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.693\nAnd a lot of people would ask like hey,\ndo you have a higher resolution graphic?\n\n276\n00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:21.758\nIt also really is do you have\na file that has more pixels?\n\n277\n00:14:21.758 --> 00:14:22.319\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n278\n00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:23.480\n&gt;&gt; Has more pixels.\n\n279\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.560\nAnd the idea with our computers,\n\n280\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.100\nnot all the programs are good\nat making more pixels.\n\n281\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.953\nSo it just kinda guesses, and so\n\n282\n00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:34.946\nthat's why sometimes you will have\nthese photographs that you get.\n\n283\n00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:37.610\nYou don't know what the size is, but\nyou're like, okay, I'll throw it in.\n\n284\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.313\nYou make it bigger and\nit just starts to not look so good.\n\n285\n00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:41.960\nCuz it just didn't have\nenough to start with.\n\n286\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.109\nSo it's better to go smaller and\nremove information than it is to try to\n\n287\n00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:52.279\nbe smaller and go bigger and\ncreate information that doesn't exist.\n\n288\n00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:57.871\nSo that's just image size 101-\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n289\n00:14:57.871 --> 00:15:02.078\n&gt;&gt; That all graphic designers and anybody\nthat works in computer graphics, it's like\n\n290\n00:15:02.078 --> 00:15:06.000\nthe be all and end all that you have to\nknow about when you start working with it.\n\n291\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.480\nNow, you're in Word, right,\nso you're not going to be\n\n292\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.140\nthat deep into graphic design, but\nagain just having that base knowledge.\n\n293\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.220\nAnd when we get into things\nthat your computer can do,\n\n294\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.960\nor actually I should say Word can do,\nwhen it talks about compressing images.\n\n295\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.050\nThese numbers are gonna come up again,\nand so\n\n296\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.110\nnow you're like,\nI understand what that means.\n\n297\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:30.270\nCuz think about it, if I have\na Word file that has 50 images that\n\n298\n00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.570\nare 5,000 pixels wide or whatever.\n\n299\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.768\nAnd then that's gonna make the overall\ndocument size a lot bigger.\n\n300\n00:15:36.768 --> 00:15:39.700\nSo it's really all about usable space.\n\n301\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.140\nAnd I don't really want a 50-meg Word file\n\n302\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:48.230\nnecessarily with all of those images if I\ncan start controlling some of that size.\n\n303\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.381\nSo, throwing that in.\n\n304\n00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:54.336\nNow, back here in our PowerPoint\npresentation, just a few things that we'll\n\n305\n00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:58.539\nbe getting into are what our computer\nprograms can do such as Word or\n\n306\n00:15:58.539 --> 00:16:00.432\nreally Office, I would say.\n\n307\n00:16:00.432 --> 00:16:06.433\nPowerPoint, Excel Where they can\ndo things like put on styles.\n\n308\n00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:09.400\nI can make my pictures\nlook really cute in here.\n\n309\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.706\nI can do some color corrections.\n\n310\n00:16:10.706 --> 00:16:13.380\nI can do transparency and\nartistic effects.\n\n311\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.000\nThere's also the wonderful format\npicture task pane that we can do\n\n312\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000\na few more things.\n\n313\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.970\nAnd just a couple more examples\nwe'll be getting into cropping.\n\n314\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.590\nRemoving the background,\n\n315\n00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.380\nwhich can be good and-\n&gt;&gt; Challenging.\n\n316\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really cool.\n\n317\n00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.470\nIt doesn't always work perfectly,\nbut we'll see that.\n\n318\n00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.780\nAnd then, change picture,\nreset picture and compress picture.\n\n319\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.200\nThese are all the things\nthat you're gonna be seeing\n\n320\n00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.858\non the picture format contextual tab,\nwhen we put images into Word.\n\n321\n00:16:37.858 --> 00:16:42.170\nAnd so, that will be in the next episode,\nif you're watching in succession.\n\n322\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.440\nWhere we'll format our images.\n\n323\n00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.510\nNow, Pictures.\n\n324\n00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.160\nKinda going on that resolution\nof what to identify.\n\n325\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.700\nWhen I look at these photographs in my\nfile explorer, I just opened up my folder.\n\n326\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.030\nAnd I go to my large icons, or\nmaybe like extra large, so you, guys,\n\n327\n00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.260\ncan see it a little bit better.\n\n328\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.790\nLike that photograph, this one,\nand then, this one, now\n\n329\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.220\nthat actually looks a little bit smaller,\nbut those look about the same, don't they?\n\n330\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.280\nI mean in the file explorer, let's say.\n\n331\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.523\nBut they're not,\nthey're way different in their file size.\n\n332\n00:17:13.523 --> 00:17:18.480\nSo, when you're in your file explorer,\nI don't always like to go to the details.\n\n333\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.600\nAnd this is where you can start\nseeing things like, well,\n\n334\n00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.310\nthere's my GIF, there's my JPEG,\nthere's my TIFF, and there's my PNG.\n\n335\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.800\nThese are the different types.\n\n336\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.950\nAnd other thing that I like to\ndo when I'm in a details view,\n\n337\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.950\nis always to turn on the file extensions.\n\n338\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.622\nYes, I can see the type column, but\n\n339\n00:17:34.622 --> 00:17:39.170\nI like to see the file\nextension in my files.\n\n340\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.024\nI wanna know which one is this,\nbecause I have flower, flower, flower,\n\n341\n00:17:43.024 --> 00:17:43.904\nflower shadow.\n\n342\n00:17:43.904 --> 00:17:46.469\nThree photographs that are names the same,\nbut they're not the same,\n\n343\n00:17:46.469 --> 00:17:48.690\nbecause they're in different file formats.\n\n344\n00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.640\nAnd that was like if I go back to those\nicons, they all kind of look the same,\n\n345\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.450\nbut they really aren't.\n\n346\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.240\nAnd a GIF, because that's just windows\ntrying to show you transparency.\n\n347\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.470\nKind of back over the details.\n\n348\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.980\nYou can see the size,\n\n349\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.070\nthat's like the amount of the information\nthat it is holding, and so, you could\n\n350\n00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.570\nsee that this particular file right here,\nthat's about what I got two mega bytes?\n\n351\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:17.100\nCuz we have two, yeah, 2,000 kilobytes,\nthe other thing that I like to do,\n\n352\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.580\nsince I need to know what those dimensions\nare, is throwing in another column, and\n\n353\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.040\nthere's this button right here\nwhere it says, add columns.\n\n354\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.060\nYou could also right click up\nin any of the column's headings\n\n355\n00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.040\nto get to the dimensions.\n\n356\n00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.111\nI want to see, cuz remember I said,\nthe pixel dimensions, those are important.\n\n357\n00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:38.710\nSo, I can tell right here with our bish,\nthat's what we name him.\n\n358\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.872\nWell, his name is Bishop, but\nwe call him Bish-Bish a lot.\n\n359\n00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:45.608\nSo, Bishop, I have it as 480 by 640,\n\n360\n00:18:45.608 --> 00:18:49.200\n240 by 320, 60 by 80.\n\n361\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.930\nThat was why you get this picture.\n\n362\n00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.540\nHere's this cute little picture I put\ninto a document trying to make it bigger.\n\n363\n00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.780\nIt's, that's not gonna work.\n\n364\n00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.900\nBut if I had a photograph like this one.\n\n365\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.177\nLook at that,\n3,000 pixels by 4,000 pixels.\n\n366\n00:19:02.177 --> 00:19:04.460\nThat's a lot of room to work with.\n\n367\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.910\nSo, if I needed to have a nice high\nquality graphic, as Gloria said,\n\n368\n00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.560\ngo on the cover of my word document.\n\n369\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.620\nLike the first page,\nlike a big old picture of Fuego.\n\n370\n00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.130\nIt'd be good to go ahead and\nhave a photograph in this size.\n\n371\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.490\nIf this is the file size that I was sent.\n\n372\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.766\nLike somebody gave me this file, and\nthis is what I need to put on the cover,\n\n373\n00:19:22.766 --> 00:19:23.339\nreally big.\n\n374\n00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:26.320\nI'm going to make it really big and\nit's not going to look good.\n\n375\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.140\nSo, making sure you have that\nfoundational understanding of,\n\n376\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.290\npixel dimensions, file types.\n\n377\n00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.119\nWhether it has transparency,\nor not transparency.\n\n378\n00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:37.630\nWhat am I working with?\n\n379\n00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.904\nAnd can I do what I want\nto do with these graphics?\n\n380\n00:19:41.904 --> 00:19:46.540\nNow, a lot of times you get big pictures,\nand that starts taking a lot of space up.\n\n381\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.760\nSo, let me come back over to our icons,\njust so, I can see what they look like.\n\n382\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.190\nSo, I have this picture right\nhere of Fuego in a tree.\n\n383\n00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.840\nI'm just going to open it.\n\n384\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.650\nIt's going to open up in a photo,\nso you can see it.\n\n385\n00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.466\nHe's just such a regal-looking\nmountain lion, isn't he?, [LAUGH].\n\n386\n00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n387\n00:20:01.487 --> 00:20:06.086\n&gt;&gt; So, this is a picture, but it's really,\nreally big, and if I hover over it,\n\n388\n00:20:06.086 --> 00:20:10.070\nthat's that 2000, by 3000,\nand more types of stuff.\n\n389\n00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.753\nWell, I wanna make this smaller,\n\n390\n00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.633\nbecause it's just kind of,-\n&gt;&gt; Big.\n\n391\n00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:14.815\n&gt;&gt; It's just too big.\n\n392\n00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:19.354\nReally easy way to do this, is if you,\nI like to right-click on this, and\n\n393\n00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:20.609\nopen it with Paint.\n\n394\n00:20:20.609 --> 00:20:24.399\nNow, you can always go to Paint,\nopen the file, because a very easy way,\n\n395\n00:20:24.399 --> 00:20:29.520\nit's like whoa, I don't even know what's\ngoing on here, because it's so big.\n\n396\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.208\nYou can use the resize button\nto make files smaller.\n\n397\n00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:38.440\nBecause it might be easier to work\nwith files that are 1200 pixels,\n\n398\n00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.330\nor maybe 800 pixels wide.\n\n399\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.290\nAnd that way,\nyou have a big resolution one, and, well,\n\n400\n00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.850\nbig pixel dimension ones, and one that is\nsmaller, because you don't want to have so\n\n401\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.710\nmuch room being taken\nup by that file size.\n\n402\n00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:58.320\nWithin your Word document, or Excel,\nor PowerPoint, and so on and so forth.\n\n403\n00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.252\nSo, on the Home you can go to Resize,\nand I usually just do percentages,\n\n404\n00:21:02.252 --> 00:21:03.290\ncuz it's easier.\n\n405\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.290\nLet's make that 25%, and notice it does\nboth, cuz it keeps the aspect ratio.\n\n406\n00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:12.911\nYou click OK, and then,\ndown here on the status bar, now,\n\n407\n00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:15.830\nthat's 600 by 800-ish pixels.\n\n408\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.658\nThat's a lot easier to work with,\n\n409\n00:21:17.658 --> 00:21:22.420\nthat's gonna make it a lot smaller when\nI start working with this photograph.\n\n410\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.560\nNow, this is where that File Save and\nFile Save As is gonna be really important.\n\n411\n00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.530\nI always say, keep a copy of the big one.\n\n412\n00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.380\nThat one that you can always go\nback to and do things off of it.\n\n413\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.420\nSo, I would do a File Save As, also has\nthose different file formats that we now\n\n414\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.360\nknow a little bit more about,\nwhich should make some good stuff.\n\n415\n00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.870\nPaint actually does a lot of other things,\nand you can try to like remove\n\n416\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.410\nthe background, and then, saving it in one\nof these file formats would be important\n\n417\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.590\nto understand, don't save it as a JPEG,\ncuz it's gonna make a white background.\n\n418\n00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.260\nIt's just the way it is.\n\n419\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.155\nI will save this is a JPEG and\nI'll name this Fuego.\n\n420\n00:21:58.155 --> 00:22:03.018\nLet's go ahead and\nuse the right letters Fuego smaller.\n\n421\n00:22:03.018 --> 00:22:08.492\nAnd now, I have a Fuego smaller coming\nin to here, if I go onto this details.\n\n422\n00:22:08.492 --> 00:22:14.490\nSo, Fuego smaller way different file\nsize that the one that we started with.\n\n423\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.620\nSo, very easy to do.\n\n424\n00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:21.240\nIn Paint to just resize those larger\ngraphics to make it a little easier.\n\n425\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.580\nAll right, so now, that we have a very\nbasic understanding of file types and\n\n426\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.330\nimage size, let's go ahead and\nhow do I put this into Word?\n\n427\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.690\nHow do I get an image in my Word document?\n\n428\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.916\nLet's start up Word.\n\n429\n00:22:34.916 --> 00:22:38.744\nWe're just going to start with a blank\ndocument, because this is the last part of\n\n430\n00:22:38.744 --> 00:22:42.741\nthis episode that let's get the pictures\nin there, and then, in the next episode,\n\n431\n00:22:42.741 --> 00:22:46.284\nwe'll talk about what we can do with it,\nhow we can make it look different,\n\n432\n00:22:46.284 --> 00:22:48.490\nhow we can move it around\nwithin my document.\n\n433\n00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.280\nSo, we'll insert, then we'll format next.\n\n434\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.714\nBasic document is fine.\n\n435\n00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:55.830\nAnd you have my show high characters.\n\n436\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.860\nCuz one thing to consider, just right now.\n\n437\n00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.416\nWe'll explore this more.\n\n438\n00:22:59.416 --> 00:23:03.853\nAn image is just like any type of\ncontent that you put into Word,\n\n439\n00:23:03.853 --> 00:23:06.635\nwhich is normally [LAUGH] well, words.\n\n440\n00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:11.700\n&gt;&gt; It's like characters, they're in\nparagraphs, so putting images in\n\n441\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.840\nyour paragraphs, and treating the as\nparagraphs is going to be very important.\n\n442\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.979\nI want an image between this paragraph and\nthis paragraph,\n\n443\n00:23:18.979 --> 00:23:21.677\nput it enter,\nmake another paragraph, and then,\n\n444\n00:23:21.677 --> 00:23:25.786\nput that picture in, and then, we can\nhave some different options in there.\n\n445\n00:23:25.786 --> 00:23:28.700\nDoesn't mean you always have to,\nbut I'll explore that.\n\n446\n00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.770\nAnyways, throwing that in,\npicture, cursor, go to insert,\n\n447\n00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:37.070\nand you have the option of doing\na picture that’s on your computer, so\n\n448\n00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.530\nfrom a file that you have.\n\n449\n00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:40.770\nOnline pictures,\n\n450\n00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.360\nthis is a cool one of where,\nthis used to be like what insert clip art.\n\n451\n00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day, and then,\n\n452\n00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.800\nit went out online, and\nstarted finding all kinds of photographs.\n\n453\n00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.697\nWell, now they just say find it online.\n\n454\n00:23:50.697 --> 00:23:53.891\nAnd it brings up all sorts\nof image searches from Bing.\n\n455\n00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:57.827\nAnd then, it does talk about\ncreative common licenses, so\n\n456\n00:23:57.827 --> 00:24:02.642\nbeing a little aware of do you have\nthe authority to use that photograph.\n\n457\n00:24:02.642 --> 00:24:04.972\nThat's something you should\njust be somewhat aware of.\n\n458\n00:24:04.972 --> 00:24:08.850\nThey have a lot of documentation on there\nfor you to go ahead and explore that.\n\n459\n00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:13.240\nAnd then the other one I'm going to cover\nis screenshot, because I love this one.\n\n460\n00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.580\nI do a lot of files with I'm doing\nstep by step instructions and\n\n461\n00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.710\nsaying click on this button.\n\n462\n00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.740\nSo taking a screenshot right from\nwithin your Office products,\n\n463\n00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.959\nit's one of my favorite features.\n\n464\n00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.570\nWe'll start from insert pictures, now\nthat we know what type of fields we have.\n\n465\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.560\nI'm gonna come over here to my\npictures folder that's on my desktop.\n\n466\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.262\nAnd I will pick,\nlet's go with little bish and\n\n467\n00:24:38.262 --> 00:24:43.822\nwe'll take Mr. Bishop,\nsay insert, photo goes in.\n\n468\n00:24:43.822 --> 00:24:45.450\nAnd there it now.\n\n469\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.660\nRonnie, actually my\ncomputer updated yesterday.\n\n470\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.360\nI think we saw it, like it's like hey,\nI need updates, right?\n\n471\n00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.970\nWell, it went ahead and\nupdated Office, too.\n\n472\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.940\nAnd one of the new Office things that they\nhad, I don't know if you noticed it right\n\n473\n00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.250\nacross the bottom is that it\nwas showing alternate text.\n\n474\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.670\nAnd that's just a new feature.\n\n475\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.312\nThat's the first one I've seen so far.\n\n476\n00:25:04.312 --> 00:25:06.721\n[LAUGH] I know there's probably\nsome more hidden in here, too.\n\n477\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.750\nVery quickly what alternate text is for\naccessibility for\n\n478\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.760\npeople that are non-sighted\nwhere you can't see the graphic.\n\n479\n00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.610\nBut if you have things like reading\nyour screen, like screen readers,\n\n480\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:26.220\nit will read whatever alternate text\nyou have added to that image to say.\n\n481\n00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.730\nCute orange and white cat with\nreindeer antlers at Christmas time.\n\n482\n00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.590\nThat would give an accurate description\nof what this file looks like.\n\n483\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.910\nSo just to know, I'll show you where\nyou can add alternate text later.\n\n484\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.100\nAnd that's how I go ahead and\nput in my picture.\n\n485\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.320\nClicking my cursor off to\nthe right of it I'm gonna hit\n\n486\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.840\nEnter just to make another paragraph.\n\n487\n00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.810\nAnother way I could insert\npicture would be online images.\n\n488\n00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.480\nWhat am I gonna search for?\n\n489\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.150\nGuess what, Ronnie?\n\n490\n00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:55.680\n&gt;&gt; Bunnies.\n\n491\n00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.816\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna search for a bunny.\n\n492\n00:25:56.816 --> 00:26:00.810\n[LAUGH] And then I have all sorts\nof adorable little bunnies.\n\n493\n00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.149\nAnd we can see I have our Creative Commons\nlicense that is showing only, and\n\n494\n00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:05.590\nthat's a nice thing to do.\n\n495\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.765\nI will click the picture that I want.\n\n496\n00:26:07.765 --> 00:26:09.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I insert it.\n\n497\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.315\nCuz, I mean, how can you,\nthat's adorable, right?\n\n498\n00:26:13.315 --> 00:26:15.120\n[LAUGH] Look, I'm just too tired.\n\n499\n00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.890\nOkay, so there's our bunny.\n\n500\n00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.240\nAnd, I'm already starting to\ndo things like resize it.\n\n501\n00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.020\nI went to the corner and resized it.\n\n502\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.560\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n503\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.540\nSorry, I'm jumping ahead.\n\n504\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.750\nSo the other way that I can get\nmy image in there screenshots.\n\n505\n00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.210\nNow I can do a screenshot if I drop\nthis down actually if I hover over it.\n\n506\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.303\nIt should,\nI thought it would actually give me\n\n507\n00:26:34.303 --> 00:26:36.410\ndifferent,\n&gt;&gt; Options.\n\n508\n00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Options and it usually shows you\nthe open Windows that you have like\n\n509\n00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.350\na different application and\nI have PowerPoint.\n\n510\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:47.595\nLets go ahead and like throw,\nwhat is this, Inter X World?\n\n511\n00:26:47.595 --> 00:26:48.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Explorer Edge.\n\n512\n00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's what it is.\n\n513\n00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:54.290\nAll right, I'm just going to type in\nbird for it to bring something up here.\n\n514\n00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:59.410\nSo I should be able to come back to\nWord and, wait, do I just need to hover?\n\n515\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.960\nHm, all right.\n\n516\n00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.800\nWell, normally I will say and\nmaybe I'm having a little bit of issues.\n\n517\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.850\nMaybe it's the virtual machine.\n\n518\n00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:10.740\nNormally, it will actually show you\nthe different windows that you have opened\n\n519\n00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.610\non your computer.\n\n520\n00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.200\nThat's okay.\n\n521\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.670\nFor now,\nwe're gonna go with Screen Clipping.\n\n522\n00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:20.968\nBecause that way you can say, I wanna get\nthis particular part of the document or\n\n523\n00:27:20.968 --> 00:27:24.190\nwhat's up on your screen and added in.\n\n524\n00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.540\nLet's just go ahead and\ndo it and I'll show you.\n\n525\n00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.840\nNotice what was the last thing that I did?\n\n526\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.310\nI went to the, wow,\nwhy am I having such a problem with edge?\n\n527\n00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.930\nMy browser that's what this thing is.\n\n528\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.290\nThis is a browser I'm\ngoing to the Internet.\n\n529\n00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.020\nAnd I had that and that was the last\nthing I had opened or on top\n\n530\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.570\nif you wanna say as my window, my active\nwindow before I brought Word back up.\n\n531\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:51.363\nSo if I was trying to get a screen\nclipping out of PowerPoint click on\n\n532\n00:27:51.363 --> 00:27:54.094\nPowerPoint, get that\nopen then bring up Word.\n\n533\n00:27:54.094 --> 00:27:58.640\nSo that way it's like\nthe next thing behind Word.\n\n534\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.770\nSo that is something\nthat you need to know.\n\n535\n00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.600\nAnd this is like,\nI don't want this, right?\n\n536\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.830\nHit the Escape key.\n\n537\n00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:08.080\nIf you hit the Escape key, then it's not\ngoing to be taking a screen clipping.\n\n538\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.200\nI come back into Word,\nand then, there we go.\n\n539\n00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.840\nAnd so nothing has happened right now.\n\n540\n00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.495\nI didn't actually get anything.\n\n541\n00:28:15.495 --> 00:28:21.370\nCould maybe I need a PowerPoint up before\nI wanted to get the screen clipping.\n\n542\n00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.330\nLet's go back over to Word, cursor where I\nwanna put the picture, go to Screenshot.\n\n543\n00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.660\nSee there it is.\n\n544\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.930\nAll right,\nnow that was like I was why is it not,\n\n545\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.330\nit's supposed to happen every time.\n\n546\n00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.850\nI think I'm having some display or\nsome graphics\n\n547\n00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.000\nissue within the virtual machine\nthat I'm teaching this product from.\n\n548\n00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000\nDon't worry about it, its okay.\n\n549\n00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.510\nI go ahead and click Screen Clipping,\nit dims down the space.\n\n550\n00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:53.282\nAnd now I have a cross here to where I\nam going to say this is the space that I\n\n551\n00:28:53.282 --> 00:28:54.170\nwant to get.\n\n552\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.400\nBecause maybe I wanted to show somebody\nabout the Quick Access toolbar up here.\n\n553\n00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.290\nAnd then I had a collapse ribbon.\n\n554\n00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.690\nIf I click hold and drag, let go.\n\n555\n00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:09.350\nAs soon as I let go, that becomes\nthe screen clipping that I want to access.\n\n556\n00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.820\nAnd look at that.\n\n557\n00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.320\nI guess Word has decided like,\n\n558\n00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.950\nnope, you're not supposed\nto be doing this right now.\n\n559\n00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.940\nBut it is nice-\n&gt;&gt; Auto recovered though.\n\n560\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.480\n&gt;&gt; Auto recovery is\na beautiful thing [LAUGH].\n\n561\n00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.340\nSo [SOUND] at least we know that\nauto recovery is working smoothly.\n\n562\n00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.330\nAnd then that's where we go.\n\n563\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.530\nBut that's how you do screen\nclippings which will be really cool.\n\n564\n00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.620\nI know you're giving me the, hey, we're\ngetting towards the end there Ronnie.\n\n565\n00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.580\nBut I have one last thing\nI want to show you.\n\n566\n00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.380\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n567\n00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.750\n&gt;&gt; It kind of goes along with that screen\nclipping within your Office product.\n\n568\n00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:45.350\nBut it's actually a tool outside,\nit's in Windows.\n\n569\n00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.870\nI love this tool, Ronnie.\n\n570\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.920\nThe Snipping Tool.\n\n571\n00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n572\n00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Now, the Snipping Tool is pretty great.\n\n573\n00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.430\nI'm just going into the search and\ntyping in Snipping Tool.\n\n574\n00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:59.410\nIt, well, takes snippings of your\ncomputer [LAUGH] who wherever you want.\n\n575\n00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:04.650\nSo if I was trying to, I'm gonna go ahead\nand minimize Word, minimize PowerPoint.\n\n576\n00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:08.300\nBecause maybe I'd like to\ntake a screenshot here.\n\n577\n00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:13.600\nI can come over to my Snipping Tool, get\nwhat I want on the screen up, ready to go.\n\n578\n00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.970\nAnd then click the New button.\n\n579\n00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.840\nI will say there's this delay because\na lot times I'm trying to show drop\n\n580\n00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.270\ndown menus, and\nI have to like really quickly go for it.\n\n581\n00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:24.680\nThis is a newer thing, so if I have it\ndelay like two seconds, I can get to\n\n582\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.919\nactivating the drop down to show\nthe option that I want people to click.\n\n583\n00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.020\nIt's really like changed my\nworld [LAUGH] just to know.\n\n584\n00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.520\nI was like, my God, that's amazing.\n\n585\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.070\nLet's go into New,\nit dims down my screen, I get my cursor.\n\n586\n00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:45.652\nI say let's go ahead and\nmake this my snipping, let go,\n\n587\n00:30:45.652 --> 00:30:48.590\nputs it into the snipping program.\n\n588\n00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.390\nThat is like,\nwell that's just really the same thing,\n\n589\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.810\nas the insert the screen\nclipping that you went into Word.\n\n590\n00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.440\nWhy am I making this extra step?\n\n591\n00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.160\nIf I just wanted to go\nright into my document?\n\n592\n00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.570\nThe thing is that in the Snipping Tool,\n\n593\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.005\nyou have some really simple\nways to mark up an image.\n\n594\n00:31:03.005 --> 00:31:06.525\nSo a lot of times,\nI'm trying to draw attention to,\n\n595\n00:31:06.525 --> 00:31:11.009\nthis is the choice that you want\nto choose, like I wanna circle it.\n\n596\n00:31:11.009 --> 00:31:15.320\nWell if I do it here in the Snipping Tool,\nI can mark it up because I have the pen.\n\n597\n00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:21.680\nAnd I can say like this one right here and\nI can do little arrows.\n\n598\n00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.850\nAnd I can say hi there's a smiley face.\n\n599\n00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.130\nAnd I can change to different colors.\n\n600\n00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:30.570\nI can do the highlighters cuz maybe\nI want to highlight the word bird.\n\n601\n00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.930\nSo I can mark up, very simple\nmarkups within this photograph,\n\n602\n00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.650\nyeah, this photograph.\n\n603\n00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.040\nI don't even have to save it on\nmy computer if I don't want to.\n\n604\n00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.330\nNow you could and save it as a file.\n\n605\n00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:48.535\nIf you just copy, edit, copy or Ctrl + C,\ncome over to Word Come back over here.\n\n606\n00:31:48.535 --> 00:31:50.340\nLet's hit Enter,\nI'll just hit Enter twice.\n\n607\n00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.410\nAnd then just paste, Ctrl+V.\n\n608\n00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.230\nThen you got the picture right in there.\n\n609\n00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.760\nSo it's the screen clipping but\n\n610\n00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.360\ngoing outside of it instead of\nstaying inside of the Word.\n\n611\n00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.850\nYou go and you can do stuff like this and\nthe mark up is part of the picture.\n\n612\n00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:10.370\nI would always go back and\nI'd try to make circles and put it on top,\n\n613\n00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.070\ncuz we're gonna add shapes\nto all these documents.\n\n614\n00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.880\nBut then if you move things around,\nthen the shape doesn't stay with it.\n\n615\n00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.220\nI tried grouping, but this is just so\n\n616\n00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.370\nmuch easier if I just wanna\ndo a quick little markup.\n\n617\n00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.700\nSo copying and\npasting from your Snipping Tool\n\n618\n00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.200\nto bring out part of the different things\non your screen is super, super handy.\n\n619\n00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.230\nSo those are the three ways\nthat I can get photographs or\n\n620\n00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.620\nimages into my Word document.\n\n621\n00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.060\nSo, that will be the end of this episode.\n\n622\n00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.990\nAnd we'll move on to formatting\nour pictures in the next one,\n\n623\n00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.840\nso check that one out.\n\n624\n00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.460\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\nwell that sounds great.\n\n625\n00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.490\nThank you again for\n\n626\n00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:50.480\nat least helping us get the mechanics\ndown of how we can get images into Word.\n\n627\n00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.900\nAlso, we took a brief look at some of\nthe history behind some of the formats\n\n628\n00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.840\nas well.\n\n629\n00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.110\nAnd then, of course, we just talked\nabout what was the nature of cats and\n\n630\n00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.240\nbunnies here, I mean,\nwho would have known.\n\n631\n00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.480\nBut that is a great place for\nus to go ahead and end this episode then.\n\n632\n00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.650\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n633\n00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n634\n00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:12.596\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft

00:00:14.040\nYou're watching the Microsoft Word\n2016 Advanced show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.710\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n5\n00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.560\ntoday, we're gonna be taking a look\nat formatting images themselves.\n\n6\n00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.280\nAnd here to help us out\nis of course going to be,\n\n7\n00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.750\nwell, our prima ballerina in Word 2016,\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.761\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.491\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I need to\ndo a pirouette right now.\n\n10\n00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:31.059\n&gt;&gt; Go for it.\n\n11\n00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.217\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know,\nI might twist my ankle [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:35.268\n&gt;&gt; No, man.\n\n13\n00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.403\n&gt;&gt; So I don't know if I'm gonna do that.\n\n14\n00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:39.956\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I did grow up taking ballet,\n\n15\n00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.550\nlots of ballet.\n\n16\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.238\n&gt;&gt; Nice, me too.\n\n17\n00:00:42.238 --> 00:00:45.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I would love to see that,\nRonnie.\n\n18\n00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:46.762\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n19\n00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:48.980\nAll right, so Vonne, here it is.\n\n20\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.850\nWe know a little bit more about images and\n\n21\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.410\nthe formatting of what they are, thanks\nto the previous episode that we did.\n\n22\n00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.690\nNow we're going into formatting images.\n\n23\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.499\nHopefully, this is to help us to make\nbetter use of the images within our\n\n24\n00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:04.203\ndocuments.\n\n25\n00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:05.230\nIs that what we're doing?\n\n26\n00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.928\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nthis is where we put the image in.\n\n27\n00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:13.868\nWe just did insert picture or is it insert\nin online picture or the screenshot.\n\n28\n00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:16.730\nBut now,\nwhat about making it black and white?\n\n29\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.010\nWhat about putting a border on it?\n\n30\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.580\nWhat about moving it around in a document?\n\n31\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.390\nSo that's why I titled this Images Format.\n\n32\n00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.180\nLet's go ahead and get it moving\naround and what can we do with it?\n\n33\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.131\nAnd actually a lot of the image\nediting tools, I will call them,\n\n34\n00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.272\nin Word and all of Office have,\nit's so grown up now.\n\n35\n00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:40.422\nThey've really advanced from what you\nused to be able to do back in the day\n\n36\n00:01:40.422 --> 00:01:41.110\nwith Word.\n\n37\n00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.946\nAnd so you can create some really\ncool looking graphics without knowing\n\n38\n00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:51.115\nanything about Photoshop or some type\nof higher end image editing program.\n\n39\n00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:54.150\nYou could do it all within Office,\nwhich is awesome.\n\n40\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.040\nSo, all the same things that\nyou can do in PowerPoint and\n\n41\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.770\neven Outlook a little bit, and\nExcel, you can do in Word.\n\n42\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.343\nAnd PowerPoint might have a few extras.\n\n43\n00:02:05.343 --> 00:02:09.807\nI wouldn't say necessarily more\noptions but since that is a little\n\n44\n00:02:09.807 --> 00:02:14.429\nbit more of a graphical program,\nbecause you're putting images and\n\n45\n00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:19.552\nthings on to a slide, you might have\na little bit more freedom, I would say.\n\n46\n00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:23.960\nLike you can move it anywhere around\nbecause it's like a blank canvas per se.\n\n47\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.790\nIn Word, it's not a canvas.\n\n48\n00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:35.160\nSo moving it around, you gotta get it into\na mode that would let you move it around.\n\n49\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.600\nBut then understanding what's\nhappening when you move it around,\n\n50\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.510\nit's important to just be\naware of what it's doing.\n\n51\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.170\nIt does have slight limitations on there.\n\n52\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.150\nSo let's jump back in.\n\n53\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.610\nWe have a file.\n\n54\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.625\nNow I have this called inserted images.\n\n55\n00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:56.431\nThis is actually like, right where we had\nleft off in the Image Basics episode, but\n\n56\n00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:59.109\nI had to restart the computer and\neverything,\n\n57\n00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.008\ncuz it kind of quit on me\nright there in the middle.\n\n58\n00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:04.611\n[LAUGH] So\nwe did a little technical help to it, and\n\n59\n00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:07.860\nI just wanted to make sure that I\nhad it back up and ready to go.\n\n60\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.593\nSo this is not part of the exercise files\nthat are associated with the images, so if\n\n61\n00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:17.689\nyou're looking for it, it's not supposed\nto be there, it's really just more for me.\n\n62\n00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:23.171\nAnd we had put in pictures of fish up and\nbunnies, we had some screen clippings and\n\n63\n00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.891\nsome insert screen clippings\nfrom the snipping tool.\n\n64\n00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.180\nNow what about changing the size,\nmoving it around?\n\n65\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.456\nLet's start with the size first, and\nreally more about the mouse cursor icons.\n\n66\n00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:40.505\nBecause when you're over items or\nobjects in Word,\n\n67\n00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:43.190\nyou're normally gonna get what\nyou can see it, there we go.\n\n68\n00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.050\nYou can see that this is\na four pointed arrow and\n\n69\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.510\nit has a little white arrow on top of it.\n\n70\n00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.311\nThat means that your over\nsomething that can be selected.\n\n71\n00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:54.999\nSo if you single click on it, then it\nbrings up the little dots around the edge\n\n72\n00:03:54.999 --> 00:04:00.130\nof the photograph and then you get\nthis little handle thing at the top.\n\n73\n00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.694\nSo these are all the different things that\nyou could do for resizing your image.\n\n74\n00:04:03.694 --> 00:04:08.950\nAnd when you come to any of those dots\nyou get the two pointed white arrow.\n\n75\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.489\nTwo pointed white arrows mean\nthat you can change the size.\n\n76\n00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.290\nNow one thing I would\nprobably suggest not doing\n\n77\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.162\nwould be taking it from either the top or\nthe bottom in the middle and doing this.\n\n78\n00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:20.662\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n79\n00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:22.977\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to squash your images,\n\n80\n00:04:22.977 --> 00:04:25.793\nyou wanna keep the aspect\nratio proportional.\n\n81\n00:04:25.793 --> 00:04:30.041\nOr at least for me I would, and\nthis is one of my pet peeves for images,\n\n82\n00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:35.180\nyou start seeing them squashed, and\nI'm like, no, just go from the corner.\n\n83\n00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.199\nGo from the corner!\n\n84\n00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.663\nCuz if you go from the corner and you drag\nin, and I'm not holding shift by the way,\n\n85\n00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:44.939\nthis is just a thing that happens in your\nOffice products and specifically Word\n\n86\n00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:49.760\nhere, is that if you go from a corner it's\ngonna keep that aspect ratio proportion.\n\n87\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.171\nThat's good, so always do that.\n\n88\n00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:54.679\nIt doesn't matter if you go from\nthe top corner or the bottom,\n\n89\n00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:59.268\nthe only thing is that when you go from\nthe top, you think it's gonna go this way,\n\n90\n00:04:59.268 --> 00:05:03.520\nlike down, but the way that this\nphotograph is placed into this document,\n\n91\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.250\nit just stays right where\nits supposed to be in.\n\n92\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.681\nWe'll cover that in just a little bit.\n\n93\n00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:14.417\nThe handle on the top,\nthis is your rotate handle.\n\n94\n00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:17.890\nAnd you get this little swirly arrow for\nyour mouse cursor.\n\n95\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.930\nThat means if I click,\nhold and drag, you're like,\n\n96\n00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.170\nwhoa why is it, it seems like it's\nkinda rotating in a weird space.\n\n97\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.810\nAgain, this is because of the text wrap or\n\n98\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.220\nthe positioning options\nthat are on by default for\n\n99\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.230\nthis graphic, but at least you know\nthat that's what that icon will do.\n\n100\n00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.208\nAnd right now I'm doing everything\nwithin just a blank document,\n\n101\n00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:44.844\njust to kinda get us familiar\nwith all of these things first.\n\n102\n00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:49.333\nNow, the moving around your photograph,\nokay?\n\n103\n00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:52.359\nAnd as soon as I said it,\nI'm gonna kinda jump over here to,\n\n104\n00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:54.253\nlet's get it into some text, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:59.063\nI'm gonna put my cursor here,\nlet's insert a picture, and let's insert,\n\n106\n00:05:59.063 --> 00:06:03.400\nwe'll go ahead and insert Mr.\nFuego and he's kind of big.\n\n107\n00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.275\nWe already know how to resize it, so\nI'll grab a corner, size it down.\n\n108\n00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:10.170\nThere's that alt text that's\ncoming up right there.\n\n109\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.776\nAnd that's something that is\na new thing within my most\n\n110\n00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:19.003\nrecent update of Office products\nthat just happened last night.\n\n111\n00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:22.929\nWell, at the time of this recording,\n[LAUGH] it was just last night.\n\n112\n00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:24.251\nSo if you're not seeing,\n\n113\n00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:28.350\nthat you might not have the most recent\nbuild of this particular product.\n\n114\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.291\nSuper quick, if I come over here to file\naccount see this is what build I'm on,\n\n115\n00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:36.103\nI'm on 8201.2.\n\n116\n00:06:36.103 --> 00:06:39.048\nSo if yours is lower than that\nin the number, in your account,\n\n117\n00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:43.030\nthen that's why yours doesn't\nshow the same way that mine does.\n\n118\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.770\nSo I've made it a little bit smaller, but\nnotice how when I put the picture in,\n\n119\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.920\nwhen I insert a photograph,\nit is in line with text.\n\n120\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.260\nThat's what it does by default.\n\n121\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.490\nThis little guy right next,\n\n122\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.860\nit's a little rainbow looking thing, this\nis where you have your layout options.\n\n123\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.830\nThe other thing that I\nhaven't pointed out yet\n\n124\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.630\nis that you also have this\nparticular option on the Format tab,\n\n125\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.160\nthe contextual tab that's going to\ncome up when you put in images.\n\n126\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.422\nIf I click off of this,\nthat tab goes away.\n\n127\n00:07:14.422 --> 00:07:19.024\nSo contextual tabs are things that\nhappen when you're on something that is\n\n128\n00:07:19.024 --> 00:07:25.090\nselected that brings up other options that\naren't normally shown on your ribbon.\n\n129\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.742\nSo select to effect,\nget our picture selected, and\n\n130\n00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:31.710\nnow I have the same thing right here\nwith it, it's known as text wrap.\n\n131\n00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.950\nHow does the text wrap around this image?\n\n132\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.840\nAnd then the other one that kind of goes\nhand-in-hand with it is the position.\n\n133\n00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.020\nThe position, as you can see,\nit is in line with text.\n\n134\n00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.730\nSo it stays as, almost like\na character if you typed in a letter.\n\n135\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.198\nThat's where it's in line with it,\nas opposed to some of the other ones.\n\n136\n00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:54.495\nNow notice it says with text wrapping.\n\n137\n00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:57.664\nSo if I had this photograph,\nlet me zoom out a little bit so\n\n138\n00:07:57.664 --> 00:08:04.090\nyou can see the whole A whole page,\njust kind of looking, Graphically at this.\n\n139\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.210\nMaybe I want to move this around to the\nbottom right-hand corner, bottom left-hand\n\n140\n00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.510\ncorner, and that's where the position's\nreally cool, where it's all built-in.\n\n141\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.430\nSo if I say here look at that, perfect,\nand it moves all my text around.\n\n142\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.880\nMaybe I want to put it there.\n\n143\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.100\nPerfect, so it's right in the middle\nof my document with the text-wrapping.\n\n144\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.310\nPut it in the middle, put it on the left,\nput it down at the bottom on the left.\n\n145\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.640\nSo these are some neat things that you\ncan do by just put the picture in and\n\n146\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.920\nit puts it where you want it to go.\n\n147\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.972\nCool, but if I wanted to move\nit around independently.\n\n148\n00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.584\nMaybe I don't want it in\nthose specific spots,\n\n149\n00:08:36.584 --> 00:08:39.140\nmaybe just to the right\nof this one paragraph.\n\n150\n00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.590\nYou have the rack options.\n\n151\n00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.562\nAnd this is, I have Square, and\n\n152\n00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:48.110\nI love that it shows that preview\nof you can see where it's going.\n\n153\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.290\nTight, and at this point, Square and\nTight looks like the same.\n\n154\n00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.560\nThat'll be different if you have\nphotographs that have transparency.\n\n155\n00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.890\nAnd actually, I could throw in the flower\nand show you the difference on that one.\n\n156\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:06.262\nThe Through, the Top and Bottom, Behind\nthe Text, okay, I could put it there or\n\n157\n00:09:06.262 --> 00:09:10.224\nI could put it in front of\nthe text where it's over the text.\n\n158\n00:09:10.224 --> 00:09:13.410\nNot sure if I want that one for\nthis particular option.\n\n159\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.080\nLet's just go with the square.\n\n160\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.455\nLet me zoom in a little bit so\nyou can see it a little bit better and\n\n161\n00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:19.910\nthere's my picture.\n\n162\n00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.520\nNow this is where I can\nmove it anywhere I want.\n\n163\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.290\nThis is another one that I always say,\nclick on the doggie,\n\n164\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.850\ncuz it actually looks like a dog\nthat had like wrap around it.\n\n165\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.730\nNow I call it the rainbow button, [LAUGH]\nwhen it really is the text wrap button.\n\n166\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.863\nSo I'd always say, just go ahead and\nthrow it into a square text wrap.\n\n167\n00:09:35.863 --> 00:09:39.582\nAnd now it moves independently,\nI can put it anywhere, okay, and\n\n168\n00:09:39.582 --> 00:09:42.510\nthat's what usually people are fine with.\n\n169\n00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.280\nBut do you see that little\nanchor guy over here,\n\n170\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.460\nnow because I have show and\nhide characters on it.\n\n171\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:52.530\nThat anchor is saying that it is\nconnected to this particular paragraph.\n\n172\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.330\nCuz remember, I put my cursor in front\nof the D in Down the Rabbit Hole and\n\n173\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.080\nthat's where I insert the image.\n\n174\n00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.780\nSo it's still thinking that that's where\nyou put it, but with these wrap options,\n\n175\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.930\nit's staying with that paragraph.\n\n176\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.690\nNow watch what happens,\nI'm gonna scroll down a little bit.\n\n177\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.565\nHere's what happens when\nI start moving down.\n\n178\n00:10:10.565 --> 00:10:13.850\nYou see how the arrow travels with it?\n\n179\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.142\nAnd like it's like down,\nwhen it gets right about there.\n\n180\n00:10:18.142 --> 00:10:18.642\nSee how it jumped down?\n\n181\n00:10:18.642 --> 00:10:20.174\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz now it's like,\n\n182\n00:10:20.174 --> 00:10:21.512\nyou're in this paragraph?\n\n183\n00:10:21.512 --> 00:10:24.762\nLet me associate myself\nwith this paragraph.\n\n184\n00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:29.153\nBecause if I, let's just for fun copy\nthis, I did a Ctrl+C and I'll come here,\n\n185\n00:10:29.153 --> 00:10:30.070\nand I pasted it.\n\n186\n00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.830\nDo you see how now it's moving with it?\n\n187\n00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.595\nCuz it thinks it's a character or\na part of this particular paragraph.\n\n188\n00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:40.180\nCuz if you hadn't done that,\nthen you start adding text,\n\n189\n00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.926\nthe paragraph will move down but\nthe picture would stay put.\n\n190\n00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:47.629\nAnd especially if this is a photograph\nthat's associated with the text in that\n\n191\n00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:50.970\nparagraph, you would definitely\nwant it to keep moving.\n\n192\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.318\nThis is a default option\nwithin the positioning and\n\n193\n00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:58.257\nlayout of the text wrap of images.\n\n194\n00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.770\nLet me move this back up a little bit.\n\n195\n00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.965\nComing back over to that Format Picture\ntoolbar, and let's go back over to wrap.\n\n196\n00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:08.630\nDo you see how it does\nhave Move with Text?\n\n197\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.790\nThat allows it to move with it.\n\n198\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.790\nIf I did that fixed position on page,\nmaybe you don't want it to move.\n\n199\n00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.470\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it doesn't have to travel with\n\n200\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.990\nthe text.\n\n201\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.220\nAnd so this is a great default\noption if that's what you want.\n\n202\n00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:27.550\n[LAUGH] Like stop moving,\nthen you can fix the position on the page.\n\n203\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.070\nAnd when I do that, if I start copying,\nwell I could just paste it.\n\n204\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.920\nSee how now I'm pasting in more text?\n\n205\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.780\nThe picture doesn't move with\nthat particular paragraph, and so\n\n206\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.840\nit knows where to go.\n\n207\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.290\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, if we do that, if we choose\nthat fix, is that a one time deal or\n\n208\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.210\ncan I unfix it to be able to\nmove it back around again?\n\n209\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.000\n&gt;&gt; It is an option of the photograph,\nwhich I'm going right back to.\n\n210\n00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.670\nSo, right here,\nif I wanted to move with the text.\n\n211\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.790\nNow if I come back and\nthat wasn't just the undo part,\n\n212\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.661\nit was I changed the property or\nthe format of that photograph.\n\n213\n00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:06.625\nSo yes, you can go back and\nforth with this, which is nice.\n\n214\n00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:08.537\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say I don't know why, but\n\n215\n00:12:08.537 --> 00:12:11.686\nI remember in some other programs\nif you change the option it said,\n\n216\n00:12:11.686 --> 00:12:15.330\nif you do this this is permanent and\nyou couldn't actually move it again.\n\n217\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.383\nI was like, well that doesn't seem to\nbe one that you can test very easily.\n\n218\n00:12:20.383 --> 00:12:23.230\nSo it's great to know that this is\nactually something we can change if\n\n219\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.960\nwe want to.\n\n220\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n221\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.390\nSo, we have those different\noptions in the wrap.\n\n222\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.850\nAnd this is some other ones.\n\n223\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.890\nYou could go into the more layout options,\nyou could also set this as default.\n\n224\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.850\nIf you wanted to have it always fixed.\n\n225\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.595\nLike every time you put in a picture like,\nstop doing that.\n\n226\n00:12:38.595 --> 00:12:39.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You could go ahead and\n\n227\n00:12:39.776 --> 00:12:40.542\nmake that the default.\n\n228\n00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:44.300\nAnd whatever wrap option you\nhave on here with that square.\n\n229\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.180\nAnd if you're also going to the more,\nsee the doggie, there.\n\n230\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.890\nThe button on the toolbar\nactually looked like that so\n\n231\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.450\nthat's why I go,\nclick on the doggie and choose square.\n\n232\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.520\nAnd I'm like,\nyes that's exactly what I want.\n\n233\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.201\nSo you have those different options here.\n\n234\n00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:59.753\nAnd the positioning,\nthis is like that absolute position and\n\n235\n00:12:59.753 --> 00:13:03.320\nthen where it's with it and\nthen how it moves with the object.\n\n236\n00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.055\nSo all of these different things\nare really in that drop down but\n\n237\n00:13:07.055 --> 00:13:10.521\nif you wanted to you can get\ninto the dialogue box in there.\n\n238\n00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:15.660\nSo different places to go ahead and\nmove around your image and the text wrap.\n\n239\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.443\nI'm gonna jump back over to\nour images by themselves.\n\n240\n00:13:20.443 --> 00:13:25.275\nCuz anything that I'm going to show\nyou next is associated with those\n\n241\n00:13:25.275 --> 00:13:29.042\ntext wrap options,\nyou can move it anywhere around.\n\n242\n00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:34.022\nThis is now getting into, let's change\nthis picture around a little bit.\n\n243\n00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.540\nLet's go with cropping the photograph.\n\n244\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.275\nMaybe I don't want so much of the top,\nI wanna make this more of a square image.\n\n245\n00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:44.290\nWith the picture selected,\ncoming over to the format tab,\n\n246\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.970\nyou can come to the Crop button.\n\n247\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:52.450\nGo with Crop, you just click it,\nput these black, square thingys, wow, yep.\n\n248\n00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.260\nBlack square thingys around the edge of\nthe photograph and if I move them down,\n\n249\n00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.170\nyou're not squashing the picture.\n\n250\n00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.790\nYou're just saying,\nthis is the area that I want to keep.\n\n251\n00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.730\nThis is the area that\nI don't want to keep.\n\n252\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.010\nIt’s not going to be removing the image\n\n253\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.300\nit’s going to be just\nhiding parts of the image.\n\n254\n00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.980\nSo if I wanted to make it\na little bit more on his face.\n\n255\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.920\nAnd then you can either hit enter\non the keyboard to accept or\n\n256\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.360\nyou can also just click off of it and\nit will go ahead and accept that cropping.\n\n257\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.110\nAnd any formats you do add\nthis like add a border.\n\n258\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.250\nGo ahead and do any color corrections.\n\n259\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.440\nIt's gonna stay within this cropped area.\n\n260\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:39.030\nSo then the border goes around this space\nof what you defined as the viewable image.\n\n261\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.220\nLet me go back and select that again.\n\n262\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.790\nThe other thing you could do,\nis you could crop it to a shape.\n\n263\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.190\nThis is cute.\nCuz maybe I want to say, you know what,\n\n264\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.840\nlet's go ahead and\nput little bishop in a heart shape.\n\n265\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.130\nThat's cute.\n\n266\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.660\nNew frame, you click on that.\n\n267\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.275\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; Awww.\n\n268\n00:14:53.275 --> 00:14:54.980\n[LAUGH] Isn't that adorable?\n\n269\n00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.505\n&gt;&gt; Adorable.\n\n270\n00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:59.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I can pick the shape\nthat I want it to crop to.\n\n271\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.840\nNow sometimes maybe the picture,\n\n272\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.730\nit's kinda like when you put\na photograph in a mat in a frame.\n\n273\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You can move the picture separate than\n\n274\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.150\nthe mat to show the area.\n\n275\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.330\nCuz if I needed to move\nthis around a little bit,\n\n276\n00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.450\nyou can back over here to\ncrop with picture selected.\n\n277\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.780\nIf you go to fill versus fit,\nif I choose fit,\n\n278\n00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.710\nnow it's trying to fit the picture but\nnow that you can kinda see it.\n\n279\n00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:24.210\n&gt;&gt; The heart.\n\n280\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't really work that way.\n\n281\n00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.313\nSo if I come back over to fill,\nokay that works a little bit better.\n\n282\n00:15:29.313 --> 00:15:35.448\nBut now if I'm in this option,\nyou see I could move around or\n\n283\n00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:42.360\nresize the picture within the frame\nto get more of just his face.\n\n284\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.550\nSo you can take that photograph and\nmove it within the frame.\n\n285\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.390\nSo that's why I usually go ahead and\nuse that fill.\n\n286\n00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.115\nGet into it,\nchange the size of the picture, and go on.\n\n287\n00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:53.306\nNow if I just kind of\nclick off to the side, and\n\n288\n00:15:53.306 --> 00:15:56.010\nnow I have this adorable picture of Mr.\nBishop.\n\n289\n00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.927\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll keep on Mr.\n\n290\n00:15:57.927 --> 00:16:01.728\nBishop and go over to some of\nthe other things that you can do.\n\n291\n00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:06.120\nThis is where I'm going to show you\na few and once you see what they can do,\n\n292\n00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.520\nit's kind of like you're\nlet out on the playground.\n\n293\n00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.250\nYou can go ahead and do all sorts\nof funny things, so picture styles.\n\n294\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.280\nStyles as we know from some\nof our other episodes,\n\n295\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.450\nit's a just like a name\nto group of formatting.\n\n296\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.230\nSo, these are how it\ndoes the picture borders,\n\n297\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.410\nthe effects, and the layout,\nall this over here.\n\n298\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.430\nIt's really just borders and\neffects, for the most part.\n\n299\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.460\nBut, they're on to a one named group.\n\n300\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.760\nThis is one of my favorites,\nthe rotated white, cuz it looks like it's,\n\n301\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.814\nkinda, lifted up the paper a little bit,\nit's got a drop shadow on.\n\n302\n00:16:37.814 --> 00:16:39.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's got a cute border And\n\n303\n00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.230\nyou could go ahead and hover across all of\nthe different ones that you want to do.\n\n304\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.330\nSome have like the vignettes around,\nthe soft edges.\n\n305\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.660\nSome that are kind of like,\n\n306\n00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.880\nlaying down because that starts\ngetting into the 3D and the bevel.\n\n307\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.220\nSo, if we wanted to pick one,\nI really like that one too.\n\n308\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.270\nIt looks like a tough standing up.\n\n309\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.560\nWe'll go with my fave and\ngo to here and like that's beautiful.\n\n310\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.060\nWell what if I want to\nchange the border of it?\n\n311\n00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.330\nWell I can come into here and\n\n312\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.400\nI could make this, I like green\nwe'll go maybe that color green.\n\n313\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.190\nWe can change the border of this.\n\n314\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.690\nAnd if I come back over to my styles,\nthen it’s going to start, well\n\n315\n00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:20.110\nit overrides that local format but you can\ngo back and change it if you wanted to.\n\n316\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.250\nAnd then the effects.\n\n317\n00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:26.950\nAll those things that we have in\nthe styles it's a combination of a shadow,\n\n318\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:32.990\na reflection, a glow, a soft edge, cool\nthing is it shows you all those little\n\n319\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.670\nrepresentations right there to say what\ntype of bevel, what type of 3D rotation.\n\n320\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.600\nLet's go to this bunny.\n\n321\n00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.162\nWe'll go to this bunny and\nI can come into the effects and\n\n322\n00:17:44.162 --> 00:17:46.601\nmaybe I can add a drop shadow.\n\n323\n00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:48.672\nI could add a glow.\n\n324\n00:17:48.672 --> 00:17:50.220\n&gt;&gt; A glow?\n\n325\n00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.542\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nLook at that, that's so cute.\n\n326\n00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:54.974\nMaybe make it a little smaller so\nyou can see it.\n\n327\n00:17:54.974 --> 00:17:58.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could have a beveled edge.\n\n328\n00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.870\nSo, you can go through and\n\n329\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.020\npick all these different options\nindividually If you wanted to.\n\n330\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.340\nYou don't have to go with the style.\n\n331\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.420\nSo, all of those who wants.\n\n332\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.750\nThe picture effects, this is where\nI actually gets into a SmartArt.\n\n333\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.420\nAnd so you can change,\nmaybe you want it to look like that and\n\n334\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.440\nhave some text over it.\n\n335\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.430\nBut this is definitely associated\nwith SmartArt graphics.\n\n336\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.480\nSo, it could add some different\nthings if you wanted to.\n\n337\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.810\nThat's kind of cute, and\nput bunny next to it.\n\n338\n00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.310\nSo, layouts and SmartArt,\nthey kind of go hand in hand.\n\n339\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.530\nAll right, but\nI started to kind of get some things that\n\n340\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.865\nmaybe I don't like what I just did, okay?\n\n341\n00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And maybe even with bed shot,\n\n342\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.390\nI don't like that either.\n\n343\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.703\nI'm gonna jump ahead a little bit,\nif you're following along the notes,\n\n344\n00:18:42.703 --> 00:18:43.238\nby the way.\n\n345\n00:18:43.238 --> 00:18:47.767\nWe have the Reset Picture Button,\nand if I dropped this button down,\n\n346\n00:18:47.767 --> 00:18:52.547\nyou might see words next to it because\nof the resolution of your monitor.\n\n347\n00:18:52.547 --> 00:18:55.462\nYou can reset the picture or\nyou can reset the picture and size,\n\n348\n00:18:55.462 --> 00:18:56.740\ncause I made it smaller.\n\n349\n00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:02.950\nIf I just choose Reset Picture, it stays\nin the same size that I had resized it to.\n\n350\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.450\nIf I chose to reset the picture and\n\n351\n00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.580\nthe size, see it went back to\nthe original size of the photograph.\n\n352\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.688\nAnd we'll do one thing for you, I'm\ngonna jump over here to a new document.\n\n353\n00:19:14.688 --> 00:19:17.700\nIn the other episode,\nif you haven't watched it,\n\n354\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.080\nwe talked about Fuego,\nthe cute picture of Fuego, and\n\n355\n00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.250\nit's a really, really big picture,\nmassive picture.\n\n356\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.424\nIf I come over,\nI don't know about massive.\n\n357\n00:19:25.424 --> 00:19:26.637\nBut it's pretty big.\n\n358\n00:19:26.637 --> 00:19:29.730\nSo, if I go over to insert picture and\n\n359\n00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:35.120\nI choose on that picture's folder on my\ndesktop, this particular one right here.\n\n360\n00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.910\nAnd notice if I hover there's\nthat 2500 by 3200 pixels.\n\n361\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:47.330\nIf I click on this and insert it,\nit will always size as wide as the page.\n\n362\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.600\nIt doesn't go past that, which is nice,\nbecause if this was put in its normal\n\n363\n00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.670\nsize, it would be really much\npast the 8.5 by 11 dimensions.\n\n364\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.170\nAnd if I made this smaller and\ndid all of our options that we had just\n\n365\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.960\ndone to our image and\nwe put on a little style, and\n\n366\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.300\nthat's really cute, and\nI go to resize picture and size.\n\n367\n00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.030\nWell look at that.\n\n368\n00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.090\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; So that's something that happens where\n\n369\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:17.690\nyou're just like whoa, that is not\nthe size that I put this picture in.\n\n370\n00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.470\nWhat happened?\n\n371\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.730\nThat's because it's like, hey,\nthis is the original size.\n\n372\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.176\nLike I'm taking out all the functionality,\nor things that I did for\n\n373\n00:20:26.176 --> 00:20:30.500\nyou when I inserted the picture and\nit only went to the width of the page.\n\n374\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.480\nWell now, all that's out the window.\n\n375\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.260\nSo, if that ever happens to you when\nyou choose to resize, what was it,\n\n376\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.360\nthe size, picture and\nsize, this could happen.\n\n377\n00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.780\nNow, it's just the nature of\n\n378\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.670\nhow many pixels I had in that\nphotograph to begin with.\n\n379\n00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:53.890\nSo, little side note on that\nreset picture option, okay?\n\n380\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.440\nBut this picture wasn't that big to\nbegin with, so it worked just fine.\n\n381\n00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:05.230\nA few other things that we can do with our\nimage tools here, I could come over here.\n\n382\n00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.310\nLet's just try and get it, there we go.\n\n383\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.160\nPerfect, right in the picture.\n\n384\n00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.870\nI have corrections, color,\nand artistic effects.\n\n385\n00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.200\nFun.\n\n386\n00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.390\nGo to our corrections, this is like\nour brightness and contrast, right?\n\n387\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.460\nMaybe it was like kind of a dark image,\nyou wanna make it a little bit brighter.\n\n388\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.230\nOoh!\n\n389\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.820\nNice hover discover,\nmaybe a little darker.\n\n390\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.650\nSo, those are some of the color\ncorrections that you can do for\n\n391\n00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:31.700\nyour photograph.\n\n392\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.360\nColor, black and white.\n\n393\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.070\nEverything looks cuter in black and\nwhite, right.\n\n394\n00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.605\nIt looks just so much more professional.\n\n395\n00:21:38.605 --> 00:21:39.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n396\n00:21:39.177 --> 00:21:44.980\nthen you also have some other color\nvariations that are the options here.\n\n397\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.730\nThese are all but based on themes,\nby the way, your document thing.\n\n398\n00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.070\nBecause if I choose this,\nthis is accent color 2, dark.\n\n399\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.850\nIf I come over here to design and\nI pick a different color,\n\n400\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.720\nbecause they're all connected to Accent 1,\nAccent 2, Accent 3.\n\n401\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.093\nSo, if I wanted some more pinks and\npurples as my overall design theme, now,\n\n402\n00:22:06.093 --> 00:22:09.840\nall of those different,\neven the borders and everything.\n\n403\n00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.680\nSo, some of those presets that\nyou're choosing will change.\n\n404\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.415\nSo, it's like hey I chose this to be\norange, and then later down the ride.\n\n405\n00:22:18.415 --> 00:22:20.615\nWe can call it a ride.\n\n406\n00:22:20.615 --> 00:22:22.646\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You change the design theme, and\n\n407\n00:22:22.646 --> 00:22:26.054\nit changes the colors in your stuff,\nwell that's because they're all connected.\n\n408\n00:22:26.054 --> 00:22:29.590\nBut you can always go\ninto more variations.\n\n409\n00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.730\nYou can also see where it's doing\nsome of these, kind of other options.\n\n410\n00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.790\nYou can also set the transparent color,\nwhich is nice.\n\n411\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.670\nSo, you could change this, and say,\nI want this to be the transparency, and so\n\n412\n00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.200\nthat's, like the see\nthroughness part of it.\n\n413\n00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.750\nThat maybe not be the best\nexample of this, but\n\n414\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.320\nif you have a photograph like\na lot of solid colors around it,\n\n415\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.400\nwell then that's where you could like\nremove the background in a sense.\n\n416\n00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.596\nIt's not remove background\nas the actual tool, but\n\n417\n00:22:57.596 --> 00:23:00.144\nit does have the set transparent colors.\n\n418\n00:23:00.144 --> 00:23:03.938\nSo that can be really handy for\ngetting rid of parts of it.\n\n419\n00:23:03.938 --> 00:23:08.020\nAnd then of course,\nyou can go into more of the color options.\n\n420\n00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.180\nAnd I'll just throw this right on here.\n\n421\n00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.950\nYou see, notice it brought over\nhere the format picture task pane.\n\n422\n00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.120\nBecause we got into more options.\n\n423\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.269\nYou could have also gotten to this if\nyou right click the photograph and\n\n424\n00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:20.614\ngo to format picture.\n\n425\n00:23:20.614 --> 00:23:24.779\nBecause a lot of the things that we're\ndoing here with the color corrections and\n\n426\n00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:28.940\nthe presets and the borders, If you do\nit through the format picture task pane,\n\n427\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.010\nits the same, but\nit has just a few extra options in there.\n\n428\n00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.606\nIf you ever needed to get into it.\n\n429\n00:23:34.606 --> 00:23:39.106\nBecause if I look over here at the picture\ncolor, its choosing what I did and\n\n430\n00:23:39.106 --> 00:23:43.179\nacross the top, and there's a couple\nmore options behind my head,\n\n431\n00:23:43.179 --> 00:23:45.556\njust so you can see it a little bit more.\n\n432\n00:23:45.556 --> 00:23:48.052\nYou can see that I've got the shadows,\n\n433\n00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:52.968\nall of those different things that I was\nadding from the picture effects, and\n\n434\n00:23:52.968 --> 00:23:56.386\nI can go into changing it\nreally to the more detailed.\n\n435\n00:23:56.386 --> 00:24:01.210\nThis is where it's almost like Photoshop,\nand we can really get into how you can\n\n436\n00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.740\nchange these different things and\ngive you more options.\n\n437\n00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:09.441\nSo, If you need it, a lot of times any of\nthese ones that go into like show more\n\n438\n00:24:09.441 --> 00:24:13.700\noptions, you're gonna bring out\nthe format picture task pane, and\n\n439\n00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.250\nyou can go through it the way you want,\nokay.\n\n440\n00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.262\nLet's come back, bunny.\n\n441\n00:24:18.262 --> 00:24:19.930\nWe're gonna close that out.\n\n442\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.670\nI'm also gonna undo it because I don't\nwanna have that transparent edge, and\n\n443\n00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:25.230\nmaybe I'll come back here to say,\n\n444\n00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.140\nI don't wanna have any\nre-coloring of the photograph.\n\n445\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.720\nThe artistic effects,\nthis is where you get into,\n\n446\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.652\nthis looks exactly like Photoshop filters.\n\n447\n00:24:35.652 --> 00:24:37.537\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So this filter right here,\n\n448\n00:24:37.537 --> 00:24:40.737\nthe glowing edges,\nyeah that's kinda scary looking, though.\n\n449\n00:24:40.737 --> 00:24:41.355\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n450\n00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:46.379\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But, again, this is a Photoshop\nfilter, it comes exactly from this,\n\n451\n00:24:46.379 --> 00:24:51.429\nmaybe some pixelations, light screen\nmake it look like it's under a glass.\n\n452\n00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:54.260\nI don't know about that one,\nthat one's kind of cute.\n\n453\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.571\nMaybe we'll go with that.\n\n454\n00:24:55.571 --> 00:24:57.615\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But we could always reset it,\n\n455\n00:24:57.615 --> 00:25:00.580\nif I don't like it, so\nlet's reset that photograph.\n\n456\n00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:05.130\nSo you can go through there and\nreally have some fun with those options.\n\n457\n00:25:06.325 --> 00:25:10.871\nNow if you go through, here let me\nmake this a little smaller, and\n\n458\n00:25:10.871 --> 00:25:15.676\nmaybe I'll throw on that style,\nyou could also change the picture.\n\n459\n00:25:15.676 --> 00:25:18.347\nIf I like all the size, like the location,\nlike everything about it,\n\n460\n00:25:18.347 --> 00:25:21.518\nbecause everything you're doing,\nyou're doing the format, the wrap options,\n\n461\n00:25:21.518 --> 00:25:22.398\nhow you can choose it.\n\n462\n00:25:22.398 --> 00:25:24.590\nI just wanna change it out.\n\n463\n00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.008\nYou can choose a different\npicture in there.\n\n464\n00:25:27.008 --> 00:25:28.358\nMaybe you wanna put Fuego inside.\n\n465\n00:25:28.358 --> 00:25:33.190\nAnd you see it keeps that formatting and\njust changes out the image.\n\n466\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:37.740\nThat's a nice way to not have\nto redo everything you just did,\n\n467\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.200\nand so on and so forth.\n\n468\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.530\nSo let's see, what else do we need to do?\n\n469\n00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.060\nCompress picture.\n\n470\n00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:45.983\nSo this is a good one.\n\n471\n00:25:45.983 --> 00:25:49.570\nLet's come over here to this document,\nI'm gonna undo.\n\n472\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.190\nThis is a really big photograph, right?\n\n473\n00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.461\nBut if I have a bunch of\nthese throughout my document,\n\n474\n00:25:56.461 --> 00:26:00.331\nI don't want the overall Word\nfile to get really, really big.\n\n475\n00:26:00.331 --> 00:26:04.720\nSo, what you could do,\nis you can compress the images.\n\n476\n00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.130\nThat button right here, I have a\nphotograph selected, it reduces the size,\n\n477\n00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.250\nclick on there.\n\n478\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.020\nApply to only this picture.\n\n479\n00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.750\nThis is a nice thing to\nwhere if you wanted,\n\n480\n00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.330\nyou had a hundred pictures\nin your document.\n\n481\n00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.200\nThey're all really big, and\nyou made them all small in the file or\n\n482\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.410\nin the document,\nyou could apply this to all of them.\n\n483\n00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.190\nThose resolutions that we talked\nabout in the image basics.\n\n484\n00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.970\nI told you they'd come back.\n\n485\n00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.982\nThe email versus web\nversus print versus HD.\n\n486\n00:26:30.982 --> 00:26:35.827\nNow, these are not the exact numbers\nthat I gave you in the first episode,\n\n487\n00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:37.760\nbut that's okay.\n\n488\n00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.126\nJust know that, hey,\nif I'm never going to be printing this,\n\n489\n00:26:41.126 --> 00:26:45.202\nI'm only gonna be showing it on screen,\nyou don't need to have 330 ppi.\n\n490\n00:26:45.202 --> 00:26:47.346\nYou don't have to have all that space.\n\n491\n00:26:47.346 --> 00:26:49.060\nJust go ahead and throw it down.\n\n492\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.182\nPut into maybe like the web, a nice\nkinda middle-of-the-road there, 150.\n\n493\n00:26:53.182 --> 00:26:57.695\nYeah, it's gonna still look good if you\nprint it out on a regular desktop printer,\n\n494\n00:26:57.695 --> 00:27:02.670\nand it'll look fine if it's going on\nthe webpage, but it's not too too big.\n\n495\n00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.860\nSo that would be nice.\n\n496\n00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.720\nAnd also you can see delete/cropped\nareas of the photograph,\n\n497\n00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.840\nusing all that cropped, you can get rid of\nall that extra space that you don't need.\n\n498\n00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:16.260\nAnd if you uncheck, like I said, this,\nyou could do it to all the images.\n\n499\n00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.890\nBut you have to turn it off.\n\n500\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.486\nBut if I apply it just to this one,\nand I click OK.\n\n501\n00:27:20.486 --> 00:27:22.946\nNothing's gonna change, visually, but\n\n502\n00:27:22.946 --> 00:27:27.600\nit will make a huge difference in your\nfile size and saving of the document.\n\n503\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.330\nAll right, so we've reset.\n\n504\n00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.700\nOkay, the last one that I wanna show you,\nRonnie.\n\n505\n00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n506\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.870\n&gt;&gt; This one,\nhere let's just do it here too.\n\n507\n00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:39.931\nWe're going to Insert the picture,\nand I'm going to go to this one.\n\n508\n00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:43.836\nI actually had to test this\nout a couple times to try and\n\n509\n00:27:43.836 --> 00:27:45.440\nfind, there it goes again.\n\n510\n00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.831\nAll right, well,\nlet's go ahead and restart.\n\n511\n00:27:47.831 --> 00:27:50.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm wondering that it's\n\n512\n00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.936\nthose particular files,\nmaybe where I got them from.\n\n513\n00:27:52.936 --> 00:27:53.972\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why\n\n514\n00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:56.200\nI'm having some problems where-\n&gt;&gt; Me neither.\n\n515\n00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.750\n&gt;&gt; My Word is not like.\nIt doesn't like my cats.\n\n516\n00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.236\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's allergic.\n\n517\n00:28:00.236 --> 00:28:02.978\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Who knows?\n\n518\n00:28:02.978 --> 00:28:07.329\n[LAUGH] So with this photograph,\nI want to get,\n\n519\n00:28:07.329 --> 00:28:15.850\nI just wanna have the cats be the only\nthing that I see, removing the background.\n\n520\n00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.580\nSo come over here,\nyou remove the background.\n\n521\n00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.054\nNow, it comes into this area,\nall right, it try to analyze what's\n\n522\n00:28:23.054 --> 00:28:28.182\nthe art it wants to keep,\nwhat's the part it wants to discard?\n\n523\n00:28:28.182 --> 00:28:31.850\nAll of this pink in here,\nthat's what it's going to take out.\n\n524\n00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.300\nEverything else you see,\nthat's what it's going to keep.\n\n525\n00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.358\nNow, if I zoom in on this a little bit,\nlet me, go ahead here.\n\n526\n00:28:39.358 --> 00:28:40.432\nThere we go.\n\n527\n00:28:40.432 --> 00:28:43.732\nYou see I have marked areas to keep,\nmarked areas to remove.\n\n528\n00:28:43.732 --> 00:28:49.680\nIf I choose this,\nit's like I'm gonna mark up with a pencil.\n\n529\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.250\nI don't want this, and see how I'm\njust kind of like circling this area?\n\n530\n00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:58.002\nAnd it's saying, okay cool, and\nI could get really close in here and say,\n\n531\n00:28:58.002 --> 00:29:02.110\nall right, let me go ahead and\nget rid of this part.\n\n532\n00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.426\nAnd this part I wanna keep,\nand I wanna keep Fuego's face.\n\n533\n00:29:04.426 --> 00:29:08.746\nSo let's move it over to marking\nareas that I can keep, and\n\n534\n00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:12.460\nI will draw around the box\nto say I want all of this.\n\n535\n00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.790\nAnd sometimes you can kind\nof draw over it a lot.\n\n536\n00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.508\nIt's like, okay it remembers,\nbut then it pops this thing up?\n\n537\n00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:19.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not perfect.\n\n538\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.230\nNow this is a pretty complicated image.\n\n539\n00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.632\nThe simpler the photographs,\n&gt;&gt; The better.\n\n540\n00:29:23.632 --> 00:29:25.990\n&gt;&gt; Like a solid background,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n541\n00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.189\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\nThis is especially good for\n\n542\n00:29:28.189 --> 00:29:33.810\nlike removing that white background in\nsay like a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n543\n00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:37.930\nThe thing with Word is most of the time,\nyour page is gonna be white.\n\n544\n00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.785\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So a white background isn't that big of\n\n545\n00:29:40.785 --> 00:29:43.200\na deal necessarily.\n\n546\n00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.522\nAnd so I could take this, and\nyou go through, and you mark, and\n\n547\n00:29:46.522 --> 00:29:50.820\nI'm gonna just pretend that I didn't\ncut off Bishop's half of his face.\n\n548\n00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.366\nAnd I keep the change, and it's like but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n549\n00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:54.718\n&gt;&gt; Do you see, it looks kind of jagged.\n\n550\n00:29:54.718 --> 00:29:58.210\nIt doesn't look great necessarily.\n\n551\n00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.570\nSo it's not going to be\nthe most perfect thing.\n\n552\n00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:08.440\nIf you got very simple colors\nthat will probably work the best.\n\n553\n00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.480\nBut it's not gonna be,\nit's not the easiest and\n\n554\n00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.860\nthe most perfect tool, but\nit is pretty neat that it can do that.\n\n555\n00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.849\nAll right, now I know that\nwe're almost out of time, but\n\n556\n00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:22.213\nI remembered, I told you guys,\nI was gonna show you something,\n\n557\n00:30:22.213 --> 00:30:24.920\nand then I kept on going and\ndidn't come back to it.\n\n558\n00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.899\n[LAUGH] The flower, and removing the\nbackground is what triggered this in my\n\n559\n00:30:29.899 --> 00:30:34.330\nhead, of, what if I don't have\nsomething that is square?\n\n560\n00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.752\nLet's insert a photograph.\n\n561\n00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:41.521\nWe're gonna go to Picture,\nand on my pictures folder,\n\n562\n00:30:41.521 --> 00:30:44.064\nthere is the one with the PNG.\n\n563\n00:30:44.064 --> 00:30:47.570\nNow we know that this is,\nyou know what, we'll go with the GIF.\n\n564\n00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:51.470\nThis is what I have, transparency\naround the edge of this flower.\n\n565\n00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.300\nI will insert this photograph\nthat is really big.\n\n566\n00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.174\nLet's go ahead, and\nmake it a little smaller.\n\n567\n00:30:55.174 --> 00:30:58.230\nLet's make it a little\nbit smaller even so.\n\n568\n00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.910\nAnd we will go ahead,\nand move down to here.\n\n569\n00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.970\nI will choose the text wrap,\nand I will choose square for\n\n570\n00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.045\nnow, and as square, it's square.\n\n571\n00:31:11.045 --> 00:31:14.030\nIf I go to Tight,\nthere's where you see it,\n\n572\n00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:19.230\ndo you see how now it's actually kinda\ngoing along the edge of the photograph?\n\n573\n00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:24.370\nIf you have a square jpg, tight and\nsquare seems like it's the same thing.\n\n574\n00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.810\nBut if you don't, and\nyou have transparency,\n\n575\n00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:31.050\nthat's where you're really gonna see\nthe difference of the text wrap.\n\n576\n00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.640\nAnd just one more thing\nyou could go through and\n\n577\n00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.640\nedit the wrap points of the file,\nand really get more into,\n\n578\n00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.320\nlike I want this to kind of move down cuz\nI need more text to come around to it.\n\n579\n00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.920\nSo you could go to that particular level\nand edit the wrap points if you need to\n\n580\n00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.710\non images that's just not\ngoing where you want it to be.\n\n581\n00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:59.380\nAnd now that I move it around, so\nthere's the real example of the difference\n\n582\n00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.010\nof tight and square within a image,\nwith transparency.\n\n583\n00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.810\nAnd I believe I have covered everything,\n\n584\n00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:10.210\nthis is one of those things where you\njust gotta jump in, play around with it.\n\n585\n00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.550\nYou might get lost for\nawhile in a sense of like, there's so\n\n586\n00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.773\nmany different things I can do.\n\n587\n00:32:13.773 --> 00:32:18.820\nAnd all the different image manipulation\ntools that are in Office products.\n\n588\n00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.830\nThey're really fun, and so there's a lot\nof great things that you can do with it.\n\n589\n00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.880\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nthank you again for helping us out, and\n\n590\n00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.120\nas we take a look at all these images and\nall the different things that it can do.\n\n591\n00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.370\nIt really has been a big\nchange since when you and\n\n592\n00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:36.220\nI really first started teaching Word, but\nremember that you want to take advantage\n\n593\n00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.280\nof these tools to make your documents\nof course look better as well.\n\n594\n00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.160\nNow, Vonne, is there anything else\nthat we need to think about as well?\n\n595\n00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.255\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's something that I\nmentioned in the episode about alt text,\n\n596\n00:32:48.255 --> 00:32:52.025\nalternate texts, and so\nI'd like to show everybody about that, but\n\n597\n00:32:52.025 --> 00:32:56.455\nI think I'm gonna have a little bit more\nthan a couple minutes to talk about that.\n\n598\n00:32:56.455 --> 00:32:57.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I know we're at the end\n\n599\n00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:58.290\nof the episode.\n\n600\n00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.650\nSo I think we're gonna go ahead and\nmake a part two.\n\n601\n00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:05.200\nSo I think we should come back,\nand talk about alternate text and\n\n602\n00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.280\nsome of the brand new features at\nleast at the time of its recording\n\n603\n00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.180\nthat Microsoft Words

It's fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.070\nI'm really excited to\nbe here with you today.\n\n10\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.680\n&gt;&gt; I know, we're making IT pro history or\nOffice pro history as well.\n\n11\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n12\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.030\nAll sorts of history going\naround here [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.398\nAnd actually talking about history,\n\n14\n00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:37.560\nwe're gonna be going over\nthe alternate text and images.\n\n15\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.360\nThat's what this show is\ngoing to be focusing on.\n\n16\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.621\nAnd I had mentioned it in the Part One,\neven though you weren't here, but\n\n17\n00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:45.844\nthat's okay,\nI will catch you up on everything.\n\n18\n00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:51.288\nSo we have been inserting our images\ninto our document and everything's been\n\n19\n00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:57.390\nfine and we've been changing the colors\nand making [INAUDIBLE] look really cute.\n\n20\n00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.010\nBut what is alternate text and\nit's actually been around for a while.\n\n21\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.450\nSo that's why we're talking about\nthe history of images and alternate text.\n\n22\n00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and the history that we're\ncreating is that we are an all\n\n23\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.780\nfemale production staff for\nthis show right here.\n\n24\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.950\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n25\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.620\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n26\n00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.410\nGirl power [LAUGH].\n\n27\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.500\nSo yes, and we've got some girl history\ngoing on everywhere, so it's awesome.\n\n28\n00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.880\nSo alternate text, it is what you\nadd to images for accessibility.\n\n29\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.170\nFor people that are sighted,\nwe can see the image and\n\n30\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.700\nwe can say that's a cute little orange\ncat right there hanging out in the grass.\n\n31\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.890\nBut for people that are non-sighted,\n\n32\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.130\nhow do they get the information\nout of that photograph?\n\n33\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.340\nWell, us as designers or\npeople who create content, it's good for\n\n34\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.970\nus to be able to add those accessibility\nfeatures to those graphical objects,\n\n35\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.670\nto be able to say hey, this is\nan actual picture of an orange cat, and\n\n36\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.800\nyou tell what that\nphotograph is all about.\n\n37\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.270\n&gt;&gt; So what we're really looking at here,\n\n38\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.380\nare we talking about ways that we can\nintegrate that metadata information, so\n\n39\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.850\nthat certain types of software that\ncan assist others, it integrates well?\n\n40\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nit's funny you say the word metadata.\n\n41\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.930\nCuz as soon as you say metadata,\n\n42\n00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.530\nI immediately start thinking of my days\nas an HTML coder and building web pages.\n\n43\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.470\nAnd metadata is that information\nthat isn't always in the foreground,\n\n44\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.500\nwe don't see it, but it's the information\nliving behind the scenes.\n\n45\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.399\nAnd where you put in your keywords and\nthings like that.\n\n46\n00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:35.670\nAnd going back to my HTML days that's\nwhat I remember alt text from.\n\n47\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.040\nWhen you put in images and\nyou use HTML code,\n\n48\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.390\nyou use an img tag and then you have\na source and then you have an alt,\n\n49\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.630\nan alt attribute to be able to show or\nto be able to describe that image.\n\n50\n00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.180\nAnd I don't know if you've ever\nexperienced this Cherokee back in\n\n51\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.218\nthe day talking about history.\n\n52\n00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:54.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You remember seeing web browsers where\n\n53\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.670\nthe pictures weren't showing because like\nmaybe you didn't have enough bandwidth.\n\n54\n00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.200\nBut you would actually see text in\nthe box where the image would sit.\n\n55\n00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and sometimes even\njust like that little default\n\n56\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.150\nicon of what an image should be.\n\n57\n00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly and\nthere was text with it and\n\n58\n00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.720\nsometimes there was nothing in there.\n\n59\n00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.390\nAnd that was because us as coders,\n\n60\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.390\nwe were responsible for\nputting that alternate text.\n\n61\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.300\nSo you could see it when a browser\nwasn't displaying images,\n\n62\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.750\nbecause back in the day before\nwe had all this Internet speed,\n\n63\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.790\nyou might not show pictures\nin your web browser.\n\n64\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.410\nSo that way you could just see the text.\n\n65\n00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.870\nSo it's that kind of same idea here\nis you are adding that metadata\n\n66\n00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.230\ninto the photograph to be able for\n\n67\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.450\nhaving those screen readers be\nable to read that description.\n\n68\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.980\nSo actually I have a couple\nof web pages pulled up here,\n\n69\n00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.990\nto kind of help us describe\nwhat's going on here and\n\n70\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.130\nall these are in the show notes, so\nfeel free to go ahead and look that up.\n\n71\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.710\nWe have here, how do I add alternate\ntext to a picture, shape, chart,\n\n72\n00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.240\nSmartArt graphic, or table, because,\nyes, this is a episode about images.\n\n73\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.740\nBut any graphical element that's in Word,\n\n74\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.600\nor Excel, or PowerPoint or any of\nthose things because we can see that.\n\n75\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.010\nBut we need to be able to have\nnon sided people be able to\n\n76\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.060\nsee the same thing that we're doing.\n\n77\n00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.860\nSo what you need to do is you need to\nformat that particular object or item.\n\n78\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.440\nAnd the easiest way is to bring up that\nformat, whatever that thing is cast pane.\n\n79\n00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.210\nWe had actually seen that in our\nimages where we would right click and\n\n80\n00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.730\ngo to format picture.\n\n81\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.080\nWell, if you're on a shape, you have\nright click format shape, so on and so\n\n82\n00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.240\nforth with your tables and charts.\n\n83\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.470\nAnd you can over in this task pane,\nthere is a button right there for\n\n84\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.920\nwhat looks like the set the properties for\nthis particular item,\n\n85\n00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.900\nand there is the alt text.\n\n86\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.030\nAnd this is where you would put in\nthe title and or the description.\n\n87\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.420\nWhat is that thing that is in that page?\n\n88\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.310\nNow, back in my day,\nI remember with the HTML,\n\n89\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.060\nall you had to do was put in that alt and\nthat would be the title.\n\n90\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.260\nThere was another attribute for\n\n91\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.210\nthat tag that was the long description and\nthat way, you can describe more.\n\n92\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.450\nI think there might have been\na character limit on that too.\n\n93\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.160\nI think there was maybe 128 characters\nof what was allowed for a title.\n\n94\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.210\nNow that's kinda back in the day, I'm not\nsure if that same limitation holds true\n\n95\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.140\nin this scenario, but\nI feel like I remember something.\n\n96\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, how descriptive do\nthey really want you to get here?\n\n97\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.740\nIs really the key is like,\nhow many ways can you describe the cat.\n\n98\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.500\nI don't know, maybe if you're a cat lover,\n\n99\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.000\nyou could have all sorts\nof adjectives there.\n\n100\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.995\nBut I'm probably just gonna say,\nthis is an orange cat.\n\n101\n00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:39.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n102\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.980\nAnd that's what it's meant to do.\n\n103\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.160\nThe title is just, here's what it is.\n\n104\n00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.880\nBut if you wanted a longer,\nthey could elect and I believe it had some\n\n105\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.490\ncorrelations with those screen readers,\nof whether they elected to do that.\n\n106\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.826\nNow I have another website that talks\nabout that and for everything that\n\n107\n00:05:55.826 --> 00:06:00.608\nI thought was just always the title,\nI never really got into the description.\n\n108\n00:06:00.608 --> 00:06:05.673\nBut, now this is dated on July 2014,\nwell, it seems old,\n\n109\n00:06:05.673 --> 00:06:09.700\nbut it actually, it's not,\nit's pretty cool.\n\n110\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.670\nAnd this particular website, I have it\nin the show notes, this guy's actually\n\n111\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.100\ngot a lot of really good information\nabout accessibility in general.\n\n112\n00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.450\nSo check some of his other blog posts out.\n\n113\n00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.300\nBut you can see that, down here, he's\ntalking about some of this stuff with,\n\n114\n00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.830\nand I wanted, here it is, there it is.\n\n115\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.730\nAnd now I guess with the alt in long\ndescription attributes that have been\n\n116\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.940\nused in HTML.\n\n117\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.530\nOkay, great.\n\n118\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.560\nSo you could go a head and\n\n119\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.290\nhave just the title,\nwhich is a quick little description.\n\n120\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.440\nWell, quick little blurb, cuz then\nthe description is the longer one.\n\n121\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.930\nAnd I said which one should you use?\n\n122\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:43.870\nAnd it says, it depends.\n\n123\n00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.260\nAnd it's talking about\nthe Word document in here, and\n\n124\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.290\nI thought this was really interesting.\n\n125\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.060\nFor the different screen readers,\nit says use description\n\n126\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.820\nbecause those screen readers are reading\nonly the description, not the title.\n\n127\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.960\nI was like, wow,\n\n128\n00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.800\nthat's actually really interesting because\nI thought it was the other way around.\n\n129\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.680\nI thought they only the small one and\nthen the description and\n\n130\n00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.820\nthen it was like an elective, so\nI'm like okay, that makes sense.\n\n131\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.400\nAnd it actually is gonna\ncorrelate into the new thing\n\n132\n00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.840\nthat this latest Office update, it's\nputting everything in the description for\n\n133\n00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.820\nus automatically,\nit's not putting the title.\n\n134\n00:07:19.915 --> 00:07:23.740\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, it's really interesting how\nwe see companies like Microsoft really\n\n135\n00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.780\ndeveloping their cognitive services areas.\n\n136\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.530\nI actually saw, I don't know if you\nwatch Bill Nye the Science Guy but\n\n137\n00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.156\nhe's back on TV now, and\nit's a little more dear for adults.\n\n138\n00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:37.990\nBut one of their software engineers\nwas a non sighted individual,\n\n139\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.490\nwho was working on developing an app,\nand he was really cool because you could\n\n140\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.500\nuse your mobile device to go ahead and\nprovide those types of descriptions for\n\n141\n00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.150\nyou, by scanning it in with\nthe integrated camera on your phone.\n\n142\n00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.863\nSo you see that there's\ndefinitely a need here and\n\n143\n00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:56.138\nit's probably gonna be coming a lot,\nutilized more so than it has in the past.\n\n144\n00:07:56.138 --> 00:08:00.868\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's exactly what\nthe intelligent services are doing in\n\n145\n00:08:00.868 --> 00:08:03.852\nMicrosoft Office, and it's It's amazing.\n\n146\n00:08:03.852 --> 00:08:04.814\nIt's almost a little scary.\n\n147\n00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:08.960\nIt's like, how can you see that by\njust me putting my own pictures in it.\n\n148\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.730\nSo when we get to where I actually\nshow you what it does now,\n\n149\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.220\nyou're gonna be like that's pretty neat.\n\n150\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.070\nBut yeah,\nthat's exactly what they're doing here.\n\n151\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:22.280\nOur computers are getting intelligent for\nus and it's an interesting time.\n\n152\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It sure is.\n\n153\n00:08:23.185 --> 00:08:26.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So here it's just\nit was just a neat article for\n\n154\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.890\nme to see that's what the actual\nhardware and software for\n\n155\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.720\nthe people that need these accessibility\nitems to be able to see it.\n\n156\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.890\nAnd so at the very bottom, and\nit goes through the different,\n\n157\n00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.440\nsay like if you are generating it from\nGoogle Docs or on the Office Libre.\n\n158\n00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.630\nIt says one thing,\nuse description, not title.\n\n159\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.370\nThat was pretty cool for me to know,\n\n160\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.450\nbecause I always thought it\nwas the other way around.\n\n161\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.650\nSo, cool.\n\n162\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.940\nUse the description, not the title,\n\n163\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.630\nbecause that's usually what\nthey're going to be going for.\n\n164\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.480\nAll right,\ntalking about those intelligent services,\n\n165\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.990\nI have another website from\nthe Office help pages.\n\n166\n00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.370\nIt's just the whole idea about\nbeing powered of the cloud.\n\n167\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.810\nSo this does everything that we're\ntalking about what this new feature\n\n168\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.340\nis going to be able to do for us.\n\n169\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.030\nIt is part of that\nOffice 365 subscription.\n\n170\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.960\nSo if you don't have that, then you\nwon't see some of these new features.\n\n171\n00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.180\nBut, like I said,\nAlt text has been around for a long time.\n\n172\n00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.450\nSo you can still add alternate text,\n\n173\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.050\nit's just not going to do\nthe auto-generation part for you.\n\n174\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.790\nAnd I'll show you where\nit's at in these products.\n\n175\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.560\nBut, if you want to learn more\nabout the Intelligent Services.\n\n176\n00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.610\nAnd this is also something you can\nelect to use, or not use, okay, so\n\n177\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.610\nyou have to be an Office 365 subscriber,\nbut you could turn that service off,\n\n178\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.590\nsay like I don't want this to\nbe using any of my products.\n\n179\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.680\nWell, I think it's pretty cool,\nso I'd say turn it on, but\n\n180\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.580\nit is an option that\nyou could turn it off.\n\n181\n00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.380\nAll right, so,\nthe thing is [LAUGH] and, Cherokee,\n\n182\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.890\nI know that you are prone to this as well.\n\n183\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.740\nThis week I had some updates happen.\n\n184\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.360\nAnd you know that sometimes when things\nupdate it kinda breaks things, doesn't it?\n\n185\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.090\n&gt;&gt; It sure does, not always, but\nthere's always that possibility.\n\n186\n00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what was working perfectly,\nit's like it broke my print driver, or\n\n187\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.290\nnow I can't connect to this particular\nservice that I had that was specifically\n\n188\n00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.910\nfor my organization, and\nit could be really frustrating sometimes.\n\n189\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.310\nAnd I'll be completely honest,\nI'm experiencing one of those right now.\n\n190\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.095\nBecause I went ahead and\nhad the latest Office update.\n\n191\n00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:33.985\nAnd at the time of this recording,\nthat is version 1705, build 82.\n\n192\n00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:37.116\nOkay, let me just bring it up so\nyou can see it.\n\n193\n00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:38.186\n[LAUGH] This one right here.\n\n194\n00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:39.342\nNow you're like, but this is Word.\n\n195\n00:10:39.342 --> 00:10:40.942\nWhy are you showing PowerPoint?\n\n196\n00:10:40.942 --> 00:10:41.942\nI'll get to that.\n\n197\n00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:45.382\nBut this is the version that I am\ncurrently running on, and this happened,\n\n198\n00:10:45.382 --> 00:10:47.012\nlike I said, within this week.\n\n199\n00:10:47.012 --> 00:10:50.632\nJust turn it on and hey,\nyou have new updates, cool, all right.\n\n200\n00:10:50.632 --> 00:10:53.212\nThat's when I put in a picture, and\nI can see all these things happening.\n\n201\n00:10:53.212 --> 00:10:55.922\nLike wow, that's neat,\nokay well let me test it.\n\n202\n00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:59.880\nBut the thing is, [LAUGH] I was doing\nit in Word, and you know what happened?\n\n203\n00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.870\nWord was crashing every single time\nI put in a picture, so I was like hm,\n\n204\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.470\nthis is a little weird.\n\n205\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.500\nSo I feel that this brand new thing\nthat happened with my particular set up,\n\n206\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.720\nmaybe it's my virtual machine, maybe\nit's whatever, but it was crashing Word.\n\n207\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.400\nAnd just like anything,\nI'm sure they will have a patch.\n\n208\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.540\n&gt;&gt; Dependent on the different type of\nenvironment, or setup that you have,\n\n209\n00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.360\nbecause, they try, but\n\n210\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.310\nnot every single variable can be accounted\nfor, when pushing these patches out.\n\n211\n00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and sometimes Microsoft\nwill go ahead and do an update.\n\n212\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.570\nAnd then there's another update to\nthe update, just a couple days later,\n\n213\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.040\nbecause yeah we realized that's\nbreaking your DLL services, or\n\n214\n00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.979\nI don't know-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:41.524\n&gt;&gt; I'm talking right now.\n\n216\n00:11:41.524 --> 00:11:44.360\nBut [LAUGH] it broke something,\nso we know that, let's fix it.\n\n217\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.560\nSo I know eventually I'll\nget Word to working, but\n\n218\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.005\nit was one of those,\nwhy isn't this working?\n\n219\n00:11:50.005 --> 00:11:52.660\n[LAUGH] And\nI'm going over to my friend's computer,\n\n220\n00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:58.350\nmy coworker has same build,\nsame Office 365, same Pro Plus account.\n\n221\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.750\nHe didn't even have it, he didn't even\nsee that like auto alt text being added.\n\n222\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.958\nI'm like all right,\nwell there's another wrinkle to this.\n\n223\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.700\n[LAUGH] I don't know what's going on here.\n\n224\n00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.840\nBut I think that's just\nwhat we do in computers,\n\n225\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.580\nI know in the tech world that's\nwhat we always have to deal with.\n\n226\n00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.741\nThere's always that asterisk at the end\nof everything that we say here.\n\n227\n00:12:16.741 --> 00:12:20.245\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The little caveat, and the\nthing that you have to kind of figure out\n\n228\n00:12:20.245 --> 00:12:24.036\nand work around, but if you're already\nworking with computers, and that's\n\n229\n00:12:24.036 --> 00:12:28.058\nprobably one of the things that draws you\nto it, is your internal trouble shooter or\n\n230\n00:12:28.058 --> 00:12:30.320\nproblem solver is what\nI'm thinking of here.\n\n231\n00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.470\nSo there are ways to go ahead and\nget around things or work through them.\n\n232\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, in this situation is I'm\ngonna have to demonstrate to you this\n\n233\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.770\nawesome new feature using PowerPoint.\n\n234\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:40.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n235\n00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.830\n&gt;&gt; Because PowerPoint's not crashing on me\n\n236\n00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:47.010\nand I can insert a picture in PowerPoint\nthe same way that I do in Word, and\n\n237\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.160\nit has the same intelligent services and\neverything's the same so\n\n238\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.480\nI'm just being able to get to\nthe place that it's not breaking.\n\n239\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.820\nSo as I said this latest update\nthat I just went through, and\n\n240\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.420\nthe intelligent services,\nbecause I thought it was one or the other.\n\n241\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.820\nAnd I went, I could not find the specific\ndocumentation, let me show you something.\n\n242\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.160\nSo since I have multiple virtual machines,\nI went to Lance's computer,\n\n243\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.570\nand I forced the update,\ncause he was on the old build.\n\n244\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.810\nSo I forced the update.\n\n245\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.540\nStarted up Word, and\nthis was what the first thing that I got,\n\n246\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.050\nwhich I think, I'm like yes.\n\n247\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.910\nI got some documentation of\nit saying latest in Word,\n\n248\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.840\nmake images more accessible.\n\n249\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.940\nIntelligent services\ngenerates alt text for\n\n250\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.750\nyour pictures to make your documents\nmore accessible to people who are blind.\n\n251\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.390\nPerfect, and that to me, that was like\nall right I know it was definitely\n\n252\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:36.720\nthe update that just happened, and I know\nthat's connected to Intelligent Services.\n\n253\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.250\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n254\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah because I tried both.\n\n255\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I turned Intelligent Services off,\n\n256\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.530\nthis thing wasn't available.\n\n257\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.800\nTurned Intelligent Services on, it was.\n\n258\n00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.110\nPerfect, at least I got that\ntroubleshooting that you're talking about,\n\n259\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.470\nthat this is what's happening.\n\n260\n00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.690\nStill don't know why Word's crashing.\n\n261\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.890\nBut that's okay.\n\n262\n00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.600\nAll right, so, bringing in Power Point,\nhere, this is the build.\n\n263\n00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.610\nIt, I do have the intelligent\nservices in my options.\n\n264\n00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.870\nNow again, this is something that if\nyou don't see this in your options,\n\n265\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.050\nthen you don't have this feature,\nbecause part of another thing\n\n266\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.700\nin my troubleshooting was, cause remember\nI said my coworker didn't have it.\n\n267\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.630\nI was wondering,\n\n268\n00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.960\nwell, this particular subscription\nis an enterprise level subscription.\n\n269\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.450\nWe're on an E5, we're like on the highest\nlevel of subscription that you can have.\n\n270\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.170\nAnd our, for the regular Office user, for\n\n271\n00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.870\nall of our IT ProTV people, I don't\nthink we're on an enterprise licence.\n\n272\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.780\nI think we're on like a small business.\n\n273\n00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.160\nHonestly, I don't even know.\n\n274\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:33.950\nI'd have to ask Don.\n\n275\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.630\nBut I wondered if that was\nanother piece of the puzzle as to\n\n276\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.040\nwhy something wasn't doing.\n\n277\n00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.580\nNate didn't have it, but I had it.\n\n278\n00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.659\nSo what's the difference?\n\n279\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.260\nThat's my assumption.\n\n280\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n281\n00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.830\nanyways if you don't see Intelligent\nServices, then you can't use this feature.\n\n282\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.290\nAll right, here's my PowerPoint.\n\n283\n00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.910\nInsert picture just like we would\ndo in Word, and I go out and\n\n284\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.090\nI find a picture you guys have been\nseeing Fuego throughout this shows.\n\n285\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.190\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen him, so a boy girl yeah.\n\n286\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.800\n&gt;&gt; This is Mr Fuego pants.\n\n287\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.730\nYes yes he's a he has a lot of other\nnames but probably not appropriate for\n\n288\n00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.570\nme to tell you on camera.\n\n289\n00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.800\nSo [LAUGH] when I put this in,\nand just give it a second,\n\n290\n00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.390\nnow don't worry about the design ideas,\nthat something different to PowerPoint.\n\n291\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.680\nBut I click on him, look at the bottom.\n\n292\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.650\nA cat wearing a costume.\n\n293\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.120\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's creepy.\n\n294\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.800\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n295\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.888\n&gt;&gt; Creepy cool.\n\n296\n00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:27.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like they just know that that's\n\n297\n00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.690\na cat wearing a costume,\nbut I insert a picture and\n\n298\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.760\nthis is my other cat Bishop,\nthis is little Bish, Mr. Bish.\n\n299\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.509\nI'm going to put him in there.\n\n300\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.515\nAnd then cat lying on the grass.\n\n301\n00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:46.720\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; I don't need the ideas right now.\n\n302\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.740\nSo that's the feature that I'm\ntalking about of this new automatic\n\n303\n00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.630\nadding alternate text to your image.\n\n304\n00:15:54.630 --> 00:16:00.271\nIt is seeing the picture, evaluating what\nit is, and it's like it's creepy cool.\n\n305\n00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:00.771\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:03.387\n&gt;&gt; Very creepy cool.\n\n307\n00:16:03.387 --> 00:16:04.042\nWhat if hey,\n\n308\n00:16:04.042 --> 00:16:05.465\nit doesn't get it right?\nAnd\n\n309\n00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.054\nI'll show you some examples\nthat are pretty funny.\n\n310\n00:16:07.054 --> 00:16:07.954\nBut let's say,\n\n311\n00:16:07.954 --> 00:16:11.349\nhey, I need to edit that.\nAnd this is the same thing you would do\n\n312\n00:16:11.349 --> 00:16:14.820\nfor pictures, even if you didn't\nhave this new alt auto thing.\n\n313\n00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.280\nYou right-click, you go to Format picture.\n\n314\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.935\nBrings up that task pane over there.\n\n315\n00:16:18.935 --> 00:16:23.763\nAnd this is the same button that we will\nclick on regardless of whatever version or\n\n316\n00:16:23.763 --> 00:16:25.990\nintelligence services we have.\n\n317\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.480\nAnd there is the option for Alt text.\n\n318\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.599\nIt's everything behind my head, it's fine,\nso we don't need to take me away.\n\n319\n00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:37.338\n[LAUGH] It says description, and\nsee how it put it in the description,\n\n320\n00:16:37.338 --> 00:16:38.182\nnot the title.\n\n321\n00:16:38.182 --> 00:16:39.484\nBecause now we know that-\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n322\n00:16:39.484 --> 00:16:41.036\n&gt;&gt; That's what all the screen readers use.\n\n323\n00:16:41.036 --> 00:16:44.919\n&gt;&gt; So what is the title actually used for\nthen?\n\n324\n00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:46.790\n&gt;&gt; I think it said that they use both.\n\n325\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.842\nAnd that sometimes a lot of screen\nreaders will just combine them together.\n\n326\n00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.448\nAnd they'll read the title first and\nthen they'll read the description.\n\n327\n00:16:52.448 --> 00:16:56.512\nBut maybe I think this is that whole kind\nof progression of maybe there was that\n\n328\n00:16:56.512 --> 00:16:57.270\nlimitation.\n\n329\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.581\nAnd it was just such a small area for\npeople to put it.\n\n330\n00:16:59.581 --> 00:17:02.852\nBut now they've graduated those\naccessibility software and hardware so\n\n331\n00:17:02.852 --> 00:17:04.338\njust read the description of it.\n\n332\n00:17:04.338 --> 00:17:08.303\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; So that's what I'm hypothesizing.\n\n333\n00:17:08.303 --> 00:17:12.732\nAnd I like that it says description\ngenerated with very high confidence.\n\n334\n00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:14.016\nAll right, good job Microsoft.\n\n335\n00:17:14.016 --> 00:17:16.848\n[LAUGH] I like that.\n\n336\n00:17:16.848 --> 00:17:18.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n337\n00:17:18.088 --> 00:17:23.070\n&gt;&gt; And it's right, so I'll go with that,\nbut of course you could get rid of that.\n\n338\n00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:29.920\nAnd you could say a white cat wearing\na top hat costume behind a Christmas tree.\n\n339\n00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.676\nSo you could explain that.\n\n340\n00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:34.796\n&gt;&gt; Well, you look at the way that\nthis description was composed and\n\n341\n00:17:34.796 --> 00:17:36.179\nit's very similar.\n\n342\n00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:39.613\nProbably is, under the hood, a lot of\nsimilarities to the application I was\n\n343\n00:17:39.613 --> 00:17:41.612\ntelling you about that they had developed.\n\n344\n00:17:41.612 --> 00:17:46.060\nBecause, for instance, there was\nan airplane sitting on a shiny table.\n\n345\n00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.210\nAnd it said an airplane sitting\non a reflective surface.\n\n346\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.080\nSo sometimes it's not like a hundred\npercent accurate, as of yet.\n\n347\n00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.020\nBut they're working on it and\nbuilding it up in that way.\n\n348\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.940\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you exactly that point\ncuz I thought this was kind of amusing.\n\n349\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.180\nSo if I take my insert pictures and\n\n350\n00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.040\nwe go over to my pictures folder\nthat I have a couple more.\n\n351\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.926\nWe've seen Fuego in a tree,\nhe loves to sit in his tree every morning.\n\n352\n00:18:07.926 --> 00:18:12.690\nSo we take him and we put this in and\nhe's like this majestic royal beast.\n\n353\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.951\nAnd then if I click on him,\na cat sitting in front of a mountain.\n\n354\n00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:22.605\nOkay, [LAUGH] a mountain I don't\nknow maybe it's seeing like the-\n\n355\n00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:23.548\n&gt;&gt; The angles or\n\n356\n00:18:23.548 --> 00:18:26.410\nsomething kind of could present that.\n\n357\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nmaybe the tree line in the back.\n\n358\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.920\nIt's finding somehow that\nit thinks it's a mountain.\n\n359\n00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.983\nOkay, so then we have some other ones.\n\n360\n00:18:33.983 --> 00:18:37.946\nLet me show you a few other ones\nthat I think are hilarious.\n\n361\n00:18:37.946 --> 00:18:41.688\nLet's see, we got this one.\n\n362\n00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:44.527\nLet me hold my control key cuz I'm gonna\ngo ahead and put them all on here.\n\n363\n00:18:44.527 --> 00:18:50.090\nWe'll go ahead and get Mr. Bishop and we\nhave some, well you'll see what it says.\n\n364\n00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.306\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm a little nervous now.\n\n365\n00:18:53.306 --> 00:19:00.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we've got here and\nthis is, come on, there we go.\n\n366\n00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.474\n&gt;&gt; Where'd you get these photos?\n\n367\n00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:06.017\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's his little shark cat hut that he\n\n368\n00:19:06.017 --> 00:19:07.820\nloves to sleep in.\n\n369\n00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.432\nAnd by the way, it says Edit Alt Text\nright here and it says,\n\n370\n00:19:12.432 --> 00:19:14.387\na dog wearing a costume.\n\n371\n00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:16.447\nOkay, well,\nI mean I can see it's a furry animal.\n\n372\n00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:17.860\n&gt;&gt; Legs of a creature, yeah.\n\n373\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.065\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it doesn't say like a cat getting\n\n374\n00:19:22.065 --> 00:19:24.766\neaten by its shark house.\n\n375\n00:19:24.766 --> 00:19:26.440\nIt doesn't really see that.\n\n376\n00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.270\nHere, this one, a colorful kite\nsitting on top of a sandy beach.\n\n377\n00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.070\nWell, that's the Colombian flag,\non top of a fort, in Cartagena.\n\n378\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.730\nSo, okay, I can see, yeah,\nthat looks like a sandy beach.\n\n379\n00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.740\nI can see where you're getting that.\n\n380\n00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.661\nAnd this is a herd of cattle, standing on\ntop of a dirt field, those are antelope.\n\n381\n00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:51.169\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which maybe could be considered cattle\n\n382\n00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:52.475\nstill, I don't know.\n\n383\n00:19:52.475 --> 00:19:53.821\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n384\n00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:58.109\nI can see where Microsoft would see okay,\nthose kinda look like cows.\n\n385\n00:19:58.109 --> 00:20:01.910\nAnd this does look like a beach,\nthat whole planar reflective surface.\n\n386\n00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.200\nIt doesn't see that it's a table.\n\n387\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:09.550\nIt looks like sand which it is\na fort that was made in the 1500s.\n\n388\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.430\nSo I'm sure it has some\ntype of sand element in it.\n\n389\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:17.467\nSo it's neat that it will generate\nthis type of information.\n\n390\n00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:20.416\nAnd it can do it for\nus and I really like that.\n\n391\n00:20:20.416 --> 00:20:21.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Vonne,\n\n392\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.490\nI've never seen it here in\nthe actual Office products before.\n\n393\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.470\nBut I'll tell you, years ago,\nwhen I first had my OneDrive account.\n\n394\n00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.210\nAnd I uploaded some\nphotos to that account.\n\n395\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.240\nIt recommended hashtags for\nphotos that I had uploaded.\n\n396\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.077\nAnd it gave me a recommendation for\nhashtag cupcake.\n\n397\n00:20:40.077 --> 00:20:42.130\nBecause I was uploading birthday pictures.\n\n398\n00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:46.810\nAnd so we see that this new development,\n\n399\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.890\nthis new technology is being\nintroduced into the office space now.\n\n400\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.300\nBut it has been developing\nin the background for\n\n401\n00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.830\nquite some time, so it's pretty cool.\n\n402\n00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.547\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's funny because me going\nthrough and doing my troubleshooting.\n\n403\n00:20:56.547 --> 00:21:00.390\nAnd finding documentation on this, it was\na little hard for me to come up with.\n\n404\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.540\nBut let me just show you\na couple more websites.\n\n405\n00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.534\nBecause that little picture right\nhere where it says Learn More.\n\n406\n00:21:06.534 --> 00:21:09.030\nSo I click on it and\nthen it comes over here.\n\n407\n00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.672\nAnd it mentions nothing about this.\n\n408\n00:21:10.672 --> 00:21:11.780\n[LAUGH] I'm just like-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n409\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so here's the latest update,\n\n410\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.360\nit's about the editor pane.\n\n411\n00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.220\nAnd there's nothing about\nthis whole alt text.\n\n412\n00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.360\nSo of course, I keep on digging,\nI keep on searching, searching, searching.\n\n413\n00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:29.585\nAnd I found this, now this is a blog post\nthat was posted here in December of 2016.\n\n414\n00:21:29.585 --> 00:21:33.916\nThis is where I'm like, okay, there's that\nintelligent alternate text for images.\n\n415\n00:21:33.916 --> 00:21:38.583\nAnd it's saying, soon you'll be able\nto get those alternate suggestions for\n\n416\n00:21:38.583 --> 00:21:40.990\nyou in Powerpoint and Word.\n\n417\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.520\nPerfect, so this was something\nthat they had been developing.\n\n418\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.750\nThey said, right here,\n\n419\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:50.118\npowered by Microsoft Computer\nVision Cognitive Service.\n\n420\n00:21:50.118 --> 00:21:54.570\nAnd it's fun that you say that because\nit talks about the hashtags, and\n\n421\n00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:55.570\nuploading your pictures.\n\n422\n00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.820\nAnd kind of, this crowdsourcing,\nlike if we all go ahead and\n\n423\n00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.380\nadd our pictures and\nstart tagging our stuff.\n\n424\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.200\nAnd the computers will learn what to look\nfor and then be able to identify it.\n\n425\n00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.107\nSo it's all kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Building their database, and\n\n426\n00:22:09.107 --> 00:22:12.020\nI know that's one of the things that\nthe developer was actually speaking on.\n\n427\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.180\nIs that they were limited,\n\n428\n00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.150\nI don't remember the actual number\nat the time of that recording.\n\n429\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.530\nBut they were limited to the type of\nimages that were already in the database\n\n430\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.430\nand looking to grow it.\n\n431\n00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.130\nSo hey, if we can help out\nthen I'm all about that.\n\n432\n00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.497\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n&gt;&gt; As long as it's being used for good.\n\n433\n00:22:26.497 --> 00:22:28.005\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And not like some nefarious purpose\n\n434\n00:22:28.005 --> 00:22:28.908\nover here I don't know.\n\n435\n00:22:28.908 --> 00:22:29.726\n[LAUGH].\n\n436\n00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:30.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I think that's where\n\n437\n00:22:30.661 --> 00:22:31.949\nthe creepy element comes in,\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n438\n00:22:31.949 --> 00:22:35.118\n&gt;&gt; It's like, how did you know\nthat that was a cat in a costume?\n\n439\n00:22:35.118 --> 00:22:36.091\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know?\n\n440\n00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:37.170\nLike, how did you know that?\n\n441\n00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.490\nWell, okay, you got the cattle, I see.\n\n442\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.940\nBut, it's working on it.\n\n443\n00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.573\nIf we put in a whole bunch more\npictures of antelope up there,\n\n444\n00:22:44.573 --> 00:22:47.211\nthey'll probably realize-\n&gt;&gt; They'll be able to distinguish\n\n445\n00:22:47.211 --> 00:22:49.040\nthe actual figure and everything.\n\n446\n00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it'll see like the stride,\nand see like the little horns,\n\n447\n00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.980\nlike that's not a cow, that's an antelope.\n\n448\n00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.869\nSo building that whole feature up and\nI thought that was pretty cool.\n\n449\n00:22:57.869 --> 00:23:02.335\nThe last thing I wanted to leave us\non was that this was a document I\n\n450\n00:23:02.335 --> 00:23:06.083\nstarted from scratch and\nit has all the new services.\n\n451\n00:23:06.083 --> 00:23:10.830\nI also have a PowerPoint that I created\nand we used in our last episode.\n\n452\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.220\nWe were talking about images or\nmaybe two episodes.\n\n453\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.038\nIt's okay, maybe you're not\nwatching this in succession.\n\n454\n00:23:17.038 --> 00:23:18.950\nIt's something about images,\nI think it was the introduction one.\n\n455\n00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.410\nSo you can see here,\nI have the same picture of Bishop.\n\n456\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:28.720\nBut notice that if I edit the alternate\ntext, it doesn't have anything in here.\n\n457\n00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.651\nBecause this was created before my update.\n\n458\n00:23:31.651 --> 00:23:32.835\nSo it wasn't doing the automatic match.\n\n459\n00:23:32.835 --> 00:23:35.314\n&gt;&gt; So this is like,\nfresh, hot off the press,\n\n460\n00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:38.276\nlike the newest option\nhere that you're covering.\n\n461\n00:23:38.276 --> 00:23:38.983\nThat's pretty cool, Vonne.\n\n462\n00:23:38.983 --> 00:23:40.789\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, at the time of recording.\n\n463\n00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:42.665\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At the time of recording, yes,\n\n464\n00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:44.630\nwe always need to throw that in there too.\n\n465\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this was done before that update.\n\n466\n00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.040\nSo you can see it doesn't have anything.\n\n467\n00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.910\nBut the cool thing is, look,\ngenerate a description for me.\n\n468\n00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:58.033\nSo if I click on this,\nit will go through a close-up of a cat.\n\n469\n00:23:58.033 --> 00:23:59.910\nAll right, so it's fine in that.\n\n470\n00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.370\nLet's go ahead and see what this one does.\n\n471\n00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.040\nI think this one still does,\nyeah, a cat wearing a costume.\n\n472\n00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.170\nBut you can see that if I had a file that\nwas already made, and I wanted to do that.\n\n473\n00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.657\nRight-click, go to Edit alternate text,\nand\n\n474\n00:24:12.657 --> 00:24:17.811\nthen you can go ahead and have it\ngenerate its own description for you.\n\n475\n00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:21.470\nMaybe it'll get it right, maybe it won't,\nthat's okay, we can always edit it.\n\n476\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.970\nAnd we do know if any of those services\nthat we don't have any of this stuff,\n\n477\n00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.490\nyou can always go back.\n\n478\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.514\nAnd add the alternate text from\nthe right-click format and\n\n479\n00:24:29.514 --> 00:24:32.270\nthen going into the alt-text place.\n\n480\n00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I think that about rounds\nout our concepts here for this show.\n\n481\n00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.370\nBut stay tuned we have\na lot more headed your way.\n\n482\n00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.530\nRemember, I've been your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n483\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n484\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.037\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at OfficeProTV\n\n485\n00:24:45.037 --> 00:24:50.060\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Word\n2016 Advanced show.\n\n3\n00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.325\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ngonna be taking a look at adding and\n\n4\n00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:19.572\nformatting shapes.\n\n5\n00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:23.150\nAnd here to help us do that in\nMicrosoft Word is gonna of course be\n\n6\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.406\nthe Microsoft Word Maestra herself,\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:27.680\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.250\n&gt;&gt; That was a lot of Ms. [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was and you know it's strange.\n\n9\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.333\nThere's actually two forms of that.\n\n10\n00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.168\nThere's maestro but\n\n11\n00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:36.142\napparently that's the masculine and\nthere's maestra which is feminine.\n\n12\n00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:37.085\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n13\n00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:41.887\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, welcome to the show as we\nbegin, as we start to take a look here.\n\n14\n00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:44.870\nWe've already added in some, pictures.\n\n15\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.750\nWhat makes this different?\n\n16\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're adding in shapes.\n\n17\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.670\nWe're gonna shape it up a little bit.\n\n18\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.830\nAnd while it is a graphical element, just\nlike as we have with our photographs and\n\n19\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.240\nour pictures, and whether we get it from\nonline or from our computers, shapes are,\n\n20\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.900\nwell, what you think of as shapes,\ncircles, squares,\n\n21\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.350\nhearts, some lightning bolts.\n\n22\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.969\nDifferent shapes that are already\npredetermined for us that we pick,\n\n23\n00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.350\nand then we draw into our Word document.\n\n24\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.910\nSo we just have ones that we wanna do.\n\n25\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne, everybody loves\nto add in a good heart shape right in\n\n26\n00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.960\nthe middle of that business letter.\n\n27\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.860\nSo, how are we going to do this?\n\n28\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n\n29\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.890\n[LAUGH] You definitely want to put hearts,\nand rainbows, and stars, and\n\n30\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.050\nsmiley faces all over\nyour business documents.\n\n31\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.450\nBut Word has different meanings for\ndifferent people.\n\n32\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.449\nMaybe you're a school teacher, and\n\n33\n00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:36.490\nthen you wanna jazz up your\ndocuments a little bit.\n\n34\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.430\nSo you can go ahead and add some shapes.\n\n35\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.610\nSo we're going to go\nthrough in this episode,\n\n36\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.940\njust adding them in to our documents.\n\n37\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.130\nUnderstanding what we need\nto do to move them around or\n\n38\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.920\nhow we can format them into position.\n\n39\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.980\nJust like when we were\ntalking about our images,\n\n40\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.550\nwe're talked a lot about word wrap and\nthe positioning on the page.\n\n41\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.340\nSo we're going to address that with shapes\nand how they're a little bit different\n\n42\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.670\nthan images, but we can end up\ngetting them to the right place.\n\n43\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.890\nAnd then changing colors and\nadding some text.\n\n44\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.130\nAnd so that's gonna be what we're\ngonna work on in this episode.\n\n45\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.370\nSo let's hop on down in here, and I have\na blank document for us to just kinda\n\n46\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.130\nplay around with to get familiar with,\njust using shapes, in general.\n\n47\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.820\nThen I also have a file that we've been\nusing throughout this whole series,\n\n48\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760\nreally, it's just Add Graphics.\n\n49\n00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.090\nIt's just text on it, so\nhow does the graphics\n\n50\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.545\nwork within a Word document that\nusually will have, hm, well, text.\n\n51\n00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n52\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.100\n&gt;&gt; So,\nlet's go back over to the blank document.\n\n53\n00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.100\nAnd we're gonna go to insert,\nlet's start there, and insert shapes.\n\n54\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.520\nNow, the way I describe this, it's like\npicking crayons out of a crayon box.\n\n55\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.380\nSo this is our box of crayons here, and\njust like if I was taking a crayon out of\n\n56\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.440\na box of crayons, I pull it out of\nthe box and I have it in my hand.\n\n57\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.040\nAnd I'm ready to take this crayon and\nthen draw on the paper.\n\n58\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.030\nAnd that's exactly what you're\ngoing to be doing here.\n\n59\n00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.520\nYou're selecting the crayon to put in\nyour hand, and then draw on your paper.\n\n60\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.410\nCuz a lot of times, people say,\nI really want this heart,\n\n61\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.230\nyou click it, and then they're like,\nwhere's the heart?\n\n62\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.533\nNow, you gotta draw it.\n\n63\n00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:16.499\nThere's two ways you can do this.\n\n64\n00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:21.050\nYou can single click once, and then it\njust goes ahead and places the shape.\n\n65\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.680\nLet's do that first one.\n\n66\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.840\nBoom, there you go.\n\n67\n00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.330\nThere is my shape.\n\n68\n00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.770\nIt goes to its default aspect ratio and\n\n69\n00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.150\nthe default size that that particular\nshape exists in within Word.\n\n70\n00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.120\nLet's go back over here and\ndo another one.\n\n71\n00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.580\nBut the other way that we can add a shape\ninto our document is you click hold and\n\n72\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.520\ndrag.\n\n73\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.360\nSo that way you can make it\nwhatever size you want, and\n\n74\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.830\nmaybe you want the heart to be\na little longer or a little wider.\n\n75\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.460\nYou can control that as well.\n\n76\n00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.539\nSo if I click hold, and drag, and\nI'm still holding that mouse button down.\n\n77\n00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:58.437\nSo I can go ahead and make it to whatever\nkind of aspect ratio, we'll say,\n\n78\n00:03:58.437 --> 00:03:59.315\nthat I want.\n\n79\n00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:03.347\nBut now what if I wanted to make it\nbigger but I wanna make sure that it\n\n80\n00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:07.525\nstays proportionate to its dimensions\nright when I'm dragging it,\n\n81\n00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:10.060\nI still haven't let go of that mouse yet.\n\n82\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.494\nHold your Shift key.\n\n83\n00:04:11.494 --> 00:04:14.798\nIf you hold your Shift key down,\ndo you see how, I'll do it there,\n\n84\n00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:15.920\nthere hold the Shift.\n\n85\n00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.720\nIt constrains the proportions while you're\ndragging to draw that particular shape.\n\n86\n00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.500\nNow, if you do this, just\n\n87\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.710\nconscientiously make sure you let go of\nthe mouse first, and then the Shift key.\n\n88\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.820\nBecause if you let go, sometimes if\nyou do it just a little bit before,\n\n89\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.220\nwell then it stops\nmaintaining that proportion.\n\n90\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.870\nAnd then it just goes ahead and\nmakes it to wherever your mouse is.\n\n91\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.830\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n92\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.910\nDo it slow at first then you can get a lot\nfaster, but mouse first then the Shift.\n\n93\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.200\nSo those are the two ways that you\ncan draw shapes into your document.\n\n94\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.370\nNow, when we had inserted images\ninto Word, I always said,\n\n95\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.220\nmake sure your cursor is in the place\nwhere you want the image to go and\n\n96\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.670\nthen what it does is it\nputs it in line with text.\n\n97\n00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.770\nIt adds it like a character that\nyou're typing on in the keyboard,\n\n98\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.090\nalthough shapes,\nthey're a little bit different.\n\n99\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.930\nThey're not in line with the text,\nto begin with, and so\n\n100\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.600\nyou an move them anywhere you\nwant from the every start.\n\n101\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.555\nYou can't do that with pictures.\n\n102\n00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:26.861\nWhat you have to do is you have\nto change the word warp in it,\n\n103\n00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.960\nthen you can start moving it around.\n\n104\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.236\nAnd it does make sure that it is anchored\nto wherever the text is when you\n\n105\n00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:33.898\nput it in.\n\n106\n00:05:33.898 --> 00:05:37.510\nSo let's jump over to the add graphics.\n\n107\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.520\nAnd I'll put my cursor\nin front of the d and\n\n108\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.080\ndown the rabbit hole because I want\nto put the shape around there.\n\n109\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.680\nLet's go back and insert that shape.\n\n110\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.900\nAnd we will make our heart again,\nclick hold and drag, let go.\n\n111\n00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.490\nAnd notice it's like floating on top\nof the text and I can move it around.\n\n112\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.040\nAnd the anchor over here on the left hand\nside of where it's connecting itself to,\n\n113\n00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.420\nbecause that's where I\nhave my cursor first,\n\n114\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.240\nif I start moving it around,\nit is moving with the text.\n\n115\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.810\nAnd that is one of the defaults\nthat's on that particular word wrap.\n\n116\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.050\nSo let's come over to the Format tab.\n\n117\n00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.810\nBecause just like our images or\nanything else that we put in our document\n\n118\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.920\nthat is not just regular text,\nwe get our contextual tab.\n\n119\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.510\nThat comes up.\n\n120\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.980\nWe have, over here, with our Wrap Text.\n\n121\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.260\nAnd notice that the default one is,\nIn Front of Text.\n\n122\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.590\nIt's not, In Line with Text,\nlike the images do by default.\n\n123\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.200\nSo that's the one where it\ncan kind of float around.\n\n124\n00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.280\nAnd it doesn't really\naffect the text by default.\n\n125\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.230\nIt does move with text.\n\n126\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.830\nThat's on.\n\n127\n00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.030\nIt's not going to fix itself on\nthe page and not move around.\n\n128\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.460\nThis Move with Text is something that\nwe would probably like to have on.\n\n129\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.946\nThere's reasons why you don't and\ndon't want to.\n\n130\n00:06:54.946 --> 00:06:59.738\nBut what that means is if you start adding\ntext on top of wherever the paragraph that\n\n131\n00:06:59.738 --> 00:07:03.220\nthis is associated with,\nthat's what that anchor means.\n\n132\n00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.916\nIf I put text on top of it, in front of\nit, it's gonna move all that other text\n\n133\n00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:14.190\ndown, and the image, or in this\nsense the shape, will move with it.\n\n134\n00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.190\nSo that's what these two things mean.\n\n135\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.440\nAnd you can turn them on and\nturn them off.\n\n136\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:26.360\nBut if I don't want the shape on top of\nthe text or the text to move around it.\n\n137\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.340\nSo that's where you get\ninto your Square or\n\n138\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.300\nyour Tight type of,\nwhat is this, Word Wrap.\n\n139\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.540\nOr you can of course always have like\nthe Through or the Top and Bottom, so\n\n140\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.230\nit only goes there.\n\n141\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.747\nSo you have different settings for\ndifferent reasons.\n\n142\n00:07:41.747 --> 00:07:46.053\nWe're gonna go with Tight here because\nthat way, if I move it over a little bit,\n\n143\n00:07:46.053 --> 00:07:49.801\nyou can see it's also kind of wrapping\naround the shape of the heart.\n\n144\n00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:55.212\nIt's not square like the square of,\nwell The square.\n\n145\n00:07:55.212 --> 00:07:58.716\n[LAUGH] It's not the square,\nthe square, the square, Ronnie.\n\n146\n00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:00.945\n&gt;&gt; It's not the square of the heart\nis what you meant to say.\n\n147\n00:08:00.945 --> 00:08:01.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Which is weird.\n\n148\n00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.493\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n149\n00:08:02.493 --> 00:08:03.108\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n150\n00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.473\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe have these different options here.\n\n151\n00:08:05.473 --> 00:08:09.849\nAnd then the moving with the text, just to\ndemonstrate that concept because maybe you\n\n152\n00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:15.060\nhaven't watched the images episode, and so\nyou're like, this is all brand new to me.\n\n153\n00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.620\nI'm going to copy all of this,\nlet's go put my cursor back here,\n\n154\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.630\nhit enter, and\nyou can even start seeing it happen.\n\n155\n00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.000\nSee, the heart didn't stay fixed\nin the position of the page.\n\n156\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.649\nIt's fixed in a position of where it's\nanchored to that particular paragraph.\n\n157\n00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:35.084\nSo this paragraph moves,\nthe shape's gonna move too.\n\n158\n00:08:35.084 --> 00:08:37.432\nNow, maybe you didn't want that,\n\n159\n00:08:37.432 --> 00:08:41.435\nmaybe I don't want the heart to\nmove in that location at all.\n\n160\n00:08:41.435 --> 00:08:46.197\nYou have to come back over to the wrap and\nthen choose to say,\n\n161\n00:08:46.197 --> 00:08:48.494\nfixed position on the page.\n\n162\n00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:52.194\nIf I choose that, and\nlet's add some more text,\n\n163\n00:08:52.194 --> 00:08:55.183\nyou see how now the heart will not move.\n\n164\n00:08:55.183 --> 00:08:57.340\nThe heart stays and then it goes.\n\n165\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.060\nYou know what it did move didn't it?\n\n166\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.120\nThis happened the other day.\n\n167\n00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.359\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n&gt;&gt; When we were demonstrating this,\n\n168\n00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:05.726\nit did move and\nthen it kinda just sits back.\n\n169\n00:09:05.726 --> 00:09:09.956\nI really think this is just\nkinda a glitch on my computer.\n\n170\n00:09:09.956 --> 00:09:13.792\nHonestly, I've had a lot glitchy\nthings happening in Word lately.\n\n171\n00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:16.572\nI don't know if it's the week,\nmaybe it's the weather,\n\n172\n00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:18.427\nit has been raining a lot here Ronnie.\n\n173\n00:09:18.427 --> 00:09:21.619\n&gt;&gt; Humidity.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We never know why these\n\n174\n00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:27.070\ncomputers decide to behave a little,\nbadly sometimes.\n\n175\n00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.800\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and chalk it\nup to my computer being a little testy,\n\n176\n00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.680\nword specifically.\n\n177\n00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.570\nAnd so if you turn it on,\nit should fix it.\n\n178\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.560\nIt did for a minute and hey if we do,\nwe can always undo and try it again and\n\n179\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.990\nwe could always switch it back and forth.\n\n180\n00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.520\nSo just throwing it out there for\nyou of knowing how to\n\n181\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.370\nmove the shape once it's in\nthe document in relationship to text.\n\n182\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.200\nLet's go back over to our regular\nblank document because now,\n\n183\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.060\nwe're just gonna learn how to format\nour objects, what can we do with them.\n\n184\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.750\nI can make them bigger, I can make\nthem smaller, I can rotate them,\n\n185\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.950\nI can make them different colors.\n\n186\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.920\nFour part arrows means that you\nare over something that is selected, or\n\n187\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.950\nin a sense that hey I'm over something\nthat I do want to select but\n\n188\n00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.340\nwhen you do select, a shape notice those\nlittle boxes that come up around it with\n\n189\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.260\nthe little dots on the corners and the\nsides, those are your resizing handles.\n\n190\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.600\nI can make something bigger or smaller.\n\n191\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.150\nIf I come up from the bottom and move up,\nyou can see how this is going to,\n\n192\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.210\nwell, it's not gonna\nmaintain the aspect ratio\n\n193\n00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.880\nwhich might be fine because I wanna\nmake the heart a little wider that way.\n\n194\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.400\nCome over to the side,\nmake the heart a little longer or\n\n195\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.540\nyou can come over to the corner and\ndo each of them together.\n\n196\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.850\nThis is different than the images.\n\n197\n00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.420\nIf you did the image it's going\nto maintain the proportions,\n\n198\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.940\nbut when you're working with shapes\nto keep the proportion maintained,\n\n199\n00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.660\nlet me undo that, you have to hold\nthe shift key when grab a corner.\n\n200\n00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.210\nHold that shift key.\n\n201\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:05.050\nSo that's gonna keep it proportionate\nwhen you grab from a corner, and\n\n202\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.810\nresize that particular shape.\n\n203\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:12.650\nAlways letting go of the mouse\nbefore you let go of the shift key.\n\n204\n00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.830\nSo, that's how I can resize the image.\n\n205\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:20.760\nThis little swirly thing on top of this\nselected item is where I can rotate this.\n\n206\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.415\nI can freeform rotate this left or\nright and\n\n207\n00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:28.896\nkind of spin it around maybe go ahead and\nmake it over there, that's cute, perfect.\n\n208\n00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:33.929\nYou could also use your rotate, if I say,\nneeded to rotate it 90 degrees or\n\n209\n00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:39.122\na specific measurement on that Format\nContextual tab in the ribbon over here,\n\n210\n00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:40.554\nthis little button.\n\n211\n00:11:40.554 --> 00:11:45.830\nThis is a Rotate Objects button where\nyou could rotate it 90, or flip it.\n\n212\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.590\nThat's another one, if it's going\nthis way and I want to turn it over.\n\n213\n00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.924\nThe flipping vertical or\nhorizontal can kind of, well, flip it.\n\n214\n00:11:53.924 --> 00:11:57.670\n[LAUGH] So there's some different\noptions here for the rotation.\n\n215\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.675\nHow do I make this pink?\n\n216\n00:12:01.675 --> 00:12:04.620\nBecause we have to have some pink\nhearts Ronnie, and some red and\n\n217\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.140\nsome yellow, right?\n\n218\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.090\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n219\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.055\nYeah, that sounds great.\n\n220\n00:12:08.055 --> 00:12:11.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's do that.\n\n221\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.500\nSo with the heart selected, or the shape,\nI come over here to the shape styles.\n\n222\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.970\nYou have the fill.\n\n223\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.100\nThe fill is the inside color.\n\n224\n00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.820\nThe outline, that's the outline.\n\n225\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:27.010\nIf I refer to this as stroke at any\npoint during this episode because\n\n226\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.020\nin Illustrator, Adobe Illustrator,\nAdobe Illustrator is your vector\n\n227\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:37.500\nediting program as opposed to Photoshop\nwhich is your raster editing program.\n\n228\n00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.730\nHmm, those are some terminologies\nwe haven't heard just yet.\n\n229\n00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.850\nWe know that images are made up of pixels,\nso pixels is also known raster.\n\n230\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.500\nAnd Photoshop will\nmanipulate raster images.\n\n231\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:57.250\nVector images, when you have a vector\ngraphic, there are no pixels in that.\n\n232\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.718\nIt's a different concept for a lot of\npeople cuz, I think, they get pixels.\n\n233\n00:13:01.718 --> 00:13:04.864\nWe know about that in our\ngeneral consciousness.\n\n234\n00:13:04.864 --> 00:13:08.997\nIf you want to say with our phones and\nour TVs, and things like that.\n\n235\n00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.765\nBut a.\n\n236\n00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:14.790\nYes, a vector graphic,\nit's known as paths.\n\n237\n00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.730\nAnd if you have paths you have fills and\nstrokes, insides and outsides.\n\n238\n00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:24.230\nAnd these shapes are vector\ngraphics in a sense.\n\n239\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:30.060\nSo it's along that same Concept, and\nwhen you have paths, you also have points.\n\n240\n00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:36.170\nIf you think about a square,\nwe'll throw in a square.\n\n241\n00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.600\nGrab a square, click, hold, and drag.\n\n242\n00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.525\nSquare had four points on the corners and\n\n243\n00:13:41.525 --> 00:13:44.210\nin-between you have paths that\nconnect them all together.\n\n244\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.220\nSame with a circle,\n\n245\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:51.460\nif I come over to my circle, this holding\nthe Shift key to keep it proportioned.\n\n246\n00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.420\nThat's four points, too,\nbut they're not straight.\n\n247\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.210\nIt's because points can also have curves\nthat come out of them, from those points,\n\n248\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.790\nthat the path travels a certain\nway out of the point,\n\n249\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.990\ncomes into the point a certain way,\nand you make that arch.\n\n250\n00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:13.060\nAnd so that's the whole kind\nof basis of virtual graphics.\n\n251\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.230\nAnd that's what you're\nreally working with.\n\n252\n00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.950\nJust a little back knowledge as to\nthe information that your working with\n\n253\n00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:19.720\nright now.\n\n254\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.730\nAnd how did I get on that whole subject?\n\n255\n00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.482\nBecause I could talk about this for\nhours too, Ronnie, but\n\n256\n00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:25.700\nit's probably because we're\ntalking about outline.\n\n257\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.205\nInside, outside colors,\nlet's go back to that heart, here we go.\n\n258\n00:14:29.205 --> 00:14:31.298\nAll of these are your theme colors, and\n\n259\n00:14:31.298 --> 00:14:34.034\nthere are different degrees\nof your theme colors.\n\n260\n00:14:34.034 --> 00:14:36.129\nThat being said,\nif you have a different theme,\n\n261\n00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:39.158\nyou're going to have different colors\nacross the top to choose from.\n\n262\n00:14:39.158 --> 00:14:41.127\nNow if these aren't\nthe colors that you like,\n\n263\n00:14:41.127 --> 00:14:42.955\nyou could always go into your more colors.\n\n264\n00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:46.298\nAnd I can pick specific colors\non either my standard or\n\n265\n00:14:46.298 --> 00:14:51.275\nmy custom tab to go ahead and match that\nparticular color that I want to have, and\n\n266\n00:14:51.275 --> 00:14:55.830\nif you know about your RGB values,\nyou can go ahead and type them in here.\n\n267\n00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.600\nWe also did talk a little bit more\nabout this with the 'Themes' episode\n\n268\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.070\nin the Word Essentials show.\n\n269\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.920\nClick ok, there's my pink fill.\n\n270\n00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.410\nThere's some other fills\nthat are allowed or\n\n271\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:15.870\nassociated here, we have some,\nsome textures and some gradients now.\n\n272\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.130\nOoh textures, Ronnie, don't we?\n\n273\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.360\nI think we need some\ndead fish in there right?\n\n274\n00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.150\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n275\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.590\n&gt;&gt; This is something that has been around\nin your office pry for a really long time.\n\n276\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.940\nAll these textures.\n\n277\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.010\nThe fossilized fish is one that\nalways makes me chuckle for\n\n278\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.400\nsome reason of why I just really\nwant that particular texture.\n\n279\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.280\nSo maybe the bubbles, that's probably\nthe cutest one, I might say.\n\n280\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.169\nThese are all predefined.\n\n281\n00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:45.795\nThe gradients, those are the ones\nthat are kind of fun to where\n\n282\n00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:50.497\nI could take whatever color I want and I\ncan do like dark to light, light to dark.\n\n283\n00:15:50.497 --> 00:15:52.662\nMaybe have like a darker center.\n\n284\n00:15:52.662 --> 00:15:59.840\nMaybe I don't like these colors in here,\nso you can go into your more gradients.\n\n285\n00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.710\nAnd then it brings up the format shape\ntask pane over here on the right.\n\n286\n00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.670\nAnd actually a couple more options are\nbehind my head, so why don't we go ahead,\n\n287\n00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.530\nand see what those look like.\n\n288\n00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:14.080\nWhen you have gradients you have\ncolor stops along a gradient ramp and\n\n289\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.170\nthat's what we see right here.\n\n290\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:20.547\nHere is a stop that is a dark blue and\na lighter blue, and then a lighter blue.\n\n291\n00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:25.040\nYou also have some preset gradients\nthat are in here, as well.\n\n292\n00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.710\nAnd these work with your themes, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.900\nYou have the type of gradients,\nwhether you want it to be a circular or\n\n294\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.700\nrectangular gradient.\n\n295\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.442\nAnd then the direction of which\nway you want those to go.\n\n296\n00:16:37.442 --> 00:16:43.020\nBut I don't want just blue to black or\nblue to white.\n\n297\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.240\nWhat if I wanted blue to yellow?\n\n298\n00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.645\nThat might be cute.\n\n299\n00:16:46.645 --> 00:16:47.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:48.562\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n301\n00:16:48.562 --> 00:16:51.995\n&gt;&gt; So you have to select the house.\n\n302\n00:16:51.995 --> 00:16:53.175\nI call them houses.\n\n303\n00:16:53.175 --> 00:16:54.845\nThey're upside down houses.\n\n304\n00:16:54.845 --> 00:16:57.105\nBut you click this stop,\nlet's say this one.\n\n305\n00:16:57.105 --> 00:17:00.626\nSo I have the orange around\nthat particular house.\n\n306\n00:17:00.626 --> 00:17:05.698\nI come over here to my color and\nI can pick a color because blue and\n\n307\n00:17:05.698 --> 00:17:09.066\nyellow kind of makes them green in there.\n\n308\n00:17:09.066 --> 00:17:10.169\n&gt;&gt; Green and gray.\n\n309\n00:17:10.169 --> 00:17:11.130\n&gt;&gt; And some gray.\n\n310\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.070\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.100\n&gt;&gt; And so each one of these\n\n312\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:18.120\nstops I can select, and\nI could change my colors.\n\n313\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.680\nI could move the houses around left and\nright.\n\n314\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.603\nMaybe I want to go pink and\nthen to yellow, and then to blue.\n\n315\n00:17:25.603 --> 00:17:26.508\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n316\n00:17:26.508 --> 00:17:29.430\n&gt;&gt; You know me I love my rainbows.\n\n317\n00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.990\nOkay, but we need a little lighter blue,\nit's a little prettier.\n\n318\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.150\nI don't really like the radial gradient,\nso maybe I'll do a linear gradient.\n\n319\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.787\nAnd I will make it go this way.\n\n320\n00:17:38.787 --> 00:17:41.280\nMaybe I'll put the house\na little bit further.\n\n321\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.450\nSo you can see all of this\nhappening in real time.\n\n322\n00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.226\nWhat if I want to throw\nanother color in there?\n\n323\n00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:47.883\nI already, well, no I didn't do it.\n\n324\n00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:49.930\n[LAUGH] Sorry, this is not Photoshop.\n\n325\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.500\nI had to add the gradient\nstop on the ramp.\n\n326\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.550\nSo I click the little plus sign,\nit adds another stop up on the ramp, and\n\n327\n00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.660\nthen I could make some\ndifferent changes from here.\n\n328\n00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.780\nMaybe I wanna make this orange,\nand so on, and so forth.\n\n329\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:10.289\nSo you're gonna have a lot of fun with\ncreating gradients in your shapes,\n\n330\n00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:15.960\nand really playing around with those\ndifferent color stops, moving them around.\n\n331\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.512\nYou can keep on.\n\n332\n00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.740\nThere's a few more options down below,\n\n333\n00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.610\nwhere you have like\nthe position on the ramp.\n\n334\n00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:26.470\nYou have the transparency level\nof that particular stop, and\n\n335\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.240\nthen rotating with the shape,\n\n336\n00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.140\nmeaning that if I rotate the actual shape,\nthe gradient rotates with it.\n\n337\n00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.160\nAs opposed to the gradient\nbeing almost separate\n\n338\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.180\nin its orientation from the shape,\nand so you can do a lot of cool stuff.\n\n339\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.040\nAnd this format shape task pane.\n\n340\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.240\nThat's something that will come up when\nyou get to those more options in anything.\n\n341\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.490\nSo if I look,\nthis is just talking about the fill.\n\n342\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:55.520\nWell, if I collapse this down,\nI could also have the line.\n\n343\n00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.590\nThat's where we get into the outline.\n\n344\n00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.680\nThe same options that are here.\n\n345\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.190\nYou have in here, but even more.\n\n346\n00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.210\nThe format shape paint just takes all of\nthis stuff that we have in our little drop\n\n347\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.060\ndown menus to the extreme.\n\n348\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.650\nWe can do a lot more things with it\nbecause if I wanted to take and make a,\n\n349\n00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.040\nmaybe like a blue outline and\nthen drop this down and change the weight.\n\n350\n00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.240\nThe other thing it's\nall kind of right here.\n\n351\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.040\nI don't have to keep clicking and\ndropping it down.\n\n352\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.780\nClicking and dropping it down.\n\n353\n00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:28.110\nAnd I can go through the different options\nthat I have in my format shape task pane,\n\n354\n00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.680\nso a lot of fun stuff that you can do.\n\n355\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.840\nYou also have a fex that you can add\non your shapes, the next one down.\n\n356\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.210\nThese are things like shadows,\nglows, edges, bevels, 3D rotation.\n\n357\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.270\nLots of fun stuff.\n\n358\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.352\nWe are not going to go through every\nsingle one of these individually.\n\n359\n00:19:44.352 --> 00:19:45.705\nWe would be here forever.\n\n360\n00:19:45.705 --> 00:19:49.050\n[LAUGH] But you can see that\nthey give you the previews on\n\n361\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.540\nwhat that's going to look like.\n\n362\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.830\nSo if I wanted to drop shadow.\n\n363\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.942\nMaybe throw on a a nice\norange glow on this heart.\n\n364\n00:19:55.942 --> 00:19:59.043\n[LAUGH] Yes, it's just beating.\n\n365\n00:19:59.043 --> 00:19:59.739\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n366\n00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:02.620\n&gt;&gt; And we have some bevel up here.\n\n367\n00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.810\nThat's nice.\n\n368\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.040\nMaybe add some 3D rotation if I wanted to.\n\n369\n00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.590\nSo a lot of fun stuff that you\ncan do with formatting your\n\n370\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.795\neffects on your shape to kinda\nmake it look pretty cool.\n\n371\n00:20:14.795 --> 00:20:19.020\nYey, and then this is also\nwithin the task pane over here,\n\n372\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.120\nif I go to the next top level menu,\nI would say?\n\n373\n00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.050\nOptions we'll call them.\n\n374\n00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.990\nIn the format shapes, you can see all\nthe shadows, reflections, glows and\n\n375\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.630\nyou can get really deep into this stuff.\n\n376\n00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.810\nJust like this would be\nin either Illustrator or\n\n377\n00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.820\nPhotoshop, you have a lot of\ndifferent options to have.\n\n378\n00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.920\nNow this format shape pane was already\nhere, cuz I went into the more options,\n\n379\n00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.116\nbut you could always get that task pane\nfrom right clicking on a selected shape.\n\n380\n00:20:49.116 --> 00:20:53.203\nThere's lots of things you can do\nby right-clicking on everything,\n\n381\n00:20:53.203 --> 00:20:57.771\nwhether it's a smart art graphic,\nwhich we'll get into, a table, a chart,\n\n382\n00:20:57.771 --> 00:21:00.690\nwords, you can get into synonyms.\n\n383\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.495\nSo definitely use that right-click it's,\nit's good stuff for you.\n\n384\n00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:08.885\nAnd you can see the format shape is going\nto bring up that particular task pane.\n\n385\n00:21:08.885 --> 00:21:12.323\nAnd some other things we might\nwant to do with our shape.\n\n386\n00:21:12.323 --> 00:21:16.073\nAnd let's say with this square\nto make it a little easier.\n\n387\n00:21:16.073 --> 00:21:18.110\nWe can add text.\n\n388\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:22.250\nNow the thing is with adding\ntext into your shape,\n\n389\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.330\nyou almost want like a button, right?\n\n390\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.180\nYou want to have like add shape.\n\n391\n00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.355\nIt's almost too simple.\n\n392\n00:21:28.355 --> 00:21:32.490\n[LAUGH] It's almost so\nsimple you don't realize that.\n\n393\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.140\nIf I want text in this square\nyou just start typing.\n\n394\n00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:41.925\nWith it selected I just say\nhello Ronnie and that's it.\n\n395\n00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:45.050\nNow once it's text you\ncould select the text.\n\n396\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.860\nYou could come over to your home tab.\n\n397\n00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.470\nYou could make it bigger.\n\n398\n00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.480\nYou could make it a different font,\n\n399\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.810\nI'll throw that curls into you got\nit throw the curls in there, Ronnie.\n\n400\n00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.000\nI can make it a different color.\n\n401\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.650\nI can make it pink.\n\n402\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.210\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n403\n00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.250\n&gt;&gt; Of course, Ronnie.\n\n404\n00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n405\n00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.950\n&gt;&gt; And I can take it and\nchange it however I want.\n\n406\n00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:05.990\nIt's really hard to see.\n\n407\n00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.628\nSo maybe I'll make it white.\n\n408\n00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:08.830\nHow about that?\n\n409\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.460\nIn a blue shape.\n\n410\n00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.908\n&gt;&gt; Don't make color for curls empty.\n\n411\n00:22:11.908 --> 00:22:14.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I can go ahead and\n\n412\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.370\nchange all of those\ndifferent things about it.\n\n413\n00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.580\nIt's like in the shape, just a shape,\n\n414\n00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.260\nI clicked off it,\nthen select the shape again.\n\n415\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.910\nCome back here to format,\nyou also have a whole section in here of\n\n416\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.290\nhow your text is going to work within\nthis shape I have some WordArt styles.\n\n417\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.940\nMaybe I wanna make it with a little drop\nshadow, or that's kinda hard to see.\n\n418\n00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.850\nBut we can see all the different\nways that I might want to\n\n419\n00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.610\nformat my text with a WordArt style.\n\n420\n00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.270\nI also have the direction.\n\n421\n00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.270\nDo I want it up and down?\n\n422\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.930\nDo I want it rotated?\n\n423\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:48.903\nOr I want it horizontal.\n\n424\n00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:53.826\nYou also have just the straight fill\nof the text versus the outline versus\n\n425\n00:22:53.826 --> 00:22:58.506\nall of those different effects that\nyou can do on the text just like you\n\n426\n00:22:58.506 --> 00:23:00.052\ncould with the shape.\n\n427\n00:23:00.052 --> 00:23:03.511\nYou also have the angle or\n\n428\n00:23:03.511 --> 00:23:09.450\nthe vertical justification of your text.\n\n429\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.220\nWhere do you want it to align?\n\n430\n00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.720\nBecause in the middle, that screen,\n\n431\n00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.590\nmaybe you want to put it\ntowards the top or the bottom.\n\n432\n00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:20.170\nAnd some shapes, like a heart,\nthere might not be so\n\n433\n00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.050\nmuch room for a top and a bottom.\n\n434\n00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.400\nIt might not move so much.\n\n435\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.248\nBut in a square, that's somewhere where\nyou can really see the different things\n\n436\n00:23:28.248 --> 00:23:31.320\nand the different places\nwhere this text could go.\n\n437\n00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.135\nAnd then of course you always have more\ntext option you see in this format shape\n\n438\n00:23:35.135 --> 00:23:37.790\ndialog box, this is not a box,\nthis is a tough paint.\n\n439\n00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.380\nWe're doing the shape options\nversus the text options,\n\n440\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.490\nthis was a new thing that we didn't\nsee in the heart because well,\n\n441\n00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.253\nwe didn't have any text added\ninto that particular shape.\n\n442\n00:23:49.253 --> 00:23:52.477\nSo we have all these different\nthings that we can go for.\n\n443\n00:23:52.477 --> 00:23:57.140\nGo really crazy with that\nparticular level of formatting.\n\n444\n00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.413\nSo those are the basics of\nformatting your shapes.\n\n445\n00:24:02.413 --> 00:24:06.709\nI'm gonna scroll down a little bit more\nbecause I wanted to show you a few other\n\n446\n00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:09.910\nshapes, and what they can do for\nus that are kind of fun.\n\n447\n00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.190\nRonnie, I know you like to have fun.\n\n448\n00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.810\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n449\n00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:13.680\n&gt;&gt; You do?\n[LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n451\n00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.187\n&gt;&gt; Yes you do.\n\n452\n00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:18.174\nHow about we make a nice sun?\n\n453\n00:24:18.174 --> 00:24:19.087\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n454\n00:24:19.087 --> 00:24:21.630\n&gt;&gt; Big old sun,\nthe sun's actually out today.\n\n455\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.080\nIt's the first time in quite\nsome time here in rainy Florida.\n\n456\n00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.115\nSo, we click, hold, and\ndrag, make the sun.\n\n457\n00:24:29.115 --> 00:24:31.090\nAnd let's make one more.\n\n458\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.140\nI'm going to make this particular one,\nthis arrow.\n\n459\n00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.440\nSelect it, drag it.\n\n460\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.110\nOn some of your shapes, like the sun or\n\n461\n00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.680\nthe arch,\nyou've got these cool little yellow dots.\n\n462\n00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.330\nNow, they used to be diamonds, they\nused to call them yellow diamonds, but\n\n463\n00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.840\nthey're modifiers of a shape.\n\n464\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.095\nIf I click and hold on them,\nand I drag in.\n\n465\n00:24:56.095 --> 00:25:00.705\nLook at that,\nI can make the rays of the sun thinner and\n\n466\n00:25:00.705 --> 00:25:02.435\nlonger-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n467\n00:25:02.435 --> 00:25:03.790\n&gt;&gt; On this arrow.\n\n468\n00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.210\nLet me kind of zoom in a little bit,\nso you can see a little bit more.\n\n469\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.390\nIt might not be really pronounced\non the screen right now,\n\n470\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.250\nbut there is one right here.\n\n471\n00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:16.118\nAnd the other thing to\nnotice is here versus here.\n\n472\n00:25:16.118 --> 00:25:19.740\nYou see how the arrowhead is just\nlike an arrowhead with no tail.\n\n473\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.620\nThat's where I can start controlling,\nwell, look at all of that.\n\n474\n00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:29.260\nI can make the curve of the arrow\neither be pointy or more curvy.\n\n475\n00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.267\nI have this one down here,\nlet's see what it does.\n\n476\n00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:36.700\nOkay, it makes the thickness of the stem,\nwe'll call it, of the arrow.\n\n477\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.030\nSo I can make that there.\n\n478\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.510\nI don't know what each one of these\ndiamonds, sorry, they're not diamonds,\n\n479\n00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.300\nthey're circles, do.\n\n480\n00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.923\nYou just click on them and drag them.\n\n481\n00:25:43.923 --> 00:25:48.310\nSo that's gonna,\nthat makes the head a little larger.\n\n482\n00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.020\nAnd then this one, okay,\nit makes it longer,\n\n483\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.070\nwe'll call it,\neven though we're kinda turned this way.\n\n484\n00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.010\n&gt;&gt; Wider or longer.\n\n485\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.211\n&gt;&gt; Wider and longer, there we go.\n\n486\n00:25:57.211 --> 00:26:01.959\nSo I could go ahead and modify my arrow\nshape to be whatever I want because I have\n\n487\n00:26:01.959 --> 00:26:05.860\nall these different modifiers along it,\nnot all of shapes do.\n\n488\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.810\nWe did not see that on the circle,\nwe didn't see it on the square,\n\n489\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.720\nbut the sun, like the smiley face,\nyou can make it frown.\n\n490\n00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.412\nWe can do, like the moon, you can make the\narch of the moon to where it's like just\n\n491\n00:26:18.412 --> 00:26:20.413\na little sliver, or a wider moon.\n\n492\n00:26:20.413 --> 00:26:22.962\nSo we have those different options there.\n\n493\n00:26:22.962 --> 00:26:27.592\nThen the last one I wanted to show\nyou in this episode was how you\n\n494\n00:26:27.592 --> 00:26:29.831\ncould edit points on a shape.\n\n495\n00:26:29.831 --> 00:26:33.917\nLet's take the sun here,\nI'll make it a little thicker.\n\n496\n00:26:33.917 --> 00:26:39.295\nSo have this, but I wanna just have\nthe top ray of the sun be longer,\n\n497\n00:26:39.295 --> 00:26:42.960\nand maybe the two sides\nto be that way as well.\n\n498\n00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.795\nYou have a button on the Format\ntab [LAUGH] to where you\n\n499\n00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:52.291\ncan edit the points or edit the shape.\n\n500\n00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:56.303\nWhen you edit the shape,\nit's going into that point level of, well,\n\n501\n00:26:56.303 --> 00:26:59.440\nthat's changing the shape,\nwe don't wanna do that.\n\n502\n00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.992\nBut that's a quick way if\nyou wanted to make this.\n\n503\n00:27:00.992 --> 00:27:03.899\nCuz if you had it all formatted,\nmaybe you had it pink, and rotated, and\n\n504\n00:27:03.899 --> 00:27:06.374\nyou wanted to not be a square,\nyou wanted it to be a circle now,\n\n505\n00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:08.340\nthat's where you go to change shape.\n\n506\n00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.370\nBut the edit points is where\nI was wanting to get into.\n\n507\n00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.400\nAnd this is on that, see, to me,\n\n508\n00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.262\nthis is where I'm at home\nof editing vector graphics.\n\n509\n00:27:15.262 --> 00:27:19.090\nI wanna get to the point\nlevel to move things around.\n\n510\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:24.520\nI can move a single point different\nthan the whole shape or the whole path.\n\n511\n00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.000\nSo, if I hover over it, and you get this\nkind of square with four little arrows on\n\n512\n00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.076\nit, and I click on this, and I drag.\n\n513\n00:27:32.076 --> 00:27:38.460\nDo you see how I can pull that one\npoint up more than the other points?\n\n514\n00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:44.240\nSo maybe I can kinda pull this one out,\npull this one out, and pull this one out.\n\n515\n00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:50.010\nSo I'm modifying the shape\nby getting into the points.\n\n516\n00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.738\nThat's kinda fun.\n\n517\n00:27:50.738 --> 00:27:55.344\nBut if, again, on shapes that have curves,\n\n518\n00:27:55.344 --> 00:28:00.557\nthis is where you're gonna\nkinda get a crush course\n\n519\n00:28:00.557 --> 00:28:05.670\ninto how to edit bezier handles,\nbezier points.\n\n520\n00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.550\nThe whole thing I was telling\nyou about with vector graphics,\n\n521\n00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:14.712\nthe whole Idea was something from a French\nMathematician named somebody Bezier.\n\n522\n00:28:14.712 --> 00:28:17.836\n[LAUGH] I can't remember his first name,\nand\n\n523\n00:28:17.836 --> 00:28:21.475\nhe kind of coined this whole idea,\nand went for it.\n\n524\n00:28:21.475 --> 00:28:25.415\nIt's all a bunch of math, and\ncurves, and points, and stuff.\n\n525\n00:28:25.415 --> 00:28:28.114\n[LAUGH] Well,\nI'm gonna come back into edit points.\n\n526\n00:28:28.114 --> 00:28:31.473\nCuz if I click on this point,\nand I drag it out, you see these,\n\n527\n00:28:31.473 --> 00:28:33.970\nthey're almost like, I call them seesaws.\n\n528\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.080\nAnd if I take this end, and I seesaw it,\n\n529\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.740\nsee how the other part is\ngoing to seesaw as well.\n\n530\n00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.640\nSo you can move the point itself,\nyou could grab the seesaw,\n\n531\n00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.050\nand then you can also pull it out more.\n\n532\n00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:53.110\nAnd that's where, remember I was telling\nyou with vector graphics how they come in\n\n533\n00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.980\nfrom one direction.\n\n534\n00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.200\nThey travel through a point one way and\nthey come in to another point.\n\n535\n00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:04.420\nThat's where, if you look at this,\nit's coming through the point this way,\n\n536\n00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.940\nand then traveling into the point,\nbut it comes out from, oops,\n\n537\n00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.520\nI just clicked one too many, from here.\n\n538\n00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.580\nSo that's where it kinda gets\nthat arch of traveling in and\n\n539\n00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.910\nout of these points, and how you\nchange the angle of how it comes in.\n\n540\n00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:27.491\nThat's where you get your S curves,\nor your bends, any type of curves.\n\n541\n00:29:27.491 --> 00:29:30.616\nIt doesn't have to be an S curve,\nit could be a whatever type of curve.\n\n542\n00:29:30.616 --> 00:29:36.097\nBut that's what you will experience when\nyou're editing points on shapes that\n\n543\n00:29:36.097 --> 00:29:42.510\nhave curves rather than straight points\nlike a rectangle or the rays of the sun.\n\n544\n00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.390\nThat gives you a little\nbit more options for\n\n545\n00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:48.120\nwhat you can do to make\nyour own custom shapes.\n\n546\n00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.890\nYou can make some blobs,\nlike I just made on the screen.\n\n547\n00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:56.249\nAnd so, that's how we can get the shapes\nin, that's how we can format them,\n\n548\n00:29:56.249 --> 00:30:00.157\nadd text, get into the format shape\ntask pane, and edit the points.\n\n549\n00:30:00.157 --> 00:30:05.740\nSo those were my main points that I wanted\nto make for you guys here in this episode.\n\n550\n00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.730\nAnd we'll have another episode where\nwe're gonna talk about multiple shapes,\n\n551\n00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.760\nwhere we'll get into working\nwith a couple of these.\n\n552\n00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.740\nWe'll talk about groups and\nsome different things like that.\n\n553\n00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.380\nSo, stick around.\n\n554\n00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.135\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, well,\nthank you again for helping us out.\n\n555\n00:30:20.135 --> 00:30:23.757\nAnd that last one on editing those\npoints that was really neat.\n\n556\n00:30:23.757 --> 00:30:26.528\nI didn't know that you could\ntake just a basic shape, and\n\n557\n00:30:26.528 --> 00:30:29.170\nkind of create the shape\nthat you want instead.\n\n558\n00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.900\nBut there's a lot more to come, of course.\n\n559\n00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.200\nBut those are for other episodes as well.\n\n560\n00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.418\nSo, signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n561\n00:30:37.418 --> 00:30:38.495\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n562\n00:30:38.495 --> 00:30:44.170\n&gt;&gt; Stay

[LAUGH] Yes, I like master juggler.\n\n13\n00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.050\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n14\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.310\n&gt;&gt; Because we are gonna be\njuggling multiple shades.\n\n15\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.610\nAnd then we're gonna throw icons in there\nwhich are different in shapes but they're\n\n16\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.790\nkinda just like shapes but my favorite\nsaying they're the same but different.\n\n17\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.652\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so they're like the chainsaw\nof juggling in shapes, aren't they?\n\n18\n00:00:54.652 --> 00:00:56.301\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah they're just,\n\n19\n00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:58.217\nthey're shapes to the next level.\n\n20\n00:00:58.217 --> 00:00:59.722\nThey're shapes 2.0.\n\n21\n00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:00.433\nHow about that?\n\n22\n00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:02.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I guess they're like juggling\n\n23\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.640\nchain saws that's kinda the last\nthing that you really want to juggle.\n\n24\n00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.378\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably.\n\n25\n00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:10.533\n[LAUGH] We're gonna get in to how\nI can take a couple shapes and\n\n26\n00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.955\nmake one big shape.\n\n27\n00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:14.670\nWe're going to talk about groups and\nun-grouping and\n\n28\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.640\nwhen you might want to do that.\n\n29\n00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.580\nWe'll also talk about,\n\n30\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.290\nif we're going to have multiple shapes,\nhow do I select them?\n\n31\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.480\nHow do I kind of manipulate multiple\nshapes to create something.\n\n32\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.325\nI think well, I'm already thinking about,\nmaybe we'll put like a heart inside\n\n33\n00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:33.262\nthe sun, and\nput a little cloud over to the side.\n\n34\n00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:34.164\nI don't know.\n\n35\n00:01:34.164 --> 00:01:36.850\nRonnie we're just gonna have fun and\njust build it.\n\n36\n00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.065\nSo let's just go.\n\n37\n00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a great idea Vonne.\n\n38\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.030\nSo when we start dealing\nwith multiple shapes, what\n\n39\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.690\nare the elements we've really got to think\nabout when we start putting it together?\n\n40\n00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.000\nA lot of it's gonna be of course\nour own personal preference, but\n\n41\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.070\nwhat else do we need to know?\n\n42\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.684\n&gt;&gt; We need to know about stacking order.\n\n43\n00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:55.510\nStacking order and how to select them.\n\n44\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.920\nSo why don't I show you?\n\n45\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.221\nLet's jump on down into\nour blank document.\n\n46\n00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:02.921\nAnd I do have our other\ndocument down here,\n\n47\n00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:08.380\nthe ad graphics that's been closed and\nnot saved, so we have it restart it again.\n\n48\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.891\nBecause if I'm gonna make like\na more complex type of object,\n\n49\n00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:16.467\nit might be good to do it\nin a blank document here.\n\n50\n00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:17.809\nIt's almost like we're\ngoing to the drawing board.\n\n51\n00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.040\nWe're gonna go ahead and create it.\n\n52\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.187\nIt's like arts and crafts.\n\n53\n00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:25.100\nWe're gonna glue it all together and\nthen put it over somewhere else.\n\n54\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.260\nThat's kind of what I would suggest doing.\n\n55\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.460\nBuild it up, group it, get to where you\nlike it, move it on over, just copy and\n\n56\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.650\npaste it into your Word document and\ndo all of the different word wraps and\n\n57\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.420\npositionings and\nall those different things we've talked\n\n58\n00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.360\nabout in the shapes adding format episode.\n\n59\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.731\nI need to put some shapes in first though.\n\n60\n00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:48.297\nLet's get with that heart.\n\n61\n00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:51.027\nFirst, click, hold, drag.\n\n62\n00:02:51.027 --> 00:02:54.780\nI don't wanna really hold the Shift key so\nI want it a little bit wider.\n\n63\n00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.500\nAnd we will make it pink.\n\n64\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.950\nAnd I don't want an outline on this one.\n\n65\n00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.940\nI just don't need to have one.\n\n66\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.880\nSo if I don't want one,\nyou just turn it off, and\n\n67\n00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.340\nthen I just have a single pink heart.\n\n68\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.127\nI will insert another shape.\n\n69\n00:03:09.127 --> 00:03:10.754\nI will come over here to the sun.\n\n70\n00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:14.214\nIt's in the most recently used because\nwe had that just a little while ago.\n\n71\n00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:16.290\nAnd I haven't even closed Word or\nanything.\n\n72\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.962\nI'm just continuing on.\n\n73\n00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:19.340\nSo that's why it's in there.\n\n74\n00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.130\nIf it's not you can always just\nfind it down in your basic shapes.\n\n75\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.000\nClick, hold, and drag.\n\n76\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.860\nWe'll make the sun.\n\n77\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.330\nAnd we'll make that, we'll make it yellow.\n\n78\n00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.580\nI like that yellow, super yellow.\n\n79\n00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.550\nAnd we will make it with no outline and\nmaybe just for fun,\n\n80\n00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.292\nI'm feeling a little saucy right now.\n\n81\n00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:43.040\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nadd a star, need a star.\n\n82\n00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.496\nAll right, there we go, now I have\nsome of my favorite elements here.\n\n83\n00:03:46.496 --> 00:03:48.876\nI have suns and hearts and stars,\n\n84\n00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:53.321\nthe only thing that's missing Ronnie,\n&gt;&gt; Is the little leprechaun on the box?\n\n85\n00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:58.077\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That might be one,\nI was thinking of bunnies,\n\n86\n00:03:58.077 --> 00:04:00.005\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bunnies.\n\n87\n00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.437\n&gt;&gt; But I see where you're\ngoing with the purple moons,\n\n88\n00:04:03.437 --> 00:04:06.636\npink clovers, or something-\n&gt;&gt; I don't even remember.\n\n89\n00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:11.556\n&gt;&gt; I think I just said all the wrong\nshapes and the colors that are associated\n\n90\n00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:13.232\nwith it, the-\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna get sued.\n\n91\n00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:14.711\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, but\n\n92\n00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:16.826\nthe commercial is playing\nin my head right now.\n\n93\n00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:19.029\nSaturday morning cartoons, all my life.\n\n94\n00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.571\n[LAUGH] So, I have these different pieces.\n\n95\n00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:28.980\nNow how they stack,\nit all depends on which one I drew first.\n\n96\n00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.860\nIf I take my star, that was the last\none I drew, and I move it over,\n\n97\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.780\nyou see how it's over the star.\n\n98\n00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.390\nIf I move it over here, it's over the sun.\n\n99\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.506\nIf I take the sun, and\nI move it here, do you see,\n\n100\n00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:48.145\nhow it's going to go behind the star,\nbut it's gonna be over the heart.\n\n101\n00:04:48.145 --> 00:04:53.890\nBecause I drew heart, then sun, [LAUGH].\n\n102\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.450\nMy brain was like star,\nI'm like nope, that's the last one.\n\n103\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.920\nAnd then the star, so\nthat's why I have the one,\n\n104\n00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.450\ntwo, three in my stacking order.\n\n105\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.711\nBut the thing is I'm going to want\nto have my heart on top of the sun.\n\n106\n00:05:09.711 --> 00:05:14.031\nSo that's where we get into bring\nto front or bring forward, and\n\n107\n00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:17.880\nthen the other part would be send back,\nsend backwards.\n\n108\n00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.540\nIt's all about the levels that I want to\ngo, and where am I and what I want to do.\n\n109\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.225\nIn this scenario,\nI want the heart to come front.\n\n110\n00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:29.600\n[LAUGH] I'm getting my\nshapes confused right now.\n\n111\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.010\n[LAUGH] Feel like I'm\nback in kindergarten.\n\n112\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.830\nSo I'm gonna come over\nhere to my Format tab.\n\n113\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.300\nI'm gonna go to Bring Front,\nBring Forward.\n\n114\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.980\nWhich is the difference?\n\n115\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.710\nIt all depends on how\nmany levels you have.\n\n116\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.860\nIf I had six items, and\nI wanted the fourth one to come\n\n117\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.500\nall the way up to the front,\nto be the toppest top.\n\n118\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.210\nThat's what I say.\n\n119\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.140\n&gt;&gt; The toppest top.\n\n120\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.120\n&gt;&gt; Then that would be bring front.\n\n121\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.170\nIf it was forward, if I wanted\nelement five to go to element four and\n\n122\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.030\nthen one, two, three would be on top\nof than then that would be forward.\n\n123\n00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.689\nSo it's one step or all the way.\n\n124\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.268\nI'll go bring to front,\nand I'll take it here and\n\n125\n00:06:10.268 --> 00:06:13.439\nI'll put this heart on top of the sun.\n\n126\n00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.635\nBut now I just realize\nthat my star is where?\n\n127\n00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:16.585\n&gt;&gt; Behind the heart.\n\n128\n00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:19.144\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I told the heart\nto come to the front so\n\n129\n00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:20.551\nit went in front of the star.\n\n130\n00:06:20.551 --> 00:06:23.563\nNow sometimes it's harder\nto visualize this.\n\n131\n00:06:23.563 --> 00:06:28.460\nAnd maybe I don't even remember\nwhat order I drew these shapes that\n\n132\n00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.146\nI can't even say their\nnames properly right now.\n\n133\n00:06:32.146 --> 00:06:34.507\nYou have this really cool\nthing called a selection pane.\n\n134\n00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:37.100\nA selection pane,\nthis is in a lot of your programs.\n\n135\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.850\nThis is really in PowerPoint as well.\n\n136\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.256\nSo you can see that I'm seeking,\nI can seeking?\n\n137\n00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:46.875\nI'm seeking where my stuffs is,\n[LAUGH] and\n\n138\n00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:50.906\nI got heart is the top,\nstar, and then the sun.\n\n139\n00:06:50.906 --> 00:06:54.927\nBut I love how you can see the stacking\norder and the other thing of what\n\n140\n00:06:54.927 --> 00:06:59.166\nthe selection pane does is it allows\nyou to select that particular item.\n\n141\n00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:03.440\nThe other kind of neat stuff is that\nit will allow you to turn on and\n\n142\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.794\noff, like layers.\n\n143\n00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:08.848\nIf you've ever worked in a program that\nworks with layers, this is very similar to\n\n144\n00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:12.697\nlike show and hide the visibilities,\nI can turn it off, I didn't delete it.\n\n145\n00:07:12.697 --> 00:07:14.766\nI just hid it for a little bit.\n\n146\n00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:16.320\nSo I can do that.\n\n147\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.610\nI could take it and\nalso change the stacking order from here.\n\n148\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.172\nSo now that it's in a list format,\nI could take the star and\n\n149\n00:07:23.172 --> 00:07:27.122\ndrag it up, watching that line\nover here on the selection pane.\n\n150\n00:07:27.122 --> 00:07:29.365\nSo now the star is on top.\n\n151\n00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.763\nSo there we go.\n\n152\n00:07:30.763 --> 00:07:31.443\nPerfect.\n\n153\n00:07:31.443 --> 00:07:33.710\nBut I need the heart to\nbe a little smaller.\n\n154\n00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.303\nSo I will hold the Shift key\nin this time to grab a corner,\n\n155\n00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:40.292\nmake that a little smaller and\nput that there.\n\n156\n00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:44.220\nAnd I'll take my star and\nI'll make that a little bit smaller and\n\n157\n00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.890\nI can kinda start moving this around.\n\n158\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.330\nBut, I'm gonna to move these all for\na minute.\n\n159\n00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.779\nI don't know, I want to get this\nperfectly aligned right now.\n\n160\n00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:56.442\nAnd maybe I'm look at all,\nI really want to select them all and\n\n161\n00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:57.786\nmake them all bigger.\n\n162\n00:07:57.786 --> 00:08:00.164\nSo you can see cuz I\nfeel it's a little small.\n\n163\n00:08:00.164 --> 00:08:01.146\nRight now.\n\n164\n00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:03.804\nHow do you select multiple items?\n\n165\n00:08:03.804 --> 00:08:05.421\nAnd if you select multiple items,\n\n166\n00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:08.932\nthen you could do things like format\nthem all at the same time, align them,\n\n167\n00:08:08.932 --> 00:08:12.353\nwhich is where I wanna go to make sure\nthey're right on top of each other.\n\n168\n00:08:12.353 --> 00:08:14.780\nAnd all those different,\nyou could move them all together.\n\n169\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.720\nDo you know what key you're gonna\nhold to select multiple items there,\n\n170\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.910\nRonnie, do you remember?\n\n171\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.660\n&gt;&gt; Shift.\n\n172\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.390\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n173\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.100\n[LAUGH] So I hold this Shift key.\n\n174\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.972\nThen it's like, that Shift comes in\nplay a lot when we're doing all of this.\n\n175\n00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:28.134\nWe've held it to maintain proportions and\n\n176\n00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:30.602\nnow we're holding it to\nselect multiple items.\n\n177\n00:08:30.602 --> 00:08:35.481\nAnd I know I've selected multiple items\ncuz I can see those bars, not those bars,\n\n178\n00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.550\nthose dots around those different items.\n\n179\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:43.300\nGetting that four pointed arrows side\nselecting the sun, now I've got them all.\n\n180\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.330\nI can grab one, hold the Shift key and\n\n181\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.180\nnow see how I'm making them\nall bigger at the same time.\n\n182\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.610\nProportionate to each other.\n\n183\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.220\nWhen I have them all selected,\nI could use my aligning because I wanna\n\n184\n00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.600\nmake sure they're all straight up and\ndown and maybe all straight this way.\n\n185\n00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.150\nThat would be aligning the what\nI call center centers.\n\n186\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.530\nCenter align this way,\ncenter align that way.\n\n187\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.769\nNow, this could be where maybe\nyou have seven, no not seven,\n\n188\n00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:13.400\nprobably we have three [LAUGH].\n\n189\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.321\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Three squares along the side and\n\n190\n00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:18.270\nyou wanna make sure they're\nperfectly aligned across.\n\n191\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.780\nWell then that way, you would select\nthem and tell them to line this way.\n\n192\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.320\nSo they don't always have both\nhorizontally and vertically aligned.\n\n193\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.590\nIt just depends on which way you wanna go.\n\n194\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:32.090\nSo I will take the align and\nI will align the centers.\n\n195\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.020\nSo now I know all the centers\nare going to be aligned.\n\n196\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.953\nThat's the selection pane,\nthat's the wrong button.\n\n197\n00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:39.891\n[LAUGH] And\nthen I can align the middles and\n\n198\n00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:43.368\nit's nice that they shows the graphics\nwhere, do you want them across or\n\n199\n00:09:43.368 --> 00:09:46.347\ndo you want them down, so\nyou can tell which way you are going.\n\n200\n00:09:46.347 --> 00:09:49.780\nAnd align the middles and\nthen there we go, we have the middles and\n\n201\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.060\nthat's a perfectly aligned object.\n\n202\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.279\nI'm gonna just select this sun,\n\n203\n00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:58.090\nI'm going to- I forgot one\nother little cute shortcut.\n\n204\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.951\nHere, let me undo it.\n\n205\n00:09:59.951 --> 00:10:03.395\nIf I held my Shift key, you see how\nit's going to the opposite corner.\n\n206\n00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:08.335\nDid you all see that it wasn't going\nfrom the corner the last time I did it,\n\n207\n00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:12.334\nit's doing this, wait,\nhold on, let's try that again.\n\n208\n00:10:12.334 --> 00:10:14.060\nThere.\nYou see that?\n\n209\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.670\nIt's going from the center that's\nbecause I'm holding Shift+Ctrl.\n\n210\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.268\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n280\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.330\nyou had each shape that made one leaf.\n\n281\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.480\nAnd then you had leaves\nthat were all over.\n\n282\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.320\nAnd it was a pattern on the background.\n\n283\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.320\nI'm like, that's that's pretty intense.\n\n284\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.640\nSo you can go that level.\n\n285\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:23.380\nThere's nothing wrong with it but\nthe limitation, I'm sure it's somewhere.\n\n286\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.131\n&gt;&gt;

Of course.\n\n394\n00:19:39.639 --> 00:19:44.218\n&gt;&gt; So, I go and click the bunny and\nyou click insert and it puts this in.\n\n395\n00:19:44.218 --> 00:19:44.881\n&gt;&gt; A bunny.\n\n396\n00:19:44.881 --> 00:19:46.553\n&gt;&gt; It does act like a graphic or\n\n397\n00:19:46.553 --> 00:19:50.500\na photograph in the sense that it\nwill be in-line with the text.\n\n398\n00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.976\nYou still have all the same options\nthat you did before with your wrap and\n\n399\n00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:56.410\nso on and so forth.\n\n400\n00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:02.070\nYou can make it bigger by clicking\nthe corner, holding the shift key,\n\n401\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:07.250\nmaking sure it's proportionate,\nchanging the fill, it's gotta be pink.\n\n402\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.350\nAnd changing the outline.\n\n403\n00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.493\nAnd notice that here,\nthis is where any type of cutout,\n\n404\n00:20:13.493 --> 00:20:16.235\nthe outline goes all the way in that.\n\n405\n00:20:16.235 --> 00:20:19.384\nAnd you can still put on your shadows and\nyour bevels and\n\n406\n00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.910\nall the same options that you can do.\n\n407\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.020\nThat bevel looks a little strange,\nnow doesn't it?\n\n408\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:24.845\nOkay, we'll undo that.\n\n409\n00:20:24.845 --> 00:20:27.200\n[LAUGH] And I will just keep it like this.\n\n410\n00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.080\nThat's, I mean it's all the same stuff.\n\n411\n00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.660\nIt's just more options that you have for\ncool little shapes,\n\n412\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.136\nshapes 2.0, that are icons.\n\n413\n00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.869\nAnd you can still group\nit with other items.\n\n414\n00:20:40.869 --> 00:20:44.745\nThe other thing with a group\nis we're just using shapes,\n\n415\n00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:49.900\nif I wanted to insert a picture,\nI'm almost scared cuz it's gonna crash.\n\n416\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.563\nSorry, I've been having a little issue for\nsome reason.\n\n417\n00:20:52.563 --> 00:20:57.140\nI don't know what it is,\nif I insert a picture, it crashes Word.\n\n418\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.277\nThere was just a recent update, and I\nthink it was just kind of getting a little\n\n419\n00:21:02.277 --> 00:21:04.395\nwonky, and sometimes when you do updates.\n\n420\n00:21:04.395 --> 00:21:05.974\n&gt;&gt; You had to do it.\n\n421\n00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:06.613\n&gt;&gt; Right, Ronnie?\n\n422\n00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:08.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Then they have to issue a patch for it,\n\n423\n00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:11.431\nand then everything will,\nit will be fixed, okay?\n\n424\n00:21:11.431 --> 00:21:12.394\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n425\n00:21:12.394 --> 00:21:13.753\n&gt;&gt; It's not doing the same\nthing in PowerPoint.\n\n426\n00:21:13.753 --> 00:21:15.436\nWe figured that out today.\n\n427\n00:21:15.436 --> 00:21:17.888\nWe've been troubleshooting all day long.\n\n428\n00:21:17.888 --> 00:21:21.370\nI just wanted to let you know,\nthat if you had a photograph in your file,\n\n429\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.890\nand you want to put a shape on top,\nlike a little star off to the side,\n\n430\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.530\nyou can group shapes with images.\n\n431\n00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.020\nIt doesn't have to be shapes with shapes.\n\n432\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.310\nThey can all kind of work together\ncuz they're all graphical elements.\n\n433\n00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.526\nIf you wanted to put a cute little icon\nsomewhere in the bottom right-hand corner\n\n434\n00:21:39.526 --> 00:21:43.443\nof your picture, cuz you want to put\nalmost like a stamp on it or something.\n\n435\n00:21:43.443 --> 00:21:45.405\nI mean you can do that group it and\n\n436\n00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:49.790\nmove it around the way you're doing\nwith any of these different items.\n\n437\n00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.480\nSo just throwing that out there.\n\n438\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.420\nDon't want you to think it's separate.\n\n439\n00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:59.460\nSo icons, shapes, all the different things\nwe can do with our vector-like images or\n\n440\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.750\nvector-like graphics,\nwe'll call them, in Word.\n\n441\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.130\nAnd so you can have some fun and\ngussy up your document.\n\n442\n00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, that's a great place\nfor us to actually think about some of\n\n443\n00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.380\nthe different things that we\ncan do with those shapes.\n\n444\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.390\nStacking those shapes,\n\n445\n00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.990\nmaking sure that they appear in the proper\norder in the way we want them to.\n\n446\n00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.990\nIt really does help,\n\n447\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.220\nespecially when we start working with\nmultiple shapes in those documents.\n\n448\n00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.800\nThey're gonna get updated by Microsoft,\nso you'll not see just a limited bit of\n\n449\n00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.880\nicons, you'll probably see\nthem change over time as well.\n\n450\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.000\nBut we're going to actually see more,\nbut not in this episode.\n\n451\n00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.060\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n452\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.180\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.390\n&gt;&gt; If you watched the Word essential show,\n\n38\n00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.915\nwe talked about that in a dinner\nconversation I would have my father all\n\n39\n00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.603\nthe time,\nhe'd always bring words to the table, and\n\n40\n00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:46.390\nostentatious and-\n&gt;&gt; and\n\n41\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.865\ngussy\n&gt;&gt; Gussy and ossiferous.\n\n42\n00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:52.285\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, sure.\n\n43\n00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:55.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So those are the one I, for\nsome reason, remember throughout my,\n\n44\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.183\nit was most in my high school years,\nbut anyway, I digress yet again.\n\n45\n00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:00.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's again,\n\n46\n00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:03.910\njust art that's going to give us\njust a little bit of a leg up and\n\n47\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.905\nthe nice thing is, it does it all for us.\n\n48\n00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:10.510\nIn the other ones we did go ahead and\ncreate shapes and then we we grouped more\n\n49\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.440\ntogether, and and did things like that,\nbut here it's all grouped shapes.\n\n50\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.120\nSo we can still go ahead and\nformat them the same way that we did\n\n51\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.120\nformatting our shapes individually,\nbut its all one entity and\n\n52\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.060\nI can move it around, and I can add and\nremove shapes really easily.\n\n53\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.858\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, the idea of the Smart Art\nreally sounds like there's a purpose\n\n54\n00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:34.590\nbehind it, at least from the examples\nthat your talking about.\n\n55\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.081\nThe idea is not only to have words\navailable, but to actually even show\n\n56\n00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:41.632\na graphic that might show\nthe interrelationship between these items,\n\n57\n00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:45.536\nas well as actually just saying look if we\nneed to change we can change it without\n\n58\n00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:47.094\nhaving to change everything.\n\n59\n00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:50.860\nSo even in just what we were talking about\nin a previous episode about stacking,\n\n60\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.568\nwe really don't have to worry about that\ntoo much because it really does help us\n\n61\n00:02:54.568 --> 00:02:55.370\nout in that way.\n\n62\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.069\nSo Vonne take us to it.\n\n63\n00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes definitely.\n\n64\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.492\nLet's go ahead and\nget into the Smart Art gallery,\n\n65\n00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:04.696\nbecause I like how you said how it can\nrepresent relationships or hierarchies.\n\n66\n00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:08.030\nWhat if we needed to go ahead and\nput an org chart of your organization?\n\n67\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.130\nThat's a big thing that a lot\nof companies need to show.\n\n68\n00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.962\nWell that's part of the Smart Art gallery.\n\n69\n00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:14.660\nA cycle.\n\n70\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.690\nWhat is the things that we do everyday?\n\n71\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.845\nWe get up, we brush our teeth, we eat\nbreakfast, we go to work, we come home and\n\n72\n00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:22.655\nthen we do it all over again [LAUGH].\n\n73\n00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:25.600\nThat would be a cycle and processes.\n\n74\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.930\nSo I just want a blank document to\nget us familiar with everything.\n\n75\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.963\nIt's in our Insert tab and\nit's right in our Illustrations group,\n\n76\n00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:37.916\nall these graphical elements that we've\nbeen going over in this particular show,\n\n77\n00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.841\nof our Word 2016 Advanced.\n\n78\n00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:45.741\nWe're moving on to Smart Art and\nit visually communicates information.\n\n79\n00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:50.176\nClicking on it,\nwe have different galleries of Smart Art.\n\n80\n00:03:50.176 --> 00:03:53.568\nWe have things that represent lists,\nand that was what I was talking about,\n\n81\n00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:57.240\nour different departments within our\ncompany, and how we want it to look.\n\n82\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.621\nThe nice thing is it gives you a preview\nover on the right-hand side and\n\n83\n00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:06.834\nit's gonna give you a little description\nof what this is, just a basic block list.\n\n84\n00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:10.110\nBut maybe you have lists\nthat have multiple levels,\n\n85\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.089\nlike we have our developer's department,\nand\n\n86\n00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:17.201\nthen maybe we wanna list the people\nthat are in the developer's.\n\n87\n00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.861\nWe have switchers, and\nwe wanna list all of our switchers, and\n\n88\n00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.193\nour famous one,-\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But yes, you're correct,\n\n12\n00:00:32.197 --> 00:00:35.080\nwe are not talking about\na table that we put things on.\n\n13\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.094\nWe are talking about a table that we put\ninformation into and how it is organized.\n\n14\n00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:45.700\nNow, there's a lot to cover in tables,\nand that's why I've broken this up into\n\n15\n00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.720\na couple episodes,\ntrying to cram it all into one.\n\n16\n00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.030\nI really wanna kinda dive into,\nhey, let's just introduce tables,\n\n17\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.116\nlet's get familiar with the terminology.\n\n18\n00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.407\nWhat we can do, how to select things,\n\n19\n00:00:56.407 --> 00:00:59.922\nbecause that's kind of a big\ndeal in working with tables.\n\n20\n00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:03.370\nIs making sure you know where you're\nat before you start doing stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.800\nAnd then we'll get into formatting,\nand then we'll get into layout, and\n\n22\n00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.570\nwe'll get into making it pretty.\n\n23\n00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.323\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n24\n00:01:09.323 --> 00:01:12.827\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I have a PowerPoint\npresentation ready to go,\n\n25\n00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:16.970\nthat I actually used in my PowerPoint\nshow, and it's parts of a table.\n\n26\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.000\nSo, when you have a table,\na table is comprised of rows and columns.\n\n27\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.260\nWhere rows and\ncolumns intersect is known as a cell.\n\n28\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.623\nSo you have cells where you\nput your information into.\n\n29\n00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:31.513\nThat's where you put in your text,\nand then you can format,\n\n30\n00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:33.620\nand do all those wonderful things.\n\n31\n00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.530\nNow, how many rows and\ncolumns do you want?\n\n32\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.370\nThat's really up to you, and\nwhat you need the information to say.\n\n33\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.260\nNow a few things that we have here\nspecifically, is that this top cell.\n\n34\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.190\nThis goes all the way across the three\ncolumns that we have in this table,\n\n35\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.750\nthis is known as a merged cell.\n\n36\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.860\nYou're taking multiple cells, merging\nthem together to create one large cell.\n\n37\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.500\nNow it doesn't have to be at the top,\nit could be anywhere,\n\n38\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.298\ndoesn't have to be\nacross the entire table.\n\n39\n00:02:01.298 --> 00:02:04.680\nNo, you could merge two\ncells in two columns, or\n\n40\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.400\nyou can merge two cells in two rows.\n\n41\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.690\nDoesn't matter the amount or the size,\n\n42\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.250\nit just matters how much you want to\nmake one big cell out of these things.\n\n43\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.960\nSo that would be a merged cell.\n\n44\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.400\nThen you could go ahead and\ngo crazy with your table layout,\n\n45\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.430\nyou can change things like the row height,\nthe column width.\n\n46\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.740\nHow does your text align within the cells?\n\n47\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.460\nHorizontally and vertically?\n\n48\n00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.350\nHow does it direct the text?\n\n49\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.060\nDoes it go up and down?\n\n50\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.460\nDoes it go vertically?\n\n51\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.132\nDoes it go to a 45 degree angle?\n\n52\n00:02:37.132 --> 00:02:40.078\nWhy would you wanna do that,\nbecause right here,\n\n53\n00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:44.230\nyou can see that the activity of the cats,\nand they like to sleep a lot.\n\n54\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.180\nThe actual content of the cells is\nreally small, it's just a number.\n\n55\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.356\nBut the name Fuego or Bishop,\nthat takes up enough space, so\n\n56\n00:02:52.356 --> 00:02:55.990\nif you just turn it sideways,\nthen those columns become a lot wider.\n\n57\n00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.729\nSo I see that for some reason,\n\n58\n00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:02.540\nI'm always thinking of like elementary\nclip boards like in P.E. or something.\n\n59\n00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.316\nWhere you had to check off the little box,\nlike the little shuttle runs.\n\n60\n00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:08.291\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how many push ups can you do,\nand then be like Cherokee.\n\n61\n00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:08.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's funny, because if\n\n63\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.491\ny'all have been watching my shows,\nI do have a lot of bad flashbacks [LAUGH].\n\n64\n00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:19.374\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you're not the only\none then, because I do too.\n\n65\n00:03:19.374 --> 00:03:23.449\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, I'm always equating\nthings like middle school or\n\n66\n00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.790\nelementary school.\n\n67\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.775\nBut yeah, the pull ups?\n\n68\n00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:28.418\n[SOUND] No, that ain't happening [LAUGH].\n\n69\n00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:30.882\nBut, that's what it reminds me of, and so\n\n70\n00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:35.335\nthat's where you can change\nthe orientation of your text in the cells.\n\n71\n00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:37.345\nThen you also have cell margins.\n\n72\n00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:41.502\nNow, we've talked about margins in Word as\nlike the white space around the edge of\n\n73\n00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:42.112\nthe paper.\n\n74\n00:03:42.112 --> 00:03:47.045\nWell, it's the same idea here, the white\nspace around the edge of the cell.\n\n75\n00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:51.202\nAnd how you might want to change that,\nyou don't want the text to be too\n\n76\n00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:54.742\nfar away from the edge of the cell,\nor you want it to be more.\n\n77\n00:03:54.742 --> 00:04:00.590\nSo you can control the margins, and then\nhow you distribute the rows and columns.\n\n78\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.325\nMaybe you want all the rows, and or\nthe columns to be the exact same width.\n\n79\n00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:09.720\nTo have that continuity across it,\nthere's buttons for all of those things.\n\n80\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.806\n&gt;&gt; So in that little square,\nif we can do full screen for a second,\n\n81\n00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:14.340\nthe one with the cell margins.\n\n82\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.772\nSo the one that we're looking\nat there from the top to bottom,\n\n83\n00:04:17.772 --> 00:04:21.890\nthe row on the top, you see that nice\nperimeter, that white space there.\n\n84\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.020\nAnd then at the bottom, it's just\npushing all the way out to the edges.\n\n85\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.260\nSo that's what you're talking about,\nwith those cell margins?\n\n86\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.790\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n87\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.262\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the,\n\n88\n00:04:29.262 --> 00:04:31.760\nI call it almost like the pillows.\n\n89\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.190\nLike the cushion around the edge\nof a cell, like a padded cell.\n\n90\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.352\n&gt;&gt; I get it [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's usually what I think..\n\n91\n00:04:40.352 --> 00:04:43.260\nSo [LAUGH] so you have that edge and\nit's a margin.\n\n92\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's how we can control it, and\n\n93\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.750\nwe can do all that through the little\nbuttons on the contextual tabs that we\n\n94\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.139\nwill be seeing in just a little bit.\n\n95\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.890\nBut, once I get the information into\nthe table, how do I make it look pretty?\n\n96\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.010\nWell, to me the easiest way to\ndo it is throw a style on it.\n\n97\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.550\nStyles are great, it's just a named group\nof formatting that you just go ahead and\n\n98\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.540\nput it on, and\nit just makes it look really pretty.\n\n99\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.450\nLike this layout right here or\n\n100\n00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.250\nthis design, all I had to do was click\none style and choose an option for it.\n\n101\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.318\nAnd it formatted it just like this, and\nI didn't really have to think about it.\n\n102\n00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:16.540\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne I'll tell you,\nthose differences between the hues,\n\n103\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.190\nthose shades of gray can be very helpful.\n\n104\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.810\nI used to work at advertising, and\nwe would have and if for a newspaper.\n\n105\n00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.410\nAnd we have these manifests,\nand you would have to check and\n\n106\n00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.020\nmake sure the orientation was correct for\nall your advertisements.\n\n107\n00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.253\nMake sure they were on the right page.\n\n108\n00:05:29.253 --> 00:05:32.450\nSo when you're dealing with a lot of\ninformation and sifting through it.\n\n109\n00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.510\nJust making sure,\nespecially if you have multiple rows and\n\n110\n00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.229\nyou get all the way to the right side.\n\n111\n00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.115\nAnd you're like, wait, wait!\n\n112\n00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:39.010\nWhat line am I on?\n\n113\n00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.130\nHaving that is a pretty cool feature too.\n\n114\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or you'd have to take the piece\nof paper and put it against there.\n\n115\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.782\n&gt;&gt; A ruler or something.\n\n116\n00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:47.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nbecause I don't wanna move off this.\n\n117\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.290\nYeah, exactly, banded rows.\n\n118\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And maybe sometimes if you have\n\n119\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.180\nmultiple columns,\nmaybe banded columns instead of rows.\n\n120\n00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.522\nDoing banded both,\nthat just throws it all off.\n\n121\n00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n122\n00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.890\nthe cool thing about this\nis if you use this style.\n\n123\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.480\nI don't have to select this row,\nformat this one, select this row,\n\n124\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.080\nformat this one.\n\n125\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.360\nIt just does it-\n&gt;&gt; Pre-compiled.\n\n126\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n127\n00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.490\n&gt;&gt; And if I add more information into it,\n\n128\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.140\nit'll do the whole banding for me.\n\n129\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.320\nSo really easy to go ahead and\n\n130\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.978\nmake things look pretty professional\nwith just a few clicks.\n\n131\n00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:19.351\nNow, [LAUGH] I say that and then she's\nlike but you could do this, too [LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:06:19.351 --> 00:06:20.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What happened?\n\n133\n00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:22.081\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n134\n00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:24.525\nnow I will give you a little\nasterisk on this one.\n\n135\n00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:28.490\nThis is from my PowerPoint show.\n\n136\n00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.948\nThe things that you see in here\nwith the gradients and the texture,\n\n137\n00:06:32.948 --> 00:06:38.370\nthe dead fish texture that I loved to\nput and everything, cuz it's ridiculous.\n\n138\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.040\n&gt;&gt; What is dead fish?\n\n139\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.842\nIs it the one that says eat on it with the\nnumber six and the [INAUDIBLE] up there?\n\n140\n00:06:42.842 --> 00:06:47.678\n&gt;&gt; There's an actual\ntexture in Office products\n\n141\n00:06:47.678 --> 00:06:49.580\nthat it just-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n142\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.430\n&gt;&gt; That's the dead fish [LAUGH].\n\n143\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.662\nIt's fossilized fish.\n\n144\n00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:53.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz,\n\n145\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.140\neverybody wants that as\nthe texture of their.\n\n146\n00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.890\n&gt;&gt; Of course they do.\n\n147\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.870\n&gt;&gt; So\nI always have to throw that in there.\n\n148\n00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.900\nBut all these textures, pictures and\n\n149\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.190\ngradients, that's actually\nnot available in Word.\n\n150\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.720\nThey only allow for the solid formatting,\nso just like the solid colors.\n\n151\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.130\nThat's the only thing you'll\nsee as the option in Word.\n\n152\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.130\nSo if you're like, but\nI really wanna fossilize this texture, and\n\n153\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.790\nthen use them in PowerPoint.\n\n154\n00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.460\nAnd then maybe they go ahead and save his\npicture, and then put them into Word.\n\n155\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.690\nSo you can use this product so-\n&gt;&gt; There you go with your problem solving\n\n156\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.582\nskills there, Vonne.\n\n157\n00:07:24.582 --> 00:07:25.082\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:07:25.082 --> 00:07:26.287\n&gt;&gt; You can always find your work around\n\n159\n00:07:26.287 --> 00:07:29.303\n[LAUGH].\nSo you have different things that you can\n\n160\n00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:33.830\ndo like shading, the border's colors.\nThe effects that you can have\n\n161\n00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.550\non your different items, the Word or\nstyle, and just regular text formatting.\n\n162\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.230\nMaybe I wanna have that top row,\nthe activities, PlayGo and Bishop.\n\n163\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.246\nIt can be both.\n\n164\n00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:47.338\nSo you can do all of those\ndifferent features and you can,\n\n165\n00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:50.311\nof course Individually format\nany part of your table.\n\n166\n00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:54.803\nOne cell will be different than another\ncell, rather than just using the styles.\n\n167\n00:07:54.803 --> 00:07:59.183\nI prefer the styles, just cuz it's easier,\nokay, but you do have that option.\n\n168\n00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:02.853\nAnd like I have said in the very\nbeginning, I gotta come over here.\n\n169\n00:08:02.853 --> 00:08:06.890\nAll about how to Select things,\nthat's super important.\n\n170\n00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.070\nOur Select to Effect, making sure we've\ngot everything in the right place.\n\n171\n00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.500\nBig thing in any of your Office products.\n\n172\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.550\nI'm always emphasizing that.\n\n173\n00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.090\nLook at where you're at,\nthink about it, where's your cursor?\n\n174\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.920\nOkay, now you can go ahead and move.\n\n175\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.730\nSo let's go over into Word now,\nbecause, hey, guess what?\n\n176\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:28.100\nI have the same table right here in Word.\n\n177\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.760\nAnd why don't we start off with the thing\nthat I always like to tell you to do in\n\n178\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.500\nWord, is put on your show/hide characters.\n\n179\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.670\nAnd with our show/hide characters,\nwe have our paragraphs,\n\n180\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.490\nwhich we've been familiar with.\n\n181\n00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.070\nBut you have some new things\nthat come up with the show/hide\n\n182\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.810\ncharacters when you're working in tables.\n\n183\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.120\nYou have these little box looking things.\n\n184\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.415\nThat's our technical definition there,\nCherokee.\n\n185\n00:08:51.415 --> 00:08:53.219\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; A box looking thing [LAUGH].\n\n186\n00:08:53.219 --> 00:08:55.407\nYou could see that I have that.\n\n187\n00:08:55.407 --> 00:08:59.508\nAnd that's indicating that\nthis is a cell within a table.\n\n188\n00:08:59.508 --> 00:09:04.810\nAnd then there's kind of a smaller\nbox thing at the end of a row.\n\n189\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.208\nSo it's showing you, this is the end of\nthe row, this is the end of the cell.\n\n190\n00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:14.510\nAnd then you also have this guy,\nright here, at the top left-hand corner.\n\n191\n00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.750\nThis is your four point arrow.\n\n192\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.097\nThat indicates that you would be\nable to select the entire table.\n\n193\n00:09:19.097 --> 00:09:23.158\nAnd then, let's zoom out a little bit\nmore, and then that little guy down at\n\n194\n00:09:23.158 --> 00:09:26.713\nthe bottom, the little square\nat the bottom right-hand corner,\n\n195\n00:09:26.713 --> 00:09:31.000\nthat would be how you can control\nthe overall size of the entire element.\n\n196\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.510\nBecause now,\nwe are putting text in this table.\n\n197\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.990\nBut it is still treated\nas a graphical element.\n\n198\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.600\nAnd that's,\n\n199\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.030\nof course, why it's in this particular\nsection of this particular show.\n\n200\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:49.075\nIt's text, but\nin a graphical life format in\n\n201\n00:09:49.075 --> 00:09:53.525\nthe sense that it's organized in columns\nand rows into an entire table, okay?\n\n202\n00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:55.675\nSo, mouse, cursor, icons.\n\n203\n00:09:55.675 --> 00:09:57.845\nNow that we know what our\nshow/hide characters are.\n\n204\n00:09:57.845 --> 00:09:59.005\nAnd I'm going to turn those off for\n\n205\n00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:02.215\nright now,\njust kind of make it a little bit easier.\n\n206\n00:10:02.215 --> 00:10:06.715\nThere are a lot of mouse\ncursors in the tables,\n\n207\n00:10:06.715 --> 00:10:07.935\nwhen you're working tables in Word.\n\n208\n00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:09.520\nSo I'm going to zoom in just a little bit.\n\n209\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.260\nI-beam we know that that means we can\nclick and that we'll be selecting text.\n\n210\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.320\nSo if I click right here,\nthe flashing cursor is now in my text.\n\n211\n00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.920\nBut if I move over,\nlet's go right from here.\n\n212\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.590\nIf I scroll, or\nif I move up just a little bit.\n\n213\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.104\nDo you see there's a black\narrow pointing down?\n\n214\n00:10:28.104 --> 00:10:31.060\nThat means that I am over the column.\n\n215\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.328\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you're wearing your\nglasses when you're doing this.\n\n216\n00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:36.683\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because I'm like, wait,\n\n217\n00:10:36.683 --> 00:10:38.213\nwhere's that little black arrow, and okay.\n\n218\n00:10:38.213 --> 00:10:40.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah they're really small.\n\n219\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.010\nAnd it's very easy to get confused and\n\n220\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.710\nespecially if I get one area,\nyou're in like the tiniest little space.\n\n221\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.970\nYou get like 16, well,\nmaybe 16's a little dramatic.\n\n222\n00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.630\nYou get a bunch of different icons in your\nmouse cursor that does different things.\n\n223\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.970\nAnd you have to be right\nin the right position,\n\n224\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.000\ncuz see like right here versus It's there-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n225\n00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.380\n&gt;&gt; Where am I?\n\n226\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.632\nSo you gotta, there you go, if I click it-\n&gt;&gt; I bet you're really good at video\n\n227\n00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:08.050\ngames, too [LAUGH].\n\n228\n00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:08.883\n&gt;&gt; I'm decent.\n\n229\n00:11:08.883 --> 00:11:10.080\nI like puzzles.\n\n230\n00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:17.160\nSo we have here that it is selecting\nthat entire column of this table.\n\n231\n00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.680\nCool.\n\n232\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.890\nNow we know clicking off these selections,\nI'll just click over to the right,\n\n233\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.230\ncuz we don't want to go left\ncuz that's a selection pane.\n\n234\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.328\nClick off to here.\n\n235\n00:11:24.328 --> 00:11:26.486\nSo I could hover right about there.\n\n236\n00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:27.743\nThere's that column.\n\n237\n00:11:27.743 --> 00:11:30.625\nThere, there's that column.\n\n238\n00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:33.775\nSo you can do the same thing for\nyour rows.\n\n239\n00:11:33.775 --> 00:11:38.324\nNow, the rows, this is where it's\na little bit trickier in the sense\n\n240\n00:11:38.324 --> 00:11:43.765\nthat it doesn't really give you\nthe arrow pointing to the left.\n\n241\n00:11:43.765 --> 00:11:46.325\nBut you can get right about here.\n\n242\n00:11:46.325 --> 00:11:50.720\nKind of like where we have the selection\npane over on the left-hand side in Word.\n\n243\n00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.080\nIf you come just a little\nbit off to the side,\n\n244\n00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.120\nyou see how that is not an I-beam, is it?\n\n245\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.498\nIt's an arrow point, it's a white arrow.\n\n246\n00:11:58.498 --> 00:12:01.800\nIf I click right now, do you see how\nit selects the entire row, okay?\n\n247\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.620\nSo it's not the tiny little black arrow,\nit's the big white\n\n248\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.280\narrow that's kind of leaning to\nits side that gives you your row.\n\n249\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n250\n00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n251\n00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.550\n&gt;&gt; Great with the consistency, right?\n\n252\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.840\nSo I have that.\n\n253\n00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.070\nBut you might also see right there.\n\n254\n00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.570\nOkay, go away mini tool bar.\n\n255\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.040\nSo right about there,\nthe arrow that's diagonal but\n\n256\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.350\nit's black and tiny,\nthat will select your cell.\n\n257\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.984\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n258\n00:12:26.984 --> 00:12:31.830\nthat selects the cell versus the big\nwhite arrow selects the row.\n\n259\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.120\nOkay, there's a bunch\nof other little stuff.\n\n260\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.070\nThe mini toolbar that comes\nup with any selection,\n\n261\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.430\nthat's been happening\nthroughout Word altogether, and\n\n262\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.510\nit does have some other options that\nwe'll get into, like insert and delete.\n\n263\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.240\nWhatever the thing is that you're\nwanting to insert or delete.\n\n264\n00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.900\nAll right, let's go over to\na couple other mouse cursor icons.\n\n265\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.030\nRight about here.\n\n266\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.170\nOkay, I'm going to try and, see,\nI'm not sure if that helps any bit,\n\n267\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.470\nbut there are two lines and\narrows going to the left and right.\n\n268\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.500\nBecause I'm hovering between the columns.\n\n269\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.660\nI am on the separation of the column.\n\n270\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.870\nThis indicates that if I click+hold and\n\n271\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.100\ndrag this,\nI'll be changing the column width.\n\n272\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.680\nJust to demonstrate, I'll show you.\n\n273\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.180\nSee, there we go.\n\n274\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.800\nI'm changing the column width.\n\n275\n00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.490\nSo if I do that between the columns,\nyeah, you guessed it.\n\n276\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.503\nYou can do that between the rows, too.\n\n277\n00:13:23.503 --> 00:13:25.142\nSo I change the row height,\n\n278\n00:13:25.142 --> 00:13:30.364\nby getting that particular mouse-cursor\nicon to change that particular row height.\n\n279\n00:13:30.364 --> 00:13:33.765\nBut you see all these\ndifferent types of icon.\n\n280\n00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:34.810\nI mean, just look at that.\n\n281\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.109\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n282\n00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:39.803\nIn a very, very small area.\n\n283\n00:13:39.803 --> 00:13:45.670\nBut just looking, slowing down\na little bit, there's my cell.\n\n284\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.560\nThat is where I'm actually\nselecting the entire table.\n\n285\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.550\nSo, if you ever get the four cornered\narrows with the other arrow,\n\n286\n00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:56.020\nthat's everything, versus there's my cell,\n\n287\n00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.090\nversus column width and row heights and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n288\n00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.410\nSo, just be aware of how you\ncan get the things that you\n\n289\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.970\nneed to have selected with\nthese different mouse cursors.\n\n290\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.800\n&gt;&gt; And you know, Vonne, I think that\nthis may also be the root cause of\n\n291\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.882\na lot of potential issues, like I don't\nknow what happened, I was just, and then,\n\n292\n00:14:16.882 --> 00:14:19.760\nand-\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah,\nI always tell people to just slow down,\n\n296\n00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.050\ntake a breath, look at what you're doing.\n\n297\n00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.350\nI have to tell myself that,\nbecause I do it all the time.\n\n298\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.020\nI don't have my mouse\ncursor in the right place.\n\n299\n00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.721\nI click on a command, and I'm like,\nwell, I'm in the wrong spot.\n\n300\n00:14:35.721 --> 00:14:38.158\nCuz I'm moving faster than-\n&gt;&gt; At least they have the Undo\n\n301\n00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:38.823\nbutton, right?\n\n302\n00:14:38.823 --> 00:14:40.194\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; IIt does.\n\n303\n00:14:40.194 --> 00:14:41.760\nOur best friend, for sure.\n\n304\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.390\nSo we have those different things.\n\n305\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.210\nAnd just, like I said, being aware of it,\n\n306\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.630\nknowing what's going on, and\nwhere to be at the right time.\n\n307\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:57.060\nBecause if I was, let's say,\nwanting to insert a column to the right\n\n308\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.120\nof Fuego, I have to make sure\nI'm in that particular column.\n\n309\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:08.450\nSo if I wanted to put a row above sleep,\nwell, make sure I'm in that row.\n\n310\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.060\nAnywhere that your cursor is, it depends\non what command you're going to do.\n\n311\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.930\nAnd a lot of the things that\nyou're going to be able to do\n\n312\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.660\nare in a couple different places.\n\n313\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.180\nYou could come up to your contextual tabs.\n\n314\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:24.670\nI'm in an element that is popping up tabs\nthat I now need because I'm in that.\n\n315\n00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.800\nThe Table tools, the Design.\n\n316\n00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.390\nNow, Design would be more for\nthe design, right?\n\n317\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.670\nThe layout.\n\n318\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.570\nHere we go.\n\n319\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.100\nInsert above, Insert below,\nInsert to the left, Insert to the right.\n\n320\n00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.870\nDelete.\n\n321\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.670\nDelete what?\n\n322\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.980\nDelete the column, Delete the row, Delete\nthe whole table, Delete just these cells.\n\n323\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:47.290\nAll of these options that I can do to\nstart modifying the layout of this table.\n\n324\n00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.571\nBut it would be,\nif I deleted a column right now,\n\n325\n00:15:49.571 --> 00:15:52.591\nit would be the Fuego column\nbecause that's where my cursor is.\n\n326\n00:15:52.591 --> 00:15:55.441\nIf I delete the row,\nit would be the Sleep row,\n\n327\n00:15:55.441 --> 00:15:58.303\nbecause that's where my\ncursor is right now.\n\n328\n00:15:58.303 --> 00:16:00.103\nSo that's that first step.\n\n329\n00:16:00.103 --> 00:16:02.343\nWell I guess the first step is\nwhat do I want to do [LAUGH]?\n\n330\n00:16:02.343 --> 00:16:07.185\n&gt;&gt; And then identifying what it is that\nobject that we're talking about or how-\n\n331\n00:16:07.185 --> 00:16:08.005\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n332\n00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:13.100\n&gt;&gt; How I'm relating that concept to\nmy graphical orientation if you will.\n\n333\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Exact, yeah where is my cursor?\n\n334\n00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.330\nWhat do I want to do?\n\n335\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.812\nYou have to have those\ntwo pieces together and\n\n336\n00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.824\nthat's where you can change\nthose different things.\n\n337\n00:16:21.824 --> 00:16:23.378\nThe other way that you could do it,\n\n338\n00:16:23.378 --> 00:16:27.530\ncuz I was saying there's multiple ways to\nget to these things, with the right-click.\n\n339\n00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.323\nIf you're a right-clicker,\nwe said when in doubt, right-click, or\n\n340\n00:16:32.323 --> 00:16:37.130\nDaniel made a really cool, give a shout\nout to, if you want to try it out-\n\n341\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:37.664\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:38.820\n&gt;&gt; Man I can't even remember anymore.\n\n343\n00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.183\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But in a really cool saying of like,\n\n344\n00:16:43.183 --> 00:16:45.507\ntry it out, right-click [LAUGH].\n\n345\n00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:46.689\nMan I wish I could remember.\n\n346\n00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:48.682\nSo, I always say when in\ndoubt right-click, but.\n\n347\n00:16:48.682 --> 00:16:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n348\n00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.810\n&gt;&gt; When in doubt, try it out.\n\n349\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n350\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:52.115\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n351\n00:16:52.115 --> 00:16:53.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I knew it'd come around.\n\n352\n00:16:53.915 --> 00:16:56.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I always,\n\n353\n00:16:56.122 --> 00:16:58.220\nmy problem is I get click happy.\n\n354\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.750\nI'm not the most patient person in\nthe world and I'll click, click, click,\n\n355\n00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.670\nclick it, then it's like.\n\n356\n00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nYes, the Jiminy Clickets.\n\n357\n00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:05.780\n&gt;&gt; Jiminy Crickets, yes.\n\n358\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.828\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's what we would call them.\n\n359\n00:17:06.828 --> 00:17:09.030\n[LAUGH] So, and I do the same thing.\n\n360\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.800\nSo you have here right-clicking,\nthere's insert.\n\n361\n00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.854\nInsert what?\n\n362\n00:17:13.854 --> 00:17:16.895\nBased on where I'm at,\ndelete, delete cells.\n\n363\n00:17:16.895 --> 00:17:20.500\nNow why does it say cells and\nit didn't give me the other options?\n\n364\n00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.294\nBecause I'm only having\nmy cursor in one cell.\n\n365\n00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:27.694\nIf I selected a row, and\nthen right-clicked, now I have,\n\n366\n00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:31.842\nwell still have to delete cells, and\nit's gonna give me the option, but\n\n367\n00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:34.787\nthey also have that mini\ntool bar that comes up.\n\n368\n00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:37.757\nDelete the columns with the rows,\nwell all that kind of stuff.\n\n369\n00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:40.484\nNow that happens,\nnot from the right-click,\n\n370\n00:17:40.484 --> 00:17:43.076\nit just happens from what you're doing,\nbut\n\n371\n00:17:43.076 --> 00:17:47.660\nthe right-click will change depending\non what you have selective right here.\n\n372\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.021\nSo that click one there.\n\n373\n00:17:51.021 --> 00:17:55.354\nNow see how the menu changes, cuz I'm now\non a word and it's doing the whole smart\n\n374\n00:17:55.354 --> 00:17:58.500\nlookup, the synonyms all that\nkind of different things.\n\n375\n00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.260\nSo have your selection,\nmake sure you know where your cursor is,\n\n376\n00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.580\nknow you can right-click, and\nthen the last thing I want to talk about\n\n377\n00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.470\nwould be right-clicking anywhere and\ngetting to the table properties.\n\n378\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.008\nSo the table properties are, yeah,\nthe properties of the table,\n\n379\n00:18:15.008 --> 00:18:20.437\nbecause the default alignment, because\nwe've talked about how the different\n\n380\n00:18:20.437 --> 00:18:26.209\nthings in our document are showing up like\nimages, what does an image do by default?\n\n381\n00:18:26.209 --> 00:18:29.400\nDoes it align to our text?\n\n382\n00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.490\nDoes it go inline with it?\n\n383\n00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.940\nWhat's my text wrap doing with it?\n\n384\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.600\nThe default one for tables is like,\nit's still a graphical element.\n\n385\n00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.030\nSo if you put this in a word\ndocument you can move it around,\n\n386\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.420\nwith your text just like an image and\nthe text is all going to wrap around it.\n\n387\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.520\nIt doesn't have the none\ntext wrapping on by default.\n\n388\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.372\nSo, all of those different things\nwill happen when you are wanting to\n\n389\n00:18:56.372 --> 00:18:59.309\nput it into your document with text in it.\n\n390\n00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:02.579\nThat four pointed arrow up at the top,\nif you click on it,\n\n391\n00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:06.685\nthis selects your entire table,\ncuz this is where you could delete it.\n\n392\n00:19:06.685 --> 00:19:08.490\nYou could move it around.\n\n393\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.340\nYou could move it down here.\n\n394\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.249\nI'm gonna actually select this, copy it,\nand here I'm going to open up a document,\n\n395\n00:19:15.249 --> 00:19:16.749\ncuz that whole wrapping,\n\n396\n00:19:16.749 --> 00:19:20.594\nI just wanna demonstrate what\nI'm talking to you guys about.\n\n397\n00:19:20.594 --> 00:19:22.011\nHere's some text yes.\n\n398\n00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:24.216\n&gt;&gt; Alice in Wonderland,\none of my favorites.\n\n399\n00:19:24.216 --> 00:19:27.812\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's the theme of all of the\nOffice shows, well at least the Word for\n\n400\n00:19:27.812 --> 00:19:28.397\nright now.\n\n401\n00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:32.959\nWe have here, if I start moving this\naround, do you see how the text is\n\n402\n00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:38.090\nwrapping around it, and I'm actually\ngonna go ahead and make this smaller.\n\n403\n00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.800\nWe'll talk about changing column widths\nand everything like that later, but\n\n404\n00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.280\nthis is where all the text\nis wrapping around it and\n\n405\n00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.000\nI could move it to where I want it to go.\n\n406\n00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.191\n&gt;&gt; You know, for me this is the easiest\noption, and even for my kids, and\n\n407\n00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.602\nI have two young children,\nbut helping with projects and\n\n408\n00:19:55.602 --> 00:20:00.433\nstuff I'm always like tell them to default\nthrough, to go ahead and set it in this\n\n409\n00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:05.549\nformat because sometimes It just doesn't\nlook so great, and even with like, kind of\n\n410\n00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:10.637\nplanning out your pages in advance, this\nis like the most, I guess, the tightest.\n\n411\n00:20:10.637 --> 00:20:14.635\nSo if you could just extend it,\nrather than have strange, awkward gaps and\n\n412\n00:20:14.635 --> 00:20:16.987\nwhite space, and dealing with all of that.\n\n413\n00:20:16.987 --> 00:20:22.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it becomes more of like,\nevery element is in like a unique,\n\n414\n00:20:22.095 --> 00:20:25.053\nand it could be moved modularly around.\n\n415\n00:20:25.053 --> 00:20:29.464\nYou don't have to be conforming to-\n&gt;&gt; The confined areas that they put them\n\n416\n00:20:29.464 --> 00:20:30.089\nin, yeah.\n\n417\n00:20:30.089 --> 00:20:31.559\n&gt;&gt; The pages, exactly.\n\n418\n00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:34.552\nSo I mean there's goods and\nbads to all of this.\n\n419\n00:20:34.552 --> 00:20:35.098\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n420\n00:20:35.098 --> 00:20:36.848\n&gt;&gt; Like you're saying,\nit depends on what you need.\n\n421\n00:20:36.848 --> 00:20:39.049\nFor a kid it's like,\nI just wanna move that around.\n\n422\n00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:40.198\n&gt;&gt;

It's great, we're going to be laying\nout and creating all sorts of tables.\n\n8\n00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.970\nI guess not all sorts of tables,\nreally just one.\n\n9\n00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.007\nBut how do we actually get\na table into our Word document?\n\n10\n00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.040\nThat's what we're going to cover.\n\n11\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.353\nAnd there are multiple ways\nthat you can make tables, but\n\n12\n00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:36.780\nwe're going to leave that for a part two.\n\n13\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.519\nI'm already prefacing right now,\nthere will be a part two,\n\n14\n00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.292\nI broke it up a little for us.\n\n15\n00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:47.980\nSo we're going to start by jumping down\ninto our computer, I got a blank document.\n\n16\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.322\nBecause we did cover some of the basics\nin our Introduction to Tables\n\n17\n00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:54.910\nin the previous episode, so if you\nhaven't looked at that check it out.\n\n18\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.265\nTo where we talked about how to select\nthings, and how it behaves within a Word\n\n19\n00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:02.630\ndocument with our text wrapping and\nour table properties.\n\n20\n00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.120\nSo make sure you check that out, cuz from\nhere we're just gonna go ahead and do it.\n\n21\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.039\nSo I'm gonna select it,\nif you need a little bit more,\n\n22\n00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.444\nyou know where to find it.\n\n23\n00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:16.396\nInserting a table, Cherokee,\nwhere do you think on this\n\n24\n00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:21.103\nribbon up here,\ndo you think you will insert a table?\n\n25\n00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:26.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I see your random, like,\nI don't know spastic clicking over there.\n\n26\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.290\nSo, [LAUGH] well,\nnot clicking but hovering.\n\n27\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.128\nSo, I'm guessing the insert tab, Vonne.\n\n28\n00:01:30.128 --> 00:01:31.234\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n29\n00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:33.506\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; You win the prize.\n\n30\n00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:37.996\n[LAUGH] So I have the Insert tab and\nwe go with Table.\n\n31\n00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:40.810\nNow when I click on this it's gonna\ndrop us down to show me a couple of\n\n32\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.680\ndifferent things.\n\n33\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.311\nYou can see the Draw Table,\nthe Quick Tables,\n\n34\n00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.281\nwhich is kinda cool now that\nthey can just go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:51.063\nthrow in a preformatted table with\nall sorts of formatting on it and\n\n36\n00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:55.290\nI can fill in the blanks where I need to,\nbut we'll cover that later.\n\n37\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.460\nRight now,\nI'm just need to put in a table.\n\n38\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.030\nSo what do I wanna make a table about?\n\n39\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.594\nLet's just stick with the cats,\nand we'll do the cat activity.\n\n40\n00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:06.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How many hours a day do Fuego and\n\n41\n00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.522\nBishop, do things like eat and sleep?\n\n42\n00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:09.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which that's\n\n43\n00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:11.151\npretty much all they do, but [LAUGH].\n\n44\n00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.073\nAnd meow,\nreally loudly when they are not feeding.\n\n45\n00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:17.960\nSo right here I will need\nto have a couple columns.\n\n46\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.717\nI will need to have Fuego and\nBishop, I know that's two.\n\n47\n00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:26.799\nAnd then their activities, that would be\nthree, so I know I have three columns,\n\n48\n00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.465\nbut even if I didn't know I needed\nthree columns, I can always add later.\n\n49\n00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:33.706\nBut let's get a base going\nof three columns, two rows.\n\n50\n00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:36.916\nEven though I know I’m gonna\nbe needing more than two rows,\n\n51\n00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:41.343\ncuz I’m gonna have like a top row that’s\ngonna say, like the headers of each one of\n\n52\n00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:45.090\nthose columns, and then I’m gonna\nhave the activities below that.\n\n53\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.027\nBut I’ll show you how you can\nadd all of that after the fact.\n\n54\n00:02:49.027 --> 00:02:53.390\nSo you just hover, and the nice thing\nis it’s showing us as I'm hovering\n\n55\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.765\nover this grid of what its\ngoing to look like on the page.\n\n56\n00:02:56.765 --> 00:03:00.504\nAnd it does automatically go\nfrom margin to margin and\n\n57\n00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:04.588\nthat is where it goes ahead and\nis going to put the table in.\n\n58\n00:03:04.588 --> 00:03:09.521\nWe will go three by two, click that\nlast square, and then it inserts our\n\n59\n00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:14.930\ntable automatically bringing up\nthose contextual tabs right here.\n\n60\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.590\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit as well so\nwe can see this.\n\n61\n00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.010\nAnd we're not really gonna pay\nattention to the contextual tabs, but\n\n62\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.160\nwe will be hanging out over here in this\nLayout tab a lot a little bit later.\n\n63\n00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.730\nNow getting our text into this table,\nflashing cursor.\n\n64\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.100\nI'm gonna go ahead and start typing,\n\n65\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.615\ncuz I said we were going\nto measure their activity.\n\n66\n00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:35.922\nActivity, yes, okay [LAUGH].\n\n67\n00:03:35.922 --> 00:03:38.984\nAnd then now I need to get\none cell to the right.\n\n68\n00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:43.077\nYou could totally use your mouse, you\ncan take your mouse, click in the cell,\n\n69\n00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:43.647\nget that.\n\n70\n00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:45.400\n&gt;&gt; What about tab?\n\n71\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.810\n&gt;&gt; You can do a tab, you know that one.\n\n72\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.178\n&gt;&gt; Well, because in Microsoft and\na lot of their wizards,\n\n73\n00:03:50.178 --> 00:03:54.264\nwhenever I'm setting things up in\nserver side or even client side,\n\n74\n00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:57.865\ntab it up because yeah it's\njust a little bit faster there.\n\n75\n00:03:57.865 --> 00:04:00.922\n&gt;&gt; Totally yes and that's exactly how\nyou can get around within your table,\n\n76\n00:04:00.922 --> 00:04:02.461\nmove over rows just hit that Tab key.\n\n77\n00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:07.090\nThe other thing is if you\nwanted to go back one,\n\n78\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.516\ninstead of Tab,\n&gt;&gt; All right what is it?\n\n79\n00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:10.949\n&gt;&gt; Shift+ Tab.\n&gt;&gt; Shift+ Tab, I'm excited now.\n\n80\n00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.495\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so if I Tab and then hold my\nShift key, you see how it goes backwards.\n\n81\n00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:17.436\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna try that now in a wizard,\nlike for typing an IP addresses and stuff.\n\n82\n00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:19.612\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz it does it in fields for\na website.\n\n83\n00:04:19.612 --> 00:04:20.606\nUsually it does.\n\n84\n00:04:20.606 --> 00:04:24.486\nIn some of, also it depends on their Tab\norder because a lot of times their Tab\n\n85\n00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:26.786\norder could be a little off sometimes.\n\n86\n00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:28.062\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But Shift+ Tab is nice and\n\n87\n00:04:28.062 --> 00:04:32.100\nthat is also when your doing lists too,\nwhen your indenting lists and out-denting.\n\n88\n00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.860\nSo we go ahead and move around clicking,\ntabbing, whichever way you want.\n\n89\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.550\nWe'll got ahead and put in Mister Fuego\nPants right in here, hit that Tab key and\n\n90\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.936\nthen we'll put in our little bish bish.\n\n91\n00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:48.490\nSo we go ahead and type in,\ndon't hit Enter, it's kind of in our.\n\n92\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.104\n&gt;&gt;

We might even be able to add my dog\nin here because he's almost like a cat.\n\n114\n00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:56.560\nHe's probably smaller than your cats\nfrom the images that you've shown.\n\n115\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he sleeps all day too.\n\n116\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.293\n&gt;&gt; Well this is perfect.\n\n117\n00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:01.285\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can use that as an example to add\n\n118\n00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:02.108\nanother column.\n\n119\n00:06:02.108 --> 00:06:04.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I love it, all right.\n\n120\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.909\n[LAUGH] So we'll keep on tabbing across.\n\n121\n00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.510\nAnd Bishop, he sleeps a little less,\nhe's a little bit more active.\n\n122\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.431\nThe thing is, I've gotten to the end\nof the table, the end of the row,\n\n123\n00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:15.238\nand I don't have anymore rows.\n\n124\n00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:18.970\nThe nice thing as you're going,\nif you just hit the Tab again,\n\n125\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.660\nit's going to automatically\nmake you another row for you.\n\n126\n00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.507\nSo I can just go ahead and keep in typing.\n\n127\n00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:27.720\nSo, they're going to eat,\nand Fuego eats a lot.\n\n128\n00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.552\n[LAUGH] Bishop, he's kind of,\nwe call him a little bird,\n\n129\n00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:34.156\nhe doesn't like to eat a lot except for\nall of the stuff he kills outside.\n\n130\n00:06:34.156 --> 00:06:35.386\nBut, hm, sorry, sorry.\n\n131\n00:06:35.386 --> 00:06:37.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's a cat.\n\n132\n00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:43.290\n[LAUGH] And then I go ahead and keep\non tabbing and we'll just go with play.\n\n133\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.986\nAnd, I'm making this up, by the way, so I\ndon't think that adds up to 24 right now.\n\n134\n00:06:46.986 --> 00:06:50.679\nBut you could get the idea\nis that we go ahead and\n\n135\n00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:54.840\nkeep on tabbing to add\nin rows as we're going.\n\n136\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.350\nPerfect, but back to that whole adding in,\nmaybe even deleting, rows and or columns.\n\n137\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.247\nAs I'm typing, that's the one way,\nbut I really wanted to add another row\n\n138\n00:07:05.247 --> 00:07:09.865\nbetween sleep and eat just because I\nknow that's where I want it to go.\n\n139\n00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:12.246\nThere's a couple of\nways you could do this.\n\n140\n00:07:12.246 --> 00:07:19.193\nLet's first get our cursor into the sleep\ncell in this, what is this, it's a row.\n\n141\n00:07:19.193 --> 00:07:23.012\nIf you hover, of, see, there it is, you\nsee when I hover and you might have seen\n\n142\n00:07:23.012 --> 00:07:26.888\nthis if you watched the previous episode,\nthat I didn't really point this out,\n\n143\n00:07:26.888 --> 00:07:30.610\ncause I really wasn't ready to, but\nit's got a plus and it's going across.\n\n144\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.850\nThat's gonna be adding a row, so\nI can a row from that little button and\n\n145\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.610\nit will do just that, yay.\n\n146\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.410\nMaybe I wanted to add\nanother row after eat.\n\n147\n00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.059\nPut your cursor there, right clicking,\nremember we talked about we could\n\n148\n00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:52.723\nright click, and insert a row below\nbecause you gotta think, my cursor's here,\n\n149\n00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:54.424\nit's gotta go below, cool.\n\n150\n00:07:54.424 --> 00:07:58.607\nOr you could do it by going into\nthe Design tab, not the Design tab,\n\n151\n00:07:58.607 --> 00:08:03.572\nthe Layout tab, and going to Insert below\nand then it goes ahead and puts it in.\n\n152\n00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:05.518\nGreat.\nBut now I don't need this.\n\n153\n00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:06.510\nYes, we have undo.\n\n154\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.649\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n155\n00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:09.412\nlet's pretend that that doesn't exist for\nsome reason.\n\n156\n00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:10.720\nThat would be a horrible world,\nwouldn't it?\n\n157\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not good.\n\n158\n00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.220\n[LAUGH] Gotta have undo.\n\n159\n00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.510\nCursor in this row.\n\n160\n00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.780\nI don't even have to\nhighlight the whole row.\n\n161\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.960\nIf it makes you feel better,\nyou're more than welcome to do that.\n\n162\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.390\nBut with the cursor here, I can delete,\nand I can choose to delete the row.\n\n163\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.630\nAnd it deletes that row.\n\n164\n00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.910\nPerfect.\n\n165\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.780\nWhat about adding?\n\n166\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.161\nWe need to add your dog/cat in there.\n\n167\n00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:37.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go,\n\n168\n00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:39.505\nlet's put him between Fuego and Bishop.\n\n169\n00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:41.660\nNow, I can be at Fuego,\nor I can be at Bishop.\n\n170\n00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.890\nI just need to know which is my left and\nwhich is my right.\n\n171\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.020\n[LAUGH] So in the Fuego column,\nthat would be inserting to the right.\n\n172\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.740\nAnd now I have a whole nother column.\n\n173\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.110\nNotice it does also space out\nthe column width here because it's\n\n174\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.340\nstill saying that there's the edge of\nthe table from the margin to margin.\n\n175\n00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.340\nSo everything kind of adjusts.\n\n176\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.454\nAnd so, all right,\nwhat's the name of your dog/cat?\n\n177\n00:09:04.454 --> 00:09:07.130\n&gt;&gt; Jack [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Jack, all right.\n\n178\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.660\nHello, Jack.\n\n179\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.740\nHow much does Jack sleep a day?\n\n180\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.860\n&gt;&gt; I'd say he's probably\nin between the two.\n\n181\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.620\nSo maybe let's go with 14.\n\n182\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, and does he eat a lot?\n\n183\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n184\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.865\nHe's an obese chihuahua [LAUGH].\n\n185\n00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:22.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a sight to see,\nI'm sure.\n\n186\n00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.142\nWe'll go with 7.\n\n187\n00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:24.644\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n188\n00:09:24.644 --> 00:09:28.490\n&gt;&gt; And is he playful?\n\n189\n00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you consider eating playful.\n\n190\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.790\nBut, no, yeah, he's kind of\nprematurely becoming a grumpy old man.\n\n191\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.440\nSo well see.\n\n192\n00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.490\nProbably about the same as a cat.\n\n193\n00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.620\nLike I said,\nhe does have like a cat personality,\n\n194\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.816\nnot super playful like a puppy or\ndog, you would expect them to be.\n\n195\n00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:47.557\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How about 2.5, how about that?\n\n196\n00:09:47.557 --> 00:09:48.245\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n197\n00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:50.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Fantastic.\n\n198\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.170\nSo now you can see how I can add a column.\n\n199\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.990\nIf I wanted to delete,\nI don't wanna delete any of our columns\n\n200\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.625\nright now because I wanna keep all\nof our wonderful pets up there.\n\n201\n00:09:58.625 --> 00:09:59.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you could-\n\n202\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.520\n&gt;&gt; Say look,\n\n203\n00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.938\ntechnically Jack's not a cat-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n204\n00:10:02.938 --> 00:10:04.151\n&gt;&gt; So we have to get rid of him.\n\n205\n00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but we'll just go though\nthe motion and then we'll bring him back.\n\n206\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.300\nSo we'll delete that column.\n\n207\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.160\nNotice my cursor's in the Jack.\n\n208\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.654\nAnd then I go to Delete Columns,\nand then it goes up.\n\n209\n00:10:14.654 --> 00:10:17.580\nBut we are gonna go ahead and undo that.\n\n210\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.730\nI don't know why I went to the Home tab,\n\n211\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.480\nit's right there on\nthe quick access toolbar.\n\n212\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.750\nBut now Jack is back.\n\n213\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.370\nWe will delete this other\nrow to get rid of that.\n\n214\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.540\nNow, watch if I delete cells,\n\n215\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.560\nthis is where it's gonna ask me\nhow do you want me to do this?\n\n216\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.248\nAnd this is where, you don't really wanna\ndelete one cell in a row because then,\n\n217\n00:10:38.248 --> 00:10:41.190\nit just kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Throw everything off a bit?\n\n218\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n219\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.790\nAnd that, I mean,\nI feel the same way about splitting cells.\n\n220\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.460\nI know that it's completely valid.\n\n221\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.720\nThere's nothing wrong\nwith splitting a cell.\n\n222\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.940\nBut then, if you split a cell in one,\nthen you have four columns.\n\n223\n00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.530\nAnd then you split one, now it has five.\n\n224\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.010\nBut it's only five in one row and\n\n225\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.230\nit can throw some of your\nformatting off a little bit.\n\n226\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:06.245\nSo to me, I try to keep the table\nin its entirety at all times.\n\n227\n00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:08.215\nAnd not just deleting one part out of it.\n\n228\n00:11:08.215 --> 00:11:13.365\nOr changing the width of one\nrow different than another row.\n\n229\n00:11:13.365 --> 00:11:14.725\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n230\n00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:19.005\nBut I just wanted to throw\nthat kind of concept out here.\n\n231\n00:11:19.005 --> 00:11:21.555\nSo if I wanted to I could shift it.\n\n232\n00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:25.920\nBut a lot of times you select them all,\nand then go into delete cells.\n\n233\n00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.420\nThis is a different way, cuz I,\nit is selecting the whole row.\n\n234\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.120\nI delete the cells.\n\n235\n00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.010\nAnd it's like, well, hey, what do you\nwant, go ahead and shift to the left.\n\n236\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.820\nCuz it's still just gonna go ahead and\ndelete that whole row out.\n\n237\n00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.430\nSo don't be thrown off too much\nwith that what do you want it to do\n\n238\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.530\nif you have everything in that row or\ncolumn.\n\n239\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.400\nIt mostly comes up with rows\nof how you want to move about.\n\n240\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.200\nUnless you only have one,\nand then it throws it off.\n\n241\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.470\nAll right, what else we gonna do?\n\n242\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.260\nMerge cells.\n\n243\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.110\nWe need to put like a big\nheading across this.\n\n244\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.165\nThe activity of our doggie cat\nthings [LAUGH], our animals.\n\n245\n00:12:00.165 --> 00:12:04.087\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Like four separate columns,\nwe just want like a big title.\n\n246\n00:12:04.087 --> 00:12:04.629\nYeah.\n\n247\n00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:05.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n248\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.930\n&gt;&gt; So, we are gonna add a row and\nthen merge the cells.\n\n249\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.825\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n250\n00:12:08.825 --> 00:12:10.809\nWe'll put our cursor on Activities.\n\n251\n00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:12.796\nWe'll add a row, insert above.\n\n252\n00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:15.406\n&gt;&gt; It's already selected for\nme, which is great.\n\n253\n00:12:15.406 --> 00:12:22.190\nBut you do need to think how many cells\ndo I need to select to then merge.\n\n254\n00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.600\nSo, click, hold and drag.\n\n255\n00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.395\nAnd again, you could only have to,\nyou might only want to merge these two.\n\n256\n00:12:27.395 --> 00:12:29.322\nAnd then merge these two separately.\n\n257\n00:12:29.322 --> 00:12:34.260\nSo it doesn't have to be across\nthe entire row or column.\n\n258\n00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.460\nJust select multiple cells.\n\n259\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.390\nAnd it can even go across rows and\ncolumns, all right?\n\n260\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.526\nSometimes I've seen a lot of\npeople get really creative.\n\n261\n00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:45.357\nThey make up a really big table, and then\nthey start selecting multiple cells and\n\n262\n00:12:45.357 --> 00:12:47.489\nmaking them into merged cells, and\n\n263\n00:12:47.489 --> 00:12:52.130\ncreating some really interesting layouts\nfor however they want to display.\n\n264\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.711\nIt's still columns and it's still rows,\nbut just merged all together.\n\n265\n00:12:55.711 --> 00:12:58.120\nIt's pretty neat.\n\n266\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.530\nSo have them selected.\n\n267\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.810\nWe can, up on the ribbon or\nright-clicking, go to Merge Cells.\n\n268\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.760\nNow it becomes one big cell.\n\n269\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.397\nAnd I could type in activity of our pets.\n\n270\n00:13:09.397 --> 00:13:13.790\nAnd there we go.\n\n271\n00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.390\nWonderful.\n\n272\n00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.135\nIt's emerging.\n\n273\n00:13:15.135 --> 00:13:16.208\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like I said,\n\n274\n00:13:16.208 --> 00:13:18.890\nyou could split a cell if you wanted to.\n\n275\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.245\nI could take this cell right here.\n\n276\n00:13:20.245 --> 00:13:25.414\nCuz Fuego, he plays, but\nhe also kind of pesters Bishop a lot.\n\n277\n00:13:25.414 --> 00:13:29.090\nWhich I think he thinks is playing but\nI don't think Bishop does.\n\n278\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:35.740\nSo I could take and\nsplit this cell into two columns.\n\n279\n00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.181\nAnd now I have two columns\nwithin the same column.\n\n280\n00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:44.030\nSo that's where it gets\na little distracting, I think.\n\n281\n00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.620\nBut it is completely valid and\n\n282\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.485\na command that you can do to split\nup the information of your table.\n\n283\n00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:55.710\nAll right, row height and column width.\n\n284\n00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.263\nCool.\n\n285\n00:13:56.263 --> 00:14:01.310\nCuz activity of our pets,\nI want that to be just a little wider.\n\n286\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.481\nWider this way, so\nI guess that'd be taller.\n\n287\n00:14:02.481 --> 00:14:06.620\n[LAUGH] So you get that cursor,\nget that two-pointed arrow,\n\n288\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.980\ntwo lines with the two\narrows on top of it.\n\n289\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.920\nClick hold, drag down, and\nyou can make that row higher.\n\n290\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.581\nMaybe I wanna move this\ncolumn over a little bit so\n\n291\n00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:20.091\nI have more room for the numbers.\n\n292\n00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:25.100\nTwo lines, two arrows on the column and\nyou pull this over.\n\n293\n00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.930\nSame thing here.\n\n294\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.900\nMaybe I pull this guy over a little more.\n\n295\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.089\nSo this is where, you see how that\nsplit cell, it doesn't understand.\n\n296\n00:14:32.089 --> 00:14:34.430\nNow your columns are off.\n\n297\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:39.172\nCuz it, the way the tables are supposed\nto be is just cells and cells and cells.\n\n298\n00:14:39.172 --> 00:14:42.345\n&gt;&gt; Right, it could end up making more\nwork for you in trying to go back and\n\n299\n00:14:42.345 --> 00:14:45.047\nmanually moving all those\nlittle components there, so.\n\n300\n00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:45.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n301\n00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.210\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm with you, yeah.\n\n302\n00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.710\n&gt;&gt; Cool!\n\n303\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.918\nSo we're gonna undo, and\nthen we're going to merge these cells.\n\n304\n00:14:52.918 --> 00:14:55.488\nAnd then now it just says 3, 1.\n\n305\n00:14:55.488 --> 00:14:59.148\nThat`s okay, we'll just take our cursor,\nwe'll click in front of the 1.\n\n306\n00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:00.083\nHit the Backspace.\n\n307\n00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:02.140\nGet it into where it`s only one paragraph.\n\n308\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.270\nThat`s where turning on those\nshow/hides can be really handy.\n\n309\n00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.200\nI usually keep them off when doing tables\nbecause I think those little square\n\n310\n00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.610\nthings, they start to get\na little distracting.\n\n311\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.445\n&gt;&gt; Too much?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'll turn that off and\n\n312\n00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:17.590\nwe can go back in to\nchanging our column widths.\n\n313\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.840\nBut see, it's still keeping that\noverall width of the table.\n\n314\n00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.270\nThis is still its own edge as well,\n\n315\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.840\nlike it's still its own column even\nthough it's the end of the table.\n\n316\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:34.280\nIf you move that in, it will move\nthe width of the entire table.\n\n317\n00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.690\nSo, whichever way you wanna do it.\n\n318\n00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.790\nAll the way, or just within the edges, so.\n\n319\n00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.990\n&gt;&gt; And if you had like a,\nlet's say, a predetermined size,\n\n320\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.590\nmaybe for an assignment or something.\n\n321\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.086\nYou were given something that said,\nhey, I'm need,\n\n322\n00:15:49.086 --> 00:15:52.467\nI'm going to be cutting this out,\ngluing it onto shoeboxes or whatever.\n\n323\n00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:54.877\nSo we need like 2.5 inched tables.\n\n324\n00:15:54.877 --> 00:15:58.579\nSo is there a way that we could\nactually specify a certain length?\n\n325\n00:15:58.579 --> 00:16:01.836\nI feel like you’ve done a project\nlike this before with your children.\n\n326\n00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.746\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ding, ding, ding\n\n327\n00:16:04.746 --> 00:16:06.536\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n328\n00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:11.385\nWell, that’s, you can, you can specify\nthat I need this row to be this wide or\n\n329\n00:16:11.385 --> 00:16:16.400\nI guess this tall, and then the column to\nbe this wide, so let’s check that out.\n\n330\n00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.160\nLet’s select this row, these are things\nwe’re gonna be cutting out and\n\n331\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.404\ngluing on our shoe box.\n\n332\n00:16:21.404 --> 00:16:23.391\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We come over to Layou and\n\n333\n00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:25.070\nthe heighth and the width.\n\n334\n00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:30.360\nNow the heighth right here, since it's\nmeasuring the row I can start bumping that\n\n335\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.480\nup, and then I can make it to\nwhatever specification that I need.\n\n336\n00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.950\nThe same way would be if you go ahead and\nselect, and I'm just using the i beam\n\n337\n00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.750\nnow and selecting down You can then change\nthe width of that particular column,\n\n338\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.810\nthere's actually points that\nsomething that I wanted to show you.\n\n339\n00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.840\nLook at what it's doing to\nthe activity of our pets.\n\n340\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.720\nIt's not doing that.\n\n341\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.070\nYes, so-\n&gt;&gt; That was funky.\n\n342\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:56.822\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n343\n00:16:56.822 --> 00:16:58.660\n&gt;&gt; They because I had\n\n344\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.150\nselected those particular\n&gt;&gt; Columns individually or\n\n345\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.820\nthose cells individually, and it wasn't\nallowing, this is because I do have\n\n346\n00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.620\na merged cell on this one because I can't,\nit sees this on top, it's like well,\n\n347\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:18.170\neverybody because that row,\nit's merged across.\n\n348\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:24.450\nBut it is a point that if I had\njust selected This, does one row.\n\n349\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.530\nComing into the row heighth.\n\n350\n00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.450\nI'm sorry, I keep mixing these up.\n\n351\n00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.484\nThe column width and move this in.\n\n352\n00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:34.190\nIt's only changing that one and\nnot all of them.\n\n353\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:39.890\nSo, try not to, in this case, select and\nthen change the column width.\n\n354\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.590\nHave nothing selected.\n\n355\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.523\nChange the column width.\n\n356\n00:17:42.523 --> 00:17:48.092\nAnd the same way that if you are trying to\nchange the column width by the numbers,\n\n357\n00:17:48.092 --> 00:17:50.440\nmake sure you have all of them.\n\n358\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.000\nThe merge cell is throwing us off for\na little bit.\n\n359\n00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.610\nI think you get the idea that if I didn't\nhave a merge cell, you had just left\n\n360\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:01.420\nthe column, come up here to the width And\nthen everybody will just type that.\n\n361\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.530\n&gt;&gt; Unit of measurement in that little\nfield right there so, perfect.\n\n362\n00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, yes awesome.\n\n363\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.380\nWhat about distributing because I have\nthis, this is the one that I would,\n\n364\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.960\ndefinitely, I use this a lot because I\ndon't like that they are not the exact\n\n365\n00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.830\nsame widths, so,\nI could distribute the columns.\n\n366\n00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.794\nGood, okay, that makes me feel better.\n\n367\n00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:25.045\n[LAUGH] Now, I know that all\nthe columns are the exact same width.\n\n368\n00:18:25.045 --> 00:18:26.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n369\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.040\nthe same with distribute the rows,\nnow they’re all the exact same height.\n\n370\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.212\nI’m feeling a lot better right now.\n\n371\n00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:33.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.160\n&gt;&gt; Well, can we, if we center our title,\n\n373\n00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.510\nthen I would feel better.\n\n374\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.095\n&gt;&gt; Let's do that.\n\n375\n00:18:38.095 --> 00:18:40.640\n[LAUGH] Cause we want everybody\nto be happy right now.\n\n376\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.750\nAnd this is just text, right?\n\n377\n00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.730\nAnd it's just like if I was doing text\nin a paragraph, I put my cursor in\n\n378\n00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.220\nthe paragraph, come over to home,\nand then hit the center button.\n\n379\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:51.750\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGHS] Not vertically, yeah.\n\n383\n00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.410\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n384\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.612\nVertical justification is\na big pet peeve of mine.\n\n385\n00:19:03.612 --> 00:19:09.597\nThe nice thing is that, you can\ncontrol that with your layout tab and\n\n386\n00:19:09.597 --> 00:19:14.400\nchange the alignment of your cell content.\n\n387\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.210\nYes, I had gone over to the home tab and\nused the center button.\n\n388\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.290\nTotally fine.\n\n389\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.390\nLet me undo that, because the other way\nI could have done it is that this is\n\n390\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.920\ncontent within a cell,\ncursor's in the cell.\n\n391\n00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.190\nI could change it up here.\n\n392\n00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.700\nSo, all these buttons and\nlet's zoom in a little bit so you can, and\n\n393\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:36.330\nit's nice that they give you these\nkind of representations of Top left,\n\n394\n00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.620\ntop center, top right,\nbottom right, bottom center, so\n\n395\n00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.530\nwhich way do you want it to be,\nvertically or horizontally?\n\n396\n00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.220\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know where I'm at, and\n\n409\n00:20:25.387 --> 00:20:26.496\neverything's good.\n\n410\n00:20:26.496 --> 00:20:28.503\nAnd hey-\n&gt;&gt; There's peace in the world.\n\n411\n00:20:28.503 --> 00:20:29.089\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n412\n00:20:29.089 --> 00:20:29.897\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n413\n00:20:29.897 --> 00:20:32.500\nat least in this little mind right here.\n\n414\n00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.332\nSo I could select all of the cells.\n\n415\n00:20:35.332 --> 00:20:38.948\nAnd make them all vertically centered and\nhorizontally centered.\n\n416\n00:20:38.948 --> 00:20:41.710\nThe center, center.\n\n417\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.900\nJustification.\n\n418\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.220\nI said justification,\nit's also another word for alignment.\n\n419\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.770\nSo right align.\n\n420\n00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:49.810\nRight justified.\n\n421\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.660\nThose types of things.\n\n422\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.318\nIt comes back from that printing.\n\n423\n00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:54.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And layouts.\n\n424\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.340\nAnd then we have our Text Direction.\n\n425\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.670\nWhat if I wanted the text to go up and\ndown and set up across, like Fuego?\n\n426\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.310\nCuz he definitely likes\nto lay on his side a lot.\n\n427\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.954\nSo Text Direction.\n\n428\n00:21:05.954 --> 00:21:07.783\nSwitch it right there, up and down,\n\n429\n00:21:07.783 --> 00:21:11.720\nall around until I basically\njust did a little circle there.\n\n430\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.450\nSo and I could take it for\nall of them if I wanted to.\n\n431\n00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:20.525\nChange it, there we go, and\nwe can turn that text direction around.\n\n432\n00:21:20.525 --> 00:21:23.811\nI will take this particular cell and\n\n433\n00:21:23.811 --> 00:21:29.519\nI'm going to left top align it\nto talk about our cell margins.\n\n434\n00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:33.739\nThat's that padding around\nthe edge of the cell.\n\n435\n00:21:33.739 --> 00:21:36.047\nAnd if I scroll in to zoom in,\n\n436\n00:21:36.047 --> 00:21:40.774\nI'm actually not scrolling up,\nI'm zooming in for you.\n\n437\n00:21:40.774 --> 00:21:45.455\nSee, there's a particular amount\nof space off that left hand side,\n\n438\n00:21:45.455 --> 00:21:49.827\nit's not right up against that\ncell wall which is usually good.\n\n439\n00:21:49.827 --> 00:21:53.493\nI don't really want it up\nagainst the cell wall and\n\n440\n00:21:53.493 --> 00:21:56.301\nthere's a specific space on the top.\n\n441\n00:21:56.301 --> 00:22:01.154\nYou can control this with your cell\nmargins cause maybe you don't want that\n\n442\n00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:02.010\nmuch space.\n\n443\n00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:06.970\nNow there's 0 on the top but there's\nstill There's still just enough but\n\n444\n00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.240\nif you want a little bit more you\ncan go ahead an increase that.\n\n445\n00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.716\nI'm just bumping the arrows.\n\n446\n00:22:11.716 --> 00:22:13.864\nLet's go ahead and bump the left.\n\n447\n00:22:13.864 --> 00:22:17.000\nI don't exactly know what\nthe measurement is gonna look like.\n\n448\n00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.908\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say that for a lot of these\ntools they actually have it real time\n\n449\n00:22:20.908 --> 00:22:23.874\nshowing you how it looks,\nbut this one, it doesn't.\n\n450\n00:22:23.874 --> 00:22:26.805\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and the live preview\nyou have when you change the font?\n\n451\n00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:27.358\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n452\n00:22:27.358 --> 00:22:29.062\nIt would be nice if they do that.\n\n453\n00:22:29.062 --> 00:22:30.314\n&gt;&gt; It would.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, we should go ahead and\n\n454\n00:22:30.314 --> 00:22:31.125\ntell Microsoft to do that.\n\n455\n00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:34.192\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; I bet you it's on the next update.\n\n456\n00:22:34.192 --> 00:22:36.100\n[LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt;

It's good, we're gonna continue on,\nlike you said.\n\n9\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.310\nWe had talked about inserting tables, we\nwere just going into the insert table and\n\n10\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.240\ngoing into the grid.\n\n11\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.035\nWe had a lot of table layouts, so\nthat's the part of the episode that, or\n\n12\n00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:39.164\nthe part of the part, wait,\npart of the part, what [LAUGH]?\n\n13\n00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.106\nThat's where we went ahead and\ndid all of those different things.\n\n14\n00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:44.560\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nnot do any more of that.\n\n15\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.990\nI just wanna show you some alternate ways\nof putting in tables into your document.\n\n16\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.120\nAnd then once you have the tables in\nthere, then you can do all the things that\n\n17\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.710\nwe covered in our part one of adding and\nremoving columns.\n\n18\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.441\nAnd then our alignment to make sure\nthat we're in that central center space\n\n19\n00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:00.977\n[LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:06.499\nSo let's jump down into our page and I\nhave a file called convert text to table,\n\n21\n00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:10.270\ncuz that's exactly what we're going to do.\n\n22\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.021\nIn the Word Essentials show,\nwe talked a lot about tab stops,\n\n23\n00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:15.764\nI'm a huge fan of tab stops.\n\n24\n00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:20.279\nI think they're the most fantastic\nthings ever and how we could format it.\n\n25\n00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:25.177\nAnd we did mention in that\nparticular show that we could think\n\n26\n00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:28.740\nabout tab stops in relationship to tables.\n\n27\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.770\nCuz we're making columns, in a sense,\n\n28\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.620\nto organize our information and\nseparating it by a tab.\n\n29\n00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.220\nAnd then formatting our tabs to stop at a\ncertain place and then align accordingly.\n\n30\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.070\nAnd then any time we want a new\nparagraph or you can think a new row,\n\n31\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.910\nwe went ahead and did that.\n\n32\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.420\nSo if you had a specific type of\ndelimiter, some type of separator\n\n33\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.340\nsuch as tabs,\nyou could convert that text into a table.\n\n34\n00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.490\nAnd we'll see everywhere we hit that\ntab key, it will make a column.\n\n35\n00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.980\nEverywhere we hit that enter,\nit's gonna make a row.\n\n36\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.230\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of cool, it's like you're\nhalf way there, so let's just go ahead and\n\n37\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.470\nlive on the edge and\nturn it in to a table.\n\n38\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.030\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, living on the edge.\n\n39\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.023\nI really want to start singing right now.\n\n40\n00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:20.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's probably a bad idea, though.\n\n41\n00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.240\nBut yes, exactly, so why not?\n\n42\n00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.490\nBecause there are certain things you\ncan do with tables in formatting and\n\n43\n00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.070\nmoving them around that you\ncan't necessarily do with tabs.\n\n44\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.120\nAnd of course, there's reasons for\nnot having it go into a table.\n\n45\n00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.930\nBut like you said, why not,\nlet's just throw it in there.\n\n46\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.960\nNow I'm using tabs in this example,\njust cuz I love them.\n\n47\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.320\nBut I said the delimiter,\nwhat type of separator.\n\n48\n00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.780\nThis could just as easily be semicolons,\nthis could be commas.\n\n49\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.599\nThis could really even be a space in\nbetween, cuz sometimes you might get\n\n50\n00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.636\na comma delimited file, or\na CSV, a comma separated value.\n\n51\n00:02:56.636 --> 00:03:00.040\nAnd it is separating each\none of those by a comma.\n\n52\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.210\nAnd you still have that Enter, so the\nEnter mark is always gonna stay tried and\n\n53\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.500\ntrue as that's your next row.\n\n54\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.670\nJust depends on what type of separator\nyou have to be able to convert.\n\n55\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.520\nSo I don't want you to think that the only\nway you could do that is with tabs.\n\n56\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.410\nIt just has to be\na consistent delimiter or\n\n57\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.080\nseparator for\nit to be able to translate properly.\n\n58\n00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.200\nSo if I have this text right here, I will\nselect all of the text, go into Insert,\n\n59\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.460\ncome into Table, and\nthere is that Convert Text to Table.\n\n60\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.159\nClicking on it, it can see, hey,\nI see there’s three columns.\n\n61\n00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.526\nI see there’s, it’s grayed out,\nbut it says Number of rows.\n\n62\n00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:46.130\nIt’s gonna auto fit to the size,\nthat’s great.\n\n63\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.520\nAnd then the separator at Tabs, and that\ncould be paragraphs, commas or others.\n\n64\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that’s what I was gonna ask you,\nhow does it know?\n\n65\n00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.310\nIs it just going to accept\nanything that you put in there or\n\n66\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.750\ndo you have to specify?\n\n67\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.040\n&gt;&gt; In this sense, it did see the tabs,\nlike you're saying, but hey,\n\n68\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.700\nif it didn't see the semicolon, especially\n\n69\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.362\nbecause the semicolon's not one of those\noptions, so you could then type that in.\n\n70\n00:04:07.362 --> 00:04:10.792\nOr it could be a hyphen,\nit could be a tilde.\n\n71\n00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.515\n&gt;&gt; So that's where you would\nuse the other option there?\n\n72\n00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:15.313\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you would use the other and\n\n73\n00:04:15.313 --> 00:04:18.914\nthen put in the specific character\nthat you're using as your separator.\n\n74\n00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:20.806\n&gt;&gt; This is really cool, Vonne\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:21.828\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n76\n00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:24.149\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I use this a lot,\nI mean, text to tables.\n\n77\n00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:28.208\nAnd of course, if you can do a table,\nyou can also, once you get it in a table,\n\n78\n00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:29.480\nyou convert into text.\n\n79\n00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.190\nSo, cuz sometimes I have a table, but\n\n80\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.390\nI don't want it to be in that particular\nformat, I just need the information out.\n\n81\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, so it can go both ways?\n\n82\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it might have gotten to me in\na table, but I just need the content so\n\n83\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.050\nI might convert it out into text.\n\n84\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.090\nThen use a find and\n\n85\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.100\nreplace to say replace all of the tabs\nwith a space or something to that effect.\n\n86\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.658\nAnd then now I have just text that I\ncan do whatever I needed to do with.\n\n87\n00:04:54.658 --> 00:04:58.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, I could see the real value\neven being with those CSV files,\n\n88\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.700\nbecause normally, the reason you'd\nbe working with one of those\n\n89\n00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.520\nfiles is because you're dealing\nwith a large amount of information.\n\n90\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.466\nSo instead of having to re-input or\n\n91\n00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:10.530\nre-type all of that information, you could\njust export it in a different format.\n\n92\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.467\nSo really efficient here.\n\n93\n00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:17.307\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, definitely, so, and\nwe're a bunch of geeks anyways,\n\n94\n00:05:17.307 --> 00:05:20.571\nwe're just like this is so cool [LAUGH].\n\n95\n00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:23.420\nSo I click OK, and there it goes,\nthere is my table.\n\n96\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.106\nAnd now I can format accordingly and\nadd and subtract and\n\n97\n00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:29.470\ndo what I need to do, so there we go.\n\n98\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.890\nAnd the same thing here,\nagain, there are tabs.\n\n99\n00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.356\nIt will see that, convert it to a,\n\n100\n00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:39.670\nthis is a table,\nclick OK and there you go.\n\n101\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.360\nNow this one,\nI don't know why it didn't work.\n\n102\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.850\nThis is what I wanted to prove cuz I was\nlike, why did I have two examples in here?\n\n103\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.950\nBecause if you have\nthe delimiters in the wrong space,\n\n104\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.650\nbetween Daniel and Outlook, there\nwasn't a tab, there was just a space.\n\n105\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.868\nSo it threw off, I'm like,\nwhy is a ten there?\n\n106\n00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:01.570\nI did this on purpose,\nyeah, I remember now.\n\n107\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.372\nIt really should have been over, so\n\n108\n00:06:03.372 --> 00:06:06.379\nthat's the whole if your\ndelimiters aren't consistent,\n\n109\n00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.943\nit's not gonna necessarily put everything-\n&gt;&gt; Skew the results there,\n\n110\n00:06:09.943 --> 00:06:10.810\nor the are order.\n\n111\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, cuz now it's like,\nwell Daniel Outlook is just the word.\n\n112\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.824\nThe next delimiter or\nseparator I saw was that first tab.\n\n113\n00:06:17.824 --> 00:06:21.141\nAnd I didn't see another one, but\nsince all the rest of it's the same,\n\n114\n00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.200\nI'm still gonna go ahead and\nbuild a table.\n\n115\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.442\nSo it's not gonna build you\nsome really wonky tables,\n\n116\n00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:29.800\nit's just gonna not have any information\nin the place that you want it.\n\n117\n00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.870\n&gt;&gt; So could you manually fix it, or\nwould you have to insert that delimiter\n\n118\n00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.690\nafter the table's already created,\nor how do you go about fixing that?\n\n119\n00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.950\n&gt;&gt; This is where, since it's already\ncreated, I would probably just take this,\n\n120\n00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.600\ncut it, paste it over here,\nand then take this and\n\n121\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.510\nthen cut the text and then put it in it.\n\n122\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.743\nBut this is just one row.\n\n123\n00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:53.490\nWhat if 50 of my rows\nwere messed up in this?\n\n124\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.040\nLike you said, hey, well, could I\njust put the delimiter in there now?\n\n125\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.840\nWell at this point,\nit's all ready a table.\n\n126\n00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But you kind of made me like,\n\n127\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.120\nwell the other thing could be this.\n\n128\n00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.770\nI could, let's undo,\nget it back to where it was, there we go.\n\n129\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.830\nI can select this table, come over here\nto layout, I convert it back to text.\n\n130\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.731\nAnd when it converts back to text, it's\ngonna say all right, well at every column,\n\n131\n00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.824\nput whatever separator I want it to be,\nwe'll just choose tabs here.\n\n132\n00:07:23.824 --> 00:07:29.022\nAnd now, this is where I could format\nit just as the text way of all right,\n\n133\n00:07:29.022 --> 00:07:31.150\ndelete that other tab.\n\n134\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Go back, fix your error.\n\n135\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.620\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and add that tab in there.\n\n136\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.370\nAnd now select that text again and\nconvert it back into a table.\n\n137\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.695\nSo sometimes, it might be easier to\nfix the text, like you're saying.\n\n138\n00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.955\nAnd then convert it back to a table, so\nit's like convert it to a table, ooh,\n\n139\n00:07:48.955 --> 00:07:50.385\ndidn't work, convert it back to text.\n\n140\n00:07:50.385 --> 00:07:52.482\nGo ahead and change the text,\nnow go back to the table [LAUGH].\n\n141\n00:07:52.482 --> 00:07:55.360\nSo yeah, exactly,\nwe could go whichever way.\n\n142\n00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.307\n&gt;&gt; Say that five times real fast [LAUGH].\n\n143\n00:07:56.307 --> 00:07:56.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know,\n\n144\n00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:59.715\nI'm actually surprised that came\nout of my mouth somewhat correct.\n\n145\n00:07:59.715 --> 00:08:05.000\n[LAUGH] So\nconverting text into our tables.\n\n146\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.770\nLet's jump over to that.\n\n147\n00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.410\nLet's open a new document and\nlet's zoom in just a little bit.\n\n148\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.820\nCuz you could insert some quick tables.\n\n149\n00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.489\nThese are just some\npre-formatted examples and\n\n150\n00:08:16.489 --> 00:08:20.590\nlayouts that may have a lot of merge\ncells, it might have some split cells,\n\n151\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.341\nit might have some formatting and\nall that stuff.\n\n152\n00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:25.280\nI'll be like, there's like a calendar.\n\n153\n00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.900\nNow, that's not saying that\nit's going to actually make\n\n154\n00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.820\na calendar to the right-\n&gt;&gt;

A little bit of creative inspiration.\n\n200\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:36.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n201\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.277\n&gt;&gt; Good to go and then build your\nown from the design up and so\n\n202\n00:10:41.277 --> 00:10:44.640\nlike picking and choosing and\nchanging things as an after thought.\n\n203\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.724\n&gt;&gt;

Well, I mean they have a whole\nwebs that are up, Pinterest,\n\n211\n00:11:06.107 --> 00:11:08.536\nthat's kinda the whole concept behind it,\nright?\n\n212\n00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:10.663\nWho would have thought that it would catch\non, of course it would have catch on.\n\n213\n00:11:10.663 --> 00:11:11.669\nIt's Sparks Creativity, right?\n\n214\n00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:17.133\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so at least you know that you\n\n217\n00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.475\nhave the quick table-\n&gt;&gt; The sub-option.\n\n218\n00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:27.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for that.\n\n219\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.437\nLet's do a Ctrl+A, for select all.\n\n220\n00:11:29.437 --> 00:11:31.600\nWe'll hit Delete to get rid of everything.\n\n221\n00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.010\nSo the other ways that we\ncan insert our tables.\n\n222\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.978\nWe have draw table.\n\n223\n00:11:36.978 --> 00:11:38.650\nThat could be fun.\n\n224\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.620\nThis is where if you really\nwanted to get creative of,\n\n225\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.240\ninstead of taking your five rows and\n15 columns, 15 might be a little much, and\n\n226\n00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.483\nthen taking and selecting and\nmerging them all together.\n\n227\n00:11:49.483 --> 00:11:53.845\nMaybe I have a specific layout\ndesign that I want my tables to\n\n228\n00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:58.043\nbe in because I want this area\nto put a lot of information.\n\n229\n00:11:58.043 --> 00:12:00.339\nThis is where you maybe\nhave a lot of paragraphs,\n\n230\n00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:02.980\nand then this is like\nsome other little blocks.\n\n231\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:08.230\nYou can create all of the different\ncells in the table by just drawing them.\n\n232\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.565\nLet me show you, draw table.\n\n233\n00:12:10.565 --> 00:12:12.897\nNow you get your cursor in here and\nit has a little pencil.\n\n234\n00:12:12.897 --> 00:12:15.388\nSo let's click hold and drag and\n\n235\n00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:20.520\ndraw the first big part like\nthe whole outside of our table.\n\n236\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.665\nNow where do I wanna put my columns and\nmy rows?\n\n237\n00:12:22.665 --> 00:12:26.766\nCuz maybe I wanna make this whole side\nright here see I'll just click hold\n\n238\n00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:27.380\nand drag.\n\n239\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.741\nThat's gonna be one side,\ncuz this is a talk about creativity.\n\n240\n00:12:30.741 --> 00:12:32.987\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So this is where I'm gonna talk about\n\n241\n00:12:32.987 --> 00:12:35.570\nthe overall vision of the company.\n\n242\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.920\nAnd then I wanna divide it\nin half right about here.\n\n243\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.240\nAnd then each one of these,\nthis is where we gonna have our different\n\n244\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.050\ncompany values, and\nwe have four company values.\n\n245\n00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.723\nAnd I wanna put that right here.\n\n246\n00:12:47.723 --> 00:12:51.040\nSo each one of them is\ngonna have a company value.\n\n247\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.037\nAnd then this area down here this is where\nI wanted to have more information but\n\n248\n00:12:55.037 --> 00:12:58.806\nmaybe just like a little part right here,\nI wanna divide it right there.\n\n249\n00:12:58.806 --> 00:13:02.010\nSo cool now I have all\nof my little pieces.\n\n250\n00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.100\nSo it's you're designing the place\nwhere you want all the text in.\n\n251\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.551\nThen you can type in your text,\nyou can add some pictures in there.\n\n252\n00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:11.543\nYou can change the colors and\nthe format, so,\n\n253\n00:13:11.543 --> 00:13:16.635\nit's almost like creating your own\ngraphic for whatever you want to display.\n\n254\n00:13:17.805 --> 00:13:19.945\nAnd then, like I said,\nchange some colors and then you're off.\n\n255\n00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:27.590\nSo this would be one, two,\nthree, four, probably four rows.\n\n256\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.312\nOne, two, three, four,\nthat'll be four columns.\n\n257\n00:13:30.312 --> 00:13:34.413\nYou have to merge these, merge these,\nbut you see I think that way because\n\n258\n00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:38.646\nback in the day from formatting HTML\ntables, and how you have to use tables to\n\n259\n00:13:38.646 --> 00:13:42.050\ndesign your pages,\nI got really creative with kinda stuff.\n\n260\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.680\nAnd you put tables,\n\n261\n00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.646\ninside the tables, inside the tables and-\n&gt;&gt; And if you would like started\n\n262\n00:13:45.646 --> 00:13:50.246\nusing primary colors and thick black lines\nwhat is that Mondrian style articles?\n\n263\n00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.253\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mondrian.\n\n264\n00:13:51.253 --> 00:13:51.839\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that was on my book.\n\n268\n00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:03.938\nRemember, there's a hair company\nback in the 80s that had all of the-\n\n269\n00:14:03.938 --> 00:14:04.508\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n270\n00:14:04.508 --> 00:14:06.961\nWhen we used to put holes and\nthat it was own layer-\n\n271\n00:14:06.961 --> 00:14:08.593\n&gt;&gt; StudioLine from Loreal.\n\n272\n00:14:08.593 --> 00:14:10.498\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I totally remembered from\n\n273\n00:14:10.498 --> 00:14:11.173\nthe commercials.\n\n274\n00:14:11.173 --> 00:14:12.995\n&gt;&gt; And\nI know exactly what you're talking about.\n\n275\n00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:15.743\nSo that is sad but okay, we digress.\n\n276\n00:14:15.743 --> 00:14:17.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yet\n\n277\n00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.460\nagain, I'm going back to middle school.\n\n278\n00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.533\nWhy do I always go there?\n\n279\n00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:26.341\nBut yes, we can go ahead and draw our\ntables to how ever we want it to be.\n\n280\n00:14:26.341 --> 00:14:30.367\n&gt;&gt; I've seen that option but I have never\nonce even attempted to go ahead and\n\n281\n00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:32.547\nclick on it to see what it was all about.\n\n282\n00:14:32.547 --> 00:14:33.619\nSo it's pretty cool, Vonne.\n\n283\n00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:34.490\n&gt;&gt; Nice, yeah.\n\n284\n00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.850\nIt's one of those hey,\nyou've got to try it and\n\n285\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:40.650\nthen putting it on a context like,\nI can see how I could use that.\n\n286\n00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.610\nThat sometimes is just that part that you\nneeded just a little push along the way.\n\n287\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.679\nSo a few things that I wanted to add in\nthis part two of the creating our tables\n\n288\n00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:53.877\nand then change in a layout because I\ndon't know exactly where to put these two\n\n289\n00:14:53.877 --> 00:14:55.181\nlittle things in here.\n\n290\n00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:58.242\nSo I'm like, should I put it in\na formatting when we change colors,\n\n291\n00:14:58.242 --> 00:14:59.437\nit's not really colors.\n\n292\n00:14:59.437 --> 00:15:02.740\nEh, I'll go ahead and throw it in here.\n\n293\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.930\nSorting and using your formulas\nwithin your tables, and\n\n294\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.665\nthe other reason is because it's on\nthe layout tab, and it's right over here.\n\n295\n00:15:09.665 --> 00:15:12.760\n[LAUGH] So I figure that's why we'll\ngo ahead and put it in this episode.\n\n296\n00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.510\nI have a file.\n\n297\n00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.829\nYep, formulas and sort, and this is a,\nremember we did the convert text to tables\n\n298\n00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:23.101\ncuz we've got all of our hosts in here,\nand here's our sort.\n\n299\n00:15:23.101 --> 00:15:26.365\nNow this is where, when you start\ngetting into some of this stuff,\n\n300\n00:15:26.365 --> 00:15:28.481\nyou could really like, well this is Word.\n\n301\n00:15:28.481 --> 00:15:30.514\nLike if I'm gonna be\ndoing a lot of formulas-\n\n302\n00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:32.745\n&gt;&gt; Then I hop over to Excel.\n\n303\n00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:34.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.875\n&gt;&gt; That's where I would probably go.\n\n305\n00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:39.188\nBut maybe you're doing a report,\nan annual report for\n\n306\n00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:44.172\na company, the state of the company and\nyou have to create all these information.\n\n307\n00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:48.841\nWell, Excel is not a word processor and\nWord is not a spreadsheet application.\n\n308\n00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:50.790\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\nyou don't want to have multiple documents.\n\n309\n00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.430\nLet's just create something\nthat has everything combined.\n\n310\n00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.850\nIt's nice to know you\nhave this functionality.\n\n311\n00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.716\nAnd that's really what it is.\n\n312\n00:15:56.716 --> 00:15:58.521\nWe just saw the creative aspect of it.\n\n313\n00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:01.304\nBut this is a great tool\nto know how to use.\n\n314\n00:16:01.304 --> 00:16:03.833\nBecause it just is Functional tool.\n\n315\n00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:04.882\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n316\n00:16:04.882 --> 00:16:08.080\nAnd we do have an episode where we're\ngoing to talk about linked content.\n\n317\n00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.530\nSo if you've got everything in Excel,\nwhy do I have to recreate the wheel?\n\n318\n00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.020\nWhy don't I just put it in here?\n\n319\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.380\nAnd even cooler, would be if I\nchange my information in Excel,\n\n320\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.720\nI want it to change my Word document.\n\n321\n00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.230\nSo then, you can link it together.\n\n322\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.950\nThat's taking this the next level.\n\n323\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.120\nBut here, this is separate\nthan anything in Excel, but\n\n324\n00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.730\nwe can do some very limited things\nwith sorting and using our functions.\n\n325\n00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.600\nSo we have, and I'm gonna turn on show and\nhide, cuz that's a little distracting.\n\n326\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.240\nSo we have our sort here.\n\n327\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.160\nWe have host, show and episodes.\n\n328\n00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.360\nI do have headings on each\none of these columns.\n\n329\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.600\nDo you have to?\n\n330\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.000\nNo, but\nin the sort that I'm gonna show you,\n\n331\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.570\nit would just start referring to this as\ncolumn one, column two, column three.\n\n332\n00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.490\nSo just keep that in mind\nif you don't have headings.\n\n333\n00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.730\nSo, I could sort this by, hey, maybe I\nwant in alphabetical order the host.\n\n334\n00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.360\nOr maybe I want the shows to\nbe in alphabetical order.\n\n335\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.090\nMaybe I want to see like well,\nthen who had the most episodes.\n\n336\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.117\nThese are completely made up numbers,\nby the way.\n\n337\n00:17:09.117 --> 00:17:10.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, okay, yeah,\n\n338\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.160\nI see why you said that.\n\n339\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.510\nShe's got me with the lowest\nnumber of episodes on this line.\n\n340\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.450\nI'm like wait,\nis she cueing me for something?\n\n341\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.611\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n342\n00:17:20.611 --> 00:17:23.690\nI threw that in today cuz I'm like,\nI'm working with Cherokee today.\n\n343\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.492\nThe first time I ever hosted and\nworked together, so\n\n344\n00:17:26.492 --> 00:17:28.551\nI'll just put her with a three [LAUGH].\n\n345\n00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:30.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that sounds about accurate,\n\n346\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.270\nwe're blondes so we'll roll with it.\n\n347\n00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so we've got all\nthese different ways we can host,\n\n348\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.770\nmaybe do I want ascending or\ndescending in episode.\n\n349\n00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.300\nSo how you want it to sort is up to you.\n\n350\n00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.300\nClicking in any of our columns,\nany of our cells,\n\n351\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.270\nI come to Layout, I come over to Sort.\n\n352\n00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:54.110\nIt automatically highlights the whole\ntable and then gives me the Sort By.\n\n353\n00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.110\nSort by Show then Host.\n\n354\n00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.290\nHost then Show.\n\n355\n00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.720\nEpisode, then Host.\n\n356\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.600\nIt's up to you.\n\n357\n00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.500\nLet's go with Host text,\nyes, because it is text.\n\n358\n00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.630\nWe're using the paragraphs.\n\n359\n00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.020\nYou do have some drop-downs in here.\n\n360\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.900\nIt automatically sees that this is text,\nbut maybe it wasn't text.\n\n361\n00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.940\nAnd then, you're like, no, it's numbers.\n\n362\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.880\nSo you can force it to do that.\n\n363\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.830\nOr if you have right\nhere using paragraphs.\n\n364\n00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.999\nWell, that's the only thing we have.\n\n365\n00:18:16.999 --> 00:18:20.180\nAnd then ascending or descending order.\n\n366\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.083\nMaybe Host, then by Show.\n\n367\n00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:24.970\nAnd I'll do the ascending order there.\n\n368\n00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.580\nAnd hey, there you're at the top there.\n\n369\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.575\n[LAUGH] So we can do it and I can see it.\n\n370\n00:18:30.575 --> 00:18:34.735\nOkay, well, Daniel, since he has\nmultiples, it goes Outlook then Word.\n\n371\n00:18:34.735 --> 00:18:36.991\nJust like the sorting\nthat I wanted it to do.\n\n372\n00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:41.485\nIf I wanted it to go by episodes,\njust to show it,\n\n373\n00:18:41.485 --> 00:18:45.635\nyou can say by Episodes, then by None.\n\n374\n00:18:45.635 --> 00:18:50.230\nMaybe don't I really want a second\nlevel sort, for whatever reason.\n\n375\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.850\nAnd the episodes I can go ascending or\ndescending.\n\n376\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.700\nLet's go with descending for fun.\n\n377\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.710\nAnd then you can see that Daniel wins,\nhe hosts a lot of shows.\n\n378\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.560\nAnd we've actually hosted a lot of shows\ntogether, so that's why he's at the top.\n\n379\n00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.910\nBut those are different\nways that you can sort.\n\n380\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.219\nVery basic, very easy to go ahead and\ndo right here within Word and our tables.\n\n381\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.145\nNow, the formulas.\n\n382\n00:19:12.145 --> 00:19:15.770\nThat's one of those where, hey,\nI can go ahead and add all of these up.\n\n383\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.673\nOkay, 55 plus I'm not-\n&gt;&gt;

Save,\n\n541\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.418\nit is a Word file, it is a docx,\nand it is whatever its name is.\n\n542\n00:26:40.418 --> 00:26:42.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If I open it up tomorrow,\n\n543\n00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.650\nnow see how this is like,\nit's not the same look as an image or\n\n544\n00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.720\na table, cuz notice,\nI don't have any contextual tabs up here.\n\n545\n00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:55.650\nSo this isn't exactly the same\nas a graphical element.\n\n546\n00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.200\nIt is an object inside of Word.\n\n547\n00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.385\nSo it's Excel living inside of Word.\n\n548\n00:27:02.385 --> 00:27:07.069\n[LAUGHS] And so if I double-click on this,\nand it does this freaky-outy thing.\n\n549\n00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:09.347\nComes back in, back in Excel.\n\n550\n00:27:09.347 --> 00:27:11.105\nAnd I do this every single time.\n\n551\n00:27:11.105 --> 00:27:13.010\nI always wanna click that X.\n\n552\n00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.990\nThat's the file.\n\n553\n00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.600\nThat's not how you do it.\n\n554\n00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.940\nAnd so I can do any type of formatting.\n\n555\n00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.910\nAnd I'm just gonna do that for now and\nthrow on some borders just to say hey,\n\n556\n00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:30.590\nI just wanna have the functionality\nof Excel in this object within Word.\n\n557\n00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.480\nSo that, doing all of our crazy\ncalculations and everything,\n\n558\n00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.930\nyou can still be in Word.\n\n559\n00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:35.830\nYou don't even have to go on Excel.\n\n560\n00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.200\nRemember I said something\nabout linked objects?\n\n561\n00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.420\nThis is not that.\n\n562\n00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.870\nThis is an embedded object.\n\n563\n00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.090\nSo embedded, live inside,\nversus linked, live outside.\n\n564\n00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.290\nAnd then make that kind of connection.\n\n565\n00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:54.341\nSo two different ways, but\nboth of those are objects within Word.\n\n566\n00:27:54.341 --> 00:27:57.467\nDouble-click or, yeah, click off the side.\n\n567\n00:27:57.467 --> 00:28:00.594\nFreaks out again, and\nthen you're back into Word.\n\n568\n00:28:00.594 --> 00:28:04.640\nAnd this object will act like an object.\n\n569\n00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:10.980\nSo that is the last thing I wanted to show\nyou about how to insert tables into Word.\n\n570\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.185\nI almost said Excel.\n\n571\n00:28:12.185 --> 00:28:13.460\n[LAUGH] Into Word.\n\n572\n00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.703\nAnd we left off with embedding an Excel\nspreadsheet inside of our Word document.\n\n573\n00:28:18.703 --> 00:28:21.532\n&gt;&gt; We'll we've came quite\nthe way here with our tables.\n\n574\n00:28:21.532 --> 00:28:22.916\nI felt like I've learned so much.\n\n575\n00:28:22.916 --> 00:28:27.152\nI know I've definitely been able to\nbrush up and improve my skills here.\n\n576\n00:28:27.152 --> 00:28:28.168\nSo thank you, Vonne.\n\n577\n00:28:28.168 --> 00:28:30.078\nAnd thank you for joining us as well.\n\n578\n00:28:30.078 --> 00:28:32.485\nWe do have more information\nheaded your way.\n\n579\n00:28:32.485 --> 00:28:34.564\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n580\n00:28:34.564 --> 00:28:36.700\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n581\n00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n582\n00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.308\n&gt;&gt; See you here next\ntime at Office Pro TV.\n\n583\n00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:45.771\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] I like that.\n\n7\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.980\n&gt;&gt; You started setting the table before,\nright?\n\n8\n00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.604\nOkay, and I brought some china and\nI got a couple bottles of vino,\n\n9\n00:00:25.604 --> 00:00:27.872\nwe're gonna make a nice\nbeautiful table here, right?\n\n10\n00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:28.743\n&gt;&gt; I love that idea.\n\n11\n00:00:28.743 --> 00:00:29.479\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n12\n00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:30.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love a good dinner party,\nright?\n\n13\n00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:31.376\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n14\n00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:35.040\n&gt;&gt; Bring the vino,\nI bring the food, we got it going.\n\n15\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.890\n&gt;&gt; And ravioli O's.\n\n16\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.300\n&gt;&gt; I like that, I love that.\n\n17\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.700\nSo that's exactly what we're\ndoing here in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.350\nWe're going to be taking our table and\nmaking it look pretty.\n\n19\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.180\nWe're going to apply some color.\n\n20\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.330\nWe brought our china out.\n\n21\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.640\nWe're gonna place it out and\nmake everything look really nice.\n\n22\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.560\nSo we've gone through our other episodes\nof where we've actually added tables.\n\n23\n00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.350\nAnd we added the content into our tables.\n\n24\n00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.677\nAnd so now we're just gonna format.\n\n25\n00:00:57.677 --> 00:01:01.520\nWe're not gonna format, we're gonna\nfocus on the format, [LAUGH] and\n\n26\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.830\nmaking it look pretty.\n\n27\n00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.381\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n28\n00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:09.211\nI have a file that we have actually\nworked in when we were doing\n\n29\n00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.860\nour introduction to tables.\n\n30\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.850\nAnd I think we might have\nseen this file a couple times\n\n31\n00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.200\nthroughout the different table episodes.\n\n32\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.950\nSo you haven't checked those out,\ndefinitely go back and check them out.\n\n33\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.845\n&gt;&gt; Yes, watch them all.\n\n34\n00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:21.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.980\n&gt;&gt; Numerous times.\n\n36\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.130\n&gt;&gt; I like that, yes,\n\n37\n00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.310\ndefinitely listen to Zach and\nwatch them all right in succession.\n\n38\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n39\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.020\n&gt;&gt; I guess, but\nyou don't have to if you don't want to.\n\n40\n00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.225\n&gt;&gt; No, you could go out and\norder it, just watch them all.\n\n41\n00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so\n\n42\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.090\nwhat do I need to do in this table\nto make it look a little better?\n\n43\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.530\nSomething to make this first row\nkinda pop out a little bit more.\n\n44\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.490\nOne of the first ways that we could do\nthat is to maybe add a different color\n\n45\n00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.310\nto the top of the cells.\n\n46\n00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.180\nMaybe go ahead and change the text.\n\n47\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.103\nMaybe make it bigger.\n\n48\n00:01:51.103 --> 00:01:52.558\nMaybe make it a different color.\n\n49\n00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:56.441\nNow the text formatting, that's something\nwe've already done through in other\n\n50\n00:01:56.441 --> 00:02:00.030\nepisodes in our Word Essentials show\nof just changing font and size.\n\n51\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.995\nIt doesn't matter that this text is in\na table, in the cells of the table.\n\n52\n00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.840\nBut still text is text is text.\n\n53\n00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.575\n&gt;&gt; Text is text.\n\n54\n00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:09.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nhow many times can I say that there, Zach?\n\n55\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Text is toast.\n\n56\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Why,\nwe always seem to go to food, don't we?\n\n57\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.850\n&gt;&gt; We do, we talk about food a lot.\n\n58\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.280\nSorry, sorry.\n\n59\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.770\n&gt;&gt; We mentioned raviolis too, so I mean,\n\n60\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.858\nwhat goes better with raviolis\nthan some Texas toast.\n\n61\n00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:21.561\n&gt;&gt; Gotta have it.\n\n62\n00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so we're going to\nselect our text which are in cells so\n\n63\n00:02:25.803 --> 00:02:29.692\nwe're gonna format those two\ndifferent parts of it, the text and\n\n64\n00:02:29.692 --> 00:02:31.770\nthe cells together.\n\n65\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.550\nSo you always want to select to effect and\nyou could either be selecting columns,\n\n66\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.570\nmultiple cells, this row,\nhave it which way you want to go ahead and\n\n67\n00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.470\nselect with all those different\ntechniques that we've learned about.\n\n68\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.490\nGo right ahead.\n\n69\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.860\nSo on our home tab on our ribbon,\nthis is our regular text formatting.\n\n70\n00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.661\nSo let's maybe make it bold and let's bump\nup the size, maybe one or two point sizes\n\n71\n00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:54.581\nor increments to go ahead and\ngive that a little bit of a definition.\n\n72\n00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:57.070\nNow we're gonna come over\nto our contextual tab.\n\n73\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.945\nWe're gonna come over into our Design tab.\n\n74\n00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.874\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, right?\n\n75\n00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:02.004\n&gt;&gt; Pretty, pretty things.\n\n76\n00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:05.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So this is where\nwe're gonna get into our colors.\n\n77\n00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.350\nWe're gonna get into the shading.\n\n78\n00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.050\nThat would be like your fill, your inside\ncolors that you want yourselves to be.\n\n79\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.080\nLet's start there.\n\n80\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.200\nLet's drop this down and\nwe have our regular colors and\n\n81\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.050\nthey are based upon our themes.\n\n82\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.740\nSo if we wanted to have different\ncolors available to us,\n\n83\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.520\nwe will just switch our document\ntheme over on our Design tab.\n\n84\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.440\nPretty sure it's a Design tab.\n\n85\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.815\nYou know what, let me just see.\n\n86\n00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:30.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there it is, the Design tab.\n\n87\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.190\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n88\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now we have two Design tabs.\n\n89\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Don't we?\n\n90\n00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:34.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do.\n\n91\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n92\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.705\n&gt;&gt; Because we have our contextual tabs\n\n93\n00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:42.535\nwith our table tools and then our regular\nDesign tab with our regular ribbon.\n\n94\n00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:44.174\nSo, [LAUGH] just to make sure that you're\n\n95\n00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:46.520\nnot like, well,\nwhich design are you talking about?\n\n96\n00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.515\nThis one is specifically for\n\n97\n00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:53.260\nthe shading of our table and\nwe have all of these different colors.\n\n98\n00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.570\nWe also have our more colors\navailable to us down here cuz\n\n99\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.080\nI don't see any pink in there.\n\n100\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.540\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nget into our more colors and\n\n101\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.260\njump into here, click OK and\nnow I have our shading.\n\n102\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.518\nNow one thing I do wanna point out in our\ntables, that's different than some of our\n\n103\n00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:12.776\nother graphical elements, if you've\nwatched some of the episodes on shapes, or\n\n104\n00:04:12.776 --> 00:04:15.700\nif you're going to be watching\nthe episodes on charts.\n\n105\n00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.510\nYou'd say, well,\nyou might have watched charts first.\n\n106\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.081\nI don't know, [LAUGH] but\nin the succession that I'm recording these\n\n107\n00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.869\nepisodes I haven't gotten\nto charts just yet.\n\n108\n00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:24.361\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But in those elements,\n\n109\n00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:27.020\nyou could add things like textures.\n\n110\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.200\nThe dead fish,\nremember the dead fish there?\n\n111\n00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n112\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.670\nwe'll be seeing those again\nin some other episodes.\n\n113\n00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.740\nBut right here you can't apply textures or\ngradients to the shadings of your cells.\n\n114\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.470\nIt's just not a thing that\nthey allow you to do in Word.\n\n115\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.750\nI believe you can do\nthis in PowerPoint but\n\n116\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.370\nthat's just more of a graphical\nprogram to begin with.\n\n117\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.960\nSo this is just a word processor so\nyou don't get as many options with\n\n118\n00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.330\nthe tables as you do with some of\nyour other graphical elements.\n\n119\n00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.310\nBut at least we know we have multiple\ncolors and we have our themes.\n\n120\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.029\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, I like the fuchsia.\n\n121\n00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:01.669\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia?\n[LAUGH]\n\n122\n00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.022\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia-ish.\n\n123\n00:05:03.022 --> 00:05:04.791\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I would call that.\n\n124\n00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:06.998\nYou know what,\nI'm gonna go with fuchsia-ish as well.\n\n125\n00:05:06.998 --> 00:05:08.310\nI think that's great.\n\n126\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.520\nSo, now over here on our borders.\n\n127\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.130\nThose are the different\nborders around these cells.\n\n128\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.790\nNow on this particular one\nwe have a couple different\n\n129\n00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.150\nplaces where borders could be applied.\n\n130\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.490\nYou could see we have,\nsince I have multiple cells selected,\n\n131\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.240\nI could have the borders in\nbetween the cells, all around,\n\n132\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.200\njust the outside,\njust the top, just the bottom.\n\n133\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.290\nAll the borders.\n\n134\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.368\nThat's why you have this button\nright over here, Borders..\n\n135\n00:05:31.368 --> 00:05:33.310\nAnd you also have your border painter.\n\n136\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.890\nI'll get back to that in a second.\n\n137\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.250\nLet me drop this down and show you all\nthe different options you can have.\n\n138\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.730\nBottom, top, all, outside,\ninside, vertical, horizontal.\n\n139\n00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.540\nThese are the different places\nwhere borders can be applied.\n\n140\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.450\nThe thing is I'll tell you just\nfrom my personal experience,\n\n141\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.450\nsometimes applying\nborders to tables can get\n\n142\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:01.260\na little weird only in the sense that\nit keeps turning the border painter on.\n\n143\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.020\nLet me demonstrate and\n\n144\n00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.950\nshow you where I just always have to kind\nof force myself to slow down a little bit.\n\n145\n00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.390\nThink in like which way do I want to go.\n\n146\n00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.770\nUsing this border's button or\nusing border painter?\n\n147\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.120\nI think it's kind of to each his own,\n\n148\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.110\nwhichever one you feel most comfortable\nusing, but let's demonstrate.\n\n149\n00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.590\nI have this all selected.\n\n150\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.020\nYou can choose between the styles,\nthe thickness and the color,\n\n151\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.830\nand these are all these\nboxes right within here.\n\n152\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.680\nBorder styles.\n\n153\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.490\nDo you want a single line?\n\n154\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.250\nDo you want a double line,\nthese different ones.\n\n155\n00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.810\nThis is a single solid line\nwith a different point size.\n\n156\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.100\nThis one's just a little thinner.\n\n157\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.990\nAnd I'm reading that by hovering\nover each one of these.\n\n158\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.820\nIt's giving me that, the type,\nthe size and then the color.\n\n159\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.790\nSo this is kind of everything\nall together within one style.\n\n160\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.365\nBut the styles all kind of come from\nthe type of line you can have which\n\n161\n00:06:58.365 --> 00:07:00.779\nis this particular drop down here.\n\n162\n00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:04.610\nAnd you get a few more options\nin this particular drop down.\n\n163\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.976\nDo I want dotted lines?\n\n164\n00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:09.530\nDo I want double solid lines or\nI want squiggly lines?\n\n165\n00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.189\nDo I want some, I don't even know what\nto call this thing, but it's something.\n\n166\n00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.761\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n167\n00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:17.110\nwe have these different styles\nof how I want the line to be.\n\n168\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.980\nSo maybe I'll pick, I'll pick this one\nwhere it's like a thicker line and\n\n169\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.770\nthen a thinner line.\n\n170\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.946\nNotice right away, do you see how\nthis little button like turns on?\n\n171\n00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:26.880\nIt's almost like turning\na light switch on.\n\n172\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.180\nJust know that it will always do\nthis automatically when you start\n\n173\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.220\nchoosing these formats for your borders.\n\n174\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.875\nJust keep going, and\nwe'll see where we're going.\n\n175\n00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:36.906\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Well, that's awesome.\n\n248\n00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.970\nIs there a way to do it quicker?\n\n249\n00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there is.\n\n250\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.167\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n251\n00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:19.623\nthis is where some people would\nsay this is like the lazy button.\n\n252\n00:11:19.623 --> 00:11:20.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well the thing is, to me,\n\n253\n00:11:20.648 --> 00:11:22.319\n&gt;&gt;

So let's see the efficient button.\n\n257\n00:11:26.232 --> 00:11:30.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nthat's where we start using styles okay.\n\n258\n00:11:30.641 --> 00:11:33.547\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes and we've known from other episodes\n\n259\n00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:36.970\nthat styles it's just like\na named group of formatting.\n\n260\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.948\nSo it's ways that I could just with\na single click Apply all of the different\n\n261\n00:11:41.948 --> 00:11:46.373\nshadings and borders and\nsome cool style options all with one click\n\n262\n00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:51.034\nto a couple of check boxes, and\nI can have a really nice looking table,\n\n263\n00:11:51.034 --> 00:11:55.170\nlike a professionally looking\ntable in just a couple clicks.\n\n264\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.130\nSo I really like styles.\n\n265\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.320\nI tend to just go ahead and\nuse them first.\n\n266\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If I need to\n\n267\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.520\ndo individual formatting, that's great.\n\n268\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.370\nAnd sometimes I start with a style.\n\n269\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.550\n&gt;&gt; And then come back and do some of\nthese kind of touch ups and everything.\n\n270\n00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.440\nAs I need to do.\n\n271\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.425\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So why don't I show you?\n\n272\n00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:11.060\n&gt;&gt;

We gotta be centered.\n\n325\n00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we're throwing\nan amazing party right now, right?\n\n326\n00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I have,\n\n327\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.235\n&gt;&gt; Fuego and Bishop and all their buddies.\n\n328\n00:14:55.235 --> 00:14:56.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n329\n00:14:56.435 --> 00:15:02.150\n[LAUGH] Let's come over\nback to the design tab.\n\n330\n00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.010\nThis is what I wanna talk to you about\nover here is the table styles options.\n\n331\n00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:12.430\nNotice that it does have a header row and\na banded row checked on by default.\n\n332\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.500\nAll of these styles, if I chose\na different one just to go with here,\n\n333\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.720\nyou see how it's not\nreally doing any of that.\n\n334\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.208\nBut it still has some of these options on.\n\n335\n00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:23.799\nSo, different styles Are going to have\nsome of these different options checked on\n\n336\n00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:27.560\nof off by default because that's\npart of that particular style.\n\n337\n00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.700\nThe cool thing is I can go ahead and\nchange it.\n\n338\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.966\nIf I don't want the top row\nto be formatted differently\n\n339\n00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:37.098\nin this particular style,\nI could just turn it off.\n\n340\n00:15:37.098 --> 00:15:40.727\nAnd notice that it takes off\nthat darker blue that's on top,\n\n341\n00:15:40.727 --> 00:15:43.990\nbut it's still keeping the banded rows.\n\n342\n00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.310\nIf I uncheck the banded rows well then\nit takes that coloring that is on and\n\n343\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.400\noff from the alternating rows.\n\n344\n00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.760\nIt takes that off.\n\n345\n00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.770\nBut look at how easy it is to go ahead and\nformat that.\n\n346\n00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.021\nBy just turning on the banded rows..\n\n347\n00:15:57.021 --> 00:15:57.774\nLove that.\n\n348\n00:15:57.774 --> 00:15:59.174\nAnd the white, that white text.\n\n349\n00:15:59.174 --> 00:16:01.736\nRemember, that was something\nthat I particularly applied.\n\n350\n00:16:01.736 --> 00:16:03.065\nOn my text.\n\n351\n00:16:03.065 --> 00:16:07.920\nSo that's why it looks like it went away\nwhen I turned off some of these options.\n\n352\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.262\nThat was really more me of how I did\nsome more local formatting on that\n\n353\n00:16:12.262 --> 00:16:14.636\nparticular text to have that color.\n\n354\n00:16:14.636 --> 00:16:17.030\nSo you could check these boxes on and off.\n\n355\n00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.724\nNow banded columns, I would suggest not\nhaving banded rows and banded columns\n\n356\n00:16:21.724 --> 00:16:26.341\non at the same time, because that is like,\nnow I don't have very many rows and\n\n357\n00:16:26.341 --> 00:16:30.290\ncolumns right here so\nyou have to choose one or the other.\n\n358\n00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:34.068\nIf you did have a lot of columns\nin a table this might make\n\n359\n00:16:34.068 --> 00:16:38.750\nit a little easier because you really\nwant to emphasize the change in\n\n360\n00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.714\ncolumns as opposed to turn that off,\nthe change in rows.\n\n361\n00:16:42.714 --> 00:16:44.072\nWhichever one you want,\n\n362\n00:16:44.072 --> 00:16:48.220\nat least you know it's really easy with\njust a click of a check box to do that.\n\n363\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.110\nNow, the first column,\nlast column, and total row.\n\n364\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.530\nLet's go with first column.\n\n365\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.172\nWhat's the difference there?\n\n366\n00:16:54.172 --> 00:16:59.410\nIt just took that first column and in this\nparticular style it just made it bold.\n\n367\n00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.498\nIf you add a different style it might\neven apply a background color to it.\n\n368\n00:17:03.498 --> 00:17:07.086\nSo I think it's one of\nthese down here maybe.\n\n369\n00:17:07.086 --> 00:17:08.724\nSee, there, right there.\n\n370\n00:17:08.724 --> 00:17:11.620\nThis is another point\nthat I wanted to go with.\n\n371\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.040\nNow that you see that I've\nchecked on that first column\n\n372\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.120\nin my table options you\nsee in this drop down,\n\n373\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.910\nit's giving me the previous of what\nthis particular style would look like.\n\n374\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.854\nIf you have that first column, option's on\nso there's the one I was trying to tell\n\n375\n00:17:26.854 --> 00:17:31.297\nyou that, if I choose this particular\nstyle, it will make the background\n\n376\n00:17:31.297 --> 00:17:36.192\ncolor of the shading of the first column\ndifferently because that option's on.\n\n377\n00:17:36.192 --> 00:17:36.720\nNice.\n\n378\n00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.322\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n&gt;&gt; Last column.\n\n379\n00:17:38.322 --> 00:17:39.152\nSame idea.\n\n380\n00:17:39.152 --> 00:17:42.879\nOkay, do I want to do this, because\nthink about it, when you have tables,\n\n381\n00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:46.130\nsometimes your last column,\nthose might be like the totals.\n\n382\n00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.412\nMaybe you're showing sales people and\nyou have the quarters, and\n\n383\n00:17:49.412 --> 00:17:52.704\nthen you had it all added up at\nthe last column to show their totals.\n\n384\n00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:56.943\nMaybe that first column is the thing\nthat you want to emphasize cuz it's\n\n385\n00:17:56.943 --> 00:17:58.790\nthe salespeople themselves.\n\n386\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.323\nYou can have both, some, non,\nwhichever way you want to do it and\n\n387\n00:18:02.323 --> 00:18:04.458\nthe same thing goes with the Total row.\n\n388\n00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:09.848\nThe Total row does not have\nanything to do with functions or\n\n389\n00:18:09.848 --> 00:18:15.022\nformulas or\nactually adding up anything in your table.\n\n390\n00:18:15.022 --> 00:18:19.213\nWe did do in our create and\nlayout episodes,\n\n391\n00:18:19.213 --> 00:18:25.780\nwe did talk about inserting a formula and\nsorting our table data.\n\n392\n00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.328\nSo if you wanna go back and actually\nhave it do the calculations for you,\n\n393\n00:18:29.328 --> 00:18:32.364\ndefinitely check out that episode so\nyou can see where it is.\n\n394\n00:18:32.364 --> 00:18:33.789\nThis is not a formula.\n\n395\n00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:37.060\nThis is just me physically typing in 24.\n\n396\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.969\nAnd just because it says total hours,\nit didn't have to have anything like that.\n\n397\n00:18:40.969 --> 00:18:44.040\nThat could just be the last row.\n\n398\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.129\nAll right, that's what the total\nrow option is going to do.\n\n399\n00:18:48.129 --> 00:18:52.541\nIt's just gonna change\nthe format of the last row and\n\n400\n00:18:52.541 --> 00:18:57.240\nit puts that,\nsee like the double borders on top.\n\n401\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.854\nIt makes it bold and that's all it does.\n\n402\n00:18:59.854 --> 00:19:05.330\nSo don't equate it with numbers or\nformulas, it's just formatting and\n\n403\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.650\nthese are the different options\nthat you can do within a style.\n\n404\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.734\n&gt;&gt; Question for you.\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n405\n00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:15.829\n&gt;&gt; What if I wanted to back off\nsome stuff, or remove things,\n\n406\n00:19:15.829 --> 00:19:18.009\ncan you reset the whole thing?\n\n407\n00:19:18.009 --> 00:19:21.491\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question because\nI tend to kinda come in here and\n\n408\n00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:23.340\nstart getting really creative.\n\n409\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.501\nAnd like here let's go with that,\nand then we'll take this and\n\n410\n00:19:26.501 --> 00:19:27.830\nwe'll make some borders.\n\n411\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.650\nAnd then we'll put them over here.\n\n412\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:34.027\nAnd that's when this is great and you're\nlike oops, okay so I kinda messed up.\n\n413\n00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:36.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And in some of them you have like\n\n414\n00:19:36.212 --> 00:19:37.954\na reset button, right?\n\n415\n00:19:37.954 --> 00:19:41.120\nIn all of these contextual\ntabs is our table tools,\n\n416\n00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.488\nyou don't have a reset table button.\n\n417\n00:19:43.488 --> 00:19:45.655\nThat's a good thing as you asked,\n\n418\n00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:50.450\nhow do I get it back to where just\nthe default table, nothing fancy going on.\n\n419\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.005\n&gt;&gt; Clear that formatting.\n\n420\n00:19:51.005 --> 00:19:55.814\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly\n&gt;&gt; We take this you just apply\n\n421\n00:19:55.814 --> 00:20:00.474\nthe top plane table's\nstyle the table grid.\n\n422\n00:20:00.474 --> 00:20:06.754\nYou apply that first style the default one\nand almost everything goes back to normal.\n\n423\n00:20:06.754 --> 00:20:11.830\n&gt;&gt; Now as you can see what's the one\nthing it didn't reset there?\n\n424\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.326\n&gt;&gt; The grey, the shading.\n\n425\n00:20:13.326 --> 00:20:18.470\n&gt;&gt; The text yes, because you said that\nstuff in there I can't see anymore.\n\n426\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.747\nThat was the text,\nremember we made it white didn't we?\n\n427\n00:20:20.747 --> 00:20:23.497\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yes so I have locally over-ridden\n\n428\n00:20:23.497 --> 00:20:26.330\nthe formatting of the text in here.\n\n429\n00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.210\nSo my table style is only\ngoing to reset my table.\n\n430\n00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.900\nBut if you did do things like I did and\n\n431\n00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:38.400\nchange the text formatting,\nhow can I get back to square one there?\n\n432\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.840\nSelect the whole table, so\n\n433\n00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.730\ncoming up to the top left hand corner,\ngetting that four cornered arrow there.\n\n434\n00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.056\nSelecting that, coming over our Home tab,\nand this is something that we did in our\n\n435\n00:20:48.056 --> 00:20:50.762\nWord Essentials show,\nis this button right here.\n\n436\n00:20:50.762 --> 00:20:53.273\nThe clear all formatting on the Home tab,\n\n437\n00:20:53.273 --> 00:20:58.380\nwithin that font group to where you\ntake it all back, that's really small.\n\n438\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:03.157\nThat's just the default font size of this\nparticular document and so it's bringing\n\n439\n00:21:03.157 --> 00:21:07.410\nback to Calibri 11 all the alignments and\neverything are back to normal.\n\n440\n00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:13.860\nSo this is the barebones, this is how the\ntable starts with that plain table grid.\n\n441\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.490\nThis is where all the formatting\nof the text has gone away.\n\n442\n00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.060\nAnd now I can go back and\n\n443\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.626\nstart selecting individual cells\nto make different font sizes.\n\n444\n00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:25.659\nGoing ahead and\napplying different styles or\n\n445\n00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:30.144\ngoing into formatting each of our\ncells individually if I want to.\n\n446\n00:21:30.144 --> 00:21:36.080\nSo yes that will be how you can remove all\nthe formats, all of the table and text.\n\n447\n00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.292\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n448\n00:21:37.292 --> 00:21:40.639\n&gt;&gt; I think we've got everything set up for\nour dinner party.\n\n449\n00:21:40.639 --> 00:21:41.470\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n450\n00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.080\n&gt;&gt; So I think its time for\nus to saunter on over.\n\n451\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And go eat some food.\n\n452\n00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.474\n&gt;&gt; Well before we go eat some food,\nanything else you want to add?\n\n453\n00:21:50.474 --> 00:21:55.000\n&gt;&gt; I think the biggest thing with\nthis is to not go overboard.\n\n454\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.870\nThe nice thing is with the files,\n\n455\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:02.030\nthat's the easiest way to just apply some\ngood looking formatting really quickly.\n\n456\n00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.799\nSo experiment, see what color combinations\nwork best, but if you're not really\n\n457\n00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:09.292\nfeeling it, you're like, you know,\nI'm glad that Word has this stuff and\n\n458\n00:22:09.292 --> 00:22:12.812\nI don't have to think too much,\njust apply a style, and you're good to go.\n\n459\n00:22:12.812 --> 00:22:13.600\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n460\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.569\nGreat job, Vonne.\nVery nice, and, this is Tables:Format and\n\n461\n00:22:18.569 --> 00:22:20.370\nDesign, right?\n\n462\n00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.318\nWith Vonne.\n\n463\n00:22:21.318 --> 00:22:25.242\nAnd thank you for watching Office Pro TV.\n\n464\n00:22:25.242 --> 00:22:26.980\nRemember a good Office\npro is always learning.\n\n465\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.560\nI'm Jack Bendace.\n\n466\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.590\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:30.332\n&gt;&gt; We'll go sailing away with you.\n\n10\n00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:36.510\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so yes we are going to\nlearn all about charts in Word.\n\n11\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.086\nNow if you have seen any of the PowerPoint\nshows or even maybe the Excel shows\n\n12\n00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:45.972\ncharts in any of your Office products\nare pretty much the same across the board.\n\n13\n00:00:45.972 --> 00:00:50.501\nYou're going to be able to get the chart\ninformation into it and then displayed.\n\n14\n00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.722\nNow I don't know about you Zach, but\n\n15\n00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:55.599\nI know when I started\nusing all these products.\n\n16\n00:00:55.599 --> 00:01:00.959\nGetting my charts actually do what I\nwanted it to do, was kind of a nightmare\n\n17\n00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:05.914\nit was one of those like, I had an idea\nof what I wanted it to look like.\n\n18\n00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:10.016\nBut I couldn't seem to get the data\nin the right spots to actually show\n\n19\n00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:13.839\nthe different columns that kind\nof compare against each other or\n\n20\n00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:16.555\nthe pies to get the pieces\nin the right place.\n\n21\n00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:21.483\nSo it was a little difficult, I will say\nthat Office has gotten a lot better at\n\n22\n00:01:21.483 --> 00:01:25.040\ntrying to guide us as we're\nsaying charting a course.\n\n23\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.617\nTrying to guide us along the right path\nto get the information to place where it\n\n24\n00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:30.399\nneeds to be.\n\n25\n00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.946\nSo they have a lot of new kind of\nlike previews and things to help us.\n\n26\n00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:39.063\nAnd that's fantastic, but what I wanted to\nstart off with in this episode was just\n\n27\n00:01:39.063 --> 00:01:41.763\nkind of getting a little bit\nof the terminology down.\n\n28\n00:01:41.763 --> 00:01:42.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:42.277 --> 00:01:45.539\n&gt;&gt; And really identifying those pieces\nbecause it's one of those do you know what\n\n30\n00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.487\na category access is?\n\n31\n00:01:46.487 --> 00:01:48.515\nDo you know what a series is?\n\n32\n00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:52.846\nIf you can start just familiarizing\nyourself with that like, that's what that\n\n33\n00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:56.830\nthing is, it will help you to be able to\nknow what you want your charts to do.\n\n34\n00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.489\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna look at\nthe parts of a chart, aren't we?\n\n35\n00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:00.228\n&gt;&gt; We sure are.\n\n36\n00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:00.905\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n37\n00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.495\n&gt;&gt; And actually I have a file.\n\n38\n00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:03.745\n&gt;&gt; And we named that so,\n\n39\n00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:07.641\nwhen we jump on down we'll hop on\nthe boat as we should say, right?\n\n40\n00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:08.175\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n41\n00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:09.739\n&gt;&gt; And we'll take a little path.\n\n42\n00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:10.927\n&gt;&gt; I did bring my compass.\n\n43\n00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:15.775\n&gt;&gt; Good job so, in some of our other\nepisodes we've been talking about tables.\n\n44\n00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:20.608\nNow if you haven't watched them that's\nfine because maybe you're only interested\n\n45\n00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:23.670\nin charts, but\nthis is some type of graphical element\n\n46\n00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.093\nthat we could use to compare and contrast\nthe activities of Mr. Fuego and Mr.\n\n47\n00:02:28.093 --> 00:02:30.837\nBish, Bish right here,\nto see what do they do.\n\n48\n00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:34.904\nAnd in this one, I guess I chose that\nBishop likes to sleep more than Fuego,\n\n49\n00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.503\nwhich yeah,\non a given a day that could be true.\n\n50\n00:02:37.503 --> 00:02:41.576\nBut we always see that Fuego will always\nlike to eat more than Bishop so, and\n\n51\n00:02:41.576 --> 00:02:45.730\nthe numbers right here but I have to\nthink, okay, is six bigger than three?\n\n52\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.460\nOkay, yes six is bigger than three, and\nhow much more is seven more than five?\n\n53\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.360\nOkay, yeah, it's two.\n\n54\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.343\nBut we're trying to say like some type\nof graphical way that I could see this.\n\n55\n00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.883\nHere we go, how about a chart?\n\n56\n00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:03.064\nSo here's the activity so,\nI can see really quickly.\n\n57\n00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:04.377\nOkay, so what's orange?\n\n58\n00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:09.476\nOrange, this is the thing over on the\nright the legend that I have that says,\n\n59\n00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:11.964\norange is Bishop and the blue is Fuego.\n\n60\n00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:16.911\nSo I could say, wow Bishop definitely\nsleeps more than Fuego because this\n\n61\n00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:21.959\nis the sleep, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nuse the word category that we have.\n\n62\n00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.238\nAnd then I can see all right well then\nthey play, but overall it looks like\n\n63\n00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:32.798\nBishop has a little bit more activity or\ndefinitely Fuego likes to eat more.\n\n64\n00:03:32.798 --> 00:03:36.985\nSo I can see kind of quickly the different\ncomparisons about this information that\n\n65\n00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:38.269\nI'm trying to display.\n\n66\n00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.946\nSo this is a clustered column chart.\n\n67\n00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:42.693\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n68\n00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:44.745\n&gt;&gt; How do I identify these pieces?\n\n69\n00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:47.582\nLike you were saying,\nwe're gonna be doing parts of the chart.\n\n70\n00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:48.607\n&gt;&gt; Parts of the chart.\n&gt;&gt; Parts of the chart.\n\n71\n00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:51.666\nSo across the bottom we\nhave our category axis,\n\n72\n00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:56.421\nalong the bottom these are the different\ncategories that I am comparing.\n\n73\n00:03:56.421 --> 00:04:02.133\nBut I'm also comparing the series, that\ndata series that would be the Bishop or\n\n74\n00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:08.187\nthe Fuego the information that's going to\ncross the different colors in the columns\n\n75\n00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:13.406\nthat I'm comparing against each other,\nto that particular category.\n\n76\n00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:18.713\nSo comparing the sleep habits of Bishop\nand Fuego, and then Fuego or Bishop\n\n77\n00:04:18.713 --> 00:04:24.287\nhas those different things that carries\nalong in that series of information.\n\n78\n00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:28.977\nAnd the nice thing is when they give\nyou the place where you're gonna be\n\n79\n00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:32.968\nputting in that data it kind\nof shows you as you're typing.\n\n80\n00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:36.774\nSo, okay, what do I want across\nthe bottom in my categories,\n\n81\n00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:39.804\nwhat are the different\nthings I'm comparing, and\n\n82\n00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:43.769\nhaving it go across all these categories,\nthose are your series.\n\n83\n00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:47.037\nSo that's nice that it kinda\nshows you all of that, and\n\n84\n00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:50.391\nthe legend that tells you\nwhat those series labels are.\n\n85\n00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:55.218\nYou also have your value axis that goes\nup the top, and so that's where we're\n\n86\n00:04:55.218 --> 00:04:59.842\ngoing to be measuring those different\ndata series along the categories.\n\n87\n00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:01.802\nSo this X and Y axis.\n\n88\n00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.481\n&gt;&gt; And Bishop and\nFuego are in their own category.\n\n89\n00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:06.517\nRight?\n\n90\n00:05:06.517 --> 00:05:08.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n91\n00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.115\nthere might be some people who don't know\nthat Bishop and Fuego are cats, they are.\n\n92\n00:05:12.115 --> 00:05:13.168\n&gt;&gt; That was so funny, I loved it.\n\n93\n00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:14.752\n&gt;&gt; It's too funny, I know.\n\n94\n00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:15.958\n&gt;&gt; No, no, keep them coming.\n\n95\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:16.864\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n96\n00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:20.254\n&gt;&gt; So we have those different categories.\n\n97\n00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:21.567\n&gt;&gt; Categories, yes.\n\n98\n00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:23.052\n&gt;&gt; For our cat activities.\n\n99\n00:05:23.052 --> 00:05:26.155\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; If we keep on going down our slides,\n\n100\n00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:29.339\nsome more things of\nthese parts of a chart,\n\n101\n00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:35.017\ndifferent things that I could add on top\nof just the data that I am putting in.\n\n102\n00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:39.880\nData labels where I am actually seeing\nnumbers the values of each one of those\n\n103\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.053\ncolumns because, yeah it's nice here like,\nokay there's eight that's six.\n\n104\n00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:52.010\nBut what if this was 8.265,\nand this was 12.821?\n\n105\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.016\nIf I had those decimal points and\n\n106\n00:05:54.016 --> 00:05:58.330\nespecially if we're talking about\ndollar amounts and everything,\n\n107\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.365\nit might be nice to actually see\nthe data on top of those columns.\n\n108\n00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:04.586\nThose are different\nthings that you can add,\n\n109\n00:06:04.586 --> 00:06:08.338\ndifferent elements you can add to your\nchart, you also have the grid lines.\n\n110\n00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:10.427\nDo you want to have grid lines or not?\n\n111\n00:06:10.427 --> 00:06:14.043\nDo you want to change\nwhere the legend shows?\n\n112\n00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:18.776\n&gt;&gt; And all the ones that are in the green,\nthose are just different elements\n\n113\n00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:23.363\nthat you can format or add different\nthings to, like the chart title.\n\n114\n00:06:23.363 --> 00:06:26.097\nAnd actually those are the different\nthings you're gonna add to, so\n\n115\n00:06:26.097 --> 00:06:28.754\nI don't why I should put green and\nyellow, what are these colors?\n\n116\n00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:32.944\nGreen and red, I was just trying\nto give you a little bit of color\n\n117\n00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:37.865\ndifferentiation so, you can see that\nan axis title, an axis title here.\n\n118\n00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:39.448\nDo you have to have those?\n\n119\n00:06:39.448 --> 00:06:40.128\nNo, not necessarily.\n\n120\n00:06:40.128 --> 00:06:45.478\nSo they're not like required\nelements of the chart.\n\n121\n00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:48.018\nNow the data,\nthat would be required of the chart so,\n\n122\n00:06:48.018 --> 00:06:49.659\nmaybe that's why I threw them in.\n\n123\n00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.693\nActually, I can't even understand\nwhy I put those in red and green,\n\n124\n00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:55.005\nsometimes when you come\nback to your own documents.\n\n125\n00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:55.735\n&gt;&gt; It's a nice contrast.\n\n126\n00:06:55.735 --> 00:06:57.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n127\n00:06:57.002 --> 00:06:58.359\nI don't, perfect.\n\n128\n00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:01.157\nYou know what,\nwe're gonna go with that logic, thank you.\n\n129\n00:07:01.157 --> 00:07:03.359\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\nit's kind of Christmas tree too.\n\n130\n00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:07.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we do have some things about\nChristmas cats eventually in this episode\n\n131\n00:07:07.134 --> 00:07:10.143\nor not this particular episode,\nbut the show altogether, so.\n\n132\n00:07:10.143 --> 00:07:10.951\n&gt;&gt; Okay, wonderful.\n\n133\n00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:14.705\n&gt;&gt; And there are complimentary colors so,\nyeah sometimes you go back to your own\n\n134\n00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:17.213\nwork and it's like,\nwhy did I named this that way?\n\n135\n00:07:17.213 --> 00:07:18.301\nWhy would I do that?\n\n136\n00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:20.750\nI don't know, all right so,\nkeeping on going.\n\n137\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.729\nThe data table, this is just another one\nof those chart elements that you could add\n\n138\n00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:29.281\nacross the bottom that gives\nyou those specific numbers.\n\n139\n00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:32.269\nCuz maybe you have numbers that are so\nbig or\n\n140\n00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:37.762\ndecimal places that you don't really\nwanna put them as labels on the columns.\n\n141\n00:07:37.762 --> 00:07:41.353\nYou just wanna go ahead and\nput it down at the bottom with the tables,\n\n142\n00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:43.310\nyou can add those different things.\n\n143\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.235\nNow you could switch this,\nyou can say all right,\n\n144\n00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:50.990\nwhat category am I wanting\nto put on the bottom?\n\n145\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.878\nI want to put Fuego so,\nI want to really see the relationship of\n\n146\n00:07:55.878 --> 00:08:00.860\nthe hours of activity with Fuego\nas my category versus Bishop.\n\n147\n00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.030\nSo this is where it's\njust a different way.\n\n148\n00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.790\nIt's turning the information, flipped it.\n\n149\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.370\n&gt;&gt; Upside down.\n\n150\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.850\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it turned it upside down.\n\n151\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.930\nSo we move it around.\n\n152\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.120\nSo you can switch the row and columns.\n\n153\n00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.790\nAnd then you could also\nchange what type of charts.\n\n154\n00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.580\nCuz we have lots and\nlots of different charts.\n\n155\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.200\nWe have the ones that we just\nshowed was a cluster column.\n\n156\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.040\nThis would be a line graph.\n\n157\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.821\nGraph charts, I think those\nare interchangeable words but\n\n158\n00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:26.278\nto me line chart doesn't\nflow as well as line graph.\n\n159\n00:08:26.278 --> 00:08:29.860\nAnd that's just always what I remember it,\ngoing through school.\n\n160\n00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.700\nSo charts and graphs, they're same thing\nand you can format them differently.\n\n161\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.686\nThis particular one has a style.\n\n162\n00:08:35.686 --> 00:08:39.130\nWe've talked a lot about styles\nin just text formatting.\n\n163\n00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.571\nAnd everywhere that you have different\nshapes or graphical elements, they have\n\n164\n00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:47.570\na whole bunch of different effects\nthat are categorized into one style.\n\n165\n00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.073\nYou have them here in charts and\nthey're, again, really easy to click it,\n\n166\n00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:53.500\nyou're done,\nyou don't have to format anything.\n\n167\n00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.560\nPie charts, now pie charts are a little\nbit different in the sense that you're\n\n168\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:04.110\nonly having one data series and\none yes, one series and one category.\n\n169\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.260\nI can't compare Fuego and\nBishop within one pie chart.\n\n170\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.328\nThat's all one piece of the pie.\n\n171\n00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:12.644\nSo this can be like all right,\nwhat is our annual budget and\n\n172\n00:09:12.644 --> 00:09:14.660\nthen what are the pieces of that?\n\n173\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.220\nYou can't necessarily compare budget of\nyour x and y together in one pie chart.\n\n174\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.836\nNow you can have to\nseparate pie charts but\n\n175\n00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:26.814\nthat chart as its entity is really\none series and one category.\n\n176\n00:09:26.814 --> 00:09:31.568\nAnd the different ways that you can show\nthe labels, the data labels in here,\n\n177\n00:09:31.568 --> 00:09:34.490\nnow notice that these are percentages.\n\n178\n00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.446\nYou could go ahead and have that\nshown in your chart automatically.\n\n179\n00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:41.040\nWell, you have to manually\nput it on there, but\n\n180\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.660\nit will automatically configure\nthe percentages for you.\n\n181\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.270\nYou don't have to do the math.\n\n182\n00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.349\nYou don't have percentages within\ncluster columns necessarily, so\n\n183\n00:09:49.349 --> 00:09:51.968\nyou'd wanna maybe kind of\ndemonstrate this in a pie chart.\n\n184\n00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:54.265\nAnd you could always\nhave an exploding pie.\n\n185\n00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:55.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n186\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.130\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nYou always want a piece of the pie, so\n\n187\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.980\nyou wanna kinda pull something out.\n\n188\n00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.390\nYou can format each one of these\nindividual pieces cuz this really is\n\n189\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.060\njust a bunch of shapes and lines.\n\n190\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.880\nAnd so all that formatting that\nwe've done in other episodes with\n\n191\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.540\nhow can I format my shape and do the fills\nand the outsets, and the effects.\n\n192\n00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.590\nGuess what?\n\n193\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.042\nYou can do them all, ooh.\n\n194\n00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:16.542\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n\n195\n00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:17.614\n&gt;&gt; In a chart.\n\n196\n00:10:17.614 --> 00:10:19.629\nNow, I'm not sure if you'd ever really\n\n197\n00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:23.390\nwanna look at a chart like this in\na board meeting, would you there, Zach?\n\n198\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.615\n&gt;&gt; It could confuse you.\n\n199\n00:10:24.615 --> 00:10:30.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so just because you can,\ndoesn't mean you should.\n\n200\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.770\nBut if you didn't want to\nput a picture of your cat.\n\n201\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.870\nMaybe you had a company logo\nthat's got a lot of transparency.\n\n202\n00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.950\nNow that can be something\nnice to put in it.\n\n203\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.180\nBut you might not want to throw in\nall these patterns and gradients.\n\n204\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.120\nBut I was just showing you the possibility\nthat every single piece of this chart,\n\n205\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.200\nwhether it be the chart title,\nthe grid lines, the category access,\n\n206\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.370\nthe series, the plot area, the chart area.\n\n207\n00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.920\nHow do you know all these things?\n\n208\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.524\nI just hover, discover and find that out.\n\n209\n00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:01.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now this is PowerPoint.\n\n210\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.870\nBut just to show you if I click\non here and I start hovering,\n\n211\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.000\nyou see that this is chart area.\n\n212\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.750\nHover over here, that is the plot area.\n\n213\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.770\nThat's the vertical value\naxis major grid lines.\n\n214\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.770\nSo the hover to discover when\nyou're over these things,\n\n215\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.120\nyou don't have to memorize them.\n\n216\n00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.580\nYou just kinda see what they do or\nsee what they are, click it, go in and\n\n217\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.130\nformat that piece, and\nthen you're good to go.\n\n218\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.670\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So that's our introduction to charts.\n\n219\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.650\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,, I know in a previous\nepisode that you and I worked on together.\n\n220\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.259\nYou were saying with the presentations\nof the charts that less is more,\n\n221\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.400\nespecially if you're doing a presentation\nwhere an office if you will.\n\n222\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.464\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because you probably don't want\npictures of your cats in the data series.\n\n223\n00:11:44.464 --> 00:11:47.590\n[LAUGH] But yeah, and\nthat's where the styles come into\n\n224\n00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.870\nplay of just throwing a quick style on it\nand you can kinda set it and forget it.\n\n225\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.510\nAnd some of the default layouts that\nthey have are a lot easier to just\n\n226\n00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.270\ndo what Office has kind\nof suggesting you do.\n\n227\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.239\nAnd then if you need to do a little\nbit of formatting, that's great.\n\n228\n00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:04.530\nBut it's just like you're saying,\nknow your audience.\n\n229\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.180\nIf you're doing a presentation for\na bunch of elementary school children,\n\n230\n00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.908\nthey might love to see\nthe cat in the background.\n\n231\n00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:12.339\n&gt;&gt; I'd love that.\n\n232\n00:12:12.339 --> 00:12:13.020\nMy gosh, yeah.\n\n233\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now, we're in PowerPoint, right?\n\n234\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.340\nSo how do you get this chart into Word?\n\n235\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.910\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n236\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.820\nThat's a perfect segue to\ndoing exactly just that.\n\n237\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.780\nSo now that we've identified everything,\nlet's go ahead.\n\n238\n00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.460\nI'm gonna close this part.\n\n239\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.829\nI'm not gonna save anything just in case\nI, well I'm just gonna make sure, so\n\n240\n00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:32.340\nthat way you guys can have the file and\neverything's wonderful.\n\n241\n00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.950\nI have Word already opened.\n\n242\n00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.950\nNow I do have a file that\nwe've been using a lot.\n\n243\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.290\nWe've been using addgraphics.ucsx and\nI also have a new file.\n\n244\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.930\nNo, I don't.\n\n245\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.680\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n246\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.910\nI will just do file new from here and\nstart a blank document,\n\n247\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:51.310\njust to kinda get us familiar\nwith just inserting a chart.\n\n248\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.830\nSo where do you think you're gonna go?\n\n249\n00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.540\nYeah, insert chart.\n\n250\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I come under here and\n\n251\n00:12:56.021 --> 00:13:01.410\nas soon as I come under here,\nit's gonna first give me the dialog box or\n\n252\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.890\nthe options of well,\nwhat type of chart do you want?\n\n253\n00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.500\nI'll tell you there's a lot of charts in\nhere that I don't even know what they\n\n254\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.575\nwould even show.\n\n255\n00:13:08.575 --> 00:13:11.700\n[LAUGH] I mean,\nwe've got some Box and whisker.\n\n256\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.641\nI mean, I know we're talking about\ncats over here but, [LAUGH].\n\n257\n00:13:14.641 --> 00:13:19.429\nThere's obviously reasons for every\nsingle chart that is in here in Word or\n\n258\n00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:20.956\nExcel and PowerPoint.\n\n259\n00:13:20.956 --> 00:13:24.340\nJust because I don't know\nwhat they all really do.\n\n260\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:24.900\nThat's okay.\n\n261\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.830\nI just don't necessarily have\nthat particular need for\n\n262\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.670\nthem but they're in the options so\nthey've gotta have one.\n\n263\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.200\nWe have our basic ones.\n\n264\n00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.240\nI got column charts.\n\n265\n00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.470\nBut notice in each one of them,\nfor example,\n\n266\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.340\nour column or our line or our pie.\n\n267\n00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.520\nWe have the different\noptions across the top.\n\n268\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.200\nDo you want it to be\na 3D clustered column.\n\n269\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.020\nDo you don't want it to be,\ndo you want the stacked columns where\n\n270\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.140\nyou see it all on top in one\nparticular column with the line.\n\n271\n00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.130\nDo you want points on the line?\n\n272\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.170\nDo you want it to be 3D?\n\n273\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:58.740\nSo each one of these, you have some\noptions to, and I'm just hovering to kinda\n\n274\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:04.682\nit zooms in or shows you a better\npicture of that particular preview.\n\n275\n00:14:04.682 --> 00:14:09.180\nAnd then the bar chart, really a bar chart\nis a column just flipped on it's side.\n\n276\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.809\nAnd you also have some area charts.\n\n277\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.590\nYour stock and\n\n278\n00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.660\nsurface charts that really just start\nlooking like pieces of origami to me.\n\n279\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.470\nBut these different ways\nthat you can go with it.\n\n280\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.775\nBut I'm gonna just start basic.\n\n281\n00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:24.390\nCuz the nice thing is once we get\nall the information into a chart,\n\n282\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.300\nall we have to do, there's a button on\nour contextual tabs that says well,\n\n283\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.870\nlets just go ahead and\nchange the chart type.\n\n284\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.306\nKeep all my data in there and\n\n285\n00:14:31.306 --> 00:14:34.940\njust have different ways that I can\ngraphically represent our data.\n\n286\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.927\nSo let's go and say, okay, for our\nclustered column basic chart, go ahead and\n\n287\n00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:44.500\nputs this in and\nthen it gives us a special little window.\n\n288\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.630\nThis is not Excel.\n\n289\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.180\nNotice there's no Excel opened up\nin my task manager or anything.\n\n290\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.862\nThis is just the chart in\nMicrosoft Word Dialog box,\n\n291\n00:14:52.862 --> 00:14:58.229\nit's where you put the information in and\nit looks like Excel but it's not.\n\n292\n00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:00.350\nIt's kind of like a picture in a picture.\n\n293\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you can see here that they have\n\n294\n00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.060\ndone a better job, I think,\nfrom previous versions of Word.\n\n295\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.750\nI mean, I remember, I've been\nteaching this since, I mean, 2003.\n\n296\n00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.650\nSo it's been a while.\n\n297\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.540\nThey never had any of this interface,\nand you just had to kinda guess.\n\n298\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.460\nSo it shows these are the series,\nseries one, two, three.\n\n299\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.070\nAnd then the category, one, two three.\n\n300\n00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.620\nIt's giving me the legend, and\n\n301\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.860\nI can see it without even\nputting in the information.\n\n302\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.320\nAnd because it gives me enough\nstuff to kind of work on, so\n\n303\n00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.950\nI can see what I want on the bottom,\nwhat do I want across the series, and\n\n304\n00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.670\nthat's where you just start filling it in.\n\n305\n00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:44.580\nSo if I want to say, well what's the first\ncategory that I'm going to be comparing?\n\n306\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.120\nI think I said sleep, right?\n\n307\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.322\nWe already have sleep.\n\n308\n00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:52.730\nAnd then we have eat and\nI'm just using my down arrow to go there.\n\n309\n00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.233\nAnd you can notice that it's\nchanging Dynamically, in the chart,\n\n310\n00:15:57.233 --> 00:15:58.661\nin my Word document.\n\n311\n00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:01.410\nWe're going to go sleep, e, m, play.\n\n312\n00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:05.980\nNow I know in my example we had those four\ncategories, but for this particular one,\n\n313\n00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.672\njust to show,\nwhat if I don't have four, okay.\n\n314\n00:16:08.672 --> 00:16:09.960\nWhat if I only have two?\n\n315\n00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.410\nWhat if I have six?\n\n316\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.910\nYou could keep adding, or\nin this case, you could delete\n\n317\n00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:20.150\ninformation that you don't need,\nto show in your chart.\n\n318\n00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.250\nNow there's a couple\nways you could do this.\n\n319\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.380\nOne versus the other,\nit's like we have multiple right answers.\n\n320\n00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:33.880\nThis box right here, you see how each one\nof these shows like a two pointed arrow\n\n321\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:41.400\non the bottom of the whole square of\nwhere it defines what is being charted.\n\n322\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.200\nI could take this and\njust drag this purple guy up,\n\n323\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.020\nthere we go, and\nit actually pulls up both of them.\n\n324\n00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.810\nIt pulls up the purple and the blue cuz\nit doesn't really go independently.\n\n325\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.810\nYou can't have that without a category.\n\n326\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.110\nSo it just kinda works that way.\n\n327\n00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:02.660\nAnd notice that it is stopped showing\nwhatever is in category four.\n\n328\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:09.080\nSo you could move around these boxes\nto say, this is what I wanna show.\n\n329\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.260\nSame way on a series.\n\n330\n00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.600\nWhat if I only had two series?\n\n331\n00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.070\nI wanted just fuego and bishop,\nwhich, that's all we have, right?\n\n332\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.290\n&gt;&gt; That's all we've got.\n\n333\n00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.130\n&gt;&gt; So I can take the two point\narrows here and I can move this in.\n\n334\n00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:27.870\nAnd I can define the area in which I want\nthe chart to display the information.\n\n335\n00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.370\nThat's totally fine,\nno big deal with that.\n\n336\n00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:35.010\nNow of course once you have that,\nyou could select the cells and\n\n337\n00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.690\ndelete the information by using\na delete key and not the backspace key.\n\n338\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.730\nSo I can take that out and\nthen so on and so forth.\n\n339\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.390\nBut let me back up just a little bit well,\nyou know what?\n\n340\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.160\nI just realized that the undo does not\nactually bring the box back out, so\n\n341\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.590\nlet me go back to where I had started.\n\n342\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.450\nIf you know that I don't need\na fourth category and a third series,\n\n343\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.410\nyou could also delete the whole row.\n\n344\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.439\nIf you're familiar with Excel and that's\nkinda the way you get rid of things,\n\n345\n00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.270\nI could hover over the row\nreference number which is 5.\n\n346\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.390\nI could right click on there and\nI could delete.\n\n347\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.529\nIt takes that away and\n\n348\n00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:14.024\nit also automatically moves that\nbox up with the chartable area.\n\n349\n00:18:14.024 --> 00:18:15.290\nSame with your column.\n\n350\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.360\nYou could delete the column.\n\n351\n00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.741\nI can right click on column D.\n\n352\n00:18:18.741 --> 00:18:22.330\nI can delete it and\nthen that goes away and so\n\n353\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.450\nthis is what I am my chartable area.\n\n354\n00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.400\nThe same way as I hey, I got another\ncategory, if you go ahead and\n\n355\n00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.480\njust start typing in category.\n\n356\n00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.050\nI can just distribute what I want.\n\n357\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.800\nOkay, now it says hey,\nI've got some problems in here, but\n\n358\n00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.100\nnotice how as soon as how\nI clicked OK it says hey,\n\n359\n00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.290\nI can see that you've added stuff\noutside the chartable area.\n\n360\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.540\nI probably should have just stopped\non that little dialogue box so\n\n361\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.830\nyou could have seen it.\n\n362\n00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.050\nBut it's fixing itself.\n\n363\n00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.790\nWhat if it didn't automatically?\n\n364\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.840\nJust move those boxes the same way that\nyou can contract the space that you're\n\n365\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.590\ncharting, you can expand that area and\ngive it more of the preview.\n\n366\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.560\nHere take that two point arrow and\nmove it over and\n\n367\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.900\nthen it's gonna show me another item.\n\n368\n00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.010\nAnd notice there's a little\ngray box down there but\n\n369\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.750\nit doesn't have like that series.\n\n370\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.840\nSo that's where you can start\nmoving things out or in and\n\n371\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.460\nthen you start putting in the pieces.\n\n372\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:24.256\nSo just knowing how to kinda control this\ninsert chart data box is half the battle.\n\n373\n00:19:24.256 --> 00:19:26.410\nPeople is like it won't show,\nit won't show.\n\n374\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.660\nYou got to have those kind of colored\nareas around the area that you\n\n375\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.120\nwant, all right.\n\n376\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.510\nLet's go back to here and\nI will come back to here.\n\n377\n00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.490\nThere we go.\n\n378\n00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.156\nWe have our three categories,\nour series, and\n\n379\n00:19:37.156 --> 00:19:38.788\nlet me just start typing\nour information in.\n\n380\n00:19:38.788 --> 00:19:40.840\nThis is Mr. Fuego Pants.\n\n381\n00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.090\nI can use my tab key to\nget over to the next cell.\n\n382\n00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:48.510\nYou could also use your keyboard or\nyour mouse to select which one you want.\n\n383\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.670\n&gt;&gt; Question?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm?\n\n384\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.685\n&gt;&gt; Has Fuego ever actually worn pants?\n\n385\n00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:54.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don't worry,\nwe've put him in quite a few costumes.\n\n386\n00:19:54.887 --> 00:19:55.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n387\n00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.672\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And he hates it, and\nwe love it, and take lots of pictures.\n\n388\n00:19:58.672 --> 00:19:59.286\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n389\n00:19:59.286 --> 00:20:03.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, Fuego,\nit was like an automatic thing,\n\n390\n00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.987\nthat's one of his nicknames that we\ncall him, so Mr. Fuego pants [LAUGH].\n\n391\n00:20:08.987 --> 00:20:11.540\nSometimes we call him fire pants\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.710\n&gt;&gt; We call him also,\n\n393\n00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.467\nwe make him dance too.\n\n394\n00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:17.550\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n395\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.790\n&gt;&gt; He love that, all right.\n\n396\n00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.977\nSo we will go with a sleep,\nnow that's how we spell slip, and\n\n397\n00:20:21.977 --> 00:20:24.800\nwe use our mouse down and\nthat was actually keyboard.\n\n398\n00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.740\nEat, right?\n\n399\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.300\nGosh, have to forget eating, and\n\n400\n00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.020\nwe'll say play and then we put in\nthe different hours of the day.\n\n401\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.750\nI am just completely making this up.\n\n402\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.459\nWe'll go with 13, 4 and 2.\n\n403\n00:20:37.459 --> 00:20:40.629\nI don't think that adds up to 24 or\nanywhere close but hey,\n\n404\n00:20:40.629 --> 00:20:43.670\n[LAUGH] we can roll with it for\nthis particular example.\n\n405\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.280\nAnd he doesn't eat nearly as much but\nhe does like to play a little bit more.\n\n406\n00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.370\nAnd then you can see,\nthere's my chartable area.\n\n407\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.704\nDefinitely seeing that they like to\nsleep more than anything else and\n\n408\n00:20:54.704 --> 00:20:56.603\nthen it compares and contrasts again.\n\n409\n00:20:56.603 --> 00:21:00.338\nI'm done with my inserting\nthe chart information.\n\n410\n00:21:00.338 --> 00:21:03.420\nAll you gotta do is just close\nthis little window right here.\n\n411\n00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.470\nAnd then,\nwell it went over to my other document.\n\n412\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.699\nWell, that was interesting, all right.\n\n413\n00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:11.270\nWell, let's come back over to our blank\ndocument that we put the chart in.\n\n414\n00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.780\nWord has been doing some\nfunky stuff on me lately,\n\n415\n00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:20.670\nbut that's all right as long as I know my\nother file's still in here, we're okay.\n\n416\n00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.280\nSo now you can see I\nhave my chart selected.\n\n417\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:29.640\nAnd this is where I can start adding in or\nformatting our different information.\n\n418\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.280\nThose things that we talked about\nlike the data labels, the data table,\n\n419\n00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.460\nwe also did our category axis and\ntitle axis.\n\n420\n00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.260\nLike I said is the title,\nno axis, we'll just do that.\n\n421\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.450\nYou have over here two options.\n\n422\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.330\nYou can go to add chart element,\nagain knowing some of\n\n423\n00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.820\nthat terminology of what these things are,\nbut the other thing that it's\n\n424\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.230\nnice that it gives us little pictures\nto see, well what is a data label?\n\n425\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.070\nIt shows me.\nAnd if I start hovering,\n\n426\n00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.350\nI'm not even clicking on anything.\n\n427\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.050\nI'm hovering over these different things.\n\n428\n00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.810\nDo I want it on the inside bottom?\n\n429\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:04.870\nDo I want it on the center?\n\n430\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.240\nDo I want it on the outside end?\n\n431\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.730\nCool, nice stuff there.\n\n432\n00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.680\nChart title.\n\n433\n00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.505\nChart titles are already there but\nmaybe I wanna center it and\n\n434\n00:22:13.505 --> 00:22:15.640\noverlay the chart information.\n\n435\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.080\nAnd I kinda like it where it's at.\n\n436\n00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.570\nThe access titles primary,\nversus vertical.\n\n437\n00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.750\nOr I could do both.\n\n438\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.390\nI can click on one and\nthen come back and use the other one.\n\n439\n00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.570\nAnd then a data table.\n\n440\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.522\nDo I want the information\ndown at the bottom?\n\n441\n00:22:30.522 --> 00:22:34.412\nSo you can see that it's giving\nme all of these individual\n\n442\n00:22:34.412 --> 00:22:37.666\nchart elements that I\ncould add piece by piece.\n\n443\n00:22:37.666 --> 00:22:43.640\nThe quick layout would be different\nways of kind of like a style of layout.\n\n444\n00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.570\nIt's giving me just a kind\nof grouped information or\n\n445\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.830\ngroup items that I could add\nwith those chart elements.\n\n446\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.270\nSo you could see that it's saying,\nall right, here there's that data table.\n\n447\n00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.510\nThe grid lines, and\n\n448\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.270\nit's giving me the options here when\nI hover over it exactly what It is\n\n449\n00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:04.070\nadding in there, putting the legend on\nthe bottom, putting it over on the right.\n\n450\n00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.240\nAdding those, look how it's\nkinda overlapping those columns.\n\n451\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.189\nSo these are different ways that I\nkinda like well I don't like that one.\n\n452\n00:23:13.189 --> 00:23:17.950\n[LAUGH] Well maybe this one, I think this\nis a good one so I will click on here.\n\n453\n00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:18.650\nAnd now I've got it.\n\n454\n00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.430\nBut this is why I can start\nwith a quick layout and\n\n455\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:26.640\nthen maybe go ahead and\nadd some other elements that I would like.\n\n456\n00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.400\nMaybe I really do want the data label.\n\n457\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.120\nNow the thing with this is like I\nalready have a data table too, so\n\n458\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.420\nI'm not sure if I really\nneed both of them.\n\n459\n00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:39.847\nBut hey, just to show you that you can add\nanything you want, I could add another\n\n460\n00:23:39.847 --> 00:23:45.125\nlegend cuz maybe I don't really,\nit's not as pronounced in the data table.\n\n461\n00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:47.552\nSo maybe I'll put that off to the right,\nor\n\n462\n00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:50.863\nmaybe after thinking I don't\nreally want the data table.\n\n463\n00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:53.242\nSo come on over here and say none.\n\n464\n00:23:53.242 --> 00:23:56.702\nThink you get the point here\nis that you can go through and\n\n465\n00:23:56.702 --> 00:24:01.300\nstart adding the different elements\nof your chart that you want to add.\n\n466\n00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.210\nNow, I do realize that I can see\nyou kinda giving me the hey,\n\n467\n00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.470\nwe're getting towards the end there,\nright?\n\n468\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.870\n&gt;&gt; Well I was gonna say,\ndo you think we need a part two or?\n\n469\n00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.790\n&gt;&gt; I think we will.\n\n470\n00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.880\nI think if we have just\na couple more minutes,\n\n471\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.070\nI wanted to show a few extra little things\nwith really just dealing with the data.\n\n472\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.270\nAnd then we'll move onto gussying\nit all up and make it all pretty.\n\n473\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.080\nSo we have over here towards the right,\n\n474\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.670\nthis is where what if some\nof my data wasn't right?\n\n475\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.948\nI realize that,\nBishop is sleeping too much.\n\n476\n00:24:30.948 --> 00:24:34.260\nHe really actually sleeps less than Fuego\nso I need to change the information.\n\n477\n00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.660\nThat's where you can go\ninto the Edit Data button.\n\n478\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.360\nAnd when you click on it,\nit takes that chart or that little\n\n479\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.520\nchart in Microsoft Word where it looks\nExcel like, it brings that back up.\n\n480\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.300\nAnd so, you could go ahead and edit\nthe information cuz Bishop really actually\n\n481\n00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.470\nonly sleeps 12 hours, but he's been\nplaying a lot more so he goes to 6.\n\n482\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.370\nSo editing the chart information.\n\n483\n00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:03.140\nThe other thing that we\nmentioned in that PowerPoint was\n\n484\n00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.890\nwhat if I wanted to flip this?\n\n485\n00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.550\nLike flipping the columns and the rows?\n\n486\n00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.730\nAnd you can see right here it says,\nswitch row and column,\n\n487\n00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.600\nbut why is it all grayed out?\n\n488\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.040\nThis happens sometimes.\n\n489\n00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.030\nIt doesn't necessarily, it was like C,\nand especially if you kind of\n\n490\n00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:19.460\nleft some information off to the side, it\ndoesn't always give you the option of just\n\n491\n00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.670\none click button and\nthen flipping it on its side.\n\n492\n00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.360\nBut you can force it to do that by\ncoming over to the Select Data button.\n\n493\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.620\nAnd when you click on this,\nthis actually brings to what\n\n494\n00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.190\nI call also the old school dialogue box\ncause this was the only way you really-\n\n495\n00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.956\n&gt;&gt; Back in my day.\n\n496\n00:25:36.956 --> 00:25:43.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so\nthis is where you would go in and\n\n497\n00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.990\nactually change the names of\nthe categories and the axis labels.\n\n498\n00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.655\nAnd this is where not having\nany visual representation,\n\n499\n00:25:50.655 --> 00:25:52.930\nI'm like I don't what this means.\n\n500\n00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.260\nSo it is nice that they've\nadvanced this feature.\n\n501\n00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:01.250\nBut the nice thing for us that we need is\ngo ahead and switch the column and row.\n\n502\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.310\nThere's that button.\n\n503\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.670\nWe click okay.\n\n504\n00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.616\nAnd then it flips it on its side and\n\n505\n00:26:06.616 --> 00:26:12.628\nnow I have it to where it can go\nthrough and change the column and row.\n\n506\n00:26:12.628 --> 00:26:15.700\nIt does this and [LAUGH] and\nthen you can close that.\n\n507\n00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.470\nI don't know why it is doing that on me.\n\n508\n00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.300\nBut hey you know what,\nwe could always just close that.\n\n509\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.551\nSo, I feel that covered a lot of the data,\nhow it can move it around a little bit or\n\n510\n00:26:24.551 --> 00:26:26.430\nadd those elements like I said.\n\n511\n00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.040\nWhy don't we do come back for\na part two and\n\n512\n00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.490\nI can keep on telling you\na couple more things?\n\n513\n00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job.\n\n514\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:31.880\nThank you so very much.\n\n515\n00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.820\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; And I can't wait for\n\n516\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:37.320\npart two where we're gonna get more\ninto the prettiness and floweriness and\n\n517\n00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.260\nall of that good stuff.\n\n518\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.360\nAnd this is Word 2016 Advanced.\n\n519\n00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.790\nThis has been charts and there'll be part\ntwo, so make sure you watch that too.\n\n520\n00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:48.840\nAnd by the way, you know a good\noffice pro is always learning?\n\n521\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.680\nThey are.\n\n522\n00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.420\nI am Zach Memis.\n\n523\n00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.024\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n524\n00:26:53.024 --> 00:26:58.144\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:10.850\nWe help you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.240\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n5\n00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.820\nAs we continue with Word\n2016 Advanced Part Two,\n\n6\n00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.796\nwhich Vonne loves that Part Two bit.\n\n7\n00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:20.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Part Two on chart\n\n8\n00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.960\n&gt;&gt; And in this particular episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.350\nwe're gonna get very colorful,\nI understand, right Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.200\n&gt;&gt; We sure are!\n\n11\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to get into formatting\n\n12\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.440\nour charts.\n\n13\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.250\nBecause in our part one, we really just\nconcentrated on getting familiar with\n\n14\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.330\nchart terminology, and then getting\nthe data that we want to actually chart.\n\n15\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.760\nSo we're going to continue on and\nput on some colors.\n\n16\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.010\nSo we got to get flavor on the background,\ndon't we?\n\n17\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.730\n&gt;&gt; You have to.\n\n18\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I have the document\nright where we left off.\n\n19\n00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.565\nThe only thing that I did,\nif you're watching from part one,\n\n20\n00:00:50.565 --> 00:00:55.160\nwas that I switched it back to\nwhere the rows and columns were\n\n21\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.150\nback to the regular cluster column in\nthe sense that it is comparing Flago and\n\n22\n00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.840\nBishop those are our data series.\n\n23\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.042\nAnd the categories are sleep,\neat and play,\n\n24\n00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:07.672\nrather than having that reversed,\njust because.\n\n25\n00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:08.682\n&gt;&gt; Just because.\n\n26\n00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:12.344\n&gt;&gt; All right so\nhow can I make this look a lot nicer?\n\n27\n00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:18.454\nFirst of all, click on the chart itself\nto bring up our contextual tabs.\n\n28\n00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:21.446\nAnd we'll come over to our design and\nthis is where,\n\n29\n00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:25.255\njust like everything else that we\nhave in our graphical elements,\n\n30\n00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:28.390\nwe have some different styles\nthat I can choose from.\n\n31\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.584\nI don't know about those\nlines in between there.\n\n32\n00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:33.450\n[LAUGH] Nice little\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n33\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.180\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nYeah.\n\n34\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.123\nAnd, really quickly that makes it, to me\nthis looks very professional, very clean.\n\n35\n00:01:39.123 --> 00:01:40.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n36\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.110\nAnd just get a little bit of flair\nwith that white to gray gradient\n\n37\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.480\nin our chart area.\n\n38\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.500\nSo really easy to go ahead and\nthrow on that style.\n\n39\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.770\nAnd some different ones.\n\n40\n00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.010\nI don't know if I like that one, it's\na little too busy for my personal taste.\n\n41\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.080\nI also tend to like this one.\n\n42\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.470\nI like the dark background with\nthe kind of light text and\n\n43\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.180\nthe different colors here.\n\n44\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.535\nSo it's just something\nthat I kinda prefer, and\n\n45\n00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:07.358\nthen there's some other items in here,\nsome gradients.\n\n46\n00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:12.299\nAnd you can see that we have some\ndifferent options for us to choose from so\n\n47\n00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.620\nwe can thrown on a style really\nquickly to whatever we want it to be.\n\n48\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.630\nAnd these are all coming\nfrom our theme colors.\n\n49\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.290\nSo let's choose this one.\n\n50\n00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.660\nIf I go back over to design and\nI choose a different theme all together\n\n51\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.786\nyou can see that that will\nchange the overall font and\n\n52\n00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:35.410\nthe colors that are being used within\nthis particular chart just automatically.\n\n53\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.810\nSo maybe I kinda like these blues so\nmaybe I'll throw this integral and\n\n54\n00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.658\nit changes everything based on the style\nthat I chose and the design theme, or\n\n55\n00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:48.030\nthe color theme that I wanted\nto have available to me.\n\n56\n00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.570\nSo that's what we have with our styles,\nbut\n\n57\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.440\nyou can change all of these pieces\nindividually and this is where.\n\n58\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.330\nFrom teaching this product for quite some\ntime, when I had it in the classroom I\n\n59\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.060\nwould have an ugly chart competition\nto where everybody would format it and\n\n60\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.980\nlet's see who could make\nthe most hideous looking charts.\n\n61\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.630\nThere were some doozy's out there.\n\n62\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.300\n[LAUGH] So that's what I want to get into,\nthe yes you can but\n\n63\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.980\nmaybe you shouldn't area of\nformatting all the different pieces.\n\n64\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.330\nSo this is where you gotta watch\nabout where you're clicking and\n\n65\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.430\nwhere it is hovering.\n\n66\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.390\nWhen you hover to discover,\nwhat is it saying when you're over it?\n\n67\n00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.290\nSo if you can see right here,\nthis is the plot area.\n\n68\n00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.650\nIf I single click,\nnotice that's the inside box versus here,\n\n69\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.870\nthat's the chart area.\n\n70\n00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.110\nIf I come over here to the format tab\nyou can really see it when you start\n\n71\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.160\nfilling in color.\n\n72\n00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.806\nIf I chose yellow,\n\n73\n00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:49.540\nooh, goodness gracious.- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hello\n\n74\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.290\nworld!-\n&gt;&gt; That's filling all the information in\n\n75\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.340\nthe back versus if I click here.\n\n76\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.240\nThen I'm changing the color of\nthe plot area versus the chart area.\n\n77\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.322\nI'm gonna undo that, cuz that's\njust too much for me to look at.\n\n78\n00:04:02.322 --> 00:04:04.760\n[LAUGH] And so we can find those.\n\n79\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.770\nThe series, if I click once notice\nthat I can see one, two, three.\n\n80\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.750\nI can see each one of the series, columns,\n\n81\n00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.350\nthe whole series is selected and\nif I change the shape Here.\n\n82\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.390\nThat's not so bad.\n\n83\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.160\nIt goes [SOUND] with all of them, so\nwatch the dots, because if I single click\n\n84\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.174\nonce on the Fuego series, but\nthen single click one more time,\n\n85\n00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:32.612\nnotice how the little dots go off,\noff of these, and just stay here.\n\n86\n00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:38.326\nAnd I'm only changing the fill color\nof that one column within the series,\n\n87\n00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:40.060\nnot the whole series.\n\n88\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.464\nSo, and\nsometimes people will double-click.\n\n89\n00:04:42.464 --> 00:04:44.092\nBut they double-click somewhat slowly and\n\n90\n00:04:44.092 --> 00:04:46.077\nthen they're like why is it\nnot changing all of them?\n\n91\n00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.440\nYou just gotta watch it.\n\n92\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.760\nSo if you single click here and\nnow I've kind of isolated it into only\n\n93\n00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.830\nselecting individual\ncolumn through the series.\n\n94\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.290\nWhen I say, it's just reset it.\n\n95\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.380\nIn a sense of click off,\nto the right, de-select everything.\n\n96\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.600\nCome back over.\n\n97\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.595\nHover over that piece.\n\n98\n00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.588\nSingle-click, and watch.\n\n99\n00:05:05.588 --> 00:05:06.628\nOkay, here, let's try it again.\n\n100\n00:05:06.628 --> 00:05:07.798\nThere we go.\n\n101\n00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:09.437\nSo I had to click off,\n\n102\n00:05:09.437 --> 00:05:15.260\nthen click back on it to get to where I\nsee all of the series to be selected.\n\n103\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.580\nAnd now I could change this to\nwhatever color I need it to be.\n\n104\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.020\nSo those are the individual pieces.\n\n105\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.270\nNow when you start getting into,\nthese are lines.\n\n106\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.200\nWell, if they're lines I can change them.\n\n107\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.640\nI can change the weight of them,\nI could make them thicker.\n\n108\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.638\nI could make them a different color.\n\n109\n00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:41.010\nOkay, again starting to\nget a little crazy but\n\n110\n00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.240\nI could do those different parts of\nmaking them dash and so on and so forth.\n\n111\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.010\nWe could also add effects to\nany of these different pieces.\n\n112\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.110\nLet me go back to that data series cuz\nthe effects where we can do things like\n\n113\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.785\nhaving a glow on the outside\nof these data series.\n\n114\n00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:03.320\nWe could go into putting a bevel on it so\n\n115\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.270\neach piece can add all the different\nthings that you can format shapes with,\n\n116\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.870\nthe fills, the outlines, and the effects\nto any piece that you want it to be.\n\n117\n00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.180\nNow I can also come in, we'll come\nback to doing some more with that.\n\n118\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.670\nI can also change anything\nthat I want to with the text.\n\n119\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.551\nIf I don't, and I actually didn't\neven change the chart title did I?\n\n120\n00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:27.688\n[LAUGH] So if I had that item and\nI wanted it, actually change the text,\n\n121\n00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.980\njust double click, or single click in it.\n\n122\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.980\nNow you have your I beam.\n\n123\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.940\nAlways watching those cursor icons,\nI can select and\n\n124\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.749\nI can say activity of the Cats,\nthere, and then.\n\n125\n00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:42.306\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I could also move it if I\n\n126\n00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:46.132\never wanted to cuz a four-part\narrow versus the I-beam,\n\n127\n00:06:46.132 --> 00:06:49.800\nI-beam for text,\nfour-part arrow for the object.\n\n128\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.350\nI can move it over.\n\n129\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.131\nI can move it anywhere\nthat I want it to be.\n\n130\n00:06:53.131 --> 00:06:57.551\nAnd the other thing is if I wanted to\nformat the entire piece, this one element\n\n131\n00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:01.160\nYou don't wanna necessarily have\nyour cursor always into it.\n\n132\n00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.640\nYou wanna have the four point arrow.\n\n133\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.510\nIt will still most of\nthe time go ahead and\n\n134\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.070\nformat everything with\nthe cursor just flashing in it.\n\n135\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.599\nBut just for me, this is the whole\nthing that I want to format.\n\n136\n00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.072\nAnd I can change fill colors,\nI could come over to the Home tab,\n\n137\n00:07:17.072 --> 00:07:22.175\nI can increase font sizes,\nI could change colors of text.\n\n138\n00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:27.530\nI can go pretty crazy with\nwhat I want it to look like.\n\n139\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.820\nAnd that's really hard,\nthat's kind of hard to read.\n\n140\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.430\nBut I'm really going off\nthe rails a little bit\n\n141\n00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.790\nwith all the different things\nthat you could format.\n\n142\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.220\nNow it is a shape.\n\n143\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.180\nAnd if you wanted,\n\n144\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.320\nyou can use all the things on\nthe Format tab, and that's great.\n\n145\n00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.060\nNotice you can also change\nthe word art style.\n\n146\n00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.660\nSo I want all of the things\nin the plot area to have this\n\n147\n00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.179\nparticular word art style.\n\n148\n00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:56.511\nThis is getting hard to watch.\n\n149\n00:07:56.511 --> 00:08:00.683\n[LAUGH] But I can change that But you\ncould also get into, if you wanna go even\n\n150\n00:08:00.683 --> 00:08:04.788\nfurther into this, if you right click\non any of the elements that you have\n\n151\n00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:09.230\nselected for the sense the plot area,\nyou have or I guess it's the chart area,\n\n152\n00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.737\nsorry, down at the bottom, you see, and\nthere's a little bit behind my head,\n\n153\n00:08:13.737 --> 00:08:16.950\njust so you can see and\nthis pane is gonna come over here.\n\n154\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:21.310\nSo, let's go ahead and remove my head and\nwe'll go with the format chart and\n\n155\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.850\nyou can see that it brings up\nthe format chart area task pane,\n\n156\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.430\nthis has come up in our shapes,\neverything.\n\n157\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.840\nYou can always get to this pane and\nget even more nitty-gritty\n\n158\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.490\ninto the different elements that you\ncan add to these particular areas,\n\n159\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.180\nmeaning the fills, the borders and the\neffects and that’s where, here’s my fill.\n\n160\n00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.630\nWe were going through\njust our solid colors,\n\n161\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.770\nbut you could always throw in a picture.\n\n162\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.074\nRemember we said we had\nto get Fuego in there?\n\n163\n00:08:51.074 --> 00:08:51.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n164\n00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.500\n&gt;&gt; So I get into my fuego,\nI get into my picture and text fills and\n\n165\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.810\nlook at all of these crazy things that I\ncan do with like tiling my picture and\n\n166\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.690\nwe always have our good old dead fish.\n\n167\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.260\n&gt;&gt; There he is.\n\n168\n00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.280\n&gt;&gt; Got to throw that fish fossil in there.\n\n169\n00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.800\nSo this is just another\nplace that I can get to,\n\n170\n00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.200\nformatting my different objects,\nrather than going into here,\n\n171\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.720\nbecause I could pick a picture,\nI could pick a texture.\n\n172\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.670\nBut, I don't get all of the different\nthings that I could do to format\n\n173\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.610\nthat particular thing.\n\n174\n00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.030\nI tend to like the format chart area, or\n\n175\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.630\nreally just format task pane that\ncomes over here to the right.\n\n176\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.140\nSo let's keep on going over here, we got\nour picture, let's click on that File\n\n177\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.388\nbutton, and then we will find,\nthere he is, in all his glory.\n\n178\n00:09:41.388 --> 00:09:46.600\nSo I could change my picture, or\nI can always pick from online or\n\n179\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.070\nthe different things and how I wanna\ntitle it, tile, not title, sorry.\n\n180\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.600\nMoving over to these would be where I\ncould change my effects, and that's where\n\n181\n00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.890\nall the different effects that we had\nhere, more knobs to turn, basically,\n\n182\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.960\nand then you also have the particular\nproperties of this particular piece.\n\n183\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:09.180\nNow, we did talk about alternate\ntexts in our Images episode,\n\n184\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.150\nit's actually Images- Part Two.\n\n185\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:16.070\nThat was, to me, a really great episode\nto talk about the history of what alt\n\n186\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.690\ntext means and why you should add it to\nany graphical element, including a chart,\n\n187\n00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.710\nand this is for, of course, accessibility,\nfor people that are not sighted.\n\n188\n00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.281\nThey're non-sighted, and you can't\nvisually see what's going on, but\n\n189\n00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:30.080\nyou could describe what's going on.\n\n190\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.914\nI wouldn't necessarily add it to the\nchart, well, I guess the chart area would\n\n191\n00:10:34.914 --> 00:10:38.880\nbe the one add this one to, but\nI wouldn't add it necessarily to a series.\n\n192\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.230\nI'm not sure how that\nwould actually read to\n\n193\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.070\nsomeone with a screen reader, but I would\nprobably go ahead and put it on chart.\n\n194\n00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.660\nBut it's always really good to try to\nadd this any graphical element for\n\n195\n00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.290\naccessibility purposes, and so, that’s why\nyou have this particular option, cuz like,\n\n196\n00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.520\nwell, it’s a chart,\nwhy do you put alternate text?\n\n197\n00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.730\nIt’s a graphical element,\nso we need to describe it.\n\n198\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.310\nAnd keeping on going,\nwe have our different text options,\n\n199\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.740\nthese are all the things over here on\nthis WordArt styles tab, or group,\n\n200\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.670\nI should say,\non this particular format tab\n\n201\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.240\nto make sure that we are formatting\nthe text of everything.\n\n202\n00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.990\nAll right, lovely, so,\nI need to go back, let close this.\n\n203\n00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.801\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee looks so happy.\n\n204\n00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:27.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah,\nyou asked if he was wearing pants.\n\n205\n00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.793\nWell, we just put him in a top hat for\nthis one.\n\n206\n00:11:29.793 --> 00:11:30.849\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But he did have\n\n207\n00:11:30.849 --> 00:11:34.545\nan entire outfit with a little dress and\na little scarf, and yeah,\n\n208\n00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:38.070\nthat was really all we had left\nat the end of this photo shoot.\n\n209\n00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.347\n&gt;&gt; It looks like he's thinking right here,\nsilly human.\n\n210\n00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:46.096\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or I'm going to get\nyou in your sleep [LAUGH].\n\n211\n00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:46.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you're asleep.\n\n212\n00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:49.800\n&gt;&gt; That's probably more\nof what he's doing.\n\n213\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.810\nSo a few other things that\nI wanted to talk about,\n\n214\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.650\nwe didn't talk about\nchange the chart type, and\n\n215\n00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.060\nthen, I wanted to explore a little\nbit more about the pie chart,\n\n216\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.430\nbecause I think we've got the idea that\nif you can click it, you can format it.\n\n217\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.700\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; And you can go as deep as you want or\n\n218\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.882\nnot, and then just go ahead and\nthrow on a nice little style, and\n\n219\n00:12:07.882 --> 00:12:11.470\nthen, that's honestly the easiest\nway to kind of clear out everything.\n\n220\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.610\nI got a little too crazy with the knobs,\n\n221\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.400\njust throw on a chart style and\nit kind of clears everything out.\n\n222\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.075\nSo, we're back to decent land over here.\n\n223\n00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:25.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Changing the chart type,\n\n224\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.670\nmaybe I want to take this same information\nand make it into a line chart.\n\n225\n00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.210\nThat was easy, okay, and\nthen throw another style,\n\n226\n00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.600\nand this is what we saw in that\nPowerPoint presentation of same data,\n\n227\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.150\njust representing it in\na different type of chart.\n\n228\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.270\nCertain types of charts are better for\n\n229\n00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:48.290\ncertain parts of information, so it\njust depends on how you want to show it.\n\n230\n00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.500\nYou can get into some of these 3D\nsurface charts, those are always fun or\n\n231\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.373\nthese area charts, those are always good.\n\n232\n00:12:56.835 --> 00:12:58.855\nLet's go with this one,\n\n233\n00:12:58.855 --> 00:13:03.715\nand we'll click okay, and hmm, yeah,\ncuz I totally understand what this means.\n\n234\n00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:04.515\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n235\n00:13:04.515 --> 00:13:05.795\nIt's very topographical.\n\n236\n00:13:05.795 --> 00:13:07.695\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so\n\n237\n00:13:07.695 --> 00:13:12.135\nmaybe this data doesn't lend itself\nto this particular type of chart, but\n\n238\n00:13:12.135 --> 00:13:15.745\nyou could go through and change the\ndifferent ones that you might want to do.\n\n239\n00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:20.700\nI could do a 3D clustered bar chart,\nthis, again,\n\n240\n00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.560\nI feel like shows the information\na little bit better than a surface chart,\n\n241\n00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.620\nit's just a different\nway of displaying it.\n\n242\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.280\nLet's get into the pie charts,\nso let's come down here,\n\n243\n00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.690\nthere it is, there's our pie chart and\nwe'll click on it and see what happens.\n\n244\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.970\nOkay, well this says activity of the cast,\nbut what is this?\n\n245\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.750\nRemember with a pie chart,\nit's only comparing one data series,\n\n246\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.615\nit's not really comparing it, well,\nit's comparing the series of one category.\n\n247\n00:13:49.615 --> 00:13:51.640\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Let's come into the edit data and\n\n248\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.630\nsee what it did.\n\n249\n00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.120\nIt's showing this, but\nit's really only showing, there's 2,\n\n250\n00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.175\nit's kinda hard to see, 2,\n4 and 13, that's Fuego.\n\n251\n00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:01.860\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n252\n00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.470\nSo, it's taking that first series\nthat was in my information, and\n\n253\n00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.642\nthat's all it's displaying.\n\n254\n00:14:07.642 --> 00:14:08.152\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n255\n00:14:08.152 --> 00:14:11.260\nSo, that's where it can get\na little confusing, when it's like,\n\n256\n00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.030\nwell, this is the chartable area.\n\n257\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.970\nWell, that's because I switched\nit into a chart type that\n\n258\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.290\ndoesn't do multiple series,\n\n259\n00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.288\nit's just a single series, and that's fine\nif that's all I need to do is show Fuego.\n\n260\n00:14:24.288 --> 00:14:28.620\nAll right, well cool, we'll just know\nthat that's what it's doing and I can\n\n261\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.960\nchange some of our layouts if I wanted to,\nand that's where we have our legend, and\n\n262\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.600\nmaybe if I turned on my category title,\nI could say Fuego.\n\n263\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.620\nAnd that's where really the chart title,\n\n264\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.820\nI'd probably say activity of The Fuego,\nright?\n\n265\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.295\nSo, now everybody knows\nthat we're talking just.\n\n266\n00:14:46.295 --> 00:14:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; About Fuego here and the sleep, eat,\n\n267\n00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.900\nand play.\n\n268\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.470\nI can take each one of these pieces, and\nI'm going to zoom in a little bit so\n\n269\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.030\nyou can see this,\nbecause that white is really hard to read.\n\n270\n00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:02.140\nYou see, as soon as I single clicked\non the labels, it selected all of them,\n\n271\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:07.570\nbecause I can come over here, and I could\nbump up the size, I can make it bold and\n\n272\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:12.100\nI can make the text yellow or\nsome other color.\n\n273\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.370\nI'll make it red for now, just so you guys\ncan see it, cuz I like the style, but\n\n274\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.260\nI just really couldn't see the information\nvery well with this particular font and\n\n275\n00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.370\nthis particular size, and that color.\n\n276\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.600\nSo, you can go through and\nchange it, and just like before,\n\n277\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.780\nyou can change the different series.\n\n278\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.930\nNow with the clustered column, you'd want\nto change all of the series at one time.\n\n279\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.480\nIf I clicked here, and\n\n280\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.330\nthen went over to design, well actually,\nyeah, let's go over to design.\n\n281\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.240\nLet's go over to Format, sorry,\nwrong one and I change the fill,\n\n282\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.270\nnotice it's changing all of it.\n\n283\n00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.510\nIn a pie chart,\n\n284\n00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:51.275\nyou really would want to change one\npart of a series different from another.\n\n285\n00:15:51.275 --> 00:15:54.862\nSo that's where you do the single\nclick one more time and\n\n286\n00:15:54.862 --> 00:15:59.151\nit just changes to where it's\nselecting that one piece of the pie.\n\n287\n00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:03.483\nAnd, you could change the different\nthings that you would want to,\n\n288\n00:16:03.483 --> 00:16:07.370\ncuz maybe you would wanna put\na Glow on this earth something.\n\n289\n00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.874\nThat doesn't really make much sense.\n\n290\n00:16:08.874 --> 00:16:09.737\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You could.\n\n291\n00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:10.965\n&gt;&gt; Actually the glow,\n\n292\n00:16:10.965 --> 00:16:15.670\nit's like hey, I'm kind of highlighting\nthis particular piece of the pie.\n\n293\n00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.300\nSo, I can roll with that, that works.\n\n294\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.000\nThe other thing is since I've\ngrabbed this one piece of the pie,\n\n295\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.520\nremember we saw that exploding pie?\n\n296\n00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.366\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n297\n00:16:23.366 --> 00:16:27.050\nI was kinda like I wanted to take\nthe piece of the pie and give it to you.\n\n298\n00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.960\nSo you can take it and\njust click hold and drag up and\n\n299\n00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.840\nit just takes that one piece\nof the pie out, because I had\n\n300\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:40.720\nisolated this one particular item of\nthe chart or this part of the series.\n\n301\n00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.690\nI'm gonna click off of this and\nthen come back.\n\n302\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.190\nIf I had all the pieces together and\nI can see like one, two.\n\n303\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.880\nI can see the points here.\n\n304\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.669\nIf I drag this out now,\nwell that's just that one piece.\n\n305\n00:16:52.669 --> 00:16:53.574\nLet me try it again.\n\n306\n00:16:53.574 --> 00:16:57.990\nI was trying to get to where you can\nexplode all of the pie out at one time.\n\n307\n00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.610\nIs it not gonna do it for me?\n\n308\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.610\nWell that's okay,\nwe can take each individual ones.\n\n309\n00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.870\nIt used to be where if you could,\nor maybe it's still is,\n\n310\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.470\nI'm just not selecting it right.\n\n311\n00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.570\nYou have the whole pie selected and\npull the pieces out.\n\n312\n00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.530\nThey all explode.\n\n313\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.410\nEqual distance from each other.\n\n314\n00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.220\nBut you know what,\n\n315\n00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.480\nyou could always come out and pull\nthe pieces out to where it looks that way.\n\n316\n00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.770\nTo me it starts kind of losing the\ncontinuity of what a pie chart really is,\n\n317\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.630\nI like the isolating one piece of\na pie that's out a little bit more,\n\n318\n00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:31.480\nso I wouldn't want the pie to explode too\nmuch, cause then we just have a mess.\n\n319\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.160\n[LAUGH] So those are the different parts\nof our pie charts, the data labels.\n\n320\n00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.830\nThese things are right here.\n\n321\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.540\nit's only showing me the percentages,\nbut it's not showing me the value.\n\n322\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.350\nOr maybe I only want to see\nthe value like two, four, and 13, or\n\n323\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.760\nwhatever those particular ones were,\nand not the percentages.\n\n324\n00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.300\nSo, having the data label selected,\nyou right click and\n\n325\n00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.820\nthen you can, it's not format the data\nseries, it's the data labels.\n\n326\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.048\nYou come to here and this is where a\ncouple of them are behind my head as well.\n\n327\n00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:07.379\nYou can see that we have\nthe percentages that is checked off.\n\n328\n00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:08.822\nSo if uncheck that and\n\n329\n00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:13.242\ngo with value that's where it's\nshowing the particular value.\n\n330\n00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:17.746\nAnd if I scroll down a little bit more,\nnotice it says best fit, which is fine,\n\n331\n00:18:17.746 --> 00:18:21.250\nbut what if I wanted it more\ntowards the inside or the center?\n\n332\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.960\nSo I can move this around\nfrom the different\n\n333\n00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.200\noptions that I have in\nthe formatting the data labels.\n\n334\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.360\nAnd I might go I kinda like\nthe center a little bit better.\n\n335\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.760\nAnd you can have multiples.\n\n336\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.049\nI can have the value and the percentages.\n\n337\n00:18:34.049 --> 00:18:37.475\nAnd this is where with\nthat particular font size,\n\n338\n00:18:37.475 --> 00:18:42.220\nmaybe I should go back out to the inside\nend and I can see a little bit.\n\n339\n00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.500\nI made the font a little bit bigger so\n\n340\n00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.120\nthat's why it's kind of a little off\nbalance at least from my eyeballs.\n\n341\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.720\nBut that was something that I\nwould always have people ask me,\n\n342\n00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.380\nis how did you get the percentages\nto show on a pie chart, and\n\n343\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.770\nhow do I get the values, so you just have\nto go in and format those data labels.\n\n344\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.870\nAnd just to kind of come back full circle,\njust this is a pie.\n\n345\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.335\nBack to food, aren't we?\n\n346\n00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:07.660\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n347\n00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.098\n&gt;&gt; You can still,\n&gt;&gt; Rhubarb pie.\n\n348\n00:19:09.098 --> 00:19:10.666\n&gt;&gt; Rhubarb.\n\n349\n00:19:10.666 --> 00:19:11.502\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n350\n00:19:11.502 --> 00:19:13.400\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm wanna\nstart singing a song.\n\n351\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.859\nWasn't there like some children's song,\nsomething about rhubarb.\n\n352\n00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:17.137\n&gt;&gt; Rhubarb pie.\n\n353\n00:19:17.137 --> 00:19:19.377\n&gt;&gt; Something's coming back in my memory,\nright?\n\n354\n00:19:19.377 --> 00:19:20.584\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n355\n00:19:20.584 --> 00:19:22.588\n&gt;&gt; So I could add different things here,\n\n356\n00:19:22.588 --> 00:19:26.095\nand I can change a lot, and\nnotice some of them are going to be grayed\n\n357\n00:19:26.095 --> 00:19:29.210\nout because we're in this\nparticular type of chart.\n\n358\n00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.670\nIt's not gonna give me everything but\n\n359\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.100\nyou can come back and\nadd the different elements.\n\n360\n00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.500\nYou could go with a quick layout, you can\nthrow in a style so whatever type of chart\n\n361\n00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.010\nyou have you can do and\nyou can add it into your word document.\n\n362\n00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.620\nNow that being said, this is word.\n\n363\n00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.350\nSo all I've been doing with you here,\nI'm gonna close this task pane,\n\n364\n00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.880\nI'm gonna zoom out a little bit for you.\n\n365\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.020\nMaybe it's been done on a single page,\nno other text.\n\n366\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.010\nHow can we get this to interact with\na document that I already created because\n\n367\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.580\nwhy would you wanna add\na chart into your Word file?\n\n368\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.100\nWell, maybe you're doing an annual\nreport for your company and\n\n369\n00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.240\nyou need to have this type of information.\n\n370\n00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.870\nBut it's gonna be part of multiple pages,\nparagraphs, other texts that's around it.\n\n371\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.680\nSo, I'm going to keep this here.\n\n372\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.840\nLet's go over to our add graphics.\n\n373\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.193\nI had closed that down, because remember,\nit kept flipping back and forth.\n\n374\n00:20:19.193 --> 00:20:20.087\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was flipping a little bit.\n\n375\n00:20:20.087 --> 00:20:23.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I just went ahead and\nclosed it because I didn't need it.\n\n376\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.786\nIf I wanted to put this into my document.\n\n377\n00:20:25.786 --> 00:20:30.714\nAt first, I would say just treat it like\na paragraph, because usually with a chart\n\n378\n00:20:30.714 --> 00:20:35.155\nyou're gonna wanna have enough space\nto actually show the information.\n\n379\n00:20:35.155 --> 00:20:39.227\nIf it's kinda small off to the side,\nyou might not see it as much, but\n\n380\n00:20:39.227 --> 00:20:43.722\nmaybe like a small pie chart, off to\nthe side, and you want off over into your\n\n381\n00:20:43.722 --> 00:20:48.150\nparagraph and have all this text wrap\naround it cuz this is a graphic.\n\n382\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.880\nSo how can I do the positioning and\nthe different word wrap.\n\n383\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.880\nI'm gonna take our file right here,\nI'm gonna put my cursor.\n\n384\n00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.700\nI'm gonna hit the Enter key because this\nis where I've decided I want my chart.\n\n385\n00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.560\nI will insert the chart.\n\n386\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.680\nI'm gonna just keep the default\nnow cuz just for examples.\n\n387\n00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.350\nHere we go, I've added all my information.\n\n388\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.430\nSure, we'll take that.\n\n389\n00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:13.320\n[LAUGH] And it acts like, right here to me\nthis would be great as this was what we're\n\n390\n00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.580\ntalking about, we're describing\nthe advice from a caterpillar and\n\n391\n00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.450\nwe're charting something\nwith caterpillars here.\n\n392\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.610\nAnd then it moves on\nto the next paragraph.\n\n393\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.420\nI'm also gonna turn on my show and\nhide button just so\n\n394\n00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.550\nwe can see that there it is,\nthere's my paragraph.\n\n395\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:32.300\nAnd I can take this whole element and\nmaybe make it a little bit smaller.\n\n396\n00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.300\nOkay, notice that it does not\nkeep the proportions constrained.\n\n397\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.430\nBecause you could make it\na little less high and less wide,\n\n398\n00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.140\nbut I don't really like that\nto me it`s like stretching it.\n\n399\n00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.460\nSo if you wanted, I did my undo, hold\nyour shift key while you grab a corner.\n\n400\n00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.220\nThis is one that with an image,\nyou didn't have to hold your shift key.\n\n401\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.410\nIt automatically constrained proportions.\n\n402\n00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:55.930\nBut with your shapes, it didn't.\n\n403\n00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.190\nSo on this,\nthis is more of a shape than an image.\n\n404\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.730\nSo, hold that shift key and\ngo ahead and make it a little smaller,\n\n405\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.430\nif you wanted to.\n\n406\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.220\nThis is a paragraph, so\n\n407\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.932\nif you hit the center button, you notice\nhow now, I've centered the paragraph.\n\n408\n00:22:09.932 --> 00:22:12.560\nIt is in that enter mark so\nI can go ahead and\n\n409\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.460\nposition it within this paragraph and\neverything is wonderful.\n\n410\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.780\nBut if I wanted to move this around\nlike an image and put that text wrap,\n\n411\n00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.580\ncuz maybe I do want it off to the side.\n\n412\n00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.070\nNotice that by default, if I start moving\nthis around, it’s not moving it like\n\n413\n00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:34.568\na normal shape because\nthe default text wrap in a chart,\n\n414\n00:22:34.568 --> 00:22:40.730\nthe little rainbow-looking thing,\nthe layout options, it's inline with text.\n\n415\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.820\nThat's the same where\nimages were by default.\n\n416\n00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:48.900\nIf you wanted it to move around freely and\nattach it or anchor itself to a specific\n\n417\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.750\nparagraph and then be able to do that\nword wrap, change it to the square or\n\n418\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:59.260\nthe tight wrap, and then it becomes\nits own kind of movable element.\n\n419\n00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.600\nI can choose this around, don't grab\na data series, make sure you're grabbing\n\n420\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.610\na higher chart, and I could move it around\nand put it to this particular side.\n\n421\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.590\nMaybe I'll make this a little bit smaller.\n\n422\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.690\nThis is where it's starting\nto kind of not show as much.\n\n423\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.980\nThis is where may be a pie chart.\n\n424\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:21.340\nSo however, vague you want to be\nto frankly convey the information.\n\n425\n00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.450\nThat's great.\nBut just remember that word wrap and\n\n426\n00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.250\nit is anchored and\nwill move with it's text.\n\n427\n00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.830\nSo if you start adding\na bunch of text here\n\n428\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.890\nthe chart will move with that\nparticular paragraph and\n\n429\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:40.030\nthat's what that little anchor over to\nthe other right though to the left.\n\n430\n00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:44.120\nThe left hand side of the document because\nit says this is the paragraph that I am\n\n431\n00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.680\nconnected to.\n\n432\n00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.720\nThis might be review if you watched\na lot of these other episodes but\n\n433\n00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.360\nagain if you're watching it separately\nI would do one to cover this.\n\n434\n00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.920\nIf you didn't want it to move with\nthe text and you want it to be\n\n435\n00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.680\nfixed in that one particular position,\nlet's jump down back into it.\n\n436\n00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.030\nYou do need to make sure that\nyou change the layout or\n\n437\n00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:07.500\nthe word wrap of this and that's why we're\nhovering over it cause you can see a lot.\n\n438\n00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.230\nIt is on that format, wrong element.\n\n439\n00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.946\n&gt;&gt; That's the like the behind text kind\nof a button feature and it's then, yeah.\n\n440\n00:24:14.946 --> 00:24:18.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the stuff that we did with\nthe shapes and everything you saw, yeah,\n\n441\n00:24:18.586 --> 00:24:21.090\nback in PowerPoint where I\ndon't want it to move around.\n\n442\n00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Where this one, if you don't want it to\n\n443\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.470\nmove with the text, and\nyou want to fix the position on the page,\n\n444\n00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:33.950\ndon't ever move if my text moves around\njust turn it to this particular feature,\n\n445\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.850\nand I guess we would say fix the position\non the page rather than move a text,\n\n446\n00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.760\nthat's the one that's on by default.\n\n447\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.130\nAnd you still do have the positionings\nhere with do I want I want it\n\n448\n00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.500\nfixed to the bottom right hand corner,\nor the top left or the middle, middle.\n\n449\n00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.260\n&gt;&gt; So you have those back in.\n\n450\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.870\nI was thinking of it like a table,\n\n451\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.930\na table you didn't have that wrap\ntext button up on the ribbons,\n\n452\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:59.300\nbut my tables and charts are starting\nto blend together a little bit.\n\n453\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.950\n[LAUGH] Timmy and the episodes that I'm\nrecording, so you do have these buttons up\n\n454\n00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:10.960\nhere on the format tab of how you want to\nhave that graphical element, play around,\n\n455\n00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.920\nI guess you can say it with a different\nelements on your page such as your text.\n\n456\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.810\nSo you can do your wrap, your positioning.\n\n457\n00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:21.900\nAnd if you do have the stacking or\nI'm not sure how much on a chart that\n\n458\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.990\nI'm gonna have things stacked on top of\nit but I guess you could, that's more for\n\n459\n00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.440\nthe shapes and the things that\nyou want to group together.\n\n460\n00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.370\nSo how it acts within a working Word file\n\n461\n00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.780\nonce we get it to put all our different\nformats and get our information.\n\n462\n00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.948\nThat's where I wanted to kind of conclude\nall this information about adding charts\n\n463\n00:25:40.948 --> 00:25:42.207\nto your Word documents.\n\n464\n00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:47.010\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, great job, Vaughn and\nthis was charts part two.\n\n465\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.830\nWord 2016 Advanced.\n\n466\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.942\nThere is a part one.\n\n467\n00:25:49.942 --> 00:25:51.670\nYou wanna make sure you see that too and\nin fact,\n\n468\n00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.570\nsee all of the videos in the series.\n\n469\n00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:54.700\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n470\n00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.910\nAnd Office Pro TV.\n\n471\n00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.870\nYou know a good Office\npro is always learning.\n\n472\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.860\nThey always are.\n\n473\n00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.780\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n474\n00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne

00:00:10.001\nhelping you to learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:14.703\nI'm your host Zach Memos as\nwe continue on with Word 2016\n\n5\n00:00:14.703 --> 00:00:17.827\nAdvanced Graphical Text Objects.\n\n6\n00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:19.040\nSounds like fun.\n\n7\n00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne Smith is gonna tell us all\n\n8\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.330\nabout it.\n\n9\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.720\n&gt;&gt; It almost does sound\nkind of like spooky, right?\n\n10\n00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it.\n\n11\n00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:26.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's like what\nexactly are we talking about?\n\n12\n00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.310\n[LAUGH] Well,\nit's exactly what it says, almost.\n\n13\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.680\nWe're using text in a graphical form.\n\n14\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Word art.\n\n15\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n16\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.120\nit still almost sounds a little scary\nlike it's in this weird form, okay, yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.160\nBut definitely Word art,\nwe're going to hit that.\n\n18\n00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.580\nAnd we're also going to just talk about\ntext boxes as their own individual\n\n19\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.410\nelements that we can move around and\nformat just like we would a shape.\n\n20\n00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.215\nIt's almost really like a square\nwith text inside of it.\n\n21\n00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:54.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds good to me.\n\n22\n00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:55.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n23\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.929\n&gt;&gt; And I also wanna throw in\nsome hyperlinks in there.\n\n24\n00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.244\nNow that's not really text\nas graphical objects, but\n\n25\n00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:05.638\nsince I figure we're talking about\ntext and we're talking about text,\n\n26\n00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:09.040\n[LAUGH] I wanted to just kinda\nthrow that in there as well.\n\n27\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.195\nSo like I said, let's jump to it.\n\n28\n00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:14.513\nI have a new file here,\njust blank Word document,\n\n29\n00:01:14.513 --> 00:01:19.807\njust to kind of play around with things\nand get the different elements in there.\n\n30\n00:01:19.807 --> 00:01:22.499\nBut I also have our hyperlinks and\n\n31\n00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.510\ntext boxes Word file here to where\nwe have a working Word file.\n\n32\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.353\nSo let me just give you a quick little\nrun through, that's little bit too far.\n\n33\n00:01:30.353 --> 00:01:32.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just have multiple pages, and\n\n34\n00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.350\nI do have them formatted with styles.\n\n35\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.470\nAnd I went through, and you can see\nthat there are different heading levels\n\n36\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.400\nin here, we have heading ones and\nheading twos.\n\n37\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.240\nAnd I did reformat that particular heading\nto make it a little bolder and bigger.\n\n38\n00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.960\nAnd this is gonna come to play\nwhen we talk about our hyperlinks.\n\n39\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.080\nSo just giving you a quick\noverview of where we're at,\n\n40\n00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.870\nI like to kind of set the stage,\nas you might say.\n\n41\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.108\n&gt;&gt; You're setting the stage quite well.\n\n42\n00:01:56.108 --> 00:01:58.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nnow we know where everything is.\n\n43\n00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.536\nBack on this blank Word document,\n\n44\n00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:04.992\nhow would I insert a text\nbox into my document?\n\n45\n00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:10.740\nYep, you probably know by now,\nInsert tab, over here I have Text Box.\n\n46\n00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.570\nNow I have this drop down\nthat comes with it, and\n\n47\n00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.320\nI have these different\ntypes of text boxes.\n\n48\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.740\nAs you can see,\nsome of them are kind of preformatted.\n\n49\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.800\nThe simple text box is\nwhere we will start, but\n\n50\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.620\nif I go through I have\nlike this Facet Quote.\n\n51\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.390\nAnd I have some site banners and some\nother ones that I scroll down through here\n\n52\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.650\nthat go through this integral and\nion and motion.\n\n53\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.525\nAnd if this is bringing back any memories\nfor you possibly of hey, headers and\n\n54\n00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.600\nfooters, I saw a lot of\nthose premade headers and\n\n55\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.535\nfooters with these particular names, yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:47.128\nYou might have seen some\nof the cover pages,\n\n57\n00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:51.474\nif you've watched the Word 2016\nEssentials show, we covered a lot of\n\n58\n00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:56.469\nthese different items that you can add to\nyour pages and they were all preformatted.\n\n59\n00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.005\nHm, kinda sounds like\na theme going on here, right?\n\n60\n00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.415\n[LAUGH] So\nif you added the retrospect sidebar and\n\n61\n00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.150\nthe retrospect header and footer.\n\n62\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.970\nI'm not sure if that's a specific one\nthat has a header and a footer in there.\n\n63\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.510\nBut you have like the stationery set\nwhere everything looks the same.\n\n64\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.310\nWhere your cover page is the same\nname as the type of page numbers and\n\n65\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.094\nthe sidebars, and\nall of this kind comes together.\n\n66\n00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:21.777\nLater in this particular series,\n\n67\n00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:25.800\nwe're gonna be talking about an\ninteresting thing called Building Blocks.\n\n68\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.640\nCuz all of these things that you're seeing\nthat have that preformatted look to it for\n\n69\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.380\nyour page elements, they all live in\na file called buildingblock.dotx.\n\n70\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.823\nFor now you just go, okay, sounds fine.\n\n71\n00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:41.608\n[LAUGH] But that's where they live and\n\n72\n00:03:41.608 --> 00:03:43.739\nwhen we get into adding\nour own Quick Parts,\n\n73\n00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.437\nit's gonna kind of put it in that same\nplace where these things are located.\n\n74\n00:03:47.437 --> 00:03:50.756\nAnyways, I digress, but\njust giving you a little background.\n\n75\n00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:53.802\nI always like to give a history\nlesson on top of everything.\n\n76\n00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:54.530\n&gt;&gt; No, I love that.\n\n77\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.940\nYeah right, I mean, it kinda gives you\na better idea of how all this stuff works.\n\n78\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.302\nSo even if you're like, I don't even know\nhow that connects together, just go okay,\n\n79\n00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:01.818\nit's fine.\n\n80\n00:04:01.818 --> 00:04:07.159\n[LAUGH] We go with Simple Text, and then\nit puts a, basically a square with text\n\n81\n00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.932\ninside it, some placeholder text for me\nto just delete anything that's in there.\n\n82\n00:04:12.932 --> 00:04:18.980\nHit the Delete key, and they we type in\naway, so I could say, this a text box.\n\n83\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.457\n&gt;&gt; A graphical text box.\n\n84\n00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:25.256\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's something that I can now\nadd as its own element, like a shape,\n\n85\n00:04:25.256 --> 00:04:27.978\nand I can move it around, I can format it.\n\n86\n00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:31.360\nI can do all sorts of different,\nI can make it bigger or smaller.\n\n87\n00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.230\nI can get the four pointed arrow,\nso that way I can move it around.\n\n88\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.585\nThe rotator swirly thingy.\n\n89\n00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:38.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n90\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.420\n&gt;&gt; Wow, technical definitions here.\n\n91\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.701\n&gt;&gt; Now that is a technical term, isn't it?\n\n92\n00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:43.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely.\n\n93\n00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:44.736\n&gt;&gt; Locating swirly thingy, I like it.\n\n94\n00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:47.508\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so\nI mean that's what it looks like to me.\n\n95\n00:04:47.508 --> 00:04:48.153\n&gt;&gt; That's what it is.\n\n96\n00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:50.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I can take that and\nmove that around.\n\n97\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.120\nBut for now, you could go through\nthe same things as a shape.\n\n98\n00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.398\nI can change the color, I can change the\noutline, I can change the outline weight.\n\n99\n00:05:00.398 --> 00:05:03.470\nIf I am going kind of fast,\ndefinitely check out some other\n\n100\n00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.780\nepisodes where we do talk about this\nway more in depth with the shapes.\n\n101\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.210\nAnd it's really the shapes episode, will\nprobably be the best one to look at, and\n\n102\n00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.880\nI can go through all the different things.\n\n103\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.150\nI can move it around individually,\nor independently,\n\n104\n00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.840\nI should say,\nbecause it is really just like a shape.\n\n105\n00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.750\nI can come and\nchange the different font, the sizes,\n\n106\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.390\nthe color, you format to your\nheart's content, and you go crazy.\n\n107\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.350\nThat's really the basis of inserting\na text box into your Word document.\n\n108\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.650\nNow, since we are talking about\nit in an active Word document,\n\n109\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.830\nlets come on over here, and lets zoom\nin a little bit more, there we go.\n\n110\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.340\nI'll put my cursor, it doesn't really\nmatter where for this particular example.\n\n111\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.979\nGoing back into Insert &gt; Text Box, and\nlets pick one that's a little fancier now.\n\n112\n00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.620\nWe'll do this Facet Quote, even if you\ndon't have anything to quote, it's still\n\n113\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.410\njust a box that has multiple items in\nhere that are already preformatted.\n\n114\n00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.820\nAnd I can move this around\nto where I want it to go.\n\n115\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.440\nSo just like a shape, and it\nautomatically has that text wrap with it.\n\n116\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.110\nIt's going to wrap the text around it,\nbecause it has the,\n\n117\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.140\nwhoops that's the wrong one.\n\n118\n00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.462\nLet's go with the Drawing Tools and\nthen the Wrap Text of Square,\n\n119\n00:06:18.462 --> 00:06:19.962\nthat's where you go.\n\n120\n00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:24.052\nOne thing I wanna point out here\nin this particular text box, and\n\n121\n00:06:24.052 --> 00:06:29.055\nsome of the others that have that\npreformatting, there's a couple different\n\n122\n00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:34.092\npieces that are going on in this text\nbox that's really grouped into one Item.\n\n123\n00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:37.357\nLike this little square\nthingy thing [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:06:37.357 --> 00:06:38.345\nThere's those technical terms again.\n\n125\n00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:39.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is getting too technical.\n\n126\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah, how else do you\ndescribe that thing that's up there?\n\n127\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.010\n&gt;&gt; It's a thing.\n\n128\n00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.850\n&gt;&gt; It's a thingy thing.\n\n129\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.598\n&gt;&gt; Chevron thingy.\n\n130\n00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:47.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I have this,\n\n131\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.270\nI could change the fill,\nnotice it's changing the whole box.\n\n132\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.120\nWell that wasn't really what I\nthought it was supposed to select.\n\n133\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.425\nSo if I click it one more time,\nyou start, this is a grouped element,\n\n134\n00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:03.927\ncuz I could go back through,\nand I could ungroup it.\n\n135\n00:07:03.927 --> 00:07:06.610\nCuz I just know, because I've\nplayed around with these things, so\n\n136\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.450\njust be aware that some of\nthese preformatted elements,\n\n137\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.490\nyou do need to be careful\nabout where I'm clicking.\n\n138\n00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.582\nAnd what I have isolated as a piece of\nthis, cause you start moving this and\n\n139\n00:07:17.582 --> 00:07:20.429\nyou think you're, woah,\nwhat did I just do?\n\n140\n00:07:20.429 --> 00:07:25.625\nIt's like, I didn't move the whole text\nbox, I was actually selected on whatever\n\n141\n00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:31.060\nthis thing is right here as that white box\nbehind it, as opposed to the whole thing.\n\n142\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.040\nSo just be aware, watch those dots,\nif you need the whole text box,\n\n143\n00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.840\ngo to the very edge, get the whole thing,\nand move that around.\n\n144\n00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.320\nAnd that, of course, will mean that\nif you format this particular piece\n\n145\n00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.780\ndifferent than the other,\nit might start to get a little weird.\n\n146\n00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.550\nCuz there's so many different elements,\nthere's so many different shapes.\n\n147\n00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.214\nAnd another text box inside of it\nthat then you move this separately\n\n148\n00:07:58.214 --> 00:08:00.641\nthan the other piece, all right?\n\n149\n00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:04.327\nSo just being aware,\nknowing what we're looking at, and\n\n150\n00:08:04.327 --> 00:08:06.442\nunderstanding how it all works.\n\n151\n00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:08.549\nSee like that, it's particular shape fill,\n\n152\n00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:11.532\nlike it's not even applying what\nI thought it was going to apply.\n\n153\n00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:15.987\nBut hey, we know that, there, that's what\nI was trying to see, there's that box.\n\n154\n00:08:15.987 --> 00:08:18.447\nIt's a text box like\ninside of another box,\n\n155\n00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:20.852\nwith other pieces that's all one big box.\n\n156\n00:08:20.852 --> 00:08:24.649\nAnd all right hey, at least we know where\nwe can get to the different pieces and\n\n157\n00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:26.354\nwe know how it all wraps together.\n\n158\n00:08:26.354 --> 00:08:31.318\nSo sometimes just keeping the defaults,\nchanging these texts that I have in here\n\n159\n00:08:31.318 --> 00:08:34.021\nand then typing what I\nwant to have in there.\n\n160\n00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:38.721\nBut I don't like any of this right now, so\nI'm gonna go back out to the whole box,\n\n161\n00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:41.641\nhit the delete key and\nget rid of it and there we go.\n\n162\n00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:44.404\nAnd you can move it around and\nhave it in guard with the word wrap.\n\n163\n00:08:44.404 --> 00:08:49.585\nAll right, one thing that I do like with\nthese pre-formatted ones the sidebars.\n\n164\n00:08:49.585 --> 00:08:52.208\nHave you seen like newsletters?\n\n165\n00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:54.574\nWhere there's like\na story off the side and\n\n166\n00:08:54.574 --> 00:08:59.177\nyou really understand that's a different\nstory cuz it's like a different color or\n\n167\n00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:00.903\nsomething like that, right?\n\n168\n00:09:00.903 --> 00:09:03.376\nWell, they have it all pre-formatted for\nme.\n\n169\n00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:07.090\nIf I go over to insert,\ncome over here to our text box.\n\n170\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.858\nThese sidebar,\nlet's just go with this first one.\n\n171\n00:09:10.858 --> 00:09:14.227\nOkay, well I'll just say what I,\nwe're gonna do what I say, [LAUGH] and\n\n172\n00:09:14.227 --> 00:09:15.471\ngo with banded sidebars.\n\n173\n00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:18.792\nAs soon as I click on that, look at that,\nit puts the word wrap on it.\n\n174\n00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:20.441\nHere, let me zoom out on it so\nyou can see it.\n\n175\n00:09:20.441 --> 00:09:26.822\nIt formats it all just like you would\nhave like a side story in a newsletter.\n\n176\n00:09:26.822 --> 00:09:30.443\nAnd I didn't have to worry about making\ncolumns or doing any of the other stuff.\n\n177\n00:09:30.443 --> 00:09:33.101\nIt just poop, popped it right in\nthere it's like that's perfect.\n\n178\n00:09:33.101 --> 00:09:37.468\nAnd I do like it as a part of maybe looks\nlike kind of my letters and footers.\n\n179\n00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:40.725\nSelect this piece and\nI can get the two pointed arrows and\n\n180\n00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:42.525\nI can move this up a little bit,\n\n181\n00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:47.314\ncuz maybe I only want to go through these\ntwo paragraphs, and that's fantastic.\n\n182\n00:09:47.314 --> 00:09:50.483\nI come into here,\nstart adding some of the text and\n\n183\n00:09:50.483 --> 00:09:55.400\nI could just can say side story cause I\ndo not really what else to say right now.\n\n184\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.837\n[LAUGH] And I go ahead and\nput that in here,\n\n185\n00:09:57.837 --> 00:10:02.222\nthis is all just default placeholder text,\nso I could just get rid of it.\n\n186\n00:10:02.222 --> 00:10:05.623\nAnd then I could type\nwhatever I wanted to have.\n\n187\n00:10:05.623 --> 00:10:06.361\n&gt;&gt; Very professional looking.\n\n188\n00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:06.973\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n189\n00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:08.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah very nice, very nice.\n\n190\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.124\n&gt;&gt; It's really great that Word is trying\nto help us be able to make things that\n\n191\n00:10:13.124 --> 00:10:14.848\nlook really nice looking.\n\n192\n00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:15.404\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n193\n00:10:15.404 --> 00:10:16.392\n&gt;&gt; And you don't have to do much.\n\n194\n00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:19.782\nSo you could go ahead and find, you could\ncopy and paste something into here,\n\n195\n00:10:19.782 --> 00:10:23.083\nmaybe change your paste options to\nmatch all of the different formatting.\n\n196\n00:10:23.083 --> 00:10:26.931\nAnd that's a nice little element that\nyou could add with your sidebar.\n\n197\n00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:31.857\nI wanna come back over into our Word\ndocument there, that's just like,\n\n198\n00:10:31.857 --> 00:10:32.839\nwhat is this?\n\n199\n00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:33.928\nIt's just a blank document, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:33.928 --> 00:10:37.306\nI will delete this, then I will insert a,\n\n201\n00:10:37.306 --> 00:10:42.632\njust a basic text box to show you\nthe concept of linked text boxes.\n\n202\n00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:48.157\nNow this could be fun, thinking about\nlike hey, going with this sidebar, right?\n\n203\n00:10:48.157 --> 00:10:51.624\nSo you can correlate this into,\nhey I have my sidebar here.\n\n204\n00:10:51.624 --> 00:10:55.745\nMaybe on page seven, I wanna have\nthe continuation of the story.\n\n205\n00:10:55.745 --> 00:10:59.837\nCuz I've seen that in newsletters, where\nit was like continued on whatever page,\n\n206\n00:10:59.837 --> 00:11:02.824\nand it goes on to the next page\nmaybe somewhere down the line.\n\n207\n00:11:02.824 --> 00:11:06.016\nSo you could do this with\nany of your text boxes.\n\n208\n00:11:06.016 --> 00:11:10.566\nI just wanna demonstrate the concept\njust a little easier with our basic one.\n\n209\n00:11:10.566 --> 00:11:16.501\nI do have a document that has some\ntext that I want to copy into.\n\n210\n00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:23.217\nSo this is text for link boxes and\nI will include that in the extra files.\n\n211\n00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:27.362\nI'll take all of these I'll select it,\nI will copy it, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:29.379\nI'll right-click so\nyou can see me copying it.\n\n213\n00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:32.895\nCome back over into my Word document and\n\n214\n00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:38.341\nI will paste that information or\nthat text into the text box.\n\n215\n00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:42.193\nBut the thing is, this text box is too\nsmall for all that text, isn't there?\n\n216\n00:11:42.193 --> 00:11:45.130\nThere's a lot more than that,\nthere's overflow text in here.\n\n217\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.853\nWell I wanna make it to\nwhere I flow the overflow of\n\n218\n00:11:49.853 --> 00:11:53.435\nthis text box into another text box.\n\n219\n00:11:53.435 --> 00:11:56.961\nIn that way if I change each text box,\nit's gonna automatically change\n\n220\n00:11:56.961 --> 00:11:59.392\nhow the text kinda goes in and\nout of the text box.\n\n221\n00:11:59.392 --> 00:12:00.004\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n222\n00:12:00.004 --> 00:12:00.704\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty cool.\n\n223\n00:12:00.704 --> 00:12:03.994\nSo first is make one,\nget the text in there, cool.\n\n224\n00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:10.324\nMake another text box, Insert, and\nI will just go with a simple text box.\n\n225\n00:12:10.324 --> 00:12:15.577\nAgain, I could have whatever one,\nthis puts in default text or placeholder.\n\n226\n00:12:15.577 --> 00:12:19.548\nGet rid of that, that's why the biggest\npart right here is you have to clear\n\n227\n00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:23.708\neverything out, get all the placeholder,\nand make an empty text box, make it\n\n228\n00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:28.080\nwhatever size you want, because you could\nchange that later but that's the key.\n\n229\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.572\nAll right, so now, and you get all\nthe extra text out of this first one and\n\n230\n00:12:32.572 --> 00:12:37.081\nI'm going to, it's almost like, and\nyou'll see the icon in a second.\n\n231\n00:12:37.081 --> 00:12:41.059\nIt's almost like taking like\na measuring cup or whatever and\n\n232\n00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:43.165\nscooping out all the extra, and\n\n233\n00:12:43.165 --> 00:12:47.690\nthen pouring it in to the other text\nbox and that's the icon it shows.\n\n234\n00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.084\nSo go into where you need\nall the extra out of,\n\n235\n00:12:50.084 --> 00:12:52.427\nclick your cursor into\nthat first text box.\n\n236\n00:12:52.427 --> 00:12:57.567\nUp on our Format tool there is\nCreate Link, click that once.\n\n237\n00:12:57.567 --> 00:13:01.086\nAnd then look at what our icon looks like,\nsee?\n\n238\n00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:01.689\nThe little cup.\n\n239\n00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:02.364\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n240\n00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:04.741\n&gt;&gt; I think that's the cutest\nmouse cursor icon and\n\n241\n00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:08.255\nit gets even cuter once I come into\nthe place that I want to pour it into.\n\n242\n00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.734\nIt actually bloop, it turns out and\n\n243\n00:13:10.734 --> 00:13:15.124\nyou can see little letters coming\nout of the mouse cursor icon.\n\n244\n00:13:15.124 --> 00:13:19.747\nThat's been around forever, it's still\none of my favorites in Word [LAUGH].\n\n245\n00:13:19.747 --> 00:13:23.620\nSo now I'm going to pour all those\nextra words into this extra pot.\n\n246\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.546\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n247\n00:13:24.546 --> 00:13:29.455\n&gt;&gt; And there it is, and so\nif I change the size of either text\n\n248\n00:13:29.455 --> 00:13:33.015\nbox maybe make this a little bit longer.\n\n249\n00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:38.347\nAnd then I, okay, there is that one\nI need that to be a little less,\n\n250\n00:13:38.347 --> 00:13:41.537\nso it will put that, actually right there.\n\n251\n00:13:41.537 --> 00:13:45.186\nBecause now it goes ahead and\nbreaks the paragraphs up and\n\n252\n00:13:45.186 --> 00:13:47.550\nit flows and I can change this stuff.\n\n253\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.535\nAnd I just think that's kinda fun.\n\n254\n00:13:49.535 --> 00:13:52.800\nSo if you are thinking about, since we\nare talking more like newsletters and\n\n255\n00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.361\neverything, that might be\nsomething you would want to do.\n\n256\n00:13:55.361 --> 00:14:01.446\nHey throwing it into this document,\nput all that text into this sidebar and\n\n257\n00:14:01.446 --> 00:14:07.645\nthen if you have extra, go ahead and\nadd another sidebar onto another page.\n\n258\n00:14:07.645 --> 00:14:12.921\nMake sure you're going to click the cursor\nwhere that extra is in, get that cup,\n\n259\n00:14:12.921 --> 00:14:17.750\nthen pour it into your other text box and\nthen you can change the flow of it.\n\n260\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.719\nThe only thing that Word doesn't do\nautomatically is add the continued on,\n\n261\n00:14:21.719 --> 00:14:23.889\nlike whatever page publisher does that,\n\n262\n00:14:23.889 --> 00:14:26.690\nwhich is like a little check\nbox that you can check on.\n\n263\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.346\nYou would have to physically type that in,\nand then make sure that you\n\n264\n00:14:31.346 --> 00:14:35.861\ndon't change the information,\nbecause that would flow into it.\n\n265\n00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:40.384\nSo I would say if you wanted that\ncontinued on, get it set first and\n\n266\n00:14:40.384 --> 00:14:45.578\nthen type that in like the very last\nthing you do, until you have to move on.\n\n267\n00:14:45.578 --> 00:14:48.754\nBut remember if you move things round,\nit is gonna move that text too.\n\n268\n00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:54.683\nAll right, so text boxes links text boxes,\nlet's move on to Word Art.\n\n269\n00:14:54.683 --> 00:14:58.489\nNow we have seen Word Art\nin plenty places,\n\n270\n00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:02.632\nin our charts, in our tables,\nin our shapes.\n\n271\n00:15:02.632 --> 00:15:06.974\nIf I took this text and selected it, and\ndon't worry it's highlighting this other\n\n272\n00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:09.891\nthing, it's just because\nthe sidebar is associated or\n\n273\n00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:11.956\nlinked to this particular paragraph.\n\n274\n00:15:11.956 --> 00:15:16.296\nIf I took this and said I want to\nformat this with some Word Art,\n\n275\n00:15:16.296 --> 00:15:21.565\nI can come onto my home tab, and I could\nsay let's make this look like that.\n\n276\n00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:25.458\nOkay, if I had the text in\nthis text box over here and\n\n277\n00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:29.728\nI wanted all of this to be\nformatted with Word Art there.\n\n278\n00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:33.683\nOkay, so Word Art is like,\nthat doesn't seem like nothing new cuz you\n\n279\n00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:37.453\ncould just select the text and\nformat that way, and that's fine.\n\n280\n00:15:37.453 --> 00:15:41.555\nBut in this particular part,\nI wanna show how Word Art,\n\n281\n00:15:41.555 --> 00:15:45.848\nas like in insert Word Art,\nit becomes it's own element.\n\n282\n00:15:45.848 --> 00:15:49.936\nIt's own graphical element that I\ncan then now move it around and\n\n283\n00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:51.533\nput it where I need to go.\n\n284\n00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:56.083\nIt's not just taking the text that's\nin the document or whatever element and\n\n285\n00:15:56.083 --> 00:15:58.957\nflowing it and\njust having it flow as a part of it.\n\n286\n00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:00.496\nIt's its own entity.\n\n287\n00:16:00.496 --> 00:16:04.895\nLet's jump back over into,\nthis box, all right.\n\n288\n00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:11.267\nI'm gonna get rid of that sidebar for\nnow and I am going to insert over here,\n\n289\n00:16:11.267 --> 00:16:16.980\nthis is the button, WordArt and\nlet's just pick a style there.\n\n290\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:24.390\nSee, this is its own box, its own shape,\nthat I could add your text here,\n\n291\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.110\ndo notice that the word wrap is\nstill doing the moving with text, so\n\n292\n00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.550\nit anchors itself, but it does not\nwrap around the box automatically.\n\n293\n00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.240\nThis is where it has the in front of text,\n\n294\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.090\nwith the word wrap automatically or\nthe wrap text, in front of text.\n\n295\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.390\nSo if you don't want it to do that,\nthen just change that to square or\n\n296\n00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:49.060\ntight or whichever type that you want it\nto be and now it moves independently and\n\n297\n00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.930\nyou can change this.\n\n298\n00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.280\nYou could also change the fill of the box,\n\n299\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.950\nit's a shape with text and\nalready formatted.\n\n300\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.530\nSo it's kind of like, okay, so we have\ninsert text box, insert WordArt and\n\n301\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.550\ninsert shape that almost kind of end\nup being the same thing [LAUGH] is,\n\n302\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.920\nyou can put text and format it.\n\n303\n00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.495\n&gt;&gt; Lovely.\n\n304\n00:17:07.495 --> 00:17:08.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Lovely!\n\n305\n00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.040\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's lovely.\n\n306\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.900\n&gt;&gt; So this word art as\nit's own independent item.\n\n307\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.120\nAlright, what's the last item that\nI wanted to talk about in this\n\n308\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.670\nparticular episode, hyperlinks.\n\n309\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.640\nHyperlinks, what do you think\nof when you think of hyperlinks?\n\n310\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.320\nThere are mean in what sense,\ndo you usually think about this in Word?\n\n311\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.515\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking about it moving very fast.\n\n312\n00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:30.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A link that moves very fast.\n\n313\n00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nsay like if I click on a link and\n\n314\n00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.670\na website, it very quickly,\nwell hopefully if you're internet speeds\n\n315\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.410\ndoing really quick it links\nyou to another page, right?\n\n316\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.321\nSo I normally think of\nhyperlinks in HTML or\n\n317\n00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:50.110\nword sorry, websites,\nyou're getting the idea.\n\n318\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.350\nBut hey I could always\nput a hyperlink in Word.\n\n319\n00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.380\nLet's say in this Alice in\nWonderland I would like it to link\n\n320\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.230\nout to ITProTV because\nthat totally makes sense.\n\n321\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.735\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n322\n00:18:00.735 --> 00:18:05.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's hit Enter let's\ngo out into the internet for\n\n323\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.850\na second and I will go into ITProTV.\n\n324\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.050\nLook, it's in my history, imagine that.\n\n325\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:15.530\n[LAUGH] And then it comes out\nto our particular website and\n\n326\n00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.270\nI want to add this website\ninto my Word Document.\n\n327\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:27.530\nSo I select the address up in the address\nbar, I copy, come back into Word.\n\n328\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.990\nAnd this is something like maybe\nyou've done this in your emails.\n\n329\n00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.470\nLike hey, go ahead and\ncheck out this link.\n\n330\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.790\nSo you just Copy and Paste,\njust like everything else.\n\n331\n00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.960\nI added it as regular text I just paste.\n\n332\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.527\nI hit the spacebar and\n\n333\n00:18:40.527 --> 00:18:44.980\nit's gonna automatically make\nthat into a clickable link.\n\n334\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.585\nI could format this.\n\n335\n00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:47.500\nI could make this bold.\n\n336\n00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.940\nI could make this centered.\n\n337\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.500\nBut it is a clickable link within word.\n\n338\n00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.670\nI'm going to close this for now.\n\n339\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.100\nTo show you that this\nwebsite was not opened.\n\n340\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.720\nThe only thing is that you\ndon't just click on it.\n\n341\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.080\nSee if I click it, it's just regular text,\nbut notice that if I hover over this,\n\n342\n00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:13.360\nthis says, use your control key\nto click and follow the link.\n\n343\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.440\nSo if I needed it to, holding down that\ncontrol you see it turns to a finger and\n\n344\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.255\nonce I get the finger you\nknow where you are going.\n\n345\n00:19:22.255 --> 00:19:25.200\n[LAUGH] That's an old\njoke I've always use.\n\n346\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.470\n&gt;&gt; It's a good joke.\n\n347\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.070\n&gt;&gt; You can see that if I scroll out now\n&gt;&gt; It is\n\n348\n00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.730\ngoing to take me directly to that link.\n\n349\n00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.900\nIn this case the link is a website\nthat takes me to my browser and\n\n350\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.930\nopens up that link.\n\n351\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:42.170\nBut you do have to hold that control\nkey down to follow that link.\n\n352\n00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.040\nAnd luckily if somebody saw it,\nbecause a lot of time when people see\n\n353\n00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.630\nblue underlined text,\nthey usually say, that's a link.\n\n354\n00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:54.880\nOr at least it's just kinda in a common,\nspace that a lot of people will identify.\n\n355\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.890\nMaybe not always, maybe like, well now I\nknow that if it's blue and underlined,\n\n356\n00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:58.700\nI'll think of it as a link.\n\n357\n00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.860\nAnd that's how you could do it.\n\n358\n00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:07.840\nBut maybe I don't want the actual\naddress to be displayed in this text.\n\n359\n00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.643\nWhat if I wanted to say visit ITProTV?\n\n360\n00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:14.170\nI just want the text.\n\n361\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.840\nBut I still want to have it link\nto that particular website.\n\n362\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:24.490\nSo in this sense you would type\nthe text in first, select the text and\n\n363\n00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.786\nthen insert a hyperlink.\n\n364\n00:20:25.786 --> 00:20:29.200\nI could right-click,\nby the way and then go to link, or\n\n365\n00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.760\nyou can go to the insert tab, so select\nwhat you want and this could be a picture,\n\n366\n00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:39.350\nby the way, if you have,\nsay a logo and in the picture it says,\n\n367\n00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:44.130\nvisit our website, so this can be any\nelement really, it doesn't necessarily\n\n368\n00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:48.140\nonly have to be associated with text,\nyou can add a hyperlink to anything.\n\n369\n00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.440\nAs long as you select it.\n\n370\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.230\nWe come over here and go to the link,\ndrop this down, and it gives well,\n\n371\n00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:59.370\nthese are some files that I've been\nrecently using in Word, or actually\n\n372\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.150\nmy computer all together, cuz you see\nit's got PowerPoint and things like that.\n\n373\n00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.620\nWe'll talk about that in a second.\n\n374\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.380\nLet's go to Insert Link, and it brings us\ninto this insert hyperlink dialog box.\n\n375\n00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.853\nThis dialog box It's pretty much been\nthe same for as long as I can remember.\n\n376\n00:21:12.853 --> 00:21:14.056\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I was a lad!\n\n377\n00:21:14.056 --> 00:21:18.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly so\nI have some different ones.\n\n378\n00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.270\nDo I want to link to an existing file or\nwebpage?\n\n379\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.970\nThat's exactly what I want.\n\n380\n00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.470\nThe text, that's what I have selected.\n\n381\n00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.610\nSo this is the text display.\n\n382\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.740\nBut the address, and\nI'm just gonna paste this in here.\n\n383\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.600\nThat's where I want the link to go into.\n\n384\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.150\nIt's kind of like behind\nthe scenes of this selected text.\n\n385\n00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.900\nAnd when I click OK, it's still a link,\nit's still blue, it's still underlined.\n\n386\n00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.760\nIf I hold my control key and\n\n387\n00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.580\nclick it, it's gonna take me\nout to that particular website.\n\n388\n00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.680\nSo it doesn't always have\nto display the text of\n\n389\n00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.290\nthey're actually URLs especially\nif you have a really long URL and\n\n390\n00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.710\nyou don't wanna to say there's like\nvisit our site, go ahead and do that.\n\n391\n00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.610\nSecond way that i had just showed you.\n\n392\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:05.350\nAnd how to add a hyperlink to your text.\n\n393\n00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.710\nNow that's of course you\nhave going out to a website.\n\n394\n00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.560\nTotally fine, but as you can see from\nthat Insert Hyperlink dialogue box,\n\n395\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.520\nthere's some other things that\nwe could do of jumping around.\n\n396\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.090\nAnd one of them was like hey, what if I\nwant to visit another file on my computer.\n\n397\n00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.420\nSo let's say, I don't know,\nturn the corner.\n\n398\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.262\nI'm just randomly picking text.\n\n399\n00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:26.772\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:22:26.772 --> 00:22:29.700\n&gt;&gt; I want turn the corner to be linked to\n\n401\n00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.210\nanother file on my computer.\n\n402\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.770\nSo same thing, insert link, there.\n\n403\n00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.080\nI could have also right clicked.\n\n404\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.970\nExisting file, and\nmaybe I want it to link to Christmas Cats.\n\n405\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.820\nThat's just, right so I click OK,\nand it does the same thing.\n\n406\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Wise choice.\n\n407\n00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.969\n&gt;&gt; Yes, let's see what that looks like.\n\n408\n00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:50.640\nPreview of like.\n\n409\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.070\nYeah, there is Ms. Felicia.\n\n410\n00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we'll be talking about\nthis when we talk about templates,\n\n411\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.220\nin this series.\n\n412\n00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.050\nBut it jumped over and\nit opened up a file exactly like it said.\n\n413\n00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:03.930\nThink about this though.\n\n414\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.160\nWhat if I sent this to you,\nand I emailed it to you.\n\n415\n00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.700\nAnd you opened up this file,\nand you clicked on it.\n\n416\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.520\nWell I didn't send you the Christmas Cats.\n\n417\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.920\nAnd maybe the Christmas Cats doesn't\nlive on your desktop obviously.\n\n418\n00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.400\nSo if I send that you do\nhave to be very aware of\n\n419\n00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.030\nlinking to files that everybody\nwould have access to.\n\n420\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n421\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.910\nthis would be something like if you're\nin a large organization that has files\n\n422\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:31.440\non a shared network drive,\neverybody can get to it.\n\n423\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.790\nBut not everybody has\nthe permissions to do.\n\n424\n00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.910\nIf it's for you, cuz maybe you\nwanna use this as a reference,\n\n425\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.480\ncuz maybe that Christmas Cats\nfile has a list of\n\n426\n00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.530\nall of the pricing that you use\nin a document all the time.\n\n427\n00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.410\nThis is really good if you're\nusing an invoice template.\n\n428\n00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.360\nI keep prefacing ooh, templates,\ntemplates, templates are really cool.\n\n429\n00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.629\nSo if you make your own and\n\n430\n00:23:54.629 --> 00:23:58.870\nI want to be able to, I don't remember\nall our customer numbers in this invoice.\n\n431\n00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.832\nBut I'm the only one that's going\nto be writing up invoices and\n\n432\n00:24:02.832 --> 00:24:07.191\nI want to be able really quickly\nClick that link, open up a document.\n\n433\n00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:08.943\nLet's say an Excel file or what not.\n\n434\n00:24:08.943 --> 00:24:10.400\nThere's that customer number.\n\n435\n00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.190\nCopy and paste it into my Word document,\nand then everything is ready to go.\n\n436\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:20.427\nSo if it's just for you, and the file's\nnever leaving, then go right for it.\n\n437\n00:24:20.427 --> 00:24:23.248\nThat was actually an example we\nwould always use in our templates.\n\n438\n00:24:23.248 --> 00:24:23.762\nAnd you know what?\n\n439\n00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.247\nNow that I think about it,\nI think we're gonna go ahead and\n\n440\n00:24:25.247 --> 00:24:26.018\nthrow it in that episode too.\n\n441\n00:24:26.018 --> 00:24:26.628\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome!\n\n442\n00:24:26.628 --> 00:24:29.847\n&gt;&gt; But\njust different ways that you can, say,\n\n443\n00:24:29.847 --> 00:24:35.250\nlink to a file that doesn't require hey,\nnot everybody's gonna use it.\n\n444\n00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.380\nAll right, so\nlinking to a particular file.\n\n445\n00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.370\nBut then there's another thing\nin that insert hyperlink\n\n446\n00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.790\ndialog box that talks about going to\ndifferent places within your document.\n\n447\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:49.450\nAnd there is a reason why I formatted\nthis particular Word file with headings.\n\n448\n00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:52.110\nWell one, I think you should use styles\nand headings all over the place.\n\n449\n00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.750\nBut it is referring to how to\njump around your document.\n\n450\n00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.410\nLet's say I want this,\nthis is your text here.\n\n451\n00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:07.530\nAnd I wanted it to jump down to this\nparticular section, the Queen of Hearts.\n\n452\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.080\nI want it to jump down into here.\n\n453\n00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.634\nRemember that whole continued on page,\nor what have you?\n\n454\n00:25:11.634 --> 00:25:13.683\nThis is where, in those text boxes,\n\n455\n00:25:13.683 --> 00:25:17.200\nyou could start adding hyperlinks\nwithin the same document.\n\n456\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.550\nIt doesn't have to go\noutside your document.\n\n457\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.550\nSo you select the text, and\nwe're just gonna come back up.\n\n458\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.185\nThere we go.\nWe've got that text selected,\n\n459\n00:25:25.185 --> 00:25:27.750\ncuz your text here makes so much sense.\n\n460\n00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.610\nWe will add our hyperlink.\n\n461\n00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.352\nWe're gonna go into\nPlace in this Document.\n\n462\n00:25:33.352 --> 00:25:37.444\nAnd this is the big reason of why you\nwanna use headings if you're using jumping\n\n463\n00:25:37.444 --> 00:25:39.874\naround to different\nplaces in your document.\n\n464\n00:25:39.874 --> 00:25:44.285\nBecause it's gonna know where to jump\nto based on your heading levels.\n\n465\n00:25:44.285 --> 00:25:46.915\nThere's Down the Rabbit Hole,\nQueen of Hearts.\n\n466\n00:25:46.915 --> 00:25:50.580\nNotice it's pulling in our heading1s,\nthen our heading2s.\n\n467\n00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.780\nIt will go ahead and\ndo our heading3s and other ones,\n\n468\n00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.930\nif you are using documents that\nare formatting with that particular style.\n\n469\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.640\nSo if I wanted it to jump to\nQueen of Hearts, I click OK.\n\n470\n00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.260\nAnd now I Ctrl+click.\n\n471\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.430\nIt takes me directly down into\nthat part of the document.\n\n472\n00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.215\nSo I can use this to go back and\nforth to different places.\n\n473\n00:26:12.215 --> 00:26:17.200\nSweet, but what if I wanted it to go to,\n\n474\n00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.900\nI don't know, this particular page.\n\n475\n00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.666\nThis particular paragraph,\nthe baby grunted again.\n\n476\n00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:27.164\nOkay, so I will then jump down here, but\n\n477\n00:26:27.164 --> 00:26:31.140\nthere is nothing that is connected\nto this area of the document.\n\n478\n00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.280\nThere's no heading specifically for\nthis area, okay?\n\n479\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.994\nBut I want to make it a destination for\nme to get to it somehow,\n\n480\n00:26:38.994 --> 00:26:43.996\nwhether it's by navigation, or\nin this sense, by hyperlink.\n\n481\n00:26:43.996 --> 00:26:47.180\nThis is known as a bookmark, okay?\n\n482\n00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.350\nIt's like we put a bookmark\nin a regular book, right?\n\n483\n00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.370\nI wanna make sure I get right\nto this particular page.\n\n484\n00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.987\nAnd especially sometimes you dog ear\nthe page down far enough to know what\n\n485\n00:26:54.987 --> 00:26:57.450\nparagraph that you had stopped on.\n\n486\n00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.050\nThis is the same idea.\n\n487\n00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:04.950\nI can insert my own kind of, this is\nwhere I want to be, I put in a bookmark.\n\n488\n00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.700\nSo cursor, where you want it to go.\n\n489\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.620\nAnd that's where, right on your link,\nyou've got bookmark.\n\n490\n00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.560\nWorks with hyperlinks that let you jump\nto specific places in your document.\n\n491\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.040\nI click my bookmark.\n\n492\n00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.810\nI can name this,\nwe'll just name this baby.\n\n493\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:24.160\nAnd this is sorting by name, because I\ndon't have any other bookmarks in here.\n\n494\n00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.930\nIf I'm not mistaken.\n\n495\n00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.030\nWell you know what,\nI think I can try it out.\n\n496\n00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.390\nBaby paragraph.\n\n497\n00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.620\nI wanna say it doesn't.\n\n498\n00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.490\nYes, okay, good.\n\n499\n00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:36.290\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Some memory coming back.\n\n500\n00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.810\nIt doesn't like if you use spaces, okay?\n\n501\n00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.810\nNotice how it does not let\nme hit that Add button?\n\n502\n00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.560\nBut if I had said baby underscore.\n\n503\n00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.830\nSo it has to have no spaces\nin the name of your bookmark.\n\n504\n00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.260\nI'm not sure if it will hold\nspecial characters either.\n\n505\n00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.019\nBut the nice thing is, you could tell that\nif it doesn't give you the add button,\n\n506\n00:27:56.019 --> 00:27:59.559\nthen you're not conforming to its naming\nconvention that it likes to have,\n\n507\n00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:00.804\nwhich would be no spaces.\n\n508\n00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:05.351\nSo add a dash, or an underscore in\nthis case, to, say, baby_paragraph.\n\n509\n00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:08.580\nI hit Add, and then it's just added.\n\n510\n00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.525\nMy cursor was there,\nthat's where it's going to go.\n\n511\n00:28:10.525 --> 00:28:12.058\nLet's scroll back up to the top.\n\n512\n00:28:12.058 --> 00:28:13.676\nI should have just did a Ctrl+Home.\n\n513\n00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:17.280\nAnd then, maybe we'll say down,\ndown, down.\n\n514\n00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.270\nI want these words to jump\ndown to that baby paragraph.\n\n515\n00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:29.190\nSelect the text, come into\nInsert Hyperlink &gt; Place in this Document.\n\n516\n00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.050\nAnd look right there, down at the bottom.\n\n517\n00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.420\nBecause it's giving me the headings, or\nit could go to the top of the document,\n\n518\n00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.230\nthat's just a default one.\n\n519\n00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:42.738\nI wanna go to that particular place right\nthere, click OK, that becomes a hyperlink.\n\n520\n00:28:42.738 --> 00:28:44.750\nHold your Ctrl key down, click, and\n\n521\n00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.770\nit goes specifically down to\nthat spot that I had bookmarked.\n\n522\n00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.615\nI don't have to always have\nit connected to a heading,\n\n523\n00:28:51.615 --> 00:28:55.380\ncuz maybe you don't have a heading for\nit to attach to.\n\n524\n00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.020\nBut you really need it to go to\nthat particular destination.\n\n525\n00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:04.860\nMake a bookmark at that destination, and\nthen go ahead and insert that hyperlink.\n\n526\n00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.566\n&gt;&gt; It's magical.\n\n527\n00:29:05.566 --> 00:29:07.014\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is!\n\n528\n00:29:07.014 --> 00:29:11.619\n[SOUND] And I believe that comes to the\nend of my notes of covering everything.\n\n529\n00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:13.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had to make sure.\n\n530\n00:29:13.074 --> 00:29:14.990\nYep, all those three parts.\n\n531\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.910\nSo those are the different things that\nyou can do with text as graphics,\n\n532\n00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.400\nthrow on some hyperlinks that\nreally aren't necessarily graphics.\n\n533\n00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.715\nBut I guess you could have it within\na graphical element, like that Word Art or\n\n534\n00:29:26.715 --> 00:29:29.632\nthat particular shape, and\njust have it jump to different places.\n\n535\n00:29:29.632 --> 00:29:30.967\n&gt;&gt; Marvelous job as usual Vonne.\n\n536\n00:29:30.967 --> 00:29:32.495\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n537\n00:29:32.495 --> 00:29:34.672\nAnd this is Word 2016 Advanced.\n\n538\n00:29:34.672 --> 00:29:37.170\nThere's a whole bunch of video content for\nyou to explore.\n\n539\n00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.182\nAnd Vonne is a great teacher, isn't she?\n\n540\n00:29:39.182 --> 00:29:40.336\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n541\n00:29:40.336 --> 00:29:42.816\nHey, an Office Pro is always learning.\n\n542\n00:29:42.816 --> 00:29:44.592\nThat means you too [LAUGH].\n\n543\n00:29:44.592 --> 00:29:46.334\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n544\n00:29:46.334 --> 00:29:47.392\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n545\n00:29:47.392 --> 00:29:48.560\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n546\n00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.363\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.791\n[SOUND]\nGreetings everyone and\n\n2\n00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:09.310\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.240\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.430\nwell, we're coming back at you with\nmore advanced Word In particular,\n\n5\n00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.240\nwe're gonna be looking at templates today.\n\n6\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.470\nAnd here to help us is our very\nown Word wizard, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.270\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.698\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic,\nI'm ready to drum up some wizardry today.\n\n9\n00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:27.680\n[LAUGH] And\nwe're gonna be talking about templates.\n\n10\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.770\nNow templates is one of those, I feel,\nkind of a misconstrued word and\n\n11\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.590\nconcept when it comes to Word.\n\n12\n00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.330\nSo I'm gonna help clarify what exactly is\na template, how to use them correctly,\n\n13\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.270\nand then explore some of the pre-made\ntemplates that come with Word and how we\n\n14\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.600\ncan utilize them to just kind of help make\nus things like business cards or resumes.\n\n15\n00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.240\nLike, hey I need to go ahead and\nmake my resume I don't even know what it's\n\n16\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.330\nsupposed to look like,\nthey have a template for that.\n\n17\n00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.540\nIt's kind of like hey they have an app for\nthat, there's probably a template for\n\n18\n00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.580\nthat in Word.\n\n19\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.530\nSo we're gonna be exploring that but\nbefore we get into it\n\n20\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.300\nJustin what do you think in general\nterms when you think of a template?\n\n21\n00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.150\n&gt;&gt; So when I think of a template I\nalmost think of a cookie cutter.\n\n22\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.800\nI don't know maybe I like\nassociations with food.\n\n23\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.970\nBut like if I want a star shaped cookie I\nget out the star shaped cookie cutter and\n\n24\n00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.000\nstamp out a bunch of star shape cookies.\n\n25\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.950\nSo that's kind of what I\nthink of as the template.\n\n26\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950\n&gt;&gt; All my shows ended up talking\nabout either cats, food, or\n\n27\n00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.760\nmiddle school traumas so\nI totally can relate with that.\n\n28\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.450\nBut it's the whole idea that you're\ntaking the cookie cutter and\n\n29\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.150\nyou're making them out.\n\n30\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.810\nBut you're not eating\nthe cookie cutter itself.\n\n31\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.480\nYou're eating the cookie right?\n\n32\n00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.295\nI hope you're doing that.\n\n33\n00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:42.160\n[LAUGH] So that's the whole idea here is\nthat when you're working with templates\n\n34\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.810\nis that you're not really\nworking in the template itself,\n\n35\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.810\nyou're making it like a cookie cutter or\na stamp.\n\n36\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.720\nI like to think of it as a rubber stamp\nto where you have that, you go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.780\nget it all inked up,\n\n38\n00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.360\nyou take a blank piece of paper, you put\nthe stamp on it, and then there you go.\n\n39\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.490\nAnd then maybe you write in the little\npieces that maybe the stamp has little\n\n40\n00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.920\nplaces for you to write stuff in.\n\n41\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.910\nAnd that's the actual document.\n\n42\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.440\nIt's not the stamp but\nthe stamp is what started it.\n\n43\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.290\nAnd that's how templates are usually or\nwhat they're supposed to be used in Word.\n\n44\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.340\nNow I say supposed to because\n\n45\n00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.650\nI've had a lot of people say I have this\ntemplate for you let me go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.010\nsend it and then they send it to me and\nit's nothing but a Word document.\n\n47\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.460\nAnd I'm like all right,\nI'll let you slide.\n\n48\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.370\nCuz it's like that's your starting point,\nright?\n\n49\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.230\n&gt;&gt; Now wait a minute Vonne,\n\n50\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.380\nare you telling me that's\nnot an appropriate template?\n\n51\n00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.810\nI've been doing it wrong the whole time.\n\n52\n00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of.\n\n53\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.755\nBut let me show you, how about that.\n\n54\n00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:43.930\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and\nget into our computer.\n\n55\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.000\nAnd I don't have Word\neven started right now so\n\n56\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.140\nI just wanted to kind of go from\nthe beginning and let's fire it up.\n\n57\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.000\nAnd actually this start\nscreen that you have\n\n58\n00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.980\nall of these things that you're\nlooking at these are templates that\n\n59\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.060\nare pre-made in Word that\nare used at a starting point.\n\n60\n00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.800\nNow, mine not look the same as yours\nbecause these are the featured templates\n\n61\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.160\nof the ones that I have been choosing.\n\n62\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.810\nSo that's why you see\nthe ones like the resume.\n\n63\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.840\nAnd while I was getting ready for\nthis episode I wanted to make sure,\n\n64\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.680\nlike which one do I want to\ndemonstrate this particular topic.\n\n65\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.920\nBut if I scroll up to the top,\nwell I didn't really need to scroll up.\n\n66\n00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.600\nBut across here you see that\nthere are different categories\n\n67\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.860\nof templates that are ready for us.\n\n68\n00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.650\nLike business, I have, wait hold on,\nlet me let it fix itself for a second.\n\n69\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.780\nAnd so it goes into the different\nbusiness type templates and\n\n70\n00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.170\nit looks like there's services proposal,\nthere is a business plan.\n\n71\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.394\nCool, business cards.\n\n72\n00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:45.670\nAnd so it's giving us pre-made layouts,\ngiving us placeholder texts,\n\n73\n00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.430\nformatting the colors,\nthe layout all of those different things\n\n74\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.620\nwithin what they are categorizing\nas business templates.\n\n75\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.670\nYou also have some that have\nmulti document more one or two or\n\n76\n00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.500\nfour or ten up on a page to where you have\nmultiple items on one particular page.\n\n77\n00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.030\nSo those are different ones\nthat you need to look for.\n\n78\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.530\nAnd then they usually will correspond\nwith some type of paper that you can buy.\n\n79\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.051\nFor example, Avery is a very popular\ncompany that creates those pre-made,\n\n80\n00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:25.180\npre-scored business cards or\ntable tents or all those different ones.\n\n81\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.430\nOr return labels, address labels,\nlet's actually look at this one,\n\n82\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.050\nif I click on this and\nI'm single clicking and\n\n83\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.920\nit's telling me that this is a template\nto use vertical business cards, and\n\n84\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.365\nit works well with Avery and\nthat is has a bunch of numbers.\n\n85\n00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:40.825\nAnd I don't know if you've all\nbeen into Office Depot, or\n\n86\n00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:42.075\nyou, Justin, have gone in there.\n\n87\n00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:43.735\nYou can see like just a big wall and\n\n88\n00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:45.895\nit has all those different\npapers that you can buy from.\n\n89\n00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:50.525\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, how did you know that I\nhave an infatuation with office supplies?\n\n90\n00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:52.260\nIt's kind of how I spend my Saturdays.\n\n91\n00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, yes I've seen,\n\n92\n00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:58.285\nyou have a bunch and there's always\nthese crazy numbers that you have to\n\n93\n00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:02.540\npay very close attention to, because\nyou're kind of seeing it right here.\n\n94\n00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.340\nThey correspond to these layouts.\n\n95\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and\nhow they likely have scored it or\n\n96\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.090\nput those predetermined lines for\nyou to cut the business cards out or\n\n97\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.410\nwhatever type of thing\nthat you're working with.\n\n98\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.510\nSo definitely pay attention to\nsome of these templates that\n\n99\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.600\nhave those specific Avery paper numbers\nthat it supposed to correspond with.\n\n100\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.700\nNow, not all of them have that.\n\n101\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.460\nIf you're doing a resume,\nthat is not necessarily any type of paper.\n\n102\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.180\nIts just an 8.5 by 11 piece of paper.\n\n103\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.670\nBut those different categories that were\nacross the top, they are now here over\n\n104\n00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.880\non the right-hand side and some different\ncategories in here like design sets.\n\n105\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.230\nI come into the design sets and it's\ngoing to have things like business cards.\n\n106\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.470\nThis is the one that I\nreally like little bears.\n\n107\n00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.660\nAnd there's rainbows of course,\n\n108\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.160\nanything colorful with animals\nI'm gonna always pick.\n\n109\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.320\nThat many, and there's some things in here\nlike flyers, so it's a great place to get,\n\n110\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.560\nyou can just get some ideas going for\nyou to kind of, how do I wanna do it and\n\n111\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.630\nhey if I've already got it done for\nme, why go ahead and pick that one?\n\n112\n00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.740\nSo I'm gonna go back to the home cuz once\nyou get into a specific categories then\n\n113\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.510\nthe categories go on the right.\n\n114\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.730\nSo if you click on the home you're\nback to what you have when you start.\n\n115\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.440\nAnd so what you're going to be doing is\nselecting one of these templates, taking\n\n116\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.630\nout that rubber stamp that I'm talking\nabout and you're creating a new document.\n\n117\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.340\nYou're not opening the file.\n\n118\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.040\nThese templates, their name and\n\n119\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.720\nthey're in a file extension as a DOTX,\ndocument template and\n\n120\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.090\nof course with an X for the XML extension\nfor that particular file format.\n\n121\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.950\nThat all of our new\noffice products are in.\n\n122\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.760\nAnd so it leaves somewhere\ndown into the program file.\n\n123\n00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.960\nSo, you're not opening the file\nyou're stamping it out.\n\n124\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.510\nSo just pay attention or just remember\nthat especially when we go ahead and\n\n125\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.810\nmake some of our own.\n\n126\n00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.490\nWe can find that and\nyou'll see the end result.\n\n127\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.540\nNow the one that I wanted to go with with\nthe featured as the certificate and now\n\n128\n00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.470\nI can't find it so why don't we come over\nhere to invent maybe, and you know what?\n\n129\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.760\nWhy don't I just do this?\n\n130\n00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.430\nLet's go ahead and search for it.\n\n131\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.720\nLet's see if I can spell certificate.\n\n132\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.320\nCertificate, wow,\nthat's really wrong, isn't it?\n\n133\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.980\n&gt;&gt; That was still incorrect Vonne, but\n\n134\n00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.085\nthat's all right cuz I'm not\nthe best speller either.\n\n135\n00:07:12.085 --> 00:07:15.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, well there you go,\nluckily it's kind of like Google,\n\n136\n00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.280\nI spell it so wrong and\nit always corrects me.\n\n137\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280\nSo thank you so much.\n\n138\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.605\nAll right, there now, if some of you\nhave watched the previous episodes,\n\n139\n00:07:23.605 --> 00:07:28.270\nRonnie and I, I gave Ronnie a Team\nSpirit Award and I created it myself.\n\n140\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.850\nThis was in the Word Essentials when\nwe were talking about page layout.\n\n141\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.790\nWell, I actually kind of took the idea\nfrom this particular template right here,\n\n142\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.650\nthe Team Spirit Award.\n\n143\n00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.360\nAnd if I select it say yes,\nI would like to create this.\n\n144\n00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.540\nIt is creating, notice up at\nthe title bar it's document 1.\n\n145\n00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.564\nIt's just a new document that's\nready to go for me to go ahead and\n\n146\n00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:53.123\nfill in things like the recipient name and\nthe team and the presented on.\n\n147\n00:07:53.123 --> 00:07:57.938\nAnd the nice thing about this is that\na lot of your templates are going to have\n\n148\n00:07:57.938 --> 00:08:01.310\nsome pieces that will lend\nitself to make it easier.\n\n149\n00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.295\nLike for example here on this day, and\n\n150\n00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:06.158\nit actually is a date picker,\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n151\n00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:08.193\nI don't have to type it in,\n\n152\n00:08:08.193 --> 00:08:13.160\nits got this particular date field\nthat is added to this template.\n\n153\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.860\nAnd if I get in I'll show you\nwanna do the business cards.\n\n154\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.200\nIf it has your name you type it in\none place it's gonna go ahead and\n\n155\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.020\npopulate everywhere.\n\n156\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.550\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n157\n00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.980\nSo, nice way to start.\n\n158\n00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.988\nReally easy to go ahead and\ncreate a cool looking certificate.\n\n159\n00:08:26.988 --> 00:08:29.384\nYou go ahead and get some nice paper and\nyou print it out.\n\n160\n00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.335\nJust one little side note.\n\n161\n00:08:31.335 --> 00:08:33.575\nBecause see if I open this up.\n\n162\n00:08:33.575 --> 00:08:35.661\nI'd be like, it's great but\nI don't like the color.\n\n163\n00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:38.470\nI want it to a different color.\n\n164\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.985\nYou can start over with your color themes.\n\n165\n00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:45.515\nAnd see if the one of these\nis going to pick out that.\n\n166\n00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:51.060\nThat's more kind of blue or\nmaybe I wanted more kind of green.\n\n167\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.220\nSo this is the prior easiest way to do is\njust find one of those colored themes.\n\n168\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.428\nThat when you start hovering over it\nchanges everything because it was built on\n\n169\n00:08:59.428 --> 00:09:00.712\na design theme as well.\n\n170\n00:09:00.712 --> 00:09:05.568\nBut just to kinda throw back in to some of\nthose other episodes that we watched in\n\n171\n00:09:05.568 --> 00:09:08.130\nthis particular advanced series.\n\n172\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.072\nIf I wanted to change\nthe color of that word Team.\n\n173\n00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:12.700\nNow if I click on this, and\n\n174\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.630\nthis is really kinda demonstrating\na lot of what templates do.\n\n175\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.478\nIt's like okay that's one piece but then\nlook I have a drawing tools contextual\n\n176\n00:09:20.478 --> 00:09:22.846\ntab, and\nI have a picture tools contextual tab.\n\n177\n00:09:22.846 --> 00:09:25.118\nIt's like wait, well which one is it?\n\n178\n00:09:25.118 --> 00:09:28.630\nA lot of this stuff is built on groups.\n\n179\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:33.650\nSo you have these more, I'll say complex\nfor lack of a better term graphics.\n\n180\n00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.352\nAnd it might be a combination of shapes,\n\n181\n00:09:35.352 --> 00:09:37.730\ncouple of pictures that\nare grouped together.\n\n182\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.050\nNow, how I know that's grouped?\n\n183\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.010\nWell, I've explored this\nparticular template myself.\n\n184\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.894\nThat if I start single clicking,\nI start to isolate different pieces.\n\n185\n00:09:45.894 --> 00:09:51.080\nJust wanna throw out that don't\nforget about your selection pane.\n\n186\n00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.685\nThe selection pane is really handy.\n\n187\n00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:56.906\nTo start exploring all the different\npieces of these graphical objects and\n\n188\n00:09:56.906 --> 00:09:59.040\nelements in your word document.\n\n189\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.530\nThat you can turn on and\noff to see which one is it.\n\n190\n00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.620\nWhat are we at?\n\n191\n00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.630\nSo you can see here on the team.\n\n192\n00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.696\nI can see that this is a group\nof there is a picture.\n\n193\n00:10:07.696 --> 00:10:10.300\nBut then there is another group.\n\n194\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.010\nAnd in this group I have\ntwo other free form object.\n\n195\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.660\nLook it's like the T and\nthe E seem to be one shape.\n\n196\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.273\nAnd then the A and almost said the me.\n\n197\n00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:23.404\n[LAUGH] The A and the M are another group.\n\n198\n00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:25.194\nAnd I can turn these on and\n\n199\n00:10:25.194 --> 00:10:30.070\noff to see, that's how they\nmade this particular graphic.\n\n200\n00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:35.540\nAnd that picture 13 that's the kind of\nlike what do they call that, destroyed?\n\n201\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.031\n&gt;&gt; Distressed,\na distressed look it's all the rage.\n\n202\n00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:41.681\n&gt;&gt; It is isn't it?\nYes, so we have that distressed look.\n\n203\n00:10:41.681 --> 00:10:46.005\nBut if I start turning them off\nI can start to identify and\n\n204\n00:10:46.005 --> 00:10:52.086\nknow okay now that I've hidded it I just\nsaid that, yep I said hidded [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:56.983\nIf I start hiding the pieces to get to\nthe piece that I want then I can come\n\n206\n00:10:56.983 --> 00:10:58.073\ninto the fill.\n\n207\n00:10:58.073 --> 00:11:01.737\nAnd that well there we go it's just\nstarting to lag a little bit behind.\n\n208\n00:11:01.737 --> 00:11:04.172\nBut I can start getting into\nthose particular elements.\n\n209\n00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:09.032\nSo just wanna throw that back in there,\nbecause it's such a handy little thing.\n\n210\n00:11:09.032 --> 00:11:11.934\nWhen you start working\nwith complex graphics for\n\n211\n00:11:11.934 --> 00:11:14.772\nyou to be able to isolate\nwhat exactly you need.\n\n212\n00:11:14.772 --> 00:11:18.704\nAnd how did they really\nbuild this particular file.\n\n213\n00:11:18.704 --> 00:11:24.510\nThis new file that I'm making\noff of my rubber stamp.\n\n214\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.407\nSo if I want to save this,\nif I did a file save as.\n\n215\n00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:32.167\nIt's just saving as a regular\nword document, not a template.\n\n216\n00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:36.803\nI made it from a template and\nthat's the real way of making templates.\n\n217\n00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:42.580\nA new document based off of that template,\nso file new off of template.\n\n218\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.950\nThat's really what they should kind\nof say but I'm saying it for you.\n\n219\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:47.740\nSo, it's all good.\n\n220\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.014\nLet's explore a couple more\njust to give you an idea.\n\n221\n00:11:51.014 --> 00:11:55.170\nAnd point out a few things that\nhappen with these pre-made templates.\n\n222\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.280\nWe'll come back to our file new and\nthis yellow one.\n\n223\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.371\nThis crisp, clean resume designed by MOO.\n\n224\n00:12:01.371 --> 00:12:04.429\nAnd it's even got the animal\npart in there, right?\n\n225\n00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:06.075\nI just, yep, moo, Cow.\n\n226\n00:12:06.075 --> 00:12:07.928\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n227\n00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:09.584\nI guess other things moo, right?\n\n228\n00:12:09.584 --> 00:12:13.144\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if other things moo or\nnot.\n\n229\n00:12:13.144 --> 00:12:14.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n230\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.792\nI guess people moo or\nlike the little toy, the cow says moo.\n\n231\n00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:19.849\n&gt;&gt; Moo.\n&gt;&gt; Moo yeah.\n\n232\n00:12:19.849 --> 00:12:23.092\n&gt;&gt; So yeah but it's by moo and\nwe're gonna go with it.\n\n233\n00:12:23.092 --> 00:12:25.898\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH] It's like I\nshould go back to kindergarten,\n\n234\n00:12:25.898 --> 00:12:27.230\nlearn my animal sounds.\n\n235\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.134\nOkay so we have here, what do I've\ngot I've got this built in table.\n\n236\n00:12:31.134 --> 00:12:35.216\nA lot of this stuff,\na lot of your resumes and different menus,\n\n237\n00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:37.150\nthey will be built in tables.\n\n238\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.590\nAnd I've noticed that even myself I'm like\nwhy isn't this working, why won't it move,\n\n239\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.370\nwhy won't it center itself.\n\n240\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.010\nYou have to know what it's being built in.\n\n241\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.345\nSo biggest thing you should\nalways do is show hide.\n\n242\n00:12:48.345 --> 00:12:50.814\nAlways trying to show high characters.\n\n243\n00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:55.133\nAnd you can start seeing all those little\nsquares off to the side that kinda\n\n244\n00:12:55.133 --> 00:12:57.025\nindicate hey, that's a cell.\n\n245\n00:12:57.025 --> 00:13:00.826\nAll right, the other thing that I would\ndo just to kind of know where you're at.\n\n246\n00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:05.152\nWhen you start seeing those four\npointed errors up at the other right,\n\n247\n00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:07.250\nupper left hand corners.\n\n248\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.990\nStart selecting them,\nlike all right that's one table.\n\n249\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.139\nAnd then just for fun throw on\nthe borders so you can see them.\n\n250\n00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:19.870\nAll right, so there's another one,\nthere's one, let's throw on those borders.\n\n251\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.320\nMaybe not that particular style,\nwe could just go ahead and\n\n252\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.730\nuse the all borders from over here.\n\n253\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.750\nSo I could start seeing\nhow this is divided.\n\n254\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:32.590\nWell that looks like a table,\nthat's probably inside, yup another table.\n\n255\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.943\nSo you have nested tables in here.\n\n256\n00:13:34.943 --> 00:13:40.938\nNot a bad thing but if I was trying to\ncenter or move it, it's not doing it.\n\n257\n00:13:40.938 --> 00:13:43.320\nThat's because it's in a table.\n\n258\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.680\nSo you'd have to go into your Table Tools.\n\n259\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.210\nAnd do your alignments from\nthere to be able to kind of get\n\n260\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.050\nthings the way that you want them to be.\n\n261\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:55.610\nSo, just being aware of how\nthese things are built.\n\n262\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:01.020\nOne more, as a last demonstration,\nI wanna go to those business cards.\n\n263\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.817\nI thought it was gonna be\nin my most recently used.\n\n264\n00:14:02.817 --> 00:14:05.610\nBut we'll go over here to our design sets.\n\n265\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.740\nI believe it was in here.\n\n266\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.969\nWell, why don't I just go ahead and\nuse that search again?\n\n267\n00:14:11.969 --> 00:14:13.933\nCuz that was a handy way.\n\n268\n00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:17.250\nYeah, we'll go with this one.\n\n269\n00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.740\nSounds good, click Create.\n\n270\n00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.870\nHere is your business card.\n\n271\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.365\nIf I type in your name, I type it in.\n\n272\n00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:28.730\nIf I click down, notice how it's\ngonna populate in all of them.\n\n273\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.837\nYou don't have to go through\nevery single one of them.\n\n274\n00:14:30.837 --> 00:14:36.190\nAnd put in your name ten times or\nthe title or the company.\n\n275\n00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.511\nI have noticed if you do\ndelete one of these fields.\n\n276\n00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:43.494\nOr trying to take some of the text out\nsometimes it doesn't delete on every\n\n277\n00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:44.210\nsingle one.\n\n278\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.430\nAnd that's where you\nmight have to go back and\n\n279\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.360\nedit each card individually to be able\nto get rid of that particular text.\n\n280\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.417\nSo you have to kind of play\naround with these templates.\n\n281\n00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:59.380\nAnd just kind of veer around and,\ndo I have tables, do I have fields?\n\n282\n00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.207\nIs it populating all of them?\n\n283\n00:15:00.207 --> 00:15:02.040\nNot so much.\n\n284\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.280\nAll those different grouped elements so\nI can modify them,\n\n285\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.240\nand get to exactly what I need to do.\n\n286\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.790\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose some of these documents.\n\n287\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.640\nI'm not gonna save any of these changes,\ncuz we just went through some of our new\n\n288\n00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.000\nfiles based off pre-made\ntemplates in word.\n\n289\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.518\n&gt;&gt; Now Von, it seems we have a fairly\nrobust selection just available from kind\n\n290\n00:15:23.518 --> 00:15:25.290\nof the word interface right.\n\n291\n00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.975\nBut what if I really wanted to make it my\nown is that something that I can do or\n\n292\n00:15:29.975 --> 00:15:32.940\njust kind of mass produce so to speak?\n\n293\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.414\n&gt;&gt; It's almost too simple,\nit's just knowing what you need to do,\n\n294\n00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:37.370\none little step.\n\n295\n00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:42.502\nAnd then how do I create that\nnew file from a template.\n\n296\n00:15:42.502 --> 00:15:45.260\nSo let's take an example.\n\n297\n00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.214\nLet's say I have to create newsletters,\nnot newsletters,\n\n298\n00:15:50.214 --> 00:15:53.235\ncustomer letters to new customers.\n\n299\n00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:54.744\nAnd I'm doing it all day long.\n\n300\n00:15:54.744 --> 00:15:59.353\nSo I usually take one that I had,\nI do a File, Open.\n\n301\n00:15:59.353 --> 00:16:03.458\nRight, delete the content out, then type\nall the new stuff in, and then do a File,\n\n302\n00:16:03.458 --> 00:16:05.114\nSave As, and then customer two.\n\n303\n00:16:05.114 --> 00:16:06.160\nAll right, great.\n\n304\n00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.582\nLater you can open up customer two,\ndelete all the information out,\n\n305\n00:16:09.582 --> 00:16:12.415\ntype in the new stuff, File,\nSave As, customer three.\n\n306\n00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:13.294\nIs that how?\n\n307\n00:16:13.294 --> 00:16:15.118\nI mean, I do that a lot of times,\nJustin, do you?\n\n308\n00:16:15.118 --> 00:16:18.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying I have, but I have,\n\n309\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.956\n[LAUGH] and it seems like it would be so\nsimple, but it ends up being a giant time\n\n310\n00:16:22.956 --> 00:16:27.030\nsink over the span of actually\ntrying to get things done.\n\n311\n00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.769\n&gt;&gt; And how much you have to replace\ncontent, that's a huge one.\n\n312\n00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:35.395\nIf it was just all blank to begin with and\nyou just had to put in the new stuff and\n\n313\n00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:39.270\nthen save the file,\nthat would be so much easier.\n\n314\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.530\nTemplates, exactly what you do.\n\n315\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.552\nLet me show you the one\nwe're going to create from,\n\n316\n00:16:44.552 --> 00:16:48.860\nit is called Christmas Cats, and,\nthere you are right over there.\n\n317\n00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.720\nI had organized my desktop, but my desktop\nthink kind of cluttered, so I go ahead,\n\n318\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.250\nopen this, and this is just a regular\nWord file, Christmas Cats, Yay!\n\n319\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.630\nWe're back with Mr.\n\n320\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:03.150\nBishop Timothy as our spokesperson and\nowner, I guess we'll say he's an owner,\n\n321\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.590\nwe'll just call him the spokesperson, of\nChristmas Cats, and we can say, dear Rye,\n\n322\n00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:11.400\nthank you for your interest, these\nvery new costumes, and all that stuff.\n\n323\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.791\nSo, I have to print these out or\nsend them out all the time,\n\n324\n00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:18.529\nI'd have to come in here,\nchange out the new name, maybe if I put\n\n325\n00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:22.779\nin some new costumes, maybe change\nthe cost and things that I have to do.\n\n326\n00:17:22.779 --> 00:17:26.692\nFile, Save as, yeah, you're going\nto make a template out of this.\n\n327\n00:17:26.692 --> 00:17:28.830\nWell I guess I'm going to make\na template out of this and\n\n328\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.230\nyou will be able to do this for\nyourself as well.\n\n329\n00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.450\nSo, I'm gonna clear out the content\nthat I would be replacing anyways.\n\n330\n00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.600\nSo, I'm just going to say dear, and then\nblank, and then down here the costumes,\n\n331\n00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.800\nmaybe I will take out the santa,\nthe snowman, and\n\n332\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.030\nthe reindeer, and\nall of the costs as well.\n\n333\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.330\nCuz those are the different things that\nI'm always having to change out depending\n\n334\n00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:57.840\non who I'm sending this to because maybe\nit was an inquiry from whatever source and\n\n335\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.730\nthey want to have costumes\nabout wreaths or whatever.\n\n336\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.092\nSo, I kind of change it depending on\nwhere this document is supposed to go.\n\n337\n00:18:08.092 --> 00:18:11.969\nSo, clear all the information,\nall the rest of the stuff is fine.\n\n338\n00:18:11.969 --> 00:18:16.927\nSaving as a template, it's just a File,\nSave As, but you're not gonna\n\n339\n00:18:16.927 --> 00:18:22.570\nsave it as a Word document,\nyou're gonna save it as a Word template.\n\n340\n00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.082\nDon't worry about the name for\nnow, you just change the type,\n\n341\n00:18:26.082 --> 00:18:30.984\nthat's the first thing you do, don't worry\nabout the location, cuz the location that\n\n342\n00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:34.051\nhappens automatically when\nyou change the file type.\n\n343\n00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:39.199\nDo you see it's going into the Documents\nfolder, and there is a folder that was\n\n344\n00:18:39.199 --> 00:18:45.020\ncreated when you installed Office that\nis called Custom Office Templates.\n\n345\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:50.260\nKeep that location, so the only thing\nyou need to change would be the type.\n\n346\n00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.670\nI guess if you wanna change the name,\nthat's totally fine too.\n\n347\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.980\nWe can name is Christmas Cats, well\nlet's have undo that and click our arrow\n\n348\n00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:03.160\nover there and we'll say template just to\nkind of clarify that this is what it is.\n\n349\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.342\nWe save, perfect.\n\n350\n00:19:05.342 --> 00:19:09.511\nClose Word,\njust to kind of give it a nice restart.\n\n351\n00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:14.358\nSo now, I've made my rubber stamp,\nI'm ready to make my customer letter,\n\n352\n00:19:14.358 --> 00:19:18.976\nI take the stamp, stamp it on that\nnew document, fill in the pieces, and\n\n353\n00:19:18.976 --> 00:19:21.270\nthen save it as I need to.\n\n354\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.410\nAwesome.\nCome back in the Word.\n\n355\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.460\nWhere's that template going to be,\nit's right here in your start menu.\n\n356\n00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.490\nIf you come into the personal group,\n\n357\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.620\nthese are the feature,\ncome over to personal, look at there.\n\n358\n00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.286\nNow it doesn't give me like a cute little\npicture, right now, but that's all right.\n\n359\n00:19:36.286 --> 00:19:40.965\nI click it, and now, voila,\nI have my new document ready to go,\n\n360\n00:19:40.965 --> 00:19:45.472\ndocument one, and then I fill in,\nDear Justin, thank you for\n\n361\n00:19:45.472 --> 00:19:50.587\nyour interest and the costume we're\ngoing to send you is the snowman,\n\n362\n00:19:50.587 --> 00:19:55.355\ncuz I can't think of anything else,\n[LAUGH] and it's going to be,\n\n363\n00:19:55.355 --> 00:19:59.637\nyou get a discount,\nyou're gonna have a $10 costume.\n\n364\n00:19:59.637 --> 00:20:05.601\nSo, that's what we're going to send you,\nI then File, Save As,\n\n365\n00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:12.003\nput this as a regular Word document,\nand I will name this Justin order.\n\n366\n00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:13.669\nI don't know if it's an order,\n\n367\n00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:17.866\nwe'll just say Justin letter cuz I said\nthat we're doing a letter, and I put it,\n\n368\n00:20:17.866 --> 00:20:21.413\nI'll just put it on my desktop for\nnow and save and then there you go.\n\n369\n00:20:21.413 --> 00:20:25.640\nSo, then tomorrow, or whenever I need\nanother one for say, Mike or Ronnie or\n\n370\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.958\nAdam because everyone's\ninquiring about Christmas Cats,\n\n371\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:32.130\nI start from a new template and\nthen you move on your way.\n\n372\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:38.738\nIt's a lot easier, at least I feel it's\na lot easier, than doing the old way or\n\n373\n00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:44.166\nthe way that a lot of people use\ntemplates not the right way, so.\n\n374\n00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:48.007\n&gt;&gt; I can definitely see the power in this\nbecause my mind's already churning I'm\n\n375\n00:20:48.007 --> 00:20:50.625\nlike, I wonder if I can\nautomate even that process and\n\n376\n00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:54.600\nmaybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but\nthat's kind of where my mind's going.\n\n377\n00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.735\nBut that is a lot easier,\nbecause as you said, the highlighting and\n\n378\n00:20:57.735 --> 00:21:00.925\nremoving of fields tends to be\nthe largest sink of time when you have to\n\n379\n00:21:00.925 --> 00:21:02.760\ndo these repetitive actions.\n\n380\n00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.130\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny you said the whole\nlike how can I automate even more?\n\n381\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.540\nWell, we will have episodes about\nmacros and then you could go ahead and\n\n382\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.180\nput that macro that's in that template and\nhave a macro enabled template and\n\n383\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.180\nthen that way, you have different\nbuttons that start controlling things.\n\n384\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.390\nSo, this is where, yeah,\n\n385\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.630\nmy mind starts going to, like these\nare things that I'm always doing.\n\n386\n00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.690\nTemplates, okay, so what can I do\nthere with a template to help me?\n\n387\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.670\nWell, then how can I use macros and Quick\nParts and some of the other things that we\n\n388\n00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.630\nhave in this particular section of\nthis series of like automating,\n\n389\n00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:40.350\nit's called automation and you can go\nahead and make it a lot easier for you.\n\n390\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.210\nI tend to love this section of Word,\n\n391\n00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.160\nof the time saving steps that\nyou can do for yourself.\n\n392\n00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.691\nSo, it's really, really fantastic.\n\n393\n00:21:48.691 --> 00:21:54.803\nSo, now there is one other thing I\nwanna talk to you guys about templates,\n\n394\n00:21:54.803 --> 00:22:01.013\nand that's the Normal.dotm, now I\nhave said that a template is a .dotx,\n\n395\n00:22:01.013 --> 00:22:06.354\nyes, that's right, but\na dotm is a macro-enabled template.\n\n396\n00:22:06.354 --> 00:22:10.906\nSo, I already kind of talked about that in\ngeneral right now, so let's, first of all,\n\n397\n00:22:10.906 --> 00:22:11.778\nwhat is a macro?\n\n398\n00:22:11.778 --> 00:22:15.699\nA macro is recorded\nsteps within a document.\n\n399\n00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.580\nNow these steps are really great, and\nit runs on something known as VBA,\n\n400\n00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.600\nVisual Basic for Applications,\nI think there's a for.\n\n401\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.156\n&gt;&gt; There is.\nVBA, Visual Basic for Applications, and\n\n402\n00:22:28.156 --> 00:22:32.449\nI think to some extent they're bringing on\nsome other ways we can record macros, but\n\n403\n00:22:32.449 --> 00:22:35.237\nI'm not totally versed in this so\nI will not speak too.\n\n404\n00:22:35.237 --> 00:22:36.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n405\n00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.529\nIt's really its a bunch of code and\n\n406\n00:22:38.529 --> 00:22:42.198\nof course anytime you start getting\ninto programming and coding,\n\n407\n00:22:42.198 --> 00:22:45.815\nit can be really great use for\ngood but it also could be use for bad.\n\n408\n00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:50.179\nSo, normally when people hear macros, you\nalmost start thinking about security and\n\n409\n00:22:50.179 --> 00:22:54.195\nlike issues, and malware, and ransomware,\nno, we're not going that far.\n\n410\n00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:58.056\nWe're just saying it could have potential\nto have some malicious code in there,\n\n411\n00:22:58.056 --> 00:23:02.164\nbut for everything that we're going to be\ndoing, we don't have to worry about that.\n\n412\n00:23:02.164 --> 00:23:05.615\nAnd then you're like, well,\nwhat is this Normal.dotm?\n\n413\n00:23:05.615 --> 00:23:07.210\nWell, let's get back into Word.\n\n414\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.860\nAnytime you start a new document,\nblank document,\n\n415\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.350\nI think that's just a blank document,\nthat's actually the normal template.\n\n416\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:21.434\nThis is Normal.dotm, if I click on this\nFile, New, here we go, you've just,\n\n417\n00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:26.635\nyou've actually used a template and\nmaybe you didn't even know it.\n\n418\n00:23:26.635 --> 00:23:27.969\nNow I'm telling you because it is.\n\n419\n00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:33.009\nNow why is it a dotm and\nnot a dotx because there's a lot\n\n420\n00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:38.620\nof stuff that our Word\ndoes automatically for us.\n\n421\n00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.348\nAll of those pre-made things when\nwe insert, say headers and footers,\n\n422\n00:23:42.348 --> 00:23:45.707\nall of this stuff, this is actually\nbuilding blocks that dotx but\n\n423\n00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:49.032\nit's connected with the macro,\nand it's like all connected.\n\n424\n00:23:49.032 --> 00:23:53.975\nBut there's a bunch of code in the\nbackground that's just letting us do some\n\n425\n00:23:53.975 --> 00:23:58.471\nof these pre-formatted and\npre-made items within this document.\n\n426\n00:23:58.471 --> 00:24:00.839\nSo, that's why it's a dotm.\n\n427\n00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:05.643\nIt's just what it lives in and any time\nthat I want to start messing, well,\n\n428\n00:24:05.643 --> 00:24:10.374\nI wouldn't say messing, modifying\nour settings within new documents,\n\n429\n00:24:10.374 --> 00:24:15.150\nwe talked about this is the styles\nepisode in Word Essentials.\n\n430\n00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.490\nI don't want there to be,\n\n431\n00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.540\nwhen I start typing my text and\nI hit Enter, the default\n\n432\n00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.500\nspacing between paragraphs I think it is\nabout eight points space after paragraphs.\n\n433\n00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.970\nSome of this drives people crazy,\nI love it.\n\n434\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.130\nBut some people want to\ndo the double enters.\n\n435\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.900\nKind of drives me crazy too, that's okay.\n\n436\n00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.880\nTo each it's own but maybe you don't like\nto have all of these pre made styles here,\n\n437\n00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.490\nlike the heading ones and everything.\n\n438\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.740\nWe talked about design sets and styles\nsets in here to where I want everything to\n\n439\n00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.970\nlook like this and\nI want my themes, to be this way and\n\n440\n00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:55.000\nI want to have my atlas theme and I wanna\nhave my paragraphs spacing have no space.\n\n441\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.050\nAll of these things that I could set as\nthe default, and when I set as default\n\n442\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:05.790\nit's saying all new documents are going to\nlook this way from this point of forward.\n\n443\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.970\nYou're really modifying\nthe normal template, and\n\n444\n00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:14.070\nyou're changing the settings within it,\nwhich is totally fine, because if that's\n\n445\n00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:18.110\nthe way you want Word to work when you\nstart a new file, then that's great.\n\n446\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.660\nI wanted to throw one more part into hey,\nhow can I change some things in\n\n447\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.900\nrelationship to styles because we talked\na lot about making our own styles.\n\n448\n00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.990\nOr modifying existing styles.\n\n449\n00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.300\nAnd making that default.\n\n450\n00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.870\nAnd I said by default that styles\nlive within the document that they,\n\n451\n00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:36.710\nwell, live in.\n\n452\n00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.040\nBut you could, I'm just gonna kind of\nthrow some things in here really quickly.\n\n453\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.218\nLet's make this center, bold, a little\nbit bigger, and we will make it pink.\n\n454\n00:25:46.218 --> 00:25:50.570\nOkay perfect, and\nI wanna make this my own style.\n\n455\n00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.340\nSo create a style and\nI could name it Vaughn and\n\n456\n00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.640\nI think I actually had a style named\nVaughn in one of my documents.\n\n457\n00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:02.310\nBut when we get into modify,\nthis is the place where we could go in and\n\n458\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.220\nstart modifying our styles.\n\n459\n00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.130\nI wanna point honestly I don't\nremember if I pointed this out or not.\n\n460\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:12.680\nBut it says only in this\ndocument that's by default.\n\n461\n00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.180\nBut if you choose this one,\n\n462\n00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.680\nnew documents based on this template, the\nreason why I think I didn't mention this,\n\n463\n00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.260\nor if I did mention it was one\nof those hand waves, Justin.\n\n464\n00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.560\n&gt;&gt; I am very good at those Vaughn.\n\n465\n00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.440\nI see you've been picking up my habits.\n\n466\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.170\nI do feel Very nice about it.\n\n467\n00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\nI do always give you credit, I say,\n\n468\n00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.465\nlet me do the Justin hand wave right now\nand some people are like, who's Justin?\n\n469\n00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:41.440\n[LAUGH] Who's this Justin\nyou keep talking about?\n\n470\n00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.840\nYes, I kind of picked that\nup from working with him.\n\n471\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.310\nIf I have the new documents based on this\ntemplate, that's because it's saying\n\n472\n00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:54.430\nthe normal template, I'll add this\nstyle into Normal dot D-O-T M and\n\n473\n00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.140\nanytime you start a new file, I'm going\nto click OK because I chose that.\n\n474\n00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.830\nLet's do a file new.\n\n475\n00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.630\nYou see how now,\nI have become part of the style.\n\n476\n00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.790\nThis particular formatting\nis where you can start\n\n477\n00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.420\nreally customizing your own stuff.\n\n478\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.486\nI don't even like any\nof the [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n479\n00:27:10.486 --> 00:27:12.580\nI want them all to be\nnamed a specific way.\n\n480\n00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.300\nAnd then may you wanna kinda\nchange that and save that out.\n\n481\n00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.080\nAnd send it to your office people and\nsay hey go ahead and use this.\n\n482\n00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.730\nThis is your own template.\n\n483\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.680\nThere's all sorts of ways that\nyou can start extending this.\n\n484\n00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.850\nBut this is all based\noff that normal.dotm.\n\n485\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:32.730\nAnd the more you start changing those\ndefault settings well the further and\n\n486\n00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.500\nfurther away you get from where\nit started which is fine,\n\n487\n00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.010\nbut let's just say, hm, you know what?\n\n488\n00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:41.940\nI don't know if you've done this Justin.\n\n489\n00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.550\nYou modified it so much,\nyou don't even know what it started like.\n\n490\n00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.750\n&gt;&gt; Well Vaughn,\nI'm a big proponent of playing around,\n\n491\n00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.410\njust seeing how things work.\n\n492\n00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:53.120\nBut I'm not gonna say there hasn't been\ntimes where I've went into a mild panic\n\n493\n00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.425\nattack where I'm like, all right,\nso I messed it up real bad.\n\n494\n00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:58.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How do I roll it back and\n\n495\n00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.950\nthen there's Google scouring or Bing,\nwhatever your search engine of choice.\n\n496\n00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.230\nSo I'm glad you're going over\nthis because I've been like,\n\n497\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.030\nI'm gonna make everything green and purple\nand then I'd be like, how do I fix it?\n\n498\n00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:10.970\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, because\n\n499\n00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.590\n&gt;&gt; As a coder you know,\n\n500\n00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.890\nwe always tell people, just get in there,\njust start playing and\n\n501\n00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.020\nplay with it until it breaks basically,\njust break it all and\n\n502\n00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.730\nthen try to deconstruct it and see if\nyou can build that code back up again.\n\n503\n00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:25.160\nSame thing here, if I'm going through my\ndesign sets and changing everything and\n\n504\n00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.780\nmaking my themes, and I've made them all\nthe defaults, you come then into here and\n\n505\n00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.540\nsay, okay, let's go ahead and\nreset to the default style and,\n\n506\n00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.210\nwell, that's it's resetting to the default\nstyle of the style set you chose.\n\n507\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.390\nAdd then you're like,\n\n508\n00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.900\nI don't remember what the paragraph\nspacing was supposed to be.\n\n509\n00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.910\nI don't remember what heading one or\nany of that looked like, because\n\n510\n00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:47.550\nI just really started to change that\nnormal and these are in the show notes.\n\n511\n00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.748\nI want to show you a couple\nwebsites that talk about this.\n\n512\n00:28:50.748 --> 00:28:54.280\nSo this normal.dotm is when\nyou start a new document.\n\n513\n00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.130\nAnd it's saying how you can change.\n\n514\n00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:00.710\nWhat I want to just point out\nright here is that this lives\n\n515\n00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:05.340\nin your program settings in what\nthey call this roaming profile or\n\n516\n00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.210\nthis app data from the Microsoft.\n\n517\n00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:12.110\nSo this is actually giving you that\nlocation of where normal.dotm.\n\n518\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:16.870\nCuz it says go to this location\nopen like do an actual opening.\n\n519\n00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:21.240\nIt's like you're actually on a stamp\ndoing the modifications to the stamp and\n\n520\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.580\nmake the changes to the fonts\nthen margins like okay.\n\n521\n00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.660\nAnd then you save this like well,\n\n522\n00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.817\nthat's great but [LAUGH] I don't\nremember what they started with.\n\n523\n00:29:28.817 --> 00:29:32.780\nAnd it says that the nice thing,\nif the normal is renamed, damaged, or\n\n524\n00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.910\nmoved, Word will automatically\ncreate a new version\n\n525\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:41.280\nwhich uses the original document\nsettings the next time you start Word.\n\n526\n00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.390\nPhew okay, so that's nice.\n\n527\n00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.010\nSo it's basically saying\nthat here's another one,\n\n528\n00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.970\nit's like they're taking you\ndown into the same place.\n\n529\n00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.660\nThey say just delete it or just rename it.\n\n530\n00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.110\nYou actually don't have to move it,\njust rename it something else and\n\n531\n00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:01.740\nthen it will go ahead and\ncreate and generate that new normal.\n\n532\n00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.180\nSo we can get back to square one if you\nwant to say, the next time you start Word.\n\n533\n00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.730\nThat's a nice thing that it has.\n\n534\n00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.000\nIf you didn't know, one it existed or two,\nwhere it lived and that all I have to do\n\n535\n00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.160\nis just kind of like delete that file or\nrename it and restart it.\n\n536\n00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.880\nThat seems like a pretty easy fix, so\nthank you the oracle of the internet.\n\n537\n00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.950\nThank you from Microsoft Help Documents\nto go ahead and get me back on track.\n\n538\n00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.090\nGet me back to normal.\n\n539\n00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.960\nKind of like the story of my life\nsometimes, a lot of times so.\n\n540\n00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.690\n[LAUGH] Get back to normal.\n\n541\n00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:39.200\nWell, Vonne, definitely thank you for,\nwell, that wonderful wizardry of Word.\n\n542\n00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.860\nNow you've definitely told me that\nI've been templates wrong, so\n\n543\n00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.090\nI'm gonna go back to my office and reflect\nabout all the bad decisions of my life,\n\n544\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.300\nbut we got more advanced Word coming at\nyou but for now we're gonna go ahead and\n\n545\n00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.670\nsign off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n546\n00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:55.259\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n547\n00:30:55.259 --> 00:30:59.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

exciting\nepisode of OfficeProTv.\n\n4\n00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.490\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n5\n00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.990\nAnd in today's episode, we'll work\nback at you with more advance Word and\n\n6\n00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.380\nwe're actually taking a look\nat quick parts and autotext.\n\n7\n00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.820\nAnd well that's kind of disturbing to\nme because I know what quick is and\n\n8\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.850\nI know what parts are but\n\n9\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.320\nI don't know how they come together\nin the context of Microsoft Word.\n\n10\n00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960\nBut here to illuminate our\npath is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.010\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.370\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic and\n\n13\n00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.982\nso to tell you what is a quick\npart is a part that is quick.\n\n14\n00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:35.230\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.420\n&gt;&gt; Well you've really enlightened us all.\n\n16\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.180\nAnd I guess that's the show.\n\n17\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.360\nWe are done.\n\n18\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.440\nBut no, no, go ahead.\n\n19\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.620\n&gt;&gt; No, we will definitely talk more\nabout what a quick part is and\n\n20\n00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.050\nwhere do we find them.\n\n21\n00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.320\nHow are they organized?\n\n22\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.120\nBut honestly,\nit really is as simple as that.\n\n23\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.130\nYou can create your own quick parts,\nbe able to store them in the quick parts\n\n24\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.190\ngallery, and then when you're ready to\ngo ahead and grab a part from here and\n\n25\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.280\ngrab a part from there and put it in\nyour document, you just pick it and\n\n26\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.410\nit drops it right in.\n\n27\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.020\nIt's really, really handy.\n\n28\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.600\nSo this is, of course, the part where\nwe're automating repetitive tasks in Word.\n\n29\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.040\nAnd this is a really great one.\n\n30\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.000\nI use this all the time.\n\n31\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.977\nCuz if I'm going to be in a place\nwhere I'm always putting in,\n\n32\n00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:20.003\nlet's say thank you so much for\nyour inquiry into Christmas [SOUND].\n\n33\n00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:21.940\nAnd I've got it all typed up.\n\n34\n00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.510\nInstead of opening up a document and\n\n35\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.270\ncopying out that paragraph,\nthrow it into the Quick Parts.\n\n36\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.830\nGo ahead and store it in what is\ncalled the Building Blocks.dotx, which\n\n37\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.950\nis part of the normal template anyways,\nwhich is all connected into our documents.\n\n38\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.330\nAnd then I can just use\nit wherever I want.\n\n39\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.130\nIt's really that simple,\nso it's, it's pretty neat.\n\n40\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.030\nAnd so while I jump in and\n\n41\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.200\nI want to demonstrate some quick\nparts that I actually already created\n\n42\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.430\nbefore this episode to just show you\nwhat it looks like when it's done.\n\n43\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.560\nAnd then we'll go back and\ncreate our own parts for our library.\n\n44\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.000\nAs I said,\nwe have this document right here.\n\n45\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.650\nAnd this could be any document.\n\n46\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.680\nI just decided to do a file new for now.\n\n47\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.960\nAnd if I go over to insert, cuz that's\nwhere we go to insert a quick part.\n\n48\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.790\nCome on over here to the right hand side.\n\n49\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.950\nOf course if you have a larger\nresolution in the monitor,\n\n50\n00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.760\nyou'll probably see next to that\nlittle icon it says quick parts.\n\n51\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.970\nAnd I drop this down,\nyou can see there's this right here.\n\n52\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.970\nNow this is some text, you got a picture,\nand all the alignment, all the formatting.\n\n53\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.171\nI saved this as a quick part\nfrom another document and\n\n54\n00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:34.405\nnow you can see it's a part that's\nready for me to [SOUND] just drop in.\n\n55\n00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:38.090\nMaking sure my cursor's where\nI want it to go first of all.\n\n56\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.590\nAnd just click it and it puts it right in.\n\n57\n00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.550\nNow it does do a little bit different\nformatting because I have some\n\n58\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.350\nextra enter marks and everything in here.\n\n59\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.750\nBecause maybe I was really supposed\nto have that be deleted there.\n\n60\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.860\nLet me forward delete that.\n\n61\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.200\nThere we go.\nOne more.\n\n62\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.250\nAnd there we go.\n\n63\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.250\nBut, as you can see,\n\n64\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.700\nwith just a little bit of modification,\nI`ve got this ready to go.\n\n65\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.910\nAnd all I had to do was click it.\n\n66\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.280\nAwesome, and then in the AutoText.\n\n67\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.340\nLet me just hit Enter.\n\n68\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.320\nif I come back into there.\n\n69\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.760\nWhat's the difference between\na Quick Part and an AutoText?\n\n70\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.920\nWell, if think about it,\n\n71\n00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.490\nAutoText, it's probably just\ngonna be holding, well, text.\n\n72\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.080\nYou're not going to get\nall the extra stuff that\n\n73\n00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.850\nyou could do with just\na Quick Part in general.\n\n74\n00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.380\nThat's where maybe you have images or\nmultiple items,\n\n75\n00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.840\nmaybe you have a table with\ngraphics inside of it.\n\n76\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.860\nThat would be a quick part.\n\n77\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.100\nAutoText would just be for text.\n\n78\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.260\nAnd this is one we've probably seen\nthrough quite a few of our different\n\n79\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.680\nepisodes, with that Alice\nin Wonderland text.\n\n80\n00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.820\nI just selected a little bit of it and\nadded it as an AutoText, and\n\n81\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.710\nthen I'm able choose it, and there you go.\n\n82\n00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.230\nSo just think of the possibilities that\nyou have here, of all of those different\n\n83\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.740\nthings, those elements, that document\ncontent, that you're always doing,\n\n84\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.640\nthrow it in that gallery and you can go\nwith it, and it's super, super handy.\n\n85\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.030\nNow a lot of the stuff that\nwe've been working in Word,\n\n86\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.820\nlike inserting headings and footers,\nwe did watermarks, what else did we do?\n\n87\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.460\nWe did margins, okay.\n\n88\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.330\nLet's look at some of this.\n\n89\n00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.090\nIf I go into Insert &gt; Header and Footer,\n\n90\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.720\nall of these pre-formatted Items\nof how you could add a header and\n\n91\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.610\nfooter and they have different\nnames like integral, grid.\n\n92\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.840\nThese are all parts of these\nthings that just come built in,\n\n93\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.510\nlet me show you a couple more.\n\n94\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.500\nRemember these cover letters?\n\n95\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.140\nOr not cover letters,\nthese are cover pages.\n\n96\n00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.130\nWell, I guess it's cut, letter,\npage, you know same thing.\n\n97\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.040\nSo we have the different cover pages and\nthey have some of the same names.\n\n98\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.420\nAnd they're almost like we talked about,\n\n99\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.100\nlike a stationary set of all\nthis stuff that comes with Word.\n\n100\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.770\nWell all of these things are technically\nknown as building blocks.\n\n101\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.510\nAnd these building blocks all stay\ntogether within what is known as\n\n102\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.930\nthe Buildingblocks.dot TX template,\n\n103\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.720\nthat is associated with all of\nyour documents within Word.\n\n104\n00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.250\nLet's come back over here to the insert\nquick part, forgot the p there.\n\n105\n00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.100\nSo we have the autotext and\ndocument properties.\n\n106\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.000\nWe'll talk about that later.\n\n107\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.930\nBut it's right here,\nbuilding blocks organizer.\n\n108\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.000\nLet's click on that.\n\n109\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.686\nThis starts to look familiar.\n\n110\n00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:24.880\nThe cover page, it is in the cover\n\n111\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.950\npages gallery, and\nit's in the built in template.\n\n112\n00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.810\nAnd if I scroll over, this is where all of\nthese pieces are built in to the document.\n\n113\n00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.310\nAnd have I keep on going down,\nthere's equations, there's footers,\n\n114\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.230\nall the ones that we were seeing in those\ndrop downs of all these automated or\n\n115\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.160\npredetermined or preformatted items\nin Word, they're all part of this.\n\n116\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.930\nAnd this is when where you start adding\ninto the Quick Art, why I keep saying Art,\n\n117\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.020\ndon't I there, Justin?\n\n118\n00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.660\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI think is that what's going on here\n\n119\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.920\n&gt;&gt; We have the quick parts gallery,\n\n120\n00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.560\nbut then it's an art gallery because well,\nthey're kind of artistic in nature.\n\n121\n00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.970\nSo I'll allow it, we're gonna go with it,\nit will be all right.\n\n122\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.900\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I feel vindicated now\n[LAUGH] Maybe that's what my mind is\n\n123\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.030\ngoing towards, and\nthese are parts of the gallery of art.\n\n124\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.620\nYes, yes, I love it.\n\n125\n00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.820\nSo we've got all of these different\nthings that live in here.\n\n126\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.510\nAnd as you Add to the quick parts gallery,\n\n127\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.840\nyou're gonna be adding\ninto this particular\n\n128\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.470\ntemplate that's hanging out in the\nbackground that all our documents live in.\n\n129\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.260\nAnd this is of course where\nyou could come in and\n\n130\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.610\nstart editing some of the properties.\n\n131\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.510\nAnd if I wanted to take this cover pages,\nfiller read.\n\n132\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.400\nDoes that mean I can come in and start\nchanging the colors and what's part of it?\n\n133\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.850\nNot necessarily.\n\n134\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.810\nIf I come in to edit the properties,\nit's really just gonna let me rename it,\n\n135\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.760\nmaybe put it into a different category or\ndifferent gallery,\n\n136\n00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.620\nsomething that I could use to reorganize.\n\n137\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.700\nBut with all the built-in pieces,\nI wouldn't really mess with them too much.\n\n138\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.150\nBut, like I said, when we add our own,\n\n139\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.810\nit's like,\nmaybe I would like that to be renamed.\n\n140\n00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.380\nI didn't really name it properly.\n\n141\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.560\nOr, I wanna make my own category\nto be able to start making all of\n\n142\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.030\nmy stuff into it's own, well, category\ninstead of just free floating in there.\n\n143\n00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.720\nSo this is how you can edit\nthe document properties.\n\n144\n00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.530\nModifying the actual content\nwithin that quick part,\n\n145\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.670\nthe easiest way honestly is\njust to make a new quick art.\n\n146\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.290\nI wanted to add a different color picture.\n\n147\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.500\nGo ahead and put the same one in,\nchange the picture, select it all and\n\n148\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.240\nthen add it as a new quick art like\nsignature two or what have you.\n\n149\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.510\nAnd then come back in here and\n\n150\n00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.640\nyou could delete the other one that you\ndidn't want as part of that gallery.\n\n151\n00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:51.580\nAll right so how do I make my own quick\nart I have a document called Quick Parts.\n\n152\n00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.656\nAnd I have some things\nthat I've already built.\n\n153\n00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:54.783\nI'll look at that.\n\n154\n00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:56.647\nWe're still going on our Christmas Cats.\n\n155\n00:07:56.647 --> 00:08:00.056\nIsn't it Happy Catmas.\n\n156\n00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:02.129\nThe old Bishop, you're so cute.\n\n157\n00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:06.729\nOr maybe this is something that\nI want to add at the end of\n\n158\n00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:09.900\nevery letter that I write in word.\n\n159\n00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.750\nHere's a signature or an address\nline that I wanted to put in here.\n\n160\n00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.720\nHere's a table, here's a paragraph.\n\n161\n00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.230\nGet the idea.\n\n162\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.800\nAs long as you can select it,\nyou can make it into a quick part.\n\n163\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.020\nSo if I take this, let's select it all.\n\n164\n00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.010\nSo I have some graphics in here.\n\n165\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.830\nI believe that's a picture\nI found online and\n\n166\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.500\nI think both of those were\npictures I found online.\n\n167\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.320\nSelect it all.\n\n168\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.136\nCome back into Insert.\n\n169\n00:08:33.136 --> 00:08:39.540\nOver here, and\nsave selection to Quick Part Gallery.\n\n170\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.581\nAnd then this is where you get to name it.\n\n171\n00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:47.976\nI can say, well, thank you sounds good.\n\n172\n00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:50.730\nThank You Bishop.\n\n173\n00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:55.195\nAnd then the gallery,\nI would keep it in the Quick Parts.\n\n174\n00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:57.970\nI could make it, no actually, the gallery,\n\n175\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.490\nkeep it in here because it's not a header,\nit's not a footer.\n\n176\n00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.120\nIt's just a part,\nit's not really a part of anything else.\n\n177\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.180\nThe category,\n\n178\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.840\nthis is where you might wanna make your\nown if you start really utilizing this.\n\n179\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.652\nWell, we'll keep it in general for now.\n\n180\n00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:15.638\nNotice, it's saving in\nthe Building Blocks.dotx.\n\n181\n00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.748\nI would keep it there.\n\n182\n00:09:17.748 --> 00:09:19.654\nNow you could switch it into the normal.\n\n183\n00:09:19.654 --> 00:09:24.360\nBut all normal is going to associated\nwith Building Blocks anyway.\n\n184\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.770\nIt's like those two things are connected.\n\n185\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.000\nSo just keeping it in it's\ndefault location is fine.\n\n186\n00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.680\nBut some of the options you have,\ninserting in it's own paragraph or\n\n187\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.950\nit's own page.\n\n188\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.700\nThat might be nice to where maybe\nyou forgot to hit the enter key,\n\n189\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.830\nbefore you went ahead and added that in.\n\n190\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.790\nOr maybe you do want it on it's own page.\n\n191\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.590\nSo having some of those options are good.\n\n192\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.370\nWe'll just go with insert content only for\nnow.\n\n193\n00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.730\nClick Okay.\n\n194\n00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.030\nNow it's part of the gallery.\n\n195\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.530\nYay.\n\n196\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:53.790\nSelect this.\n\n197\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.060\nWe could add this in\nthe Quick Parts Gallery.\n\n198\n00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.570\nAnd well, Christmas cats sign and\nsay, okay.\n\n199\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.900\nKeep on going.\n\n200\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.520\nI could add a table.\n\n201\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.800\nAny elements I could\nadd to my Quick Parts.\n\n202\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.395\nIf I come back over to my filenew,\nnow you'll be able to see that\n\n203\n00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:16.582\nthis will have in my choice,\nI could choose all of these.\n\n204\n00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:19.219\nAnd this will follow you throughout\nall of your documents and\n\n205\n00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:20.518\nall of your new files as well.\n\n206\n00:10:20.518 --> 00:10:25.480\nSo that can be really,\nreally handy for you moving forward,\n\n207\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.096\nstart gathering up all\nthe pieces you want.\n\n208\n00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:33.770\nLet me cancel that for just a second cuz\nwe wanna go back and add the auto parts.\n\n209\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.749\nBecause if I do wanna keep just text\nas text and this is one of those,\n\n210\n00:10:37.749 --> 00:10:41.318\ncould I add this paragraph and\nthis heading as a Quick Part?\n\n211\n00:10:41.318 --> 00:10:44.494\nTotally, you don't have to really\nsubdivide it all the way down into\n\n212\n00:10:44.494 --> 00:10:45.216\nthe AutoText.\n\n213\n00:10:45.216 --> 00:10:47.950\nAnd I don't know, to me,\nmaybe it's just cuz,\n\n214\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.840\nI don't know if we'll call it lazy,\nwe'll call it more efficient.\n\n215\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.970\nI don't wanna have to go into another\nflyout to pick from my different pieces,\n\n216\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.609\nI just want it all in one place.\n\n217\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.654\nIt's up to you.\n\n218\n00:10:59.654 --> 00:11:02.821\nHowever you want to subdivide, but\nI'll go ahead and save it into\n\n219\n00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:06.460\nan AutoText Gallery, and we'll say\nITProtext, that sounds wonderful.\n\n220\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.726\n&gt;&gt; So it seems to me that AutoText\nis almost like a specialized version\n\n221\n00:11:13.726 --> 00:11:18.177\nof a Quick Part, that the whole idea is to\nprovide some semantic meaning of this is\n\n222\n00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.606\ntext only assets, I don`t have anything.\n\n223\n00:11:20.606 --> 00:11:25.246\nWhere I can think of using this is\nyou always have a text based header,\n\n224\n00:11:25.246 --> 00:11:29.581\nlike an address line or\nyou have kind of your signature.\n\n225\n00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:32.948\nAnd if it doesn't involve any graphics\nyou may just wanna go text only.\n\n226\n00:11:32.948 --> 00:11:38.871\nBut as you said, I don't have to\nput media assets in a Quick Part,\n\n227\n00:11:38.871 --> 00:11:44.950\nI could technically have a Quick Part\nthat is text only, correct?\n\n228\n00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly,\nif you wanna sub divide, it's up to you.\n\n229\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.849\nBut you can't add images into AutoText,\nbut\n\n230\n00:11:49.849 --> 00:11:55.250\nyou can add just text into Quick Part,\nso it's kind of that rule there.\n\n231\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.410\nSo I'm going to click Okay, and\nI've got all these pieces in here.\n\n232\n00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.356\nGood to go.\nI`m gonna close this document.\n\n233\n00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:05.030\nI'm also going to close my document 1.\n\n234\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.172\nSo I wanted to show you\nthe warning that I'm going to get.\n\n235\n00:12:08.172 --> 00:12:11.670\nBecause I`m really now\nclosing down word altogether.\n\n236\n00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.830\nLike this is the last open\ndocument in my program.\n\n237\n00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.091\nSo when I say, don't save\nthe changes to this document 1, so\n\n238\n00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:20.304\nI was just using that for demonstration.\n\n239\n00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:24.757\nRight here, it says, let me zoom in, you\nhave modified styles, Building Blocks such\n\n240\n00:12:24.757 --> 00:12:28.870\nas cover pages, or other content that\nis stored in the Building Blocks.dotx.\n\n241\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.556\nDo you want to save your changes?\n\n242\n00:12:31.556 --> 00:12:36.014\nThis is a definite yes because if you\ndon't say yes here or click the Save\n\n243\n00:12:36.014 --> 00:12:40.992\nbutton, then all of those things that I\njust added into my Quick Parts Gallery,\n\n244\n00:12:40.992 --> 00:12:44.440\nwhich is really Building Blocks,\nit wouldn't save.\n\n245\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.226\nAnd sometimes when people get these\nweird prompts, like I don't know.\n\n246\n00:12:49.226 --> 00:12:54.030\nI'm just gonna say no, or I'm gonna cancel\nthis and I'm just gonna forget that.\n\n247\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.194\nRead them, and now we know that this\nis okay, so we will click save.\n\n248\n00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:03.788\nI'll zoom back out and then now\neverything will be in that gallery for\n\n249\n00:13:03.788 --> 00:13:05.724\nme to be able to choose.\n\n250\n00:13:05.724 --> 00:13:10.745\nLet's start Word back up cuz some of those\n\n251\n00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:16.055\nentries I just didn't like anymore or hey,\n\n252\n00:13:16.055 --> 00:13:21.255\nmaybe Bishop Timothy is no longer the CEO.\n\n253\n00:13:21.255 --> 00:13:25.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There was that nice little\npause at Cat Executive Officer.\n\n254\n00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:30.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And them I'm like, yeah\nthat's the rest of the acronym, right?\n\n255\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.616\nExecutive Officer, so I trailed off for\na little bit, just a tad.\n\n256\n00:13:34.616 --> 00:13:35.290\nThat's funny.\n\n257\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.279\nSo I have my Quick Art gallery because,\nmaybe like I said,\n\n258\n00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:41.762\nBishop is not part of this anymore,\nwe need a different signature.\n\n259\n00:13:41.762 --> 00:13:46.670\nI want this out of my Quick Parts Gallery.\n\n260\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.804\nCome down into that Building Blocks\norganizer, little bit behind my head but\n\n261\n00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:52.402\nwe got that there, awesome.\n\n262\n00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:54.475\nAnd now, you can see the different pieces,\n\n263\n00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:57.344\nthis is that Alice falling that\nI had added the ItProTv text.\n\n264\n00:13:57.344 --> 00:14:00.778\nYou can see that the gallery and\nthere is that AutoText.\n\n265\n00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:06.263\nSo if I scroll down in,\nwe said that it was in the Quick Parts,\n\n266\n00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:10.440\nso m, n, o, p, there we go, q.\n\n267\n00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.111\nThere's the signature,\nthere's the thank you, and\n\n268\n00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:15.150\nthere's Justin Timberlake signature.\n\n269\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.650\nSo I could take this and delete it\nout of the Quick Parts Gallery and\n\n270\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.750\nthen it won't show up in my choices.\n\n271\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:29.370\nSo those are different things\nthat you could do after the fact.\n\n272\n00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.158\nThe other thing I wanna talk\nabout is the document properties.\n\n273\n00:14:32.158 --> 00:14:36.997\nNow this is kind of combining two\nepisodes that I've cleaned out in my mind\n\n274\n00:14:36.997 --> 00:14:41.838\nbecause in our Word Expert series we\nwill be talking about the metadata and\n\n275\n00:14:41.838 --> 00:14:46.590\nwhat document properties really mean and\nthen how you can hide that.\n\n276\n00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:51.054\nAnd especially when you start getting\nin the security of your documents,\n\n277\n00:14:51.054 --> 00:14:54.518\nwhere you might want to remove\nsome of that information.\n\n278\n00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:56.720\nI have a document that is right here.\n\n279\n00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.220\nDocument properties added.\n\n280\n00:14:59.390 --> 00:14:59.900\nWe'll open it up.\n\n281\n00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.210\nThis is our Alice in Wonderland like okay,\nwell,\n\n282\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.904\nthis is the same document we've have been\nworking with this for the whole time.\n\n283\n00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:10.005\nDocument properties, I've already\nsaid were metadata and Jess and\n\n284\n00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:13.466\nI know a little bit about metadata\nin the world of coding and\n\n285\n00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:16.658\nhow that kinda all comes\ntogether with our keywords.\n\n286\n00:15:16.658 --> 00:15:19.415\nAnd that's the one I\ncan remember right now.\n\n287\n00:15:19.415 --> 00:15:20.129\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so,\n\n288\n00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:25.060\nmetadata's kinda like this hidden thing\nthat you don't particularly think about.\n\n289\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.820\nIt really hit me about metadata when I\n\n290\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.540\nfound out that the images that\nwe take with GPS enabled phones,\n\n291\n00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.710\nwould embed location, date time stamp,\nthings like that inside of images.\n\n292\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.367\nAnd then if you don't scrub that away,\nwell then people can then look at it and\n\n293\n00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:42.751\ngo well here are all\nthe places you've been.\n\n294\n00:15:42.751 --> 00:15:46.580\nSo metadata, well it can be used for\nevil, but it's also used to make\n\n295\n00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.690\nkind of decisions and to provide\na better experience in some capacities.\n\n296\n00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.505\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's an excellent example cuz\nyou put your pictures, I know with my\n\n297\n00:15:54.505 --> 00:15:58.612\nApple, Mac stuff, and the photos, and\nthe photo stream, that's what it is, and\n\n298\n00:15:58.612 --> 00:16:02.898\nit goes like, these are all the locations\nthat you took these pictures, and you're\n\n299\n00:16:02.898 --> 00:16:07.039\nlike, that's a little scary [LAUGH], but\nit is those things that you don't see.\n\n300\n00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:10.453\nWhen we see the photograph or\nin this case a Word document,\n\n301\n00:16:10.453 --> 00:16:15.132\nwe're seeing the content that's in\nfront of us, the photograph, the words.\n\n302\n00:16:15.132 --> 00:16:19.868\nBut all that stuff that's kind of going\non behind the scenes in the underground\n\n303\n00:16:19.868 --> 00:16:23.900\ninformation, in you wanna say,\nof the file, that's all there.\n\n304\n00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.870\nYou just don't see it, and\n\n305\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.050\nwith these document properties,\nit's good in some places,\n\n306\n00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.150\nlike hey, I do wanna know where I took\nthis photograph or what the date was, and\n\n307\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.880\nso on and so forth, but and especially\nin Word like, who was the author?\n\n308\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.191\nWhat's the company name?\n\n309\n00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:44.352\nIf you're talking about this as\nlike a legal document or anything,\n\n310\n00:16:44.352 --> 00:16:48.587\nI know a lot of law offices uses\nthe document properties to an extent,\n\n311\n00:16:48.587 --> 00:16:53.626\nbecause they need to put all that extra\ninformation besides just the deposition or\n\n312\n00:16:53.626 --> 00:16:58.152\nthe brief that they're working with,\nand where you can find the document\n\n313\n00:16:58.152 --> 00:17:03.410\nproperties in Word if you see here, it's\nin the info section of the backstage view.\n\n314\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.880\nSo in the info,\nover here on the right-hand side,\n\n315\n00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.610\nyou can see the properties.\n\n316\n00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.998\nNow if you don't fill any of this part in,\n\n317\n00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:15.299\nsay you make your own document, you\nstart a file, and then you save it, and\n\n318\n00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:19.706\nyou've never touched any of this stuff,\na lot of stuff won't be filled in.\n\n319\n00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:24.131\nIf I do a file new, here let's go back\nover to new, and go with blank document,\n\n320\n00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:27.819\ncome back over to the info here,\nyou can see there isn't a title,\n\n321\n00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.033\nthere isn't any tags or comments, and\n\n322\n00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:34.762\nthe other things that are automatically\ngenerated, like how many words, pages?\n\n323\n00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.454\nWhat's the file size?\n\n324\n00:17:36.454 --> 00:17:38.932\nOkay, that hasn't really\nbeen filled in just yet\n\n325\n00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:40.889\nbecause I don't have anything there.\n\n326\n00:17:40.889 --> 00:17:46.323\nComing back over to the document\nproperties, going back into the info,\n\n327\n00:17:46.323 --> 00:17:49.992\nnotice that in this one,\nwe have a title, a tag.\n\n328\n00:17:49.992 --> 00:17:55.197\nThis is another one that maybe\nyou've never seen this before,\n\n329\n00:17:55.197 --> 00:17:59.516\nbut how do I know if this\ndocument was created today or\n\n330\n00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:04.816\nyesterday, and [LAUGH] this is one\nof those, as a teacher I know or\n\n331\n00:18:04.816 --> 00:18:10.114\nsomeone's like I typed this in weeks ago,\nand da da da, and\n\n332\n00:18:10.114 --> 00:18:16.434\nI look at the created date says yesterday,\nthe day after your paper was due.\n\n333\n00:18:16.434 --> 00:18:20.995\nI can tell from this data,\ncuz that's one of those automatic stamps,\n\n334\n00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:24.552\nthat automatic metadata that\ncomes with the file, and\n\n335\n00:18:24.552 --> 00:18:29.600\nI could tell who was the last person that\nmodified it and when was it modified.\n\n336\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.272\nSo these are the good things that you\nmight want to start just being aware that\n\n337\n00:18:34.272 --> 00:18:37.131\nit exists and\nthen using it to your advantage.\n\n338\n00:18:37.131 --> 00:18:41.464\nSo I went in and actually filled in\nthe title and the tags, and then if I,\n\n339\n00:18:41.464 --> 00:18:45.656\nall the way down at the bottom\nthere's the show all properties, and I\n\n340\n00:18:45.656 --> 00:18:50.443\ncome into here and it expands out to give\nme a few other things like the company.\n\n341\n00:18:50.443 --> 00:18:53.540\nI put OfficeProTV,\npart of the edutainment live family.\n\n342\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.800\nI typed that in.\n\n343\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.740\nI typed in the subject, cuz I wanted this\nto come in with it, and if you wanted to,\n\n344\n00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.760\nyou can also scroll up the top and you can\nget into even more advanced properties and\n\n345\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.070\nit brings you into this dialog\nbox where you can start adding,\n\n346\n00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:14.900\nyou can add your custom tags or\ncategories or properties, because they all\n\n347\n00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.240\nkind of blend together there, and you can\nstart adding and putting the values in.\n\n348\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:26.410\nSo all that metadata, how can we use this\nwith the whole idea about quick parts?\n\n349\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.380\nWell now that I have, I've seen that I\nhave document properties in here, and\n\n350\n00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.600\nI go into the insert, cover page,\nand we'll go into that filagreen.\n\n351\n00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.250\nA lot of this stuff is already done, learn\nabout document properties, because these\n\n352\n00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:47.070\nfields are being used in a lot of the\nstuff that is in those building blocks.\n\n353\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.270\nThe cover pages, some of the things\nwith the headers and footers,\n\n354\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.980\nbut some of the things\nthat you can choose,\n\n355\n00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.620\nit's going to find that document\nproperties and automatically populate it.\n\n356\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.700\nThat's why if you have one that doesn't\nhave any of these document properties,\n\n357\n00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.260\nwhen you go into the header,\nit just says, company name, and\n\n358\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.240\nit puts it in these little\nbrackets right here.\n\n359\n00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.151\nIt's because the company address was not\npopulated in the document properties, so\n\n360\n00:20:10.151 --> 00:20:13.576\nit's not showing me and I can still go\nahead and come in here and change it.\n\n361\n00:20:13.576 --> 00:20:18.458\nThat's fine, but that whole idea of\nthis is a field that is trying to find\n\n362\n00:20:18.458 --> 00:20:22.796\nthat information,\nit ties in with those document properties.\n\n363\n00:20:22.796 --> 00:20:26.792\nSo that's part where I wanted to\nkind of demonstrate it with already\n\n364\n00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.414\ncreated building blocks.\n\n365\n00:20:28.414 --> 00:20:33.655\nBut if I was in this document and\nI wanted to maybe put in the footer,\n\n366\n00:20:33.655 --> 00:20:38.428\nthat I wanted to put in the title,\nor the whatever I've put in\n\n367\n00:20:38.428 --> 00:20:42.850\nwith one of those document properties,\nI can add it in.\n\n368\n00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:47.224\nI can add it into the document itself,\nit's just regular text.\n\n369\n00:20:47.224 --> 00:20:51.326\nSo anywhere where your cursor is,\nfooter, document,\n\n370\n00:20:51.326 --> 00:20:54.904\ncome into Insert,\ngo over to those Quick Parts,\n\n371\n00:20:54.904 --> 00:21:00.490\nnow we know that if I go with Document\nProperties, and these are populated,\n\n372\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:05.150\nI can put in the company and\nit puts it right into that document.\n\n373\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.817\nSo that's where you have\nto have both pieces.\n\n374\n00:21:07.817 --> 00:21:12.485\nThere it's in Quick Parts, so I can\nput it in, but if it's not populated,\n\n375\n00:21:12.485 --> 00:21:16.708\nnothing's gonna show up, and\nyou can also put in some other items,\n\n376\n00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:19.394\nlike maybe you wanna\nput in the word count.\n\n377\n00:21:19.394 --> 00:21:24.263\nThis is one of those I used to know,\nwhen I was writing papers,\n\n378\n00:21:24.263 --> 00:21:26.521\nwhat was it the Gordon rule?\n\n379\n00:21:26.521 --> 00:21:30.417\nIs that one of those requirements in\ncollege where you had to have a 6,000 word\n\n380\n00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:31.560\nEnglish classes and?\n\n381\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.199\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I have no idea.\n\n382\n00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:37.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm a very stream of consciousness\n\n383\n00:21:37.644 --> 00:21:38.729\nwriter, I'm just like [NOISE].\n\n384\n00:21:38.729 --> 00:21:42.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then I have someone review it and\n\n385\n00:21:42.658 --> 00:21:44.880\nkind of help me put it into shape.\n\n386\n00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.867\nSo I tend not to focus on those,\n\n387\n00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:48.643\ncuz then it becomes-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:21:48.643 --> 00:21:50.072\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like when you can't sleep\n\n389\n00:21:50.072 --> 00:21:53.173\nand you're like, if I go to sleep right\nnow, I'll get three hours of sleep.\n\n390\n00:21:53.173 --> 00:21:55.231\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; If I counted words, then I was like,\n\n391\n00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.124\nI only have to write 4,000 more words.\n\n392\n00:21:57.124 --> 00:21:59.428\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I just kind of, whoo,\n\n393\n00:21:59.428 --> 00:22:01.262\nI just forgot about all this.\n\n394\n00:22:01.262 --> 00:22:02.199\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n395\n00:22:02.199 --> 00:22:05.066\nI think it was where you had to have so\nmany requirements,\n\n396\n00:22:05.066 --> 00:22:09.009\ncuz I went to community college first,\nthen went off to the university and so,\n\n397\n00:22:09.009 --> 00:22:13.794\nyour English classes were like 6,000 words\nand your Social Sciences were 3,000, or\n\n398\n00:22:13.794 --> 00:22:15.213\nsomething to that effect.\n\n399\n00:22:15.213 --> 00:22:16.740\nI don't know,\nwho knows if they still have that?\n\n400\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.760\nIt's been awhile since\nI've been in college.\n\n401\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.336\nBut those things that you had to have,\npage or a,\n\n402\n00:22:22.336 --> 00:22:25.402\nfiles that were 1,500 word essays.\n\n403\n00:22:25.402 --> 00:22:27.018\nSo how many words do I have?\n\n404\n00:22:27.018 --> 00:22:29.592\nNow we do have down here,\nI've got my word count.\n\n405\n00:22:29.592 --> 00:22:33.100\nSo I can really quickly tell\nyou I've got 470 words.\n\n406\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:38.173\nBut if I wanted to put that into\nthe file as this is information,\n\n407\n00:22:38.173 --> 00:22:41.924\nwell that's something I\ncould use as a field.\n\n408\n00:22:41.924 --> 00:22:45.978\nSo, I can choose putting a field of\nthis document, now this is where,\n\n409\n00:22:45.978 --> 00:22:50.653\nI don't have all of these populated in\nhere, but some of these categories that,\n\n410\n00:22:50.653 --> 00:22:54.776\nif I go into the document information,\nthere we go, we have file name,\n\n411\n00:22:54.776 --> 00:22:56.881\nfile size, document properties.\n\n412\n00:22:56.881 --> 00:23:01.312\nThere is the key word,\nnumber of words there we go, numwords, and\n\n413\n00:23:01.312 --> 00:23:05.981\nit's gonna show me the number of\nwords in the document, you click OK,\n\n414\n00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:10.174\nit puts it in there, and\nif I start typing out more words, the,\n\n415\n00:23:10.174 --> 00:23:13.972\nit should update itself,\nit's not, but that's okay,\n\n416\n00:23:13.972 --> 00:23:19.554\nI could right-click on it [LAUGH] and I\ncan update that field, and now I have 467.\n\n417\n00:23:19.554 --> 00:23:24.434\nSo you can have those different\nfields in your document wherever you\n\n418\n00:23:24.434 --> 00:23:25.637\nwant them to go.\n\n419\n00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:29.570\nSo just wanted to cover all the bases\nthat's in this dropdown list.\n\n420\n00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.353\nSo you're like, okay,\nwell what is the document property?\n\n421\n00:23:32.353 --> 00:23:36.660\nWhat's a field and now you know that\nthey're all part of the building blocks\n\n422\n00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.227\norganizer, and\nnow you know how to use them.\n\n423\n00:23:39.227 --> 00:23:43.259\nNow, just start filling up that gallery\nand add to your heart's content and\n\n424\n00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:45.030\nmake your life a lot easier.\n\n425\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.718\nParts that are quick.\n\n426\n00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:50.165\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, you've definitely shown us\nsome wonderful tools here that can make\n\n427\n00:23:50.165 --> 00:23:53.310\nour lives a little bit easier, but\nbefore we go, I do have a question.\n\n428\n00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:57.231\nCould I create a template, if you've\nhaven't seen our template episode\n\n429\n00:23:57.231 --> 00:24:02.038\ndefinitely go check that out, that already\nhas pre-populated document properties, so\n\n430\n00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:03.807\nI don't have to fill those in, or\n\n431\n00:24:03.807 --> 00:24:06.994\nis that something that I kind\nof have to fanangle each time?\n\n432\n00:24:06.994 --> 00:24:11.861\n&gt;&gt; You know, I'm almost positive [LAUGH]\nthat if you populate that document\n\n433\n00:24:11.861 --> 00:24:17.365\nproperty, in the template, cause you're\nmaking a whole new file off of whatever\n\n434\n00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:22.388\nthis stamp is, if it's in the stamp\nit's gonna stamp down into there, and\n\n435\n00:24:22.388 --> 00:24:27.493\nI feel like I know I've read this before,\ncompanies will make templates for\n\n436\n00:24:27.493 --> 00:24:31.298\ntheir office users, and\nsay, okay, so here's this.\n\n437\n00:24:31.298 --> 00:24:34.928\nMake sure you, and they'll write\nout the steps, do a file save as,\n\n438\n00:24:34.928 --> 00:24:38.812\nsave it as a template, and put it into\nyour custom Office templates, and\n\n439\n00:24:38.812 --> 00:24:40.553\nthen make new files off of that.\n\n440\n00:24:40.553 --> 00:24:44.220\nSo it keeps all of those things like\nthe company name and the address and\n\n441\n00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.599\nall of those pre-populated fields with it.\n\n442\n00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:51.153\nSo that way when they make the cover\nletter, I keep saying letter, the cover\n\n443\n00:24:51.153 --> 00:24:55.922\npage, it will do everything, and that\nway it can keep consistency, maybe have\n\n444\n00:24:55.922 --> 00:25:00.719\na specific branding brief, or just this\nis what all of our documents need to do.\n\n445\n00:25:00.719 --> 00:25:03.659\nSo, I'm going to say 99.99% yes.\n\n446\n00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:05.757\nYes [LAUGH].\n\n447\n00:25:05.757 --> 00:25:07.539\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's all I can ask of you, and\n\n448\n00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:10.623\nI'm pretty sure that is the case\ncuz that just makes sense, right?\n\n449\n00:25:10.623 --> 00:25:13.551\nWhy would be there if I can't kind\nof persist them through some kind of\n\n450\n00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:16.287\ntemplated means, because well,\nthey're suppose to help me?\n\n451\n00:25:16.287 --> 00:25:17.939\nBut Vonne, thank you so much.\n\n452\n00:25:17.939 --> 00:25:22.333\nYou've illuminated, well what are Quick\nParts, and particularly how do audit text\n\n453\n00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:26.679\nand document properties fill into there,\nbut that's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n454\n00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:30.450\nBut we've got more Word,\nadvanced Word mind you, coming at you.\n\n455\n00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.270\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for\n\n456\n00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.790\nOfficeProTV I've been your\nhost Justin Dennison.\n\n457\n00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.554\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n458\n00:25:35.554 --> 00:25:36.342\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:25:36.342 --> 00:25:41.045\n[NOISE]\n\n",

Tv.\n\n3\n00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:11.610\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.754\nAnd in today's episode, well, we're back\nwith more advanced word and well, we're\n\n5\n00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:19.587\ngetting near and dear to my heart because\nwe're gonna be talking about macros.\n\n6\n00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:23.225\nNow if you don't know what a macro is,\nthat's okay because we have someone\n\n7\n00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:27.171\nin the studio that is going to explain\neverything, and that is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:28.021\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.732\nI'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:31.758\nYes, we're going to macro it up.\n\n11\n00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:32.988\nMacrosonian cheese.\n\n12\n00:00:32.988 --> 00:00:36.550\nI don't- [LAUGH] I couldn't help myself,\nI had to go with it,\n\n13\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.237\nbut- That sounds really good right now.\n\n14\n00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:38.993\n[LAUGH] It does, it does.\n\n15\n00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:39.845\nDoes it not?\n\n16\n00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:41.468\nBut more importantly, macros.\n\n17\n00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:45.363\nYes, instead of macaroni and,\nI can't even say it the way that, [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:45.363 --> 00:00:45.949\nMacrosoni and cheese.\n\n19\n00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.643\nMacrosoni and Cheese.\n\n20\n00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:52.367\nWell, we're gonna add a little cheese to\nour document in the sense that we're gonna\n\n21\n00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.426\nmake it easier for ourselves, and\nit's gonna be really delicious.\n\n22\n00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:58.197\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I'm going with that, too.\n\n23\n00:00:58.197 --> 00:00:59.603\nSo what is a macro?\n\n24\n00:00:59.603 --> 00:01:04.258\nA macro is recorded steps that you\nlike kind of hit the tape recorder.and\n\n25\n00:01:04.258 --> 00:01:08.455\nyou'll see why I'm using the tape\nrecorder reference once we get\n\n26\n00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:10.990\ninto actually how you record in macro.\n\n27\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.873\nAnd then it's just, you hit the Record,\nyou talk,and then you hit the Stop, and\n\n28\n00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:18.829\nthen you rewind it, and you play it back,\nand then it plays what you just recorded.\n\n29\n00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.289\nIt's fantastic, and\nthen once you go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.424\nrecord it you can use it to where\nmaybe assign it to a button and\n\n31\n00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:27.886\nthen you just click a little button and\nit does everything for you.\n\n32\n00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:28.552\nAwesome.\n\n33\n00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:32.992\nWell now we have talked about some\nother techniques within this area of\n\n34\n00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.408\nthe series about automating things.\n\n35\n00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:36.475\nWe've talked about Quick Parts.\n\n36\n00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:41.299\nWell, what could I do as a macro that's\ndifferent than using Quick Parts?\n\n37\n00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.774\nWell, these would be things\nlike actual steps, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:49.227\nNot just typing where I want things to\nmaybe, the example I always go with and\n\n39\n00:01:49.227 --> 00:01:53.970\nwhat we are going to be using in this show\nis maybe I need to always make my margins.\n\n40\n00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.063\nLike something that I have to\nsetup my page all the time.\n\n41\n00:01:57.063 --> 00:01:59.916\nI gotta make my margins,\n1.5 all the way around.\n\n42\n00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:02.725\nI always have to change it to landscape,\nI have\n\n43\n00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:08.340\nto put a watermark on there that says Do\nNot Copy And I have to put a page border.\n\n44\n00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.960\nAll those things that I have to do,\nrepeated steps, you could record and\n\n45\n00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.535\nmake a macro out of it, so then it\nwill perform those particular steps.\n\n46\n00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:19.747\nAnd macros are really great, but\n\n47\n00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:24.571\nthere are some small limitations to it\nin the sense of what it can record.\n\n48\n00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:27.870\nIt's not good with recording\nyou selecting text,\n\n49\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.560\nthat's not something it does very well.\n\n50\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.049\nSo because think about it,\nif you're selecting text in a document,\n\n51\n00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.418\nyou'd go ahead and perform those\nsame steps in another document,\n\n52\n00:02:37.418 --> 00:02:40.565\nit's not gonna have the same\nplace to know where it's going.\n\n53\n00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:45.382\nSo the best way to try it is to well,\nrecord the steps that you think that you\n\n54\n00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:48.592\nwanna do and then play it back and\nsee if it works.\n\n55\n00:02:48.592 --> 00:02:50.490\nIf it doesn't, then guess what?\n\n56\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.522\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n57\n00:02:51.522 --> 00:02:54.597\n[LAUGH] So\nyou do have to know some of those pieces.\n\n58\n00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:59.260\nAnd I'll show some other parts along\nthe way as we record our own macros.\n\n59\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.210\nBut the other thing we need to talk about\nwith macros is the security issues that\n\n60\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.813\nthey do kinda carry with it,\nand essentially security.\n\n61\n00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:09.631\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n62\n00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:11.415\nSomething that's potentially harmful?\n\n63\n00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:14.086\nWell, kind of, in the sense of like, hey,\n\n64\n00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:18.155\nyou get a file that has a macro that\nyou don't know who recorded it.\n\n65\n00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:22.961\nWe're talking about VBA,\nwhich is visual basic for application.\n\n66\n00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.528\nIt is a programming language.\n\n67\n00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:29.283\nAnd any time that you can get into\nprogramming languages then it\n\n68\n00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:33.588\nhas the potential to write\ncode that could be malicious,\n\n69\n00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:39.880\nthat could then kind of sneak into your\ncomputer, and start attacking your files.\n\n70\n00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.030\nAnd then maybe even attacking In your\nnetwork, and you just let in a virus.\n\n71\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.563\nWe hear about all of these\nthings in Computer Security,\n\n72\n00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:50.215\nabout Trojan Horses and viruses.\n\n73\n00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:54.419\nBelieve, I'm not a security expert but\nI do know enough about this to say,\n\n74\n00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.913\nhey if you get a document with a Macro\nmake sure that it's from a trusted source.\n\n75\n00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:04.328\nYou know who it is, and that you're\nable to run this without the fear\n\n76\n00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:09.078\nof having something potentially\ndangerous happen to you or\n\n77\n00:04:09.078 --> 00:04:13.171\neven more the network that\nyou are connected with.\n\n78\n00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.380\nSo something that you\ndo need to be aware of.\n\n79\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.450\nNow what we're gonna do we're gonna\nbe writing our own macros for\n\n80\n00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.942\nour use so we're okay,\nwe're in our bubble of happiness.\n\n81\n00:04:26.942 --> 00:04:27.962\nI don't, I just made that up.\n\n82\n00:04:27.962 --> 00:04:30.032\nWe are going to just hug.\n\n83\n00:04:30.032 --> 00:04:31.772\nWe're gonna go with that.\n\n84\n00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:38.525\nBut I do want to reiterate we're\ngonna be recording macros, right?\n\n85\n00:04:38.525 --> 00:04:42.114\nThat's kind of how most people are going\nto produce these reproducible pieces.\n\n86\n00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:45.706\nThat's from the department of\nredundancy department, sorry.\n\n87\n00:04:45.706 --> 00:04:47.852\n[LAUGH] These reproducible\nactions that we can take.\n\n88\n00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:50.760\nHowever, because it does produce VBA code,\n\n89\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.770\nthere are people that will write VBA\ncode and just have things happen.\n\n90\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.329\nWhich means you can get\nsome pretty complex,\n\n91\n00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:02.974\nalmost like a full-fledged application\nthat pops up and runs in a Word document,\n\n92\n00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:07.443\nso what we're limited to is not just\nthe things that we're going to see today.\n\n93\n00:05:07.443 --> 00:05:11.458\nSo don't be afraid to use them but\ndo be aware that they\n\n94\n00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:16.469\nare a possible vector of security\nexploits that can cause issues.\n\n95\n00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.283\nExactly and I know you do a lot of\ncoding and so you know about this stuff.\n\n96\n00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:23.100\nAnd the other thing you're like coding,\nI don't know how to code.\n\n97\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.761\nI don't know the first thing.\n\n98\n00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:24.610\nDon't worry about it.\n\n99\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.368\nI'm just gonna show you what it\ncreates in the background, but\n\n100\n00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:30.139\nwe're gonna be doing everything\nthrough our Word interface.\n\n101\n00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.598\nWe're going to be clicking on\nthe layout tab and going to margins and\n\n102\n00:05:33.598 --> 00:05:37.130\nthen typing in the margins so\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n103\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.440\nSo easiest way to show you how\nto do it is, well, to show you.\n\n104\n00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.587\nDidn't we talk about the department\nof redundancy department?\n\n105\n00:05:43.587 --> 00:05:44.210\nYes.\n\n106\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.649\nYeah, department of redundancy department.\n\n107\n00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:48.262\nIt's one of my favorite places to visit.\n\n108\n00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:50.902\nWell I'm definitely swirling\naround in there, too.\n\n109\n00:05:50.902 --> 00:05:54.341\nSo let's jump down into our file.\n\n110\n00:05:54.341 --> 00:06:00.280\nThe other thing to note about documents\nthat do have macros attached to them.\n\n111\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.000\nYou're going to see\na different file extension.\n\n112\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.618\nWe've been working with DOCX with\nall of our regular Word documents.\n\n113\n00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:09.811\nWe've also talked about DOTX\nwith the templates episode.\n\n114\n00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:15.888\nNow we have the DOCM,\nthe M for macro-enabled.\n\n115\n00:06:15.888 --> 00:06:20.218\nThe other thing to look at is look at\nhow different that icon looks next to\n\n116\n00:06:20.218 --> 00:06:25.143\nthe DOCX, it's got this big piece of paper\nwith a big old exclamation to say hey!\n\n117\n00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:28.320\nCareful, [LAUGH] tread lightly.\n\n118\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.919\nOne other thing that´s gonna happen,\nif this was somebody, say like Justin sent\n\n119\n00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.958\nthis to me and I brought this onto\nmy computer for the very first time.\n\n120\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:40.119\nThe very first time I open this I´m\ngonna get a warning because your Word in\n\n121\n00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:46.280\ngeneral, has macros security enabled to\nsay, hey, I´m going to disable all macros,\n\n122\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.049\nbut I´m also gonna notify you and\ntell you that I did.\n\n123\n00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:52.982\nAnd I took a screenshot of this because,\n\n124\n00:06:52.982 --> 00:06:58.173\nsince I've already trusted this document,\nI said, hey, I'm okay.\n\n125\n00:06:58.173 --> 00:06:59.880\nLet me show you the warning.\n\n126\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.282\nI already clicked the enable\ncontent that came up but this was,\n\n127\n00:07:03.282 --> 00:07:05.539\nyou can see the title name, right there.\n\n128\n00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.281\nBorders Macros, even though I recorded it.\n\n129\n00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:10.160\nAnd I saved it and I closed it.\n\n130\n00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.208\nThe next time, the very next time I open\nthis, it's hey I'm just letting you know,\n\n131\n00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:15.422\ni disabled everything.\n\n132\n00:07:15.422 --> 00:07:18.869\nUnless you tell me that it's okay,\nand so I did.\n\n133\n00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:22.478\nSince I have said that for\nthis particular file,\n\n134\n00:07:22.478 --> 00:07:26.798\nmy Word program now knows that\nthis is a trusted document.\n\n135\n00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:32.260\nSo it's not gonna give me that\nwarning the next time I open it.\n\n136\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.433\nSo that way when I open it as file\nfrom the desktop I don't see any of\n\n137\n00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:38.262\nthose same problems, or\nthose same, it's not problem,\n\n138\n00:07:38.262 --> 00:07:40.883\nit's I don't see any of\nthose same warning anymore.\n\n139\n00:07:40.883 --> 00:07:43.938\nThe notification has been cancelled.\n\n140\n00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:48.079\nMacros, the other thing Developer tab,\nbecause you're like,\n\n141\n00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:51.328\nI've never seen macros in\nany of my ribbons so far.\n\n142\n00:07:51.328 --> 00:07:55.405\nWell, that's because I hadn't shown you\nhow to turn on the Developer tab yet.\n\n143\n00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:57.192\nSo where do I go to turn this tab on?\n\n144\n00:07:57.192 --> 00:08:01.990\nCuz this is part of Word,\nit's just off by default in Word.\n\n145\n00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.260\nWe went over to Home and\nwe went to our Options.\n\n146\n00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.390\nAnd from Options we went\nto Customize Ribbon.\n\n147\n00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.540\nAnd over here on the right-hand side,\nthere's a check box for Developer.\n\n148\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.180\nNormally you will see that unchecked,\nso that's all you gotta do.\n\n149\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.860\nSo that might be the first when we\nstart work with macros is go ahead and\n\n150\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.110\nturn on that Developer toolbar so\nyou can see things like the macros button,\n\n151\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.570\nhow to record a macro, and\nthere's that visual basic.\n\n152\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.030\nThere's some other things that's happening\nover here if you're going to be creating\n\n153\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.090\nforms in Word, but that's for\nanother day and another time.\n\n154\n00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.730\nThis document has macros built in, so I'm\ngonna come over here to this macros button\n\n155\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:49.130\nand click on it to see that I have\na macro named apples, cake, and clear.\n\n156\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.075\nAlways going back to\nthat food there Justin.\n\n157\n00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:53.230\n[LAUGH] Those sound delicious.\n\n158\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.720\nI could eat those with a big bowl\nof cheese, it'd be delicious.\n\n159\n00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.660\n[LAUGH] You know apples and\ncheese is actually really good.\n\n160\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.060\nThey are, they are actually.\n\n161\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.720\nI love a good brie and a good apple.\n\n162\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.087\n[LAUGH] Some howdah?\n\n163\n00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:05.534\n[SOUND] I have no idea what you`re saying.\n\n164\n00:09:05.534 --> 00:09:08.126\n[LAUGH] But we`ll go with it.\n\n165\n00:09:08.126 --> 00:09:09.938\n[LAUGH] I say it`s gouda but\n\n166\n00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:14.065\nI was corrected one time that\nit`s properly named howdah.\n\n167\n00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:15.830\nWe`ll go with it, you know?\n\n168\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.625\nTomato, tomato.\n\n169\n00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:20.590\n[LAUGH] In here we, and\nalso cheesecake [SOUND].\n\n170\n00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.230\nOkay, let`s get back to here.\n\n171\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.360\nSo I have apples, cake, and clear.\n\n172\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.890\nThese are steps that I have recorded.\n\n173\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.370\nSo in this dialogue box you can see\nwe can either run, step into, edit,\n\n174\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.860\ncreate, delete, and organizer.\n\n175\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.820\nWe don't really need to\nworry about the organizer.\n\n176\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.610\nIn it notice that it says,\nthat is in this particular document.\n\n177\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.490\nBecause if I went to a new document,\nit's not going to be in there\n\n178\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.830\nbecause I specifically told it\nto only be in this document.\n\n179\n00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.984\nSo if I run the apples,\ncuz that's the one that is selected.\n\n180\n00:09:50.984 --> 00:09:54.068\nLet's click it, and [SOUND] look at that.\n\n181\n00:09:54.068 --> 00:09:59.489\nIt went ahead and made it landscape,\nit added a green page color,\n\n182\n00:09:59.489 --> 00:10:04.960\nit added a apple border, and\nit vertically aligned my text.\n\n183\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.970\nAll of those different things I\nrecorded into that one macro.\n\n184\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.838\nHm, what do you think clear's gonna do?\n\n185\n00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:14.292\n[SOUND] well- That.\n\n186\n00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:17.340\nYou took away my thunder, Vaughn,\nyou take away my thunder.\n\n187\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.700\nBut I can already see the power here\nbecause if you're doing some kind of\n\n188\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.340\nrepetitive mailings or anything like that.\n\n189\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.037\nAnd yeah, you could save these in\ntemplates but maybe you want to persist\n\n190\n00:10:28.037 --> 00:10:32.978\nthis, it's something you reproducibly\ndo over other documents, right.\n\n191\n00:10:32.978 --> 00:10:35.710\nSo it's not necessarily you want\nto save in a particular template.\n\n192\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.860\nI still want the apple border all the time\nbut maybe I don't want it landscaped so\n\n193\n00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.580\nI can kind of piece.\n\n194\n00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.750\nIt's almost like a bunch of mega blocks or\nLego's that I can kind of piece together.\n\n195\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.730\nAnd you actually made\na really great point.\n\n196\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.620\nI was like why don't I make\na template that looks like that and\n\n197\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.650\nthen I can choose to make\na new file any time I want.\n\n198\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.540\nTotally fine.\n\n199\n00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.990\nAnd I've actually talked to people about,\n\n200\n00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.300\nwell we don't wanna use macros\nbecause of the security.\n\n201\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.230\nOr even just,\n\n202\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.900\nmaybe you have group policies cuz you\ntalk about networks and everything.\n\n203\n00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.540\nThat if you have a networked environment,\nto a certain degree they can\n\n204\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.640\ncontrol what you can and\ncannot do in all of your products.\n\n205\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.450\nSo they could lock down something in\nWord to where you're never even able to\n\n206\n00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.400\nrecord a macro.\n\n207\n00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.209\nSo you could do things like make\na template that has all of these layouts,\n\n208\n00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:26.031\nand you have an apple template,\nand a cake template.\n\n209\n00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:29.780\nBut this is just another way\nof getting the same thing.\n\n210\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.530\nSo it's always that half,\nsix dozen, one way or the other.\n\n211\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.076\nI don't know if I've said that correctly.\n\n212\n00:11:35.076 --> 00:11:37.040\n[LAUGH] Six of one, half dozen of another.\n\n213\n00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.500\nYeah, that saying.\n\n214\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.680\nBut I do want to keep in mind\nthat macros also provide\n\n215\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.830\nkind of beyond the capabilities of\ntemplates when you really dive deep, but\n\n216\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.810\nthat's not what we're talking about here.\n\n217\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:53.664\nYeah exactly, at a level where we're at as\nsome basic to intermediate Office users,\n\n218\n00:11:53.664 --> 00:11:58.459\nwe don't need to go much further than\nlet's just go ahead and use VBA or\n\n219\n00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:00.570\nmacros to record steps.\n\n220\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.780\nSo just to show you what the cake does.\n\n221\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.771\nSame idea except that it makes it pink and\nit gets cake, and\n\n222\n00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:08.231\nthen the macro to records\nthat I clear this out.\n\n223\n00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:10.640\nAnd so I can pick and\nchoose when I need that to happen.\n\n224\n00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.250\nJust to see some of that VBA, just so\n\n225\n00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.220\nyou can get an idea of it, with\nthe apples if I click the Edit button.\n\n226\n00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.810\nYou're kind of being thrown into, notice\nthat title Microsoft Visual Basic for\n\n227\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.215\nApplications, and it's writing this.\n\n228\n00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:34.220\nNow I'll tell you I don't write VBA,\nI do code enough\n\n229\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.810\nto where I can kind of pick out look\nit says fill, background color.\n\n230\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.470\nSo it's using words that\nwe would associate with,\n\n231\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.250\nthat must be how they're using that, pink.\n\n232\n00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.525\nNo this is apples,\nthis would be green, okay.\n\n233\n00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:50.920\nAnd I also know enough about RGB\nvalues that if I really wanted to\n\n234\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.320\nI could come in here and change some of\nthese numbers to make this yellow, or\n\n235\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.720\nmake this white or make this purple.\n\n236\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.691\nI would have to remind myself how\nto make purple [LAUGH] from light,\n\n237\n00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:04.710\ncuz you're like red and blue.\n\n238\n00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.360\nWe're talking about light,\nnot subtractive colors.\n\n239\n00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.650\nSorry, I'm digressing into colors.\n\n240\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.940\nSo I could pick out, there's the borders.\n\n241\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.100\nIt says something about apples and where\nit's gonna be put into, and the width, and\n\n242\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:17.790\nso on and so forth.\n\n243\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.560\nSo if you're feeling saucy,\nyou might wanna come in here and\n\n244\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.500\ntry to change some of this.\n\n245\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.670\nMy biggest thing is, hey,\nif my macro doesn't work, you know what?\n\n246\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.960\nJust record another one.\n\n247\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.390\nGive it a new name, and\ndelete the other one that didn't work.\n\n248\n00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.760\nKinda like we talked about\nwith the Quick Parts gallery.\n\n249\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.190\nIt's much easier to just recreate\na new one and delete the old one,\n\n250\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.220\nthan trying to edit.\n\n251\n00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.630\nAnd really with the Quick Parts,\nyou can't really edit it.\n\n252\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.850\nNow if I close this I'm still in Word,\n\n253\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.600\njust back into where I'm not\nlooking at that Visual Basic.\n\n254\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.080\nSo those are the things that are kind of\nalready made in this pick your document,\n\n255\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.190\nand then we'll go through and\nstart making our own.\n\n256\n00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.792\nSo well that actually brings\nme kind of my next question.\n\n257\n00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:58.655\nThat seems a little intimidating for some.\n\n258\n00:13:58.655 --> 00:14:02.281\nIt kind of made me giddy cuz I was like,\nI don't even know Visual Basic and\n\n259\n00:14:02.281 --> 00:14:06.310\nI kind of know what it's doing and\nI think I could go and switch this around.\n\n260\n00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.150\nSo I might have to go\nplay with that myself.\n\n261\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.677\nBut for people who are like,\n\n262\n00:14:09.677 --> 00:14:13.566\nwell I don't want to learn to program\nto get these reproducible pieces.\n\n263\n00:14:13.566 --> 00:14:15.300\nWhat do we, how do we make macros?\n\n264\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.150\nIt's not too hard, really.\n\n265\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.840\nIf you hit the record button, you do your\nsteps, and then you hit the stop button.\n\n266\n00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.605\nThat's usually the biggest part,\nremembering to hit the stop button.\n\n267\n00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:27.630\n[LAUGHS] All right, so let's close this.\n\n268\n00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.170\nI'm not gonna save the changes.\n\n269\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:34.270\nAnd you'll see when we start recording\nour own macros, I have a choice\n\n270\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:39.440\nof recording the macros within\nthat document only or going it\n\n271\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.280\nto where it's across all of our documents,\nall active and new documents within Word.\n\n272\n00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.300\nAnd that's where you can start\nkind of using the power across\n\n273\n00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.190\nall of your documents.\n\n274\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.910\nSo let's start a new file.\n\n275\n00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.890\nWe're just starting up Word.\n\n276\n00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.798\nBlank document, here it is.\n\n277\n00:14:54.798 --> 00:14:58.640\nSo we're gonna use that same demonstration\nof let's change the orientation,\n\n278\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.640\nmargins, we'll put a watermark on it,\nsome different things with page layout.\n\n279\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.250\nI don't have any text in here right now,\nI don't have to.\n\n280\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.176\nBut remember, you're not gonna wanna\nselect the text and apply a heading,\n\n281\n00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:11.103\nselect the text.\n\n282\n00:15:11.103 --> 00:15:12.800\nIt doesn't like selections.\n\n283\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.560\nAnd the other thing it's not gonna like\nare those predetermined building blocks.\n\n284\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.860\nWhen we do the watermark,\nI'll show you what to avoid in that step.\n\n285\n00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.590\nWe have our developer tab, we just going\nto click that, record macro to start and\n\n286\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.090\nstop recording macro, perfect.\n\n287\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.410\nWhat are we going to name it?\n\n288\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.870\nNaming convention does\nmake a difference here.\n\n289\n00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.913\nYou cannot use spaces.\n\n290\n00:15:36.913 --> 00:15:40.382\nI want to say you have to\nuse lowercase letters but\n\n291\n00:15:40.382 --> 00:15:44.708\nI might be crossing like a naming\nconventions in HTML files.\n\n292\n00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:48.731\nBut let's just for all sense and purposes,\n\n293\n00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:54.945\nlet's just use lowercase letters,\nand we'll do a page_layout.\n\n294\n00:15:54.945 --> 00:15:59.840\nYou could assign it to a button or\na keyboard, we'll do that after the fact.\n\n295\n00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.510\nAnd then store macros in all documents.\n\n296\n00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.330\nYes, this is what I would like it to do.\n\n297\n00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.200\nI don't wanna store it\nin this document only.\n\n298\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.690\nLet's go head and keep it in that\nnormal document that everything,\n\n299\n00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.380\nall files start off as normal.\n\n300\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.022\nSo if everybody's made off of normal and\n\n301\n00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:20.200\nit's part of that,\nthen it will be available to me.\n\n302\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.264\nYou click OK.\n\n303\n00:16:21.264 --> 00:16:24.490\nAnd that's my old school mouse cursor.\n\n304\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.957\nI don't know if you can,\nI don't think it makes my mouse cursor.\n\n305\n00:16:26.957 --> 00:16:28.180\nIt makes it a little bit.\n\n306\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.995\nSo it looks like a tape recorder, right.\n\n307\n00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:31.310\nIsn't that cute?\n\n308\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.800\nI remember having a tape recorder.\n\n309\n00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.250\nMy little red tape recorded\nthat had a little handle.\n\n310\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:37.340\nYep, dating myself again.\n\n311\n00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.590\nSo it's now recording\neverything that I do.\n\n312\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.327\nLess steps the better.\n\n313\n00:16:44.327 --> 00:16:47.740\nIf you start clicking around, undoing,\nit's gonna record all of that.\n\n314\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.770\nYou start recording a lot of\nextras that it doesn't need,\n\n315\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.240\nit might take a little longer to process,\nso be slightly aware of that.\n\n316\n00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.080\nKinda have a game plan before you start.\n\n317\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.580\nSo we're gonna change the orientation\nthat's on the Layout tab.\n\n318\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.920\nWe'll go from portrait to landscape.\n\n319\n00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.435\nWe're gonna go to our margins.\n\n320\n00:17:07.435 --> 00:17:10.260\nRemember, try not to pick some\nof these already created ones,\n\n321\n00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.870\neven though, that's exactly what I want.\n\n322\n00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.090\nGo into the dialog boxes and type them in.\n\n323\n00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:22.820\nSo come into custom margins,\nlet's do 1.5 all around for\n\n324\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.820\nthis demonstration, and\nlet's change the layout too.\n\n325\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:31.810\nLet's change that to center\nvertical alignment, just because.\n\n326\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.202\nWe click OK.\n\n327\n00:17:33.202 --> 00:17:34.546\nI've got that.\n\n328\n00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:37.020\nLet's come over into the Design tab.\n\n329\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.740\nLet's change the watermark.\n\n330\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.210\nYou're going to be very tempted to\nwanna say, confidential or do not copy,\n\n331\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.660\ncuz I wanna say do not copy.\n\n332\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.900\nDon't choose this one.\n\n333\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.040\nCome down into the custom watermark.\n\n334\n00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.710\nGet in that dialogue box.\n\n335\n00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.640\nThat's what the macros like.\n\n336\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.700\nThe other thing to remember all\nof these predetermined ones,\n\n337\n00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.760\nthose are from our building blocks.\n\n338\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.140\nThe building blocks that's\nseparate than normal, and\n\n339\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.495\nwe're not recording it in building\nblocks so it starts to do it.\n\n340\n00:18:03.495 --> 00:18:05.230\nI've done this and it throws an error.\n\n341\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.650\nI've gone back and played it,\nit's nope, I can't do it.\n\n342\n00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.890\nAnd I go in the VBA code, and\nthere's just a big yellow block there.\n\n343\n00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.650\nI don't know how to fix it besides, okay,\n\n344\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.130\njust record one without using\nthat particular option.\n\n345\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.170\nWe're doing custom.\n\n346\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.030\nWe want the text one,\nwe can choose from here.\n\n347\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.212\nThis is okay.\n\n348\n00:18:22.212 --> 00:18:23.832\nI wanna choose the text of do not copy.\n\n349\n00:18:23.832 --> 00:18:27.250\nI'm gonna change the font\njust because I want to.\n\n350\n00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:32.865\nI'll make it, where is my,\nwell that's, a is above c, a before c.\n\n351\n00:18:32.865 --> 00:18:35.360\n[LAUGH] Scrolling, there we go.\n\n352\n00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.040\nArial black.\n\n353\n00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.359\nEverything else will be fine.\n\n354\n00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:39.920\nClick OK.\n\n355\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.788\nThere is my watermark and\nlet's throw, you know what, just for\n\n356\n00:18:44.788 --> 00:18:47.417\nfun let's throw in a page border.\n\n357\n00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:50.730\nWe'll throw in some cute little balloons.\n\n358\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.230\nDone, all right,\nall those steps I've recorded.\n\n359\n00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.130\nThe most important,\ngotta hit the stop button.\n\n360\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.390\nBack to Developer,\nclick that stop button, and\n\n361\n00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:06.200\nnow I have recorded the steps in my macro,\nawesome.\n\n362\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.690\nI do not have to save my changes to\nthis document because, just remember,\n\n363\n00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.200\nit's being saved in my normal template.\n\n364\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.120\nSo if I come into,\nlet's just start a new document for fun.\n\n365\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.960\nWe'll go into New, we'll say Hello World.\n\n366\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.632\nGood old Hello World.\n\n367\n00:19:23.632 --> 00:19:29.309\nLet's bump that up to 72 and\nwe'll make it centered.\n\n368\n00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:31.630\nNow I'm ready to apply that macro.\n\n369\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.892\nCome over to Developer,\ncome over to macros, there it is.\n\n370\n00:19:35.892 --> 00:19:40.821\nAnd I can run it and, [SOUND],\nI have a run time error.\n\n371\n00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:42.677\nHow did I get a run time error?\n\n372\n00:19:42.677 --> 00:19:45.219\nAll right, well, let's debug and\nsee what it says.\n\n373\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.430\nOkay, power plus watermark,\nthat watermark.\n\n374\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.500\nI thought the do not copy would be okay.\n\n375\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.396\nYou know what, I am not exactly sure why\n\n376\n00:19:58.396 --> 00:20:03.422\nthat is being thrown, watermark object.\n\n377\n00:20:03.422 --> 00:20:07.988\nYou know what we could do, we could try\nand just delete, [SOUND], something.\n\n378\n00:20:07.988 --> 00:20:09.200\nNo, you're fine.\n\n379\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.850\nTry it.\nYou think so?\n\n380\n00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.112\nBecause that's the debug line and\n\n381\n00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:16.171\nthe debug line is always gonna\nhighlight that relative line.\n\n382\n00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:18.367\nOoh.\nSo you have to remove text you still get\n\n383\n00:20:18.367 --> 00:20:19.380\nsome weirdness.\n\n384\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.719\nSo I would just try to run it again.\n\n385\n00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:23.335\nI'm so glad I have a coder with me today.\n\n386\n00:20:23.335 --> 00:20:25.600\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna save this.\n\n387\n00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.420\nAnd we'll save the changes\nto that particular macro.\n\n388\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.460\nThis will stop the debugger,\nokay, let's try it again.\n\n389\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.320\nWe will come over to a,\nwe're just starting a new file for fun.\n\n390\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.581\nMacro, run, [SOUND], look at that.\n\n391\n00:20:42.581 --> 00:20:44.340\nHey, and we just debugged it.\n\n392\n00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.870\nYeah, and look, this is the first step to,\nwell, to gaining close to a superpower.\n\n393\n00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.290\nSo don't be afraid.\n\n394\n00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.030\nIf things go horribly awry, as you've\nalready said, just throw it away and\n\n395\n00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.160\nrecord it again.\n\n396\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.340\nAnd then go okay, I just need to\nknow enough of what not to do and\n\n397\n00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.430\nthen I can just do it all over again so.\n\n398\n00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.260\nYeah that's perfect.\n\n399\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.400\nI'm so glad we did that.\n\n400\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.501\nAll right, so\nyes you can do it too, [SOUND].\n\n401\n00:21:06.501 --> 00:21:08.990\nSo now it works, awesome.\n\n402\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:14.080\nAnd I went in and edited in the VBA\ncode and if I wanted I could delete it.\n\n403\n00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.610\nAnd now the other one I wanted to show\nyou is that it was great to go ahead and\n\n404\n00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.050\nclick on Developer and\ngo to macros and run the recording.\n\n405\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.040\nBut wouldn't it be cute to have just like\na little button right here for me to just\n\n406\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:32.680\nboop, just click it and I can perform\nthat macro on any document at any time.\n\n407\n00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.570\nThat's where were going to\nbe customizing the ribbon.\n\n408\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.540\nNow this isn't really\na part of recording macros,\n\n409\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:42.460\nI just wanted to kind of extend it into\nmaking it a really accessible button.\n\n410\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.370\nSo we come over here to File,\nwe're gonna go to Options.\n\n411\n00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.420\nWe're gonna customize\nthe quick access toolbar.\n\n412\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:55.070\nNow this macro that I have, well it\nis a command but where does it live?\n\n413\n00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:59.420\nIf you drop this down,\nthere's a whole section for macros.\n\n414\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:04.620\nCool, so that's why we should go ahead and\nput those macros into the ether,\n\n415\n00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.820\nif you want to say.\n\n416\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.620\nWe put it into that normal template,\nthat dotm rather than\n\n417\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:16.210\njust that particular document so that\nway I can share it with everybody else.\n\n418\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.367\nSelect that macro that I have, add it.\n\n419\n00:22:19.367 --> 00:22:22.909\nBut now that normal,\nthat doesn't really say much for me and\n\n420\n00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:24.720\nI don't really like the icon.\n\n421\n00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.237\nSo you can come into the Modify\nbutton down at the bottom,\n\n422\n00:22:28.237 --> 00:22:30.156\nand when you click the Modify.\n\n423\n00:22:30.156 --> 00:22:33.170\nWhat should we choose, Justin?\n\n424\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:33.798\nWhat about that little smiley face?\n\n425\n00:22:33.798 --> 00:22:36.199\nYep, you gotta go emoji every time.\n\n426\n00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:39.550\nIf you have a choice, it's not really\na choice if you have an emoji.\n\n427\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.667\nYeah, exactly [LAUGH] what\ncould be happier than some,\n\n428\n00:22:43.667 --> 00:22:46.090\nwe have some balloons, right.\n\n429\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.425\nBalloons and do not copy,\nthat just screams smiles.\n\n430\n00:22:49.425 --> 00:22:54.088\n[LAUGH] And\nI can name this macro layout and\n\n431\n00:22:54.088 --> 00:22:57.250\nname it whatever you want.\n\n432\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.770\nClick OK, and so\nI can edit that particular button.\n\n433\n00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.260\nNotice you can,\nwell you can't modify that particular one.\n\n434\n00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.568\nBut some of your ones, especially\nthe macros, you could go ahead and\n\n435\n00:23:06.568 --> 00:23:07.606\nmodify that button.\n\n436\n00:23:07.606 --> 00:23:10.071\nWe click OK, awesome.\n\n437\n00:23:10.071 --> 00:23:13.204\nAnd then if I opened up\na file of whatever one,\n\n438\n00:23:13.204 --> 00:23:17.010\nlet's go with this quick parts,\nokay, just for fun.\n\n439\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.309\nWe click that button and\nthen you see that it will, ta da,\n\n440\n00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:24.905\nwent ahead and\napply that macro just like that.\n\n441\n00:23:24.905 --> 00:23:28.940\nAnd that was a document I already created,\nthat was not a file new.\n\n442\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.250\nSo I wanted to show you that it's for\nall document,\n\n443\n00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:36.662\nfor all active documents, and\nnew documents that I could run this.\n\n444\n00:23:36.662 --> 00:23:42.040\nSo I hope it's making your mind run\na little bit too of all the possibilities\n\n445\n00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:49.590\nthat you could do with using macros to\nhelp you make your life so much easier.\n\n446\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.688\nYeah, macros are definitely something\nthat, well, I can see the power in them.\n\n447\n00:23:53.688 --> 00:23:57.780\nAnd well, Vaughn, before we go is there\nanything else that you would like to add?\n\n448\n00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.600\nJust really kind of getting into,\nlike I said in the beginning.\n\n449\n00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.770\nWhen do I use a template?\n\n450\n00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.780\nWhen do I use a quick part?\n\n451\n00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.340\nWhen do I use a macro?\n\n452\n00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.640\nYou do have to kind of\ncompartmentalize it.\n\n453\n00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.400\nAnd you can combine them,\nyou can put macros in a template.\n\n454\n00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.629\nBut if you are going to put a macro in\na template, it does need to be a macro\n\n455\n00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.480\nenabled template, and\nyou need to make sure it has that dotm.\n\n456\n00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.650\nAnd that is one of those in the drop\ndown with the Save As Type,\n\n457\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.600\nthere will be template and\nthere will be macro enabled template.\n\n458\n00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.550\nSame with your document.\n\n459\n00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:32.640\nIf you are saving a macro in a document,\nyou don't save as a docx.\n\n460\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:38.090\nThere is a choice in the drop down for\nmacro enabled documents.\n\n461\n00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:42.610\nThat would be the biggest part is if\nyou're saving these within templates or\n\n462\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.670\ndocuments, get that m at\nthe end of the file name to\n\n463\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.440\nmake sure you have the full power\nof what a macro can do for you.\n\n464\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.970\nWell there you have it, right.\n\n465\n00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.840\nWe can have our very own macros that make\nour workflow, well, more performant.\n\n466\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.120\nBut then you can also store macros that\nyou distribute through other people.\n\n467\n00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.160\nDo keep in mind that could be a possible\nvector for a security exploit, so\n\n468\n00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.950\nif you get them always be aware\nof who they're sent from.\n\n469\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.510\nBut thank you so much, Vaughn.\n\n470\n00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.150\nBut I think we have run out of time for\nthis episode, but\n\n471\n00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.660\nwe've got more advanced\nWord coming at you.\n\n472\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.590\nBut for now, signing off for OfficePro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n473\n00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.240\nAnd I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n474\n00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.851\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n475\n00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:24.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.730\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.280\nin today's episode,\nwe'll work back with more advanced work.\n\n5\n00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.160\nI'm excited and I know you are as well,\nand in particular,\n\n6\n00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.080\nwe're gonna be looking at linked objects.\n\n7\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.650\nNow, I don't know if this has\nanything to do with high rule or\n\n8\n00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.760\nthe masters Sword of the triforce, but\n\n9\n00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.650\nhere to help us kind of find our way,\nis our one and only Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.570\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.832\n&gt;&gt; Are those Zelda references?\n\n12\n00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.752\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those were Zelda references.\n\n13\n00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:34.335\n&gt;&gt; I was like.\n\n14\n00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.010\n[LAUGH] I heard master sword in there,\nand I was like.\n\n15\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.070\nAnd I'm like, A, B, A, B, up, down, up,\ndown, left, right, left, right, start?\n\n16\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.860\nOr [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who knows?\n\n17\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.652\nIt's nostalgia.\n\n18\n00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:43.400\nNostalgia.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.540\n&gt;&gt; I don't need you judging me.\n\n20\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.710\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm right there with you.\n\n21\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.070\nSo I totally feel you.\n\n22\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.350\nSo unfortunately we're not gonna be\ntalking about the Legend of Zelda because\n\n23\n00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.490\nthat's probably as far as I can\nget with that particular game.\n\n24\n00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.224\nNow give me some Lolo 2,\nooh, then we're talking.\n\n25\n00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:02.646\nBut no, we're talking about\nlinked objects in Word.\n\n26\n00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:07.390\nSo why is this in the automation\nsection of this show?\n\n27\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.390\nWell it’s because if you think about it,\n\n28\n00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.970\nif I can get information\nfrom another source and\n\n29\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.395\nhave it update itself automatically,\nthat could save me a lot of time.\n\n30\n00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:18.345\nLet's take an example.\n\n31\n00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:22.345\nSay we're doing an annual report in Word,\nbecause it's a word processor,\n\n32\n00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:27.055\nand we're gonna be getting a lot of\ninformation from our Excel files.\n\n33\n00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:29.505\nAnd maybe even let's take it,\ncuz annual report,\n\n34\n00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:31.345\nthat's something that\nonly happens once a year.\n\n35\n00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:35.445\nWhat if we took this, maybe you're doing\na weekly report or a quarterly report\n\n36\n00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:40.130\nthat you're going to be needing that data\nin the same data set, but you're gonna\n\n37\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.790\nneed to have it refresh every time that\nyou have to create that particular report.\n\n38\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.562\nOkay, so we will go from annual to weekly.\n\n39\n00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:51.053\nBut the idea is we will be taking the\ncontent from Excel and I would normally\n\n40\n00:01:51.053 --> 00:01:56.330\njust go ahead and copy and paste, and\npaste the information right into Excel.\n\n41\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.260\nBut again, what are the changes?\n\n42\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.390\nI don't need to go back, and\n\n43\n00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.940\nlike, let me go ahead and copy that again,\ndelete it out, paste it again.\n\n44\n00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.010\nWhat if you just had it\nconnected to that source?\n\n45\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.000\nConnected to the Excel table, or\nI guess you could say it's table.\n\n46\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.360\nThat Excel content, that chart.\n\n47\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.880\nAny of that information from there,\n\n48\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.900\nand all I have to do is come into Word,\nopen the file up.\n\n49\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.610\nAnd then it will show, and reflect any\nof the changes I've made in those Excel\n\n50\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.070\ndocuments, right in my Word document.\n\n51\n00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.990\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n52\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.330\n&gt;&gt; Now, I could definitely see this\nbeing something where I need to,\n\n53\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.120\nmaybe I have some investors.\n\n54\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.650\nRight, and I have to provide them with\na report of about profit and loss.\n\n55\n00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.430\nOn a monthly basis, and\nI have to provide justification for\n\n56\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.680\nanything that seems out of the ordinary,\nright?\n\n57\n00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.110\nYou have kinda these standard metrics for\na PnL, but I don't wanna have to go and\n\n58\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.620\ncopy and paste that all the time.\n\n59\n00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.240\nI have important things to do\nlike making our PnL better.\n\n60\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.120\nAnd well, it would be nice just to have\nthat prepopulate, give my justification,\n\n61\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.470\nship that off, and\nkinda automate that part of my day.\n\n62\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nAnd then you can go play Legends of Zelda.\n\n63\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.747\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, there is nothing better\nthan finishing up your PnL report and\n\n64\n00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:04.869\ngoing back to link to the past.\n\n65\n00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.768\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH ] Exactly.\n\n66\n00:03:06.768 --> 00:03:10.550\nThat's a perfect example of some\nways that you might want to do this.\n\n67\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.060\nNow I am concentrating\nspecifically on Excel\n\n68\n00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.300\ninformation because that's probably\nthe most common type of linked object.\n\n69\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.950\nYou can link, well you actually really\ncan't link to a PowerPoint presentation\n\n70\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.590\nbecause then it just becomes, it's just\nan image, whatever, slides you're on.\n\n71\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.950\nSo it really is going to\nwork best with that Excel.\n\n72\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.640\nI can see maybe Access, but even that\n\n73\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.270\nI think is pushing the envelope a little\nbit, so we're gonna concentrate on that.\n\n74\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.560\nI have an example of an already\ncreated linked document in Word.\n\n75\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.410\nIt's called Linked Example,\nso if I open this up.\n\n76\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.830\nYou're gonna look at this and say,\nwell that just looks like a regular table.\n\n77\n00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.946\nWe've been talking about\nthe activity of Mr and\n\n78\n00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:55.910\nlittle over here, but\nthis is the same thing, right?\n\n79\n00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.410\nWell, no.\n\n80\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.102\nOne because I know I made this document,\nbut there's gonna be some bigger\n\n81\n00:04:02.102 --> 00:04:06.732\nindicators to you of hey, this isn't\njust a created table within Word.\n\n82\n00:04:06.732 --> 00:04:11.334\nIf I click on it, the first thing you see\nis like all of the text is kind of gray\n\n83\n00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:15.867\nand we've seen these things before,\nwe've seen these in the headers and\n\n84\n00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:18.230\nfooters when we put our page numbers.\n\n85\n00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.850\nMany of those types of\nfields that will update,\n\n86\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.460\nwe also saw this when we're inserting\nformulas into our tables and\n\n87\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.240\nsome of our previous\nepisodes within the show.\n\n88\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.900\nSo that gray backgroundy stuff, that's\nan indicator to you that that's a field.\n\n89\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.742\nSo it's pulling from somewhere and it's\ngoing to be able to be updated somehow.\n\n90\n00:04:41.742 --> 00:04:44.820\nSo that's a big one right there.\n\n91\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.250\nThe other thing that you can always\ndouble check with is right clicking.\n\n92\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.890\nWhen in doubt, right click or\ntry it out, when in doubt.\n\n93\n00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.660\nTry it out, that was the saying\nthat Daniel came up with.\n\n94\n00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.800\nSo if you right click, and\ni am over the actual field.\n\n95\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.900\nIt says right there, Update Link.\n\n96\n00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.490\nIf I was in a regular table,\nI wouldn't see things like update link.\n\n97\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.590\nI would have insert row or delete rows,\nor all those different items that I would\n\n98\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.790\nhave in a normal\nright-clicking of a table.\n\n99\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.510\nSo that's gonna be another\nbig indicator to me,\n\n100\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.080\nthat this is a linked\nobject of some source.\n\n101\n00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.560\nAnd it says, linked worksheet object.\n\n102\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.520\nCool, and I can go to things like edit\nthe link, open the link, convert, and\n\n103\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.380\nthen the links..., which is where\nwe get to the links dialog box.\n\n104\n00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.635\nSo that's one place\nthat you can get to it.\n\n105\n00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:35.302\nSo I think that's probably the easiest\nway to see if this is a link document,\n\n106\n00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:36.470\njust right click on it.\n\n107\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.800\nBut that links dialog box,\nand the document information.\n\n108\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.430\nThat is a second, or another place that we\ncould go and find all of this information.\n\n109\n00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.030\nSo in the info section,\nif you go down to the bottom,\n\n110\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.480\nit's probably gonna be behind my head.\n\n111\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.350\nSo you see right there, past open file\nlocation, it is added link to file.\n\n112\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.614\nIf you see that in the document\nproperties, guess what,\n\n113\n00:06:01.614 --> 00:06:03.587\nyou've got linked information.\n\n114\n00:06:03.587 --> 00:06:06.537\nI'll go ahead and click it, so\nyou can see this dialog box,\n\n115\n00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:09.720\nas we will be coming back into\nthis throughout this episode.\n\n116\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.940\nTo do things like, hey update this link.\n\n117\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.280\nAnd how is this not\nupdating when I open it?\n\n118\n00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.970\nCuz if you also have linked\nobjects in a Word document,\n\n119\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.530\nyou might see when you open the file up,\nyou'll get a warning dialog box, or\n\n120\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.210\na prompt that says, hey,\nthere is stuff connected to this file.\n\n121\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.450\nDo you want me to go ahead and\nupdate this?\n\n122\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.210\nAnd usually if you want to, say yes.\n\n123\n00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.013\nI didn't get that prompt because\nI had it on a manual update.\n\n124\n00:06:34.013 --> 00:06:35.990\nThat means I've to force it.\n\n125\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.530\nIt's kinda like, kind of phones where\nyou can have like push notification or\n\n126\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.800\nhave to like pull the notifications\ndown like, I've all my mail on pull,\n\n127\n00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.820\nI don't have it on push because hey,\nyou know what, if I'm somewhere,\n\n128\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.518\nI don't want my email to\nbe going off all day long.\n\n129\n00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:53.720\n[LAUGH] So\nI change it to pull within my settings.\n\n130\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.090\nSo it's the same thing here.\n\n131\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.810\nI'm only gonna pull the information\nwhen I want it to be pulled out.\n\n132\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.840\n&gt;&gt; Also, I can think of this as I'm trying\nto write some kind of interaction with\n\n133\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.530\na particular static setup information.\n\n134\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.260\nAnd maybe I wanna finish that first.\n\n135\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.310\nBefore I do an update.\n\n136\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.340\nBecause maybe the behind the scenes\ndata is changing fairly frequently but\n\n137\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.650\nI need to take a snapshot.\n\n138\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.500\nKind of persist that before\nthe update occurs and\n\n139\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.400\nthat would kind of mess up my mojo so\nto speak.\n\n140\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.860\nIf that just happened\nwithout me being aware of it.\n\n141\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's another great example there.\n\n142\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.650\nSo what do you want to do?\n\n143\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.720\nDo you want it automatic or\ndo you want to pull it down?\n\n144\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.110\nFor those specific reasons that\nJustin was just demonstrating.\n\n145\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.020\nAnd then we also have open source,\nchange source,\n\n146\n00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.510\nmaybe I have moved the location\nof where that file lived,\n\n147\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.170\nI was all my desktop and\nnow it's in my documents folder.\n\n148\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.189\nSo I could say, hey just go ahead and\nmove over to this or\n\n149\n00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:47.618\nhey maybe it's the exact\nsame data range but\n\n150\n00:07:47.618 --> 00:07:52.236\nit's in a different file because I have it\nin a different month or a different year.\n\n151\n00:07:52.236 --> 00:07:58.171\nSo that could be a nice reason why you\nwould want to use, change the source.\n\n152\n00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:00.780\nAnd then break link,\nis exactly what it sounds like.\n\n153\n00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.710\nI don't want this to be connected,\nto here.\n\n154\n00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.360\nI do want it to be completely static.\n\n155\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.030\nIt's kinda like going back to where, you\nwould just do a regular copy and paste,\n\n156\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.230\nand just put the information\ninto the document, and\n\n157\n00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.972\nthen it doesn't have any connection.\n\n158\n00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:18.053\nSo these might be good things that\nyou would want to do when, say,\n\n159\n00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:19.241\nyou're sending a file.\n\n160\n00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:24.025\nBecause if I send this Word file to\nJustin, if I have linked information in\n\n161\n00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:29.041\nthere, it gonna give him a warning like\nI can't find that because it's gonna\n\n162\n00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:34.309\ntry to be looking on my desktop for that\nsecure file name so he wouldn't see that.\n\n163\n00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.279\nSo that might be another reason why,\nat that point, when you're final, final,\n\n164\n00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:39.845\ndone, final, final, final.\n\n165\n00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:42.370\n[LAUGH] Gotta say it a couple of times.\n\n166\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.360\nBefore you go ahead and\nsend it off to somebody to share.\n\n167\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.790\nSo these are some different options that\nyou have, and we'll also talk about and\n\n168\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:53.580\ndemonstrate what this preserve\nformatting after update means.\n\n169\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.550\nWell, it's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n170\n00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:03.002\nPreserve any formatting that I'm doing in\nWord to this information when I update it.\n\n171\n00:09:03.002 --> 00:09:08.538\nBecause if I have that unchecked it's all\ngonna go back to however it looked like or\n\n172\n00:09:08.538 --> 00:09:10.880\nlooks like from that source file.\n\n173\n00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.875\nSo that's usually a good thing\nthat I would probably keep on,\n\n174\n00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:16.800\ncuz I'm gonna wanna kind\nof match that formatting\n\n175\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.210\nof that information in my document,\nrather than keeping it from the source.\n\n176\n00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.170\nSo just a few last things to go\nover in this dialog box, and\n\n177\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.330\nwe will be coming back to it.\n\n178\n00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.860\nYou can see where the source file lives,\nand\n\n179\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.320\nlet me gonna zoom into that a little bit.\n\n180\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.529\nSo this is just saying that this is on\nmy Desktop, it is called Chartdata.xlsx.\n\n181\n00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:39.620\nAnd there is a specific range Sheet1!\n\n182\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.990\nThat is a reference for\nthe sheet name within that file.\n\n183\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.700\nAnd then,\nthis is where it gets a little different.\n\n184\n00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.600\nThey don't use the a and\nthe column references and\n\n185\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.200\nrow references like you\nnormally see in Excel.\n\n186\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.210\nIt's using R1, C1 for row 1, column 1.\n\n187\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.347\nSo that's really I think A1.\n\n188\n00:10:00.347 --> 00:10:02.526\nBut if you think about it,\nit might not even start at A1.\n\n189\n00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:06.055\nSo it's just trying to\nfind where you told it to,\n\n190\n00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:10.000\nno actually it would be R1 C1 would be A1.\n\n191\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.306\nAnyways, you get the idea that the R and\nthe C will be rows and columns and\n\n192\n00:10:15.306 --> 00:10:21.612\nthat's how it's using as references as to\nwhat the range is within that worksheet.\n\n193\n00:10:21.612 --> 00:10:25.181\nSo just all of the different things\nthat you will see in this dialogue box\n\n194\n00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:25.847\nexplained.\n\n195\n00:10:25.847 --> 00:10:33.625\nSo now let's demonstrate how we can get\nthat information into our Word document.\n\n196\n00:10:33.625 --> 00:10:37.670\nThere's two main way,\nactually I think there are only two ways.\n\n197\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.510\nThere is copy from whatever location or\nsource that you have,\n\n198\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.430\nin this sense an Excel file.\n\n199\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.802\nYou select it, you copy it, and\nthen you paste it, but you don't just\n\n200\n00:10:48.802 --> 00:10:53.497\nregular paste, you do a paste as link,\nso you link it to that information.\n\n201\n00:10:53.497 --> 00:10:58.135\nI think that's the easiest way\nto do it because you isolate\n\n202\n00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:03.253\nexactly what content you want to\nbe shown in your Word document.\n\n203\n00:11:03.253 --> 00:11:07.580\nSo that`s, I would say,\nmy preferred way of doing this.\n\n204\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.220\nThe other way you can do this is going\nthrough your insert tab on your ribbon,\n\n205\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:19.830\ncoming over here to object and then going\nthrough the insert object dialog box and\n\n206\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.960\nyou can say, create from file.\n\n207\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.680\nWhen you create from file,\nthen you can go ahead and\n\n208\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.700\ncheck this box where it says link to\nfile and then it becomes, well, linked.\n\n209\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.670\nThe thing about doing it this way is\nyou're telling it to link to a file and\n\n210\n00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:42.660\nit's going to show whatever is\nactive in that particular file and\n\n211\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.066\nwhere you left off on.\n\n212\n00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:46.270\nSo if you were on sheet one and\n\n213\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:51.430\nall that data in there, that's going to\nshow everything in one little window.\n\n214\n00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.060\nWell a lot of times, I don't necessarily\nwant to see everything on that worksheet.\n\n215\n00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.610\nMaybe I just want one specific area.\n\n216\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.040\nThat's where the copy and paste method is\ngoing to be, to me, the easiest way to\n\n217\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.370\nisolate exactly what you want and\nwhere you want it in the Word document.\n\n218\n00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.260\nSo, we'll demonstrate both them,\nnow that we know how to do it.\n\n219\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.378\nI'm going to zoom out this a little bit, I\ndon't know why I have a W down there, but\n\n220\n00:12:16.378 --> 00:12:18.130\nlet's enter a couple more times.\n\n221\n00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.910\nNow, this one's already in here,\ngreat so why don't we go ahead and\n\n222\n00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.799\nget some other information.\n\n223\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.190\nI'm going to minimize that document.\n\n224\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:31.677\nI have a file called department and\naddresses and we will open this up.\n\n225\n00:12:31.677 --> 00:12:33.171\nHere we go.\n\n226\n00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:38.050\nWe got Bishop and Fuego and\nsome Tootsie and Zinger.\n\n227\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.055\nCan you tell I just went down\na list of all the cats I know.\n\n228\n00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:42.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute,\n\n229\n00:12:42.347 --> 00:12:46.660\ndo you have all of these cats actively,\nor is this just imagination?\n\n230\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.360\n&gt;&gt; No, these are gen one´s,\ngen twos, gen three´s.\n\n231\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was like hold up,\nthat´s more than, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n232\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.833\nAll right and so,\nwe have multiple generations, but\n\n233\n00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:59.182\nit is a sheet of nostalgia, so to speak.\n\n234\n00:12:59.182 --> 00:13:02.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, because Tootsie,\nthat was my childhood cat.\n\n235\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.180\nAnd then Zinger, she was kind of crazy.\n\n236\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.240\nAnd then I started going to friend`s cats.\n\n237\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.052\nAnd then people`s work cats that\nare on there so that`s, yeah.\n\n238\n00:13:12.052 --> 00:13:14.240\nThey`re not all my cats.\n\n239\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.324\nBut you can see I've got a bunch\nof information here, and\n\n240\n00:13:18.324 --> 00:13:21.556\nmaybe I want to show the first and\nlast name and\n\n241\n00:13:21.556 --> 00:13:27.270\ndepartment of just the first couple of\nthem maybe from Bishop down to Tito.\n\n242\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.020\nSo those are the ones I want to show,\nand I know that\n\n243\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.380\nthey will be changed departments here and\nthere, or maybe phone numbers.\n\n244\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:41.760\nAnd so I want to be able to just link\nthat part of this document into Word.\n\n245\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.700\nLet´s select it.\n\n246\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.436\nWe´ll go down to, I think it said Cheeto.\n\n247\n00:13:44.436 --> 00:13:48.725\nSo we go to here we´ll just regular\ncopy Ctrl+C, come back into Word,\n\n248\n00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:52.060\nget my cursor where I want\nthe information to go.\n\n249\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.070\nI´m going to right-click to show\nyou the different paste options.\n\n250\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.660\nSo we've talked about the difference\nbetween keep source formatting,\n\n251\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.250\nversus merge, or use destination formats.\n\n252\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.930\nThen the next couple, link and\nkeep source formatting,\n\n253\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.380\nmeaning whatever came from Excel.\n\n254\n00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.330\nLink and\nuse destination formats or styles.\n\n255\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.190\nAnd that's the one I will probably choose.\n\n256\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.030\nBecause a lot of times,\n\n257\n00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.770\nwhatever is formatted in Excel might not\nbe how it want it to be formatted in Word.\n\n258\n00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.015\nBut I am going to make\nsure that it is a link and\n\n259\n00:14:23.015 --> 00:14:27.260\nit`s going to be able to use\nmy Word styles that I want.\n\n260\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.695\nI click that and then there you go.\n\n261\n00:14:29.695 --> 00:14:31.810\nI`ve got all the information.\n\n262\n00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.982\nAnd you can format this, I could make\nthis bigger, I could go ahead and\n\n263\n00:14:35.982 --> 00:14:37.625\nchange the column widths.\n\n264\n00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:40.315\nAnd I could increase\nthe font size of all of,\n\n265\n00:14:40.315 --> 00:14:43.450\nwhoops, let`s go ahead and get the undo.\n\n266\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.200\nSelect the whole table first.\n\n267\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.095\nAnd then let's up the font size,\nlet's throw a design on there,\n\n268\n00:14:50.095 --> 00:14:54.023\nand voila,\nwe have a beautifully formatted table.\n\n269\n00:14:54.023 --> 00:14:55.743\nI'll take the first column off.\n\n270\n00:14:55.743 --> 00:14:59.381\nClick off to the side, and great, okay?\n\n271\n00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:02.829\nI didn't have to type the information,\nand everything is linked in there.\n\n272\n00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:07.390\nIf I right click on here, this is where\nI could update the link when needed.\n\n273\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.920\nI can go into the links, edit links file.\n\n274\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.850\nFrom the info you can see that yes,\nit has come in.\n\n275\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:20.460\nAnd I will tell you that the automatic\nupdating, that`s the default setting.\n\n276\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.430\nI had forced it for\nthe example that I showed to manual.\n\n277\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:32.560\nI changed that here in this dialogue box,\nbut the auto will happen by default.\n\n278\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.365\nLet's click okay,\nlet's do a save, file save.\n\n279\n00:15:37.365 --> 00:15:41.791\nClose Word, and\nlet's see the power of that dynamic\n\n280\n00:15:41.791 --> 00:15:45.018\nchanging in the linked information.\n\n281\n00:15:45.018 --> 00:15:47.440\nCuz Bishop, Timothy, well,\n\n282\n00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.844\nlet's say he decided that he doesn't\nwant to go by Timothy any more,\n\n283\n00:15:52.844 --> 00:15:57.986\nhe wants to go by Mr Pencil Cat,\nbecause that's what his name is.\n\n284\n00:15:57.986 --> 00:15:59.202\nOoh, goodness.\n\n285\n00:15:59.202 --> 00:16:03.230\nThere, so that's his new last name\nthat he decided that he wanted.\n\n286\n00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:10.101\nAnd let's say Tootsie went ahead and\ngot married to Elvis,\n\n287\n00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:16.161\nso now she is Tootsie Tiger\ninstead of Tootsie Paws.\n\n288\n00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:17.670\nSo she had a name change there.\n\n289\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.610\nSo, I've changed some information.\n\n290\n00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.087\nLet's save.\n\n291\n00:16:21.087 --> 00:16:22.671\nLet's close.\n\n292\n00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:25.220\nLet's also change the chart data.\n\n293\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:30.180\nWe realize that Fuego has been\nsleeping a lot more lately.\n\n294\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.353\nHe sleeps about 56 hours a day.\n\n295\n00:16:34.353 --> 00:16:36.355\nJust making a very significant change.\n\n296\n00:16:36.355 --> 00:16:38.210\n[LAUGH] He does eat a lot more.\n\n297\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.937\nSo we'll go with eighteen.\n\n298\n00:16:40.937 --> 00:16:43.050\nMaybe this is a week, a month?\n\n299\n00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.520\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna need him to tell me how to be\nthat productive, cuz that's a lot of work.\n\n300\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sleeping and\n\n301\n00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:52.785\neating regardless in a single day,\nbut I'm gonna need that information.\n\n302\n00:16:52.785 --> 00:16:53.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n303\n00:16:53.673 --> 00:16:55.800\nYou know, he's pretty magical.\n\n304\n00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.430\nAnd those are his big priorities,\nsleeping and eating, and bugging me.\n\n305\n00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.120\nWell, we'll save the changes here too.\n\n306\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.780\nCome back up, let’s see what happens.\n\n307\n00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.870\nI think you guys are going to know, if I\nopen up, there's that warning dialogue,\n\n308\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.430\nor it’s not really a warning.\n\n309\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.900\nIts more of a prompt I would say.\n\n310\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.880\nThis document contains links to\nother files do you want update them?\n\n311\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.613\nYes or no?\n\n312\n00:17:17.613 --> 00:17:18.612\nYou could say no.\n\n313\n00:17:18.612 --> 00:17:22.390\nYou don't have to, but if I say,\nyeah, I'd like you to do that.\n\n314\n00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.807\nClick yes.\n\n315\n00:17:23.807 --> 00:17:25.031\nLet it spin a little bit.\n\n316\n00:17:25.031 --> 00:17:26.552\nAnd there we go.\n\n317\n00:17:26.552 --> 00:17:31.244\n[LAUGH] See the pencil cat has been\nsmall because it didn't remember.\n\n318\n00:17:31.244 --> 00:17:36.160\nThat's new information that was\nadded as opposed to Tootsie Tiger.\n\n319\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.265\nLike, why did that format versus Mr\nPencilcat, again, it's added information.\n\n320\n00:17:41.265 --> 00:17:45.420\nThere was a single word in\nTootsie's last name there.\n\n321\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.390\nSo it just went ahead and changed it out.\n\n322\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.560\nAnything extra you're gonna\nhave to reformat that.\n\n323\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.530\nBut that's not too terribly difficult.\n\n324\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.605\nI could just come up here and\nthen increase all of the text at one time.\n\n325\n00:17:56.605 --> 00:17:59.060\nAnd then change the, there we go.\n\n326\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.210\nCuz that would bother me if we left that.\n\n327\n00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.380\n&gt;&gt; Now, now Vonne,\nsomething I want to ask about.\n\n328\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.491\nYou had those two different link\noptions where you could keep the Excel\n\n329\n00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:13.050\nsheets' formatting or\nyou could do destination formatting.\n\n330\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.549\nIf you kept the Excel\nsheets' formatting and\n\n331\n00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:18.724\nthen you made this changes\nlike you made the coloration.\n\n332\n00:18:18.724 --> 00:18:21.781\nThat doesn't back propagate\nto your other file does it?\n\n333\n00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:27.390\n&gt;&gt; If you retain those,\nit should but it doesn't always.\n\n334\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.041\nA lot of times and\nespecially if you have that option\n\n335\n00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:33.432\npreserved formatting in the edit\nlength style box that it shows,\n\n336\n00:18:33.432 --> 00:18:36.409\nit's not going to care anything\nof what you did in Excel.\n\n337\n00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:39.709\nIt's going to only remember\nhow you formatted it in Word.\n\n338\n00:18:39.709 --> 00:18:44.045\nNow if you turn that check box off,\nanytime that it updates, and\n\n339\n00:18:44.045 --> 00:18:49.080\nhere we can actually do that,\nlet's come back over into here.\n\n340\n00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.066\nAnd we will turn off the preserve\nformatting after update.\n\n341\n00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:55.440\nAnd I believe I can do it right from here.\n\n342\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.530\nWe can update now, and come back out.\n\n343\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.180\nYeah, there you go.\n\n344\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.880\nAnd so then it's going to take off\neverything that It had in Word.\n\n345\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.640\nBecause I updated it,\nit's gonna clear it all out, so\n\n346\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.930\nthat's where it will come into play.\n\n347\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nit will preserve it in Word, but\n\n348\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.801\nif I make changes to this chart in Word,\nor, excuse me, not a chart,\n\n349\n00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:21.543\nit's not a chart, this table that\ndoesn't make changes in my Excel sheet.\n\n350\n00:19:21.543 --> 00:19:23.300\n&gt;&gt; This is a one-way data flow, right?\n\n351\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.540\n&gt;&gt; I see what you're asking.\n\n352\n00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.630\nYeah, it doesn't go back to Excel.\n\n353\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.150\nYes, I see.\n\n354\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.975\nThe back propagation,\nthat's what you mean.\n\n355\n00:19:29.975 --> 00:19:33.870\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nit doesn't touch the Excel data.\n\n356\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.030\nIt is a one-way communication\njust from Excel to Word,\n\n357\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.376\nwith the content and\nnothing in Word goes back into Excel.\n\n358\n00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:48.560\nSo I could change things in Word and\nit's not gonna change in the Excel data.\n\n359\n00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.360\nSo yeah,\nI hear what you're saying now, got it.\n\n360\n00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:52.990\nPerfect.\n\n361\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.760\nSo that's where we have\nsome different options.\n\n362\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.095\nNow, why didn't Fuegos chart?\n\n363\n00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.887\nCuz remember we said he's\nlike sleeping a lot, right?\n\n364\n00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:00.878\nThat didn't work.\n\n365\n00:20:00.878 --> 00:20:03.182\nAny options?\n\n366\n00:20:03.182 --> 00:20:03.870\n&gt;&gt; I think,\n\n367\n00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:09.000\nbecause we've set this to a manual update,\ndon't we have to manually update it.\n\n368\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.475\nThat kind of makes sense, right?\n\n369\n00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is brought to you by\n\n370\n00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:14.927\nthe Department of Redundancy Department.\n\n371\n00:20:14.927 --> 00:20:18.300\nIt's manual update,\nyou've got to update it manually?\n\n372\n00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that sounds like music to my ears.\n\n373\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.520\n[LAUGH] That's exactly what we have to do,\nI have to right click on here.\n\n374\n00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.010\nI have to update the link,\nand now it's going to change.\n\n375\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:32.182\nThat prompt that I got when I opened\nthe file was because I had two different\n\n376\n00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:35.966\nthings that were linked,\none was an automatic, one was a manual.\n\n377\n00:20:35.966 --> 00:20:41.088\nAnd that was that prompt before\nthe automatic changes that I had for\n\n378\n00:20:41.088 --> 00:20:42.655\nthis information.\n\n379\n00:20:42.655 --> 00:20:45.840\nSo now, that's what we're doing.\n\n380\n00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.749\nI had opened the file outside\nwhere everybody was closed.\n\n381\n00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.966\nAnd then I went ahead and opened up Excel.\n\n382\n00:20:51.966 --> 00:20:53.251\nBut what if I'm here and\n\n383\n00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:57.580\nI'm realizing while I'm in Word like,\nthat's essentially not right.\n\n384\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.590\nI need to change that data.\n\n385\n00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.610\nI can right click,\nlike in its source file,\n\n386\n00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.858\nI need to go to the source and change it.\n\n387\n00:21:03.858 --> 00:21:06.660\nYou can come into the right click and\nopen the link, or\n\n388\n00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:11.580\ngo from that dialogue box we went into and\nit will open in Excel.\n\n389\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.804\nThis is opening the actual file.\n\n390\n00:21:13.804 --> 00:21:18.490\nThis is not an embedded object because\nwe've seen some of that when we inserted\n\n391\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.247\ntables in some of our previous episodes\nwhere it was an embedded object that used\n\n392\n00:21:23.247 --> 00:21:24.455\nExcel inside of it.\n\n393\n00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:25.990\nIt was like the picture in picture?\n\n394\n00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.306\nNo this is completely outside.\n\n395\n00:21:28.306 --> 00:21:29.830\nSo I can come in here be like,\n\n396\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.645\nFuego can't sleep 56 hours during\nthe day as much as he would want to,\n\n397\n00:21:33.645 --> 00:21:38.200\nhe's only gonna sleep 10 hours cuz I'm\ngoing to pester him to stay awake.\n\n398\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.410\nAnd I'm gonna take away his food and\nthat way he is going to meow a lot more.\n\n399\n00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.370\nSo I still don't think that adds up to 24.\n\n400\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:45.954\nI think eight.\n\n401\n00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:47.971\nI'm not really good with math.\n\n402\n00:21:47.971 --> 00:21:49.041\n&gt;&gt; It's still, make that six.\n\n403\n00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:50.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, six, thank you.\n\n404\n00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.834\n[LAUGH] So now I have updated my changes.\n\n405\n00:21:54.834 --> 00:21:57.380\nSave my file, so I just did a file save.\n\n406\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.631\nClose Excel, come back into here.\n\n407\n00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:02.720\nIt's a manual update, so update the links.\n\n408\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.440\nAnd now it will change because I'm\npulling from that information.\n\n409\n00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.260\nSo in that sense,\nremember I did go to the source.\n\n410\n00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.300\nIt just was a shortcut from being in Word.\n\n411\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.952\nSo those are some of the different\nthings that you can do.\n\n412\n00:22:16.952 --> 00:22:19.570\nNow down here I went to Cheeto.\n\n413\n00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.530\nWhat if I needed to add\nin a couple of more rows.\n\n414\n00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:28.880\nI realize I need to get those other\nthree cats that are past Cheeto.\n\n415\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.440\nCan't remember which ones they are,\nbut I need more.\n\n416\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.030\nWell there's two ways.\n\n417\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.070\nIf it's something small like this.\n\n418\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.630\nYou can do it through changing\nthe reference within Word.\n\n419\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.680\nAnd I'll show you that.\n\n420\n00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.850\nBut if it's a lot like, I need an add,\nlike, I need to change the sheet.\n\n421\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.230\nAnd I gotta to change the range and\neverything.\n\n422\n00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.925\nYou know what, it might just\nbe easier to just delete this.\n\n423\n00:22:48.925 --> 00:22:53.597\nGo back to where it came, the Excel file,\nmake that new selection, copy and\n\n424\n00:22:53.597 --> 00:22:57.545\npaste that link again and\njust make it a little easy on yourself.\n\n425\n00:22:57.545 --> 00:23:04.060\nIt's sometimes easier to just redo it than\nto try to change what's already there.\n\n426\n00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.510\nBut in a small sense, like I just need\na couple more rows, let's go into File.\n\n427\n00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.100\nLet's go to Info.\n\n428\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.010\nWe'll scroll down to that\nEdit Links dialog box.\n\n429\n00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:19.434\nSo we said that it is pulling from\nrow 1 column 1 to row 10 column 3.\n\n430\n00:23:19.434 --> 00:23:23.421\nI can change the source and\nchange that range.\n\n431\n00:23:23.421 --> 00:23:24.692\nSo let's make sure I've got.\n\n432\n00:23:24.692 --> 00:23:25.724\nIt is this one, perfect.\n\n433\n00:23:25.724 --> 00:23:28.380\nSo I'm gonna change the source.\n\n434\n00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.090\nIt's saying,\nwhat file do you want me to pull from?\n\n435\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.230\nI still wanna pull from the same file.\n\n436\n00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.280\nBut down here, where it says Item,\n\n437\n00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.040\nthat's where it saying that\nsheet two row one column.\n\n438\n00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.030\nOkay well if I go into Item,\nI can change it here.\n\n439\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:49.304\nWell, three more rows\nfrom ten would be row 13.\n\n440\n00:23:49.304 --> 00:23:53.023\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, you're making changes\nto those rows and columns things, and\n\n441\n00:23:53.023 --> 00:23:56.000\nI do want to re-emphasize some\npoint that you made earlier.\n\n442\n00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.325\nThese are row and\ncolumn numbers Be careful if your making\n\n443\n00:23:59.325 --> 00:24:03.896\nthese changes inside of Word because\nthat's not how their labeled in Excel and\n\n444\n00:24:03.896 --> 00:24:07.570\nyou may get a little wonky if\nyou get things out of kilter.\n\n445\n00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what we we're\nsaying as well, if you needed to make\n\n446\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:15.250\nmajor changes to this then go back out and\nredo it rather than editing this.\n\n447\n00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:20.580\nIf it's just, I need to go from ten to 13,\nI can figure that out and it's okay.\n\n448\n00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.890\nBut don't go too much pass that and\nalso make sure that you\n\n449\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.828\nhave that many more rows to add within\nthe actual source documents so.\n\n450\n00:24:27.828 --> 00:24:30.810\nThe one other thing I wanna\npoint out in this problem.\n\n451\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.266\nI went into the item, you do make sure cuz\nsometimes notice here, like the file name.\n\n452\n00:24:35.266 --> 00:24:38.370\nSometimes the file name even\nthough I had like said no,\n\n453\n00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.750\nchange this keep that selection.\n\n454\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.410\nWhen I come into this item\nit kind of clears this out,\n\n455\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:48.540\nso just click back on that yes\nfrom this particular Excel file,\n\n456\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.940\nin this location, and that item,\nthat range, that's what I want.\n\n457\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.832\nI click open and you can see that\nthe information has now been changed.\n\n458\n00:24:56.832 --> 00:25:00.950\nI'm gonna update this now,\nclick the update button.\n\n459\n00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.840\nGive me another little swirl,\nokay perfect.\n\n460\n00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.930\nWe say okay, come back out, and\nmine is just caught that really quick,\n\n461\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.080\nit just went bloop.\n\n462\n00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:16.660\nAnd it added those extra three rows,\nto include Jack, Georgette, and Belle.\n\n463\n00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.360\nSo those are some of my\nfriends cats [LAUGH].\n\n464\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.770\nAnd so that way I can go ahead and\nchange that source data.\n\n465\n00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:27.050\nNow what if I'm ready to\nsend this off to Justin,\n\n466\n00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.130\nI want him to have this information.\n\n467\n00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:33.719\nOr I'm ready to send it off to the boss of\nhere's the annual report, don't wanna send\n\n468\n00:25:33.719 --> 00:25:37.928\nthat information with the linked documents\ncuz I'd have to send him the linked\n\n469\n00:25:37.928 --> 00:25:42.550\ndocuments, then give them instructions on\nhow to come back in and change the source.\n\n470\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.850\nWe're still gonna be looking for\nmy file system.\n\n471\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.580\nJust forget all of that.\n\n472\n00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.200\nJust break the link cuz I'm done with it.\n\n473\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.180\nHow do I do that?\n\n474\n00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.400\nBack where we just were.\n\n475\n00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:59.039\nCome in to the edit links to file,\nand just click the break link.\n\n476\n00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.230\nBreaka, are you sure you want to do that?\n\n477\n00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.790\nYep, I'm good.\n\n478\n00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.178\nYou sure you want to do the second one?\n\n479\n00:26:05.178 --> 00:26:08.980\nMm-hm, I'm alright, click yes, click yes.\n\n480\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.410\nCome back over the document,\nnow this is just,\n\n481\n00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.150\nthis is just a regular table now,\nsee it says table tools and\n\n482\n00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.930\nI think happened with the design or the\nlayout and I can change the information.\n\n483\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.900\nI don't have any of the gray anymore.\n\n484\n00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.800\nSo this is just a regular item,\n\n485\n00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.830\nin the sense a table in Word, and\nI can go on my merry life without having\n\n486\n00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:32.320\nto worry about sending documents to people\nthat have the linked information in it.\n\n487\n00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:38.000\nNow if this was a chart, because I\ncould have just as easily copied and\n\n488\n00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.300\nlinked to that chart that was in Excel.\n\n489\n00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.280\nCuz that's something that\nmaybe I need to demonstrate or\n\n490\n00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.950\ninclude into my Word document,\nthen it would become a chart.\n\n491\n00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.560\nBut every once in a while,\nif it's something that is\n\n492\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.390\njust a little too off-kilter that it\ndoesn't understand that's a table,\n\n493\n00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:59.550\nor that's a chart, it will become\nan image, it just becomes a picture, and\n\n494\n00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.530\nthen that way you would then\njust format it as a picture.\n\n495\n00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:08.320\nIf it had individual pieces that\nyou could've edited before, and\n\n496\n00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.640\nthen it becomes this whole image,\nit doesn't really\n\n497\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.440\nhave that same editability as\nmuch anymore from that source.\n\n498\n00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:22.760\nBut, just keep in mind that at least it\nshows the content of how you last left it.\n\n499\n00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.300\nYou don't really have to\ndo much more with it.\n\n500\n00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.800\nI did tell you that there was\nanother way of inserting a link\n\n501\n00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.990\nfrom an object, a linked object.\n\n502\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.950\nBut I just wanna show you what it\nlooks like cuz I just tend to not\n\n503\n00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.860\nreally like it as much.\n\n504\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.832\nI completely see why you could,\nlike if that's all I need to show,\n\n505\n00:27:41.832 --> 00:27:42.800\nlike that's great.\n\n506\n00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:46.370\nI like to be more specific.\n\n507\n00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:50.290\nLet's go to insert, object, and\nI'm going to create from file.\n\n508\n00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:55.460\nI'm going to browse to that same\nfile that we were going with.\n\n509\n00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.990\nWe'll go with the department and\naddresses.\n\n510\n00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.170\nClick insert.\n\n511\n00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.010\nNotice I didn't have any option to\nsay like what range I'm looking at.\n\n512\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.110\nWhat am I doing?\n\n513\n00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.970\nLink to the file.\n\n514\n00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:05.590\nClick okay.\n\n515\n00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.780\nGive it a second, there you go.\n\n516\n00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.960\nEverything that was on that worksheet,\n\n517\n00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.890\nall of the information is going to\nbe displayed in this linked item.\n\n518\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.979\nNotice it is not going to\nshow me anything more of,\n\n519\n00:28:21.979 --> 00:28:27.090\nlike I can't really change the,\ncan't change the column sizes.\n\n520\n00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:33.060\nIt's really more of an image,\na snapshot into what's in that file.\n\n521\n00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.150\nI'll save this just for a second,\ncome back out to that source\n\n522\n00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:44.960\ndocument just to show that if I had\nadded a new sheet and said hello world,\n\n523\n00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.030\nsave this file,\nwhere this is the active sheet.\n\n524\n00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:57.510\nClose this, open up our Word file again,\nand then update this link.\n\n525\n00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.871\nIt will,\nsee that's the only thing that's showing,\n\n526\n00:29:01.871 --> 00:29:04.910\nbecause I had left off\non that other sheet.\n\n527\n00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.140\nSo that's the biggest part I think,\nespecially with this,\n\n528\n00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.586\nI can see Justin's over there going like?\n\n529\n00:29:09.586 --> 00:29:12.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is not intuitive,\n\n530\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.180\nI would mess that up.\n\n531\n00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.850\nThat would actually aggravate me and\nprobably cost me more time than,\n\n532\n00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:20.120\nwhile having these linked objects\nis kind of helping me update and\n\n533\n00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.640\naccumulate information.\n\n534\n00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.670\nThat's kind of a weird behavior to me.\n\n535\n00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:28.090\nNow I possibly understand why it's like\nthat, right, if you get into a workflow.\n\n536\n00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.710\nBut for me,\nI just don't think it would work.\n\n537\n00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I guess, and it also really\ndepends on how that source file is set up.\n\n538\n00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:38.520\nIf we're talking about weekly reports or\nmonthly reports, and every month, you have\n\n539\n00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:43.660\neach month on its own worksheet, and\nthe information is exactly what you need\n\n540\n00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:48.133\nto show in the Word document, it's just\na couple of rows and a couple of columns.\n\n541\n00:29:48.133 --> 00:29:52.890\nThat hey every time it's a new month,\nas long as I know that I left off in\n\n542\n00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:57.290\nthe Excel document that hey I'm on month\nJuly, and that was the last active sheet\n\n543\n00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:02.790\nwhen I closed the file and then it\nwill show in Word, I mean I can kinda,\n\n544\n00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.280\nI'm trying to, I'm kinda circling\na little bit to try to justify.\n\n545\n00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.821\nI see you shaking your head like [SOUND]\nbecause It's too many variables,\n\n546\n00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:12.158\nit's too many factors\nthat I have to remember.\n\n547\n00:30:12.158 --> 00:30:17.310\nSo using that, select that, this is\nthe area that I want to link it to.\n\n548\n00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.810\nI personally think that\nthat is going to be\n\n549\n00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:23.690\nthe preferred method of\nadding linked information.\n\n550\n00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:28.080\nBut as you can see from all of these\ndifferent examples, this can save you\n\n551\n00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.500\na lot of time than especially if you're\nworking with all of these numbers and\n\n552\n00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.060\nall of this information in one place to\nshow here, just create it as a link and\n\n553\n00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.260\nsave yourself some of that.\n\n554\n00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I agree.\n\n555\n00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.350\nI particularly like adopting a workflow\nthat involves its own flow chart.\n\n556\n00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.010\nSo I don't think I'd go\nwith that second option.\n\n557\n00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:49.110\nBut that first one does not\nhave the master sword or\n\n558\n00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:53.460\nthe tri-force, it does help put\nus on auto pilot so to speak.\n\n559\n00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.520\nSo very helpful information,\nthank you so much Vonne.\n\n560\n00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.510\nBut it does look like we're running\nout of time for this episode but\n\n561\n00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.400\nwe definitely have more\nadvanced Word coming at you.\n\n562\n00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.900\nSo signing for OfficeProTv,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n563\n00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:06.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n564\n00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.432\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n565\n00:31:08.432 -->

Yeah. I'm like man,\nthis is personalized.\n\n46\n00:01:54.938 --> 00:01:55.596\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n47\n00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:56.854\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n48\n00:01:56.854 --> 00:02:00.890\n&gt;&gt; Someone took the time to\nwrite this by hand, didn't they?\n\n49\n00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, of course,\nthat was a little more back in the day.\n\n50\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.490\nNow, I know what they're doing,\nbut it looks like, wow,\n\n51\n00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.290\nthis really is to me because\nthey've perfected it.\n\n52\n00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.241\nThey didn't have the shells,\nif you want to say, and\n\n53\n00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.415\nthen they hand-wrote your name in it.\n\n54\n00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:19.640\nNo, they took the time to make\nsure everything matched, and\n\n55\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.003\nit actually looked like it was\nspecifically addressed to you.\n\n56\n00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:26.450\nAnd that's really what we're\ngoing to be doing in mail merge.\n\n57\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.573\nWe're going to be doing batch\nprocessing of one letter with variable\n\n58\n00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:37.864\ninformation into it, and that variable\ninformation is connected to a data source.\n\n59\n00:02:37.864 --> 00:02:41.401\nNow, I'm using some of that\nterminology right there, well,\n\n60\n00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:44.540\nMicrosoft doesn't really\nuse the same words.\n\n61\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.650\nSo, why don't we do this?\n\n62\n00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.300\nWhy don't we go ahead and jump down\nin here and go ahead and start with\n\n63\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.590\nthe actual white pages if you want to,\nof the help files?\n\n64\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.419\nAnd here, right, I've got the support.\n\n65\n00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.050\nUse mail merge to create and\nsend bulk mail, labels, and envelopes.\n\n66\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.580\nBecause, yes, this is a mail merge, but\n\n67\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.740\nyou can use mail merges to create\nthese different types of documents.\n\n68\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.550\nYou can make a letter.\n\n69\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.625\nYou can do an email.\n\n70\n00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.190\nYou can batch email and\ngo ahead and send it to everybody.\n\n71\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.260\nYou can do envelopes and labels.\n\n72\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.470\nWe're just gonna concentrate\non letters in this episode.\n\n73\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.840\nThe next episode we're gonna\ndo the envelopes and labels.\n\n74\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.607\nIt's not a part two, it's actually named\nenvelopes and labels, so check that,\n\n75\n00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:28.746\nI think it's labels and\nenvelopes actually.\n\n76\n00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n77\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.743\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Envelopes.\n\n78\n00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:31.382\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.\n\n79\n00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:31.893\n&gt;&gt; What she said.\n\n80\n00:03:31.893 --> 00:03:32.635\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n81\n00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:38.110\nthose are the different things that\nyou can use mail merge to create.\n\n82\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.400\nNow the thing you have to know about\nin this process is that you're going\n\n83\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.010\nto end up with different types\nof documents, your end results.\n\n84\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.420\nYou're going to have your main document,\nthe one that you're gonna start with.\n\n85\n00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.490\nYou're gonna have your mailing list.\n\n86\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.940\nI'm going to be referring\nto this as data source.\n\n87\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.710\nI think it's in there somewhere,\nbut that's just how I remember.\n\n88\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.385\nIt's like where is the source of my data.\n\n89\n00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:07.600\nAnd you take that and\nmerge it into your document.\n\n90\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.246\nAnd this is kind of like your steps,\nbut there's a very\n\n91\n00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:15.941\nimportant step that everybody seems\nto miss when they do a mail merge.\n\n92\n00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:19.820\nI've been doing this for a long time.\n\n93\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.864\nAnd that last one that's kind\nof the that everyone misses.\n\n94\n00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:25.860\nAnd they're like, now it makes sense.\n\n95\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.570\nWe're gonna concentrate on that.\n\n96\n00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.850\nSo, these are just some nice little\nhelp files to get you ready.\n\n97\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.955\nSo, let's kind of look at\nthese different pieces.\n\n98\n00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:39.210\nOkay, so I'm going to switch on over, and\n\n99\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.440\nI just realized I am doing\nthe wrong keyboard shortcuts.\n\n100\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.430\nI need to come down here and\ndo my ALT tab.\n\n101\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.050\nI was doing that,\n\n102\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.850\nsince I'm on my MAC, I was doing\ncommand tab and that goes too high.\n\n103\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.419\nI'm in my virt machine,\n\n104\n00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.770\ngo do that alt tab like I am on\na Windows operating system because I am.\n\n105\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.148\n&gt;&gt; Also works on Linux.\n\n106\n00:04:57.148 --> 00:04:57.838\n&gt;&gt; Does it?\n\n107\n00:04:57.838 --> 00:04:58.525\nLook at that, okay.\n\n108\n00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:01.699\nHe is the Linux man over here so\nI'll just trust him,\n\n109\n00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.385\n[LAUGH] which is really\nscary to trust you.\n\n110\n00:05:04.385 --> 00:05:05.202\nSo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:05:05.202 --> 00:05:05.716\n&gt;&gt; You should,\n\n112\n00:05:05.716 --> 00:05:07.503\nin this email I'm gonna\nsend you real quick.\n\n113\n00:05:07.503 --> 00:05:08.168\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n114\n00:05:08.168 --> 00:05:10.710\n&gt;&gt; If it prompts you for\nanything just say yes [LAUGH].\n\n115\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.994\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\nAll right,\n\n116\n00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:15.045\nto talk about those status sources.\n\n117\n00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:16.905\nWe've gotta get him off security,\n\n118\n00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:20.691\nbecause we'll somehow be infected\nwith viruses by this thing.\n\n119\n00:05:20.691 --> 00:05:21.820\nThat sounds really bad.\n\n120\n00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.950\nOkay, anyways.\n\n121\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.190\n&gt;&gt; Like the contagion [LAUGH].\n\n122\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.926\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we digress yet again.\n\n123\n00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.460\nSo here's our datasource [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.490\nSo this is our Excel file because that's\nthe type of datasource that we're gonna\n\n125\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.020\nbe using this episode.\n\n126\n00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.530\nThere is others if you can use,\n\n127\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.380\nlike your Outlook contacts that's get\na little nuances, so we're gonna just kind\n\n128\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.270\nof focus on the one that I think is\nthe most popular, which would be Excel.\n\n129\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.890\nSo you could see that I have my rows and\ncolumns, and I have like a first name,\n\n130\n00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.390\nlast name, phone numbers, addresses,\nalso important to know right here headers,\n\n131\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.579\nyou need to have a header\nrow in your data source.\n\n132\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.930\nNow this is Just like it, so\nit's in a tabular format.\n\n133\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.541\nSo like I said with those\noutlook contacts or\n\n134\n00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:07.517\neven you could have a word\nfile that's in a table.\n\n135\n00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:12.852\nIt has to be in some type of tabular\nformat like a database that has records\n\n136\n00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:18.274\nand columns so it understand that this\nwhat the information looks like and\n\n137\n00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:23.695\nit's gonna be able to pull from those\ncolumns and each one of these records\n\n138\n00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:29.574\nis gonna go ahead and put in that variable\ninformation into your merged letter.\n\n139\n00:06:29.574 --> 00:06:31.420\nYou're like, okay.\n\n140\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.970\nWe'll get there.\n\n141\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.415\n&gt;&gt; It'll make sense in a minute.\n\n142\n00:06:33.415 --> 00:06:35.592\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all gonna come around so\n\n143\n00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:36.240\nbear with us.\n\n144\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.137\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just getting the vocabulary.\n\n145\n00:06:38.137 --> 00:06:40.310\nWe always like to go ahead and get there.\n\n146\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.370\nSo let's just jump down into word.\n\n147\n00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.100\nThis is going to be my main document.\n\n148\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.190\nThis is the place where\nI'm going to start.\n\n149\n00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.160\nThis is where we have all that\nyou can call static information,\n\n150\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.360\nthe dear, whoever,\nthat's the variable, that name.\n\n151\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.258\nI want it to say, hey,\ndear Bishop Timothy.\n\n152\n00:06:59.258 --> 00:07:01.520\nDear Flago Pants.\n\n153\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.080\nI forgot which name I'm using for\nmy cats, so on and so forth.\n\n154\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.216\nSo that's where you're gonna, whoops,\nwrong shorcut again guys [LAUGH].\n\n155\n00:07:08.216 --> 00:07:10.111\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can tell I've been working on\n\n156\n00:07:10.111 --> 00:07:11.560\nmy Mac a little bit more lately.\n\n157\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.150\nSo this is where we have our\nvariable information that goes\n\n158\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.350\ninto this particular letter.\n\n159\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.910\nAnd then thank you for your interest,\nyou're a resident of state.\n\n160\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.950\nThen whatever state Bishop is in,\nput the state.\n\n161\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.460\nAnd that's how it works.\n\n162\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.871\nSo this is where we're going to be\nstarting in our mail merge process.\n\n163\n00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:34.560\nWell, where is that within Word?\n\n164\n00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.540\nHow do we get started and actually perform\nthis mail merge now that we have kind of\n\n165\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.390\na very base concept of how this works?\n\n166\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.610\nWhat tab do you think we’re\ngoing to do on the Ruben?\n\n167\n00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.080\nYeah, it’s mailings, okay.\n\n168\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.069\nSo in the mailings tab, we have all the\ndifferent things that we’re going to need\n\n169\n00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.956\nand all the buttons that we\nneed to perform our mail merge.\n\n170\n00:07:52.956 --> 00:07:57.997\nNow I actually, I have the steps\nwritten out in the episode notes,\n\n171\n00:07:57.997 --> 00:08:00.618\nso definitely take a look at that.\n\n172\n00:08:00.618 --> 00:08:05.316\nBut the cool things is, in the PC\nversion of Word, as opposed to say,\n\n173\n00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:09.852\nthe Mac version I think, the cool\nthing when you want to start a mail\n\n174\n00:08:09.852 --> 00:08:14.155\nmerge is that it gives you this\nreally cool step by step wizard.\n\n175\n00:08:14.155 --> 00:08:19.079\nIt's gonna walk you through all of\nthe pieces, which I've always found so\n\n176\n00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:22.297\nhelpful when explaining\nmail merges to people.\n\n177\n00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:25.880\nI'm like, just follow the wizard,\nread everything, and then move along.\n\n178\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.190\nOnce you do this quite a few times,\nit becomes old hat.\n\n179\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.677\nYou don't have to use a wizard,\n\n180\n00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.551\ncuz all the things that you need\nto do are up here on the wizard.\n\n181\n00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:37.013\nThe ribbon just depends on\nwhich place you wanna go.\n\n182\n00:08:37.013 --> 00:08:41.684\nSo since we are going to demonstrate\nthis first mail merge with a letter,\n\n183\n00:08:41.684 --> 00:08:46.891\nwhy don't we go ahead and jump into this\nstep by step wizard, and it's gonna give\n\n184\n00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:51.820\nme the same information or choices here,\nover there on the right hand side.\n\n185\n00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.070\nSo I'm gonna click this.\n\n186\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.422\nIt brings up, on the right hand side,\nyour task pane, where it says, hey,\n\n187\n00:08:57.422 --> 00:09:01.910\nall right, there are six steps that we\nthink you need to do in this process, and\n\n188\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.319\nthis is the first one of like,\nwhere are you going to start?\n\n189\n00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:08.400\nWhat are you going to be performing here?\n\n190\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.140\nAre you gonna be doing letters, envelopes,\nmail, no we're gonna be doing letters,\n\n191\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.290\ncuz we've already said that.\n\n192\n00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.950\nCool, so let's go ahead and\nclick onto the next step.\n\n193\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.830\nThe next one is, how do you want to take\nthis start document, what do you wanna do?\n\n194\n00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.750\nNotice it says, Use the current document,\nStart from template,\n\n195\n00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.840\nStart from existing document.\n\n196\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.743\nI would say, most times out of most,\nmost times out of most,\n\n197\n00:09:33.743 --> 00:09:37.317\nwow, I was trying to do 9 times out of 10.\n\n198\n00:09:37.317 --> 00:09:38.029\n[LAUGH] Most times.\n\n199\n00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:39.668\n&gt;&gt; Most came out of your mouth.\n\n200\n00:09:39.668 --> 00:09:42.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Most times out of ten.\n\n201\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.321\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was gonna say.\n\n202\n00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.354\n&gt;&gt; So somewhere between,\nyou know, six and nine.\n\n203\n00:09:46.354 --> 00:09:48.697\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n204\n00:09:48.697 --> 00:09:50.038\nThis brain in here.\n\n205\n00:09:50.038 --> 00:09:50.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n206\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.425\n&gt;&gt; We wanna start with\nthe current document, okay?\n\n207\n00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.589\nSo this is my letter,\nyou've already composed it.\n\n208\n00:09:55.589 --> 00:09:57.273\nAll the static information.\n\n209\n00:09:57.273 --> 00:10:00.213\nSo, this step right here,\nyeah, this is what I want.\n\n210\n00:10:00.213 --> 00:10:01.007\nI'm good to go.\n\n211\n00:10:01.007 --> 00:10:02.990\nSo, we're gonna go onto the next step.\n\n212\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.482\nSo we're gonna come down on here, and\nstep three is select the recipients.\n\n213\n00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:12.734\nThis is where we need to go out and tell\nit, hey, that data source, that's what I\n\n214\n00:10:12.734 --> 00:10:18.249\nwant to bring into as the recipients that\nI'm going to be addressing this letter to.\n\n215\n00:10:18.249 --> 00:10:21.911\nSo right here where it says,\nuse an existing file,\n\n216\n00:10:21.911 --> 00:10:25.620\nwe're just gonna go out and\nbrowse to that file.\n\n217\n00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.280\nSounds good.\n\n218\n00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.645\nBut also notice right here, it says you\ncould go to your Outlook context, and\n\n219\n00:10:30.645 --> 00:10:35.175\nyou could type a new list, but\nkind of defeats the purpose of being able\n\n220\n00:10:35.175 --> 00:10:40.165\nto have that automation of here's all the\ninformation, here it is, drop it in there.\n\n221\n00:10:40.165 --> 00:10:41.394\nSo we're gonna browse out to that.\n\n222\n00:10:41.394 --> 00:10:45.752\nWe're gonna find that file that I\nhave out here on my desktop, and\n\n223\n00:10:45.752 --> 00:10:47.395\nthere is my Excel file.\n\n224\n00:10:47.395 --> 00:10:49.190\nWe're gonna open this.\n\n225\n00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.155\nIf I had multiple worksheets in this file,\nI should go ahead and choose this one.\n\n226\n00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:58.606\nI [LAUGH] name sheet two,\nthat's not very descriptive.\n\n227\n00:10:58.606 --> 00:11:01.556\n[LAUGH] I'm having some trouble there.\n\n228\n00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:02.182\n&gt;&gt; Appropriately?\n\n229\n00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:04.210\n&gt;&gt; Appropriately?\n\n230\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.007\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Doing good.\n\n231\n00:11:07.007 --> 00:11:10.170\nSo, I have yeah, sheet two, descriptive.\n\n232\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.089\nThat sounds great.\n\n233\n00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:14.845\nSo, these are all of the entries\nthat I have here in my list.\n\n234\n00:11:14.845 --> 00:11:17.470\nI could filter it if I\nwanted to at this point.\n\n235\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.346\nLike, I only want the state of California,\nor the state of Florida, we're gonna skip\n\n236\n00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:25.239\nover that for right now, because we really\njust want everything that's in this list.\n\n237\n00:11:25.239 --> 00:11:28.292\nWe click okay, and you're like,\nwell what happened?\n\n238\n00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:30.430\nIt just designated that right here.\n\n239\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.312\nYou can see that this is going to be\nthe data source for our recipients.\n\n240\n00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:36.360\nSo, we're done with step three.\n\n241\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.930\nWhy don't we move on down here?\n\n242\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.520\nNow we're going to write our letter.\n\n243\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.530\nThis is where you're going\nto take those fields and\n\n244\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.989\nthen match them into where you need to go.\n\n245\n00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:51.876\nYou can choose some parts that are,\nthey're like pre-made ones,\n\n246\n00:11:51.876 --> 00:11:53.608\nlike an address block.\n\n247\n00:11:53.608 --> 00:11:58.298\nThat's usually gonna be what, first,\nlast, address, city, state, zip, and\n\n248\n00:11:58.298 --> 00:11:59.578\nit has it all built in.\n\n249\n00:11:59.578 --> 00:12:01.420\nYou could do a greeting line.\n\n250\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.318\nDear, so on and so forth.\n\n251\n00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:04.133\nThat's fine.\n\n252\n00:12:04.133 --> 00:12:09.238\nNo problem with that, or\nif you wanted to pick which ones you want,\n\n253\n00:12:09.238 --> 00:12:11.750\nyou can go into the more items.\n\n254\n00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.690\nI will say that this step,\nat the point where I'm going to be writing\n\n255\n00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.710\nout my letter, this dropdown,\nright up here in the ribbon where it says\n\n256\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.730\ninsert merge fields, this is\nsometimes a little easier honestly.\n\n257\n00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.034\nIf you click the dropdown,\nnot the button at the top,\n\n258\n00:12:29.034 --> 00:12:33.071\ndon't click that one, I mean you can,\nbut you see how it drops and\n\n259\n00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:37.356\nit shows me all of the different\nheaders in this Excel file, cool.\n\n260\n00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:40.581\nSo it's pulling all of that, so\nthat's why headers are so very important.\n\n261\n00:12:40.581 --> 00:12:44.427\nI'm gonna close this Excel file for right\nnow, cuz we really don't need to have it\n\n262\n00:12:44.427 --> 00:12:48.233\nopen, and if you drop this down, this is\nwhere you can pick where they come from.\n\n263\n00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:52.253\nIf you click the button at the top,\nit brings up this little dialog box,\n\n264\n00:12:52.253 --> 00:12:56.809\nwhich is the same, by the way, if you come\nover here to the right where it says more\n\n265\n00:12:56.809 --> 00:13:00.630\nitems, it brings this same box with hey,\nhere are the fields.\n\n266\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.492\nWhere do you want to put them?\n\n267\n00:13:02.492 --> 00:13:07.067\nAll right it's again, it's easier from the\ndropdown, because here you have to click,\n\n268\n00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:11.520\ninsert, cancel, then do your typing, then\nopen the box up, click insert, cancel,\n\n269\n00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.980\nit's just not as fluid\nin my personal opinion.\n\n270\n00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.755\n&gt;&gt; Too clunky.\n&gt;&gt; It is a little clunky.\n\n271\n00:13:15.755 --> 00:13:19.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So how am I gonna put these fields into\n\n272\n00:13:19.045 --> 00:13:20.227\nmy document?\n\n273\n00:13:20.227 --> 00:13:22.726\nNow I, when I wrote this,\nI kept this here as a placeholder for\n\n274\n00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:25.243\nmyself to know like this is where\nyou're gonna put your name.\n\n275\n00:13:25.243 --> 00:13:29.120\nSo I'm gonna just delete that right now,\nand I'm gonna say dear space, and\n\n276\n00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.650\nI'm gonna zoom in on this just so\nyou can see this a little bit closer.\n\n277\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.880\nNow, this is where I would type in a name.\n\n278\n00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.160\nWell no, I want that variable data.\n\n279\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.812\nI want the field to go in here.\n\n280\n00:13:39.812 --> 00:13:43.754\nSo you always need to make sure you put\nyour cursor where you want to write\n\n281\n00:13:43.754 --> 00:13:44.881\nthat information.\n\n282\n00:13:44.881 --> 00:13:48.520\nI'm coming up to the dropdown,\nand I'm just gonna choose first.\n\n283\n00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.851\n&gt;&gt; Now, quick question, these data fields\nthat you're getting from the dropdown,\n\n284\n00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:53.337\nis that coming from the data source?\n\n285\n00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:55.580\nIs that the column names basically?\n\n286\n00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah, that's when we, yeah.\n\n287\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.396\n&gt;&gt; I'm following along,\nI can follow all the bouncing balls.\n\n288\n00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.965\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We also pulled up the Excel\n\n289\n00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.773\nfile, and I said that a little bit ago.\n\n290\n00:14:02.773 --> 00:14:03.278\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n291\n00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:06.091\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] you're just\nreiterating that point, aren't you?\n\n292\n00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:09.540\n&gt;&gt; I am, I am,\nplus I was looking up the word adverb.\n\n293\n00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.795\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're looking up,\n\n294\n00:14:11.795 --> 00:14:13.845\nhow am I going to-\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, yeah.\n\n295\n00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:15.206\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Decipher Vonne's words and\n\n296\n00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:16.992\nbe able to give the words that she needs.\n\n297\n00:14:16.992 --> 00:14:18.721\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, this is how I\ncontribute to the show Vonne.\n\n298\n00:14:18.721 --> 00:14:20.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\nthat's why I like to work with you.\n\n299\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.899\nSo, [LAUGH] you keep me in check.\n\n300\n00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:24.149\nYeah, so you're exactly right.\n\n301\n00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:28.064\nRight from those headers it's gonna pull\nit, and it is nice that you did point that\n\n302\n00:14:28.064 --> 00:14:32.170\nout because, do you see how one, it says\naddress then there's an underscore there?\n\n303\n00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Why is that happening?\n\n304\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.769\nThis is another thing with your\ndatasource, and when you're doing things\n\n305\n00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:42.939\nin Excel, try not to at all times,\nor at all costs, to not put a space.\n\n306\n00:14:42.939 --> 00:14:48.159\nI typed in address space, and so\nit's pulling that space that it sees,\n\n307\n00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:52.074\nthat white space,\nin from how I typed it in Excel, and\n\n308\n00:14:52.074 --> 00:14:55.902\nthat's why it's giving me the underscore,\nokay?\n\n309\n00:14:55.902 --> 00:14:58.830\nAnd you'll see it when we go\nthrough some other examples like,\n\n310\n00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.500\nit's how it's actually written.\n\n311\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.201\nHere, let's go here.\n\n312\n00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:05.806\nLet's go here, and bring up that desktop.\n\n313\n00:15:05.806 --> 00:15:09.940\nSo, I can see Daniel has\nan inquisitive look right there.\n\n314\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.870\n&gt;&gt; I'm taking it in.\n\n315\n00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.126\nI'm soaking this up.\n\n316\n00:15:12.126 --> 00:15:15.118\nMy screen is over here\nthat's why I'm looking off.\n\n317\n00:15:15.118 --> 00:15:15.647\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n318\n00:15:15.647 --> 00:15:16.732\nit's like where are they looking?\n\n319\n00:15:16.732 --> 00:15:19.533\n&gt;&gt; He's really like staring\noff into [LAUGH] wonderment.\n\n320\n00:15:19.533 --> 00:15:20.824\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n321\n00:15:20.824 --> 00:15:22.660\n&gt;&gt; No, the screen is that way.\n\n322\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.574\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So right here,\n\n323\n00:15:24.574 --> 00:15:28.116\nif I put my cursor in here,\naddress see, right there,\n\n324\n00:15:28.116 --> 00:15:30.010\nyou see-\n&gt;&gt; So you get a white space character.\n\n325\n00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly, and\nthat's why it's doing that underscore.\n\n326\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.177\n&gt;&gt; So in the dropdown, it interprets white\nspace characters as an underscore so\n\n327\n00:15:36.177 --> 00:15:37.530\nthat you know that it's there.\n\n328\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.658\n&gt;&gt; For the headers.\n\n329\n00:15:38.658 --> 00:15:39.344\n&gt;&gt; For the headers.\n\n330\n00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:41.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where there's-\n&gt;&gt; And the headers only.\n\n331\n00:15:41.528 --> 00:15:43.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's where that little oops.\n\n332\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.660\n&gt;&gt; What other thing would be there?\n\n333\n00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.370\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n334\n00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.892\n&gt;&gt; That would not get\nwhite space interpreted?\n\n335\n00:15:47.892 --> 00:15:51.023\n&gt;&gt; Well, Hold on.\n\n336\n00:15:51.023 --> 00:15:54.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What's gonna happen is say,\n\n337\n00:15:54.383 --> 00:15:59.022\nif I have this, if I have pumpkin, and\nthere's a space, I hit a space, and\n\n338\n00:15:59.022 --> 00:16:02.042\nI have it entered in as\nthe data in my data source,\n\n339\n00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:04.800\nThink about when I'm writing this letter.\n\n340\n00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.440\nIf I'm doing, okay here's first, space.\n\n341\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then I insert their last name.\n\n342\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.640\nI only want one space between first and\nlast name.\n\n343\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.460\nWell the data source has a space, so\nit's gonna be like first, space, space.\n\n344\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.430\nAnd I'm going to give that\nextra information into\n\n345\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.300\nthe finished merge that\nI don't want to have.\n\n346\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:33.531\n&gt;&gt; So the insert merge field button only\ngets data from the column name header?\n\n347\n00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:34.257\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n348\n00:16:34.257 --> 00:16:36.520\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] right, yeah?\n\n349\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I hope I'm using\n\n350\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.220\nthe right terminology here.\n\n351\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not great on that.\n\n352\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe last it's pulling right from here.\n\n353\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.630\nIt's pulling from there.\n\n354\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.150\nSo there is no other object\nthat could go in that field?\n\n355\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.220\n&gt;&gt; It has to go in the last.\n\n356\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.140\nSo that what, maybe?\n\n357\n00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:51.730\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n358\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.420\n&gt;&gt; No. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; You got first, last,\ndept, phone number, address, cities,\n\n359\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.790\nstate, zip\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n360\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n361\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.510\n&gt;&gt; You clicked the button that says,\n\n362\n00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.510\nif you'll take me back to-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n363\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.080\n&gt;&gt; To there?\n\n364\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.310\nNo.\nHere.\n\n365\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.480\nPerfect.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n366\n00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.740\n&gt;&gt; Insert merge field.\n\n367\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It will only pull these objects\n\n368\n00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.730\nfrom that area, nowhere else.\n\n369\n00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.680\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n370\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.390\n&gt;&gt; So.\n\n371\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.050\n&gt;&gt; I see what you're talking about.\n\n372\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:12.740\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter.\n\n373\n00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Other places.\n\n374\n00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.955\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about-\n&gt;&gt; It always does this.\n\n375\n00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:17.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n376\n00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.140\n&gt;&gt; Because it only pulls from that spot.\n\n377\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.180\n&gt;&gt; It will only pull\nfrom your header rows.\n\n378\n00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:21.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n379\n00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:22.630\n&gt;&gt; See?\n\n380\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.660\nCircular.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n381\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.520\n&gt;&gt; We'll come back around.\n\n382\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.311\n&gt;&gt; We do this dance.\n\n383\n00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:27.013\n[LAUGH] It's so much fun.\n\n384\n00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:29.825\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean,\nI think that's a good point of like.\n\n385\n00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:33.280\nAnd, how important it is\nto have that header row.\n\n386\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.250\nAnd you can't have it in\nall these different places.\n\n387\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:39.290\nIt also has to have one\ncontiguous range of information-\n\n388\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.060\n&gt;&gt; You gotta remember Von, hacker.\n\n389\n00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.850\nI'm thinking how can I break this.\n\n390\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like the way you think.\n\n391\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.870\n&gt;&gt; So, that's how I think.\n\n392\n00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.610\n&gt;&gt; And you are bringing up\nreally great points about,\n\n393\n00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:53.060\nit has to be one table, you know,\none whole contiguous range.\n\n394\n00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.560\nIt has to have very specific headers and\n\n395\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.160\nyou can't have them all floating\naroud in there and like.\n\n396\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, something else seems to\nbe down lower in another row and\n\n397\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.520\nbreaking the information.\n\n398\n00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.000\nNo, one single header row.\n\n399\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.020\nThat's the only thing\nit's gonna pull from,\n\n400\n00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.670\nbecause that's the database\nquality of what it's looking for.\n\n401\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, I'm following.\n\n402\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.600\nHopefully, you are as well.\n\n403\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.350\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n404\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.914\n&gt;&gt; It does makes sense, yes, thank you.\n\n405\n00:18:15.914 --> 00:18:17.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n406\n00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.750\nAwesome, and so\nnow that we have all of this.\n\n407\n00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.240\nIt will go ahead and\npull that variable information from here.\n\n408\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.410\nAnd, great point right here,\nwhy don't we go ahead and illustrate this.\n\n409\n00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.110\nLike I have composed my letter.\n\n410\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.700\nI said I want my first name and\nthen my last name.\n\n411\n00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.720\nAnd the next step would be, and\nyou can see down here behind\n\n412\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.830\nmy head we have step four of six, and\nthe next would be Preview Your Letters.\n\n413\n00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:43.210\nAnd now it's just going in and actually\nclicked right up here on the ribbon.\n\n414\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.140\nIt just turned on the preview results.\n\n415\n00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.630\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n&gt;&gt; So it's saying all right,\n\n416\n00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.520\nwell let me pull up Bishop Timothy.\n\n417\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.210\nWhy is that?\n\n418\n00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.600\nBecause Bishop Timothy is our first\nrecord within our data source.\n\n419\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.850\nLet's jump back over here.\n\n420\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.710\nWell, did it pull the rest of them?\n\n421\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:58.720\nUp here on the ribbon.\n\n422\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.930\nYou see these little buttons\nthat go backwards and forwards?\n\n423\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.400\nIf you just start clicking through,\nit's going to go through and tell me.\n\n424\n00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.150\nWell, it will in a minute.\n\n425\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.100\nWhy don't we go ahead and\nPreview that one more time.\n\n426\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.770\nAnd it's gonna go through and.\n\n427\n00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.050\nNow it's not working.\n\n428\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.250\nWhy is it not working?\n\n429\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.592\n&gt;&gt; Do absolutely nothing.\n\n430\n00:19:17.592 --> 00:19:18.106\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n431\n00:19:18.106 --> 00:19:18.916\nLet's go ahead and do this.\n\n432\n00:19:18.916 --> 00:19:19.467\nLet's close this.\n\n433\n00:19:19.467 --> 00:19:22.886\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Let's see, yeah,\ndo that, do exactly that.\n\n434\n00:19:22.886 --> 00:19:26.311\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was wondering for\nsome reason if I had it open and\n\n435\n00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:29.490\nit was in the middle of being changed\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.\n\n436\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.480\nIt almost looks like it's not\nreceiving the data from the data\n\n437\n00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.570\nsource or something.\n\n438\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.330\nIt's just not giving you\nany more information.\n\n439\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.580\n&gt;&gt; That's a very good insight.\n\n440\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.225\nYou know, and that is\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n\n441\n00:19:39.225 --> 00:19:40.203\n&gt;&gt; It's quite possible that\n\n442\n00:19:40.203 --> 00:19:41.141\nthat's what happened.\n\n443\n00:19:41.141 --> 00:19:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n444\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.140\n&gt;&gt; And this is also something\nthat's a good point to make,\n\n445\n00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.930\nis that while I have these\nsteps that I'm following.\n\n446\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.240\nYou can go back to any one of those steps.\n\n447\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.610\nIt's not like, gosh,\nwe've already passed step number two.\n\n448\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.430\nWe can never go back to it.\n\n449\n00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.470\nYou totally can.\n\n450\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.720\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n451\n00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.910\nWhy don't we come back down into here.\n\n452\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.210\nI'm just gonna go up to the ribbon and\ndo this.\n\n453\n00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.870\nBecause, yes, we've been using the wizard.\n\n454\n00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I set all the buttons right here.\n\n455\n00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.430\nSo why don't we try to connect\nto that data source again and\n\n456\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.360\nsee if that's going to do it.\n\n457\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.820\nSo I'm just gonna back over here,\nget the departments.\n\n458\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.630\nYes I want the second worksheet.\n\n459\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.090\nAll right, so let me go ahead and\n\n460\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.070\nmy preview's already on and\nwhoa and look at that.\n\n461\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.930\n&gt;&gt; Now you have access.\n\n462\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.500\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n463\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.130\nYeah, so that's a great,\nI'm glad you made that observation.\n\n464\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.140\nYes\n&gt;&gt; It's, at any time I can go back and\n\n465\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:33.870\nchange something.\n\n466\n00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.032\n&gt;&gt; That makes up for the thing I did\nbefore where I wasn't paying attention.\n\n467\n00:20:38.032 --> 00:20:38.544\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n468\n00:20:38.544 --> 00:20:40.550\n&gt;&gt; See how I did that?\n\n469\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.670\n&gt;&gt; But it came around where we\nwere able to explain it so.\n\n470\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.460\nGood job, but yes,\nthat's exactly what happened.\n\n471\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:52.660\nAnd the nice thing is with the preview,\nif I turn the preview on or\n\n472\n00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.160\noff, I can come back and say hey,\nalright, let me go ahead and format it.\n\n473\n00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.380\nOr what if I got the wrong Excel file,\nright?\n\n474\n00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.220\nI have another Excel file, has the same\nheaders, that's another important thing,\n\n475\n00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.250\nbut I chose the wrong one,\njust pull that in.\n\n476\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.020\nIt's coming back around to thinking about,\n\n477\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.090\nhey, I'm gonna go ahead and\nmake this list.\n\n478\n00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.970\nAnd this is gonna be my mailing\nthat I'm going to do, or\n\n479\n00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.480\nmy letters that I'm going to create for,\nsay, the first quarter.\n\n480\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.050\nBut then the second quarter I'm\ngonna have a different worksheet and\n\n481\n00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:21.650\na different file.\n\n482\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.510\nWell, you just come back to the same\nfile that you've already going to\n\n483\n00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.910\nhave done with all the merged fields,\nyou just need a different data source.\n\n484\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.420\nSo you can go back and\nforth in your different steps.\n\n485\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.330\nSo if I turned off the preview, maybe for\n\n486\n00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.530\nsome reason I wanna make this bold,\nmaybe I wanna go ahead and center it.\n\n487\n00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:45.200\nYou treat your fields just like text,\ncuz it is.\n\n488\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.940\n&gt;&gt; Basically.\n\n489\n00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just gotta pull\nfrom that variable information.\n\n490\n00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.820\nThen what about here?\n\n491\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.590\nWhat if I needed to write more?\n\n492\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.100\nBecause we're having a sale for\n\n493\n00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.400\nthe residents of, I'm just gonna delete\nthat for fun, hit the space bar.\n\n494\n00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.600\nLet's go back over to Mailings.\n\n495\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.840\nAnd I'm going to insert the,\nlet's do City.\n\n496\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.944\nWe'll go City, and then we will do a comma\nand then a space and then the state.\n\n497\n00:22:08.944 --> 00:22:10.860\nSo pull that in.\n\n498\n00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.400\nCool let's see if it works.\n\n499\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.970\nCome back here to preview,\nrun through this, looks like it's working.\n\n500\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.990\nOkay, perfect,\nI think that is working just great.\n\n501\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:28.590\nLovely, so this is where I'm\ndone with my merged document.\n\n502\n00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.260\nThis is where I would suggest, remember,\n\n503\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.080\nwe had our start file,\nour Christmas Cats mail merge.\n\n504\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.680\nI'm going to do a Save As.\n\n505\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:44.060\nAnd I'm going to name this Christmas\nCats Mail Merge Merged, wow, really?\n\n506\n00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.530\nBut this is how I start to\nkinda do my naming conventions.\n\n507\n00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.070\nI have my letter.\n\n508\n00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.940\nI always name that\nsomething something start.\n\n509\n00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.420\nGo ahead and connect it to a data source,\nput in the fields, the merged fields and\n\n510\n00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.970\nthen I say merged.\n\n511\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.060\nThen I save this.\n\n512\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.340\nThis is the part that always\ngets people tripped up.\n\n513\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.880\nOkay, I'm done, right.\n\n514\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.860\nRight?\n\n515\n00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.620\nWell, kind of.\n\n516\n00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.010\nBack down here in this wizard,\nit says next, complete the merge.\n\n517\n00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.120\nNow, it just says, it’s right here,\nyou think I’ll just go ahead and print it,\n\n518\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.540\nwhich you’re totally capable of doing.\n\n519\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.680\nSo this is a printer.\n\n520\n00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.980\nAnd it’s going to print the 19 records,\nthe 19 individual pages,\n\n521\n00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.350\nbecause right now there\nis one single page, okay?\n\n522\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.820\nBut I have multiple variable\ninformation in here.\n\n523\n00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.550\nSo what about the file,\nor like the final step?\n\n524\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.650\nIt's right here,\nedit the individual letters.\n\n525\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.410\nWhen I click this one, this is going to,\n\n526\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.180\nI'm gonna click it,\nmerge everything together.\n\n527\n00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.900\nOkay, take everything from\nthat data source, click okay.\n\n528\n00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.470\nBrings you to a brand new file.\n\n529\n00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.360\nHere's letters one.\n\n530\n00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.120\nSo, see notice it's separate from\nthat Christmas Cat Merge Merged.\n\n531\n00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.190\nAnd then once I go into here,\nlook down here.\n\n532\n00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:04.660\nThat's where I have all my\nindividual pages for the merge.\n\n533\n00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.190\nThis is the part that\npeople always forget about.\n\n534\n00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.410\nAnd so maybe, for example,\non this Pooma Princess,\n\n535\n00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.790\nwe realize, you know what it's just one o,\nactually two o's?\n\n536\n00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.780\nOr maybe it was actually p u.\n\n537\n00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.590\nRight, yeah.\n\n538\n00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:23.330\nSo I can come in here and change just\nthis one letter, and then go ahead.\n\n539\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:28.690\nAnd this is the file that I would\ndo a file, save as, and name this.\n\n540\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.390\nWe'll put this on our desktop.\n\n541\n00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:34.310\nAnd we'll name this\nChristmas Cats Finished.\n\n542\n00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.760\nSo that way, I know.\n\n543\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.984\nWell, let's see if I can spell is this.\n\n544\n00:24:37.984 --> 00:24:39.200\n[LAUGH] Finished.\nThere we go.\n\n545\n00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:46.080\nThat I am done with this and\nI have my three different files in here.\n\n546\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.670\nSo I'm gona close this and\nI'm gonna close this.\n\n547\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.160\nI'll save the

00:25:00.840\nThis is the one that's connected to the\ndata source and has it all spelled out,\n\n551\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.130\nif you want to say, and\nthen this is the finished result.\n\n552\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.800\nThis is my 19 individual\npages of a Word document.\n\n553\n00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.900\nAnd that's that final stuff\nthat everybody forgets.\n\n554\n00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.240\nAnd that's what it's kind\nof showing right here.\n\n555\n00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.310\nYour main document.\n\n556\n00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.790\nYou're gonna have your [INAUDIBLE] and\nthat's your merge document.\n\n557\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.570\nI really think they need\na fourth one right there of like\n\n558\n00:25:20.570

--> 00:25:29.580\nindividual content.\n\n561\n00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.920\nSo that's how you can\nperform a mail merge.\n\n562\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.488\nWe talked all about it\nwith a single letter,\n\n563\n00:25:36.488 --> 00:25:40.260\nthe explanation of the concept,\nhow to actually do it.\n\n564\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.690\nNext episode we're going to get into\na little bit more of that with doing\n\n565\n00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.880\nour mailing labels because we have that\nsame data source why don't we go ahead and\n\n566\n00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.130\nmake those little labels\nwe can put on an envelope.\n\n567\n00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.790\nOr you know what why don't we\nput that right on the envelope.\n\n568\n00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.720\nWe can do that
