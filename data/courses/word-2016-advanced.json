00:00:14.968\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and I will be\nyour host for this this course overview.\n\n4\n00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:18.140\nAnd what we're going to be covering\nin this course overview is, well,\n\n5\n00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.760\nexactly what we're gonna be talking\nabout throughout these episodes.\n\n6\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.150\nWho is this target audience?\n\n7\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.969\nWho should be the ones that are watching\nthese shows in this series?\n\n8\n00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.666\nAnd do I need to know anything\nbefore we get started?\n\n9\n00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:33.870\nAnd any extra tidbits that I might have\nfor you as we go through everything.\n\n10\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.080\nThis series is broken up\ninto two main sections,\n\n11\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.430\nwe have our graphical elements and\nwe have automation.\n\n12\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.110\nIn our graphical elements section,\n\n13\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.690\nwe're going to be going over how to\ninsert images in to our Word document.\n\n14\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.210\nWe'll also be covering shapes and\nSmartArt.\n\n15\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.247\nWe'll also be creating and\ninserting tables and charts.\n\n16\n00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:58.297\nFor all of these different graphical\nobjects, we'll be learning how to format\n\n17\n00:00:58.297 --> 00:01:02.662\nthem, make them really pretty, maybe\nthrow some pink in there and some purple.\n\n18\n00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.960\nWe'll also talk about how\nto actually position and\n\n19\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.090\nword warp these in our document.\n\n20\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.889\nSo we know exactly where we want to\nhave them placed in relationship to\n\n21\n00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.471\nthe words on the page.\n\n22\n00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:18.149\nIn the automation section, we're gonna\nbe talking about creating templates.\n\n23\n00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.257\nAnd exactly what is a template, which I\nfeel is a misconstrued word sometimes if\n\n24\n00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:28.890\nwe're talking about the technical, correct\nway of using a template within Word.\n\n25\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410\nSo definitely stay tuned for\n\n26\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.055\nthat episode, so we can know that\nthe right way to be using it.\n\n27\n00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:39.310\nWe're also be talking about adding quick\nparts, and how the building blocks within\n\n28\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.462\nword can be really hardy to make\nus a more efficient user of Word.\n\n29\n00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:46.940\nWe're also gonna be reporting macros,\nall those steps that you have to do\n\n30\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.230\nall the time, record a macro, hit the play\nbutton and make your life a lot easier.\n\n31\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.660\nWe'll also be inserting linked objects\nin from Excel into our Word documents\n\n32\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.730\nto be able to pull that information and\ngenerate the content automatically.\n\n33\n00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.345\nAnd the all important mail merge,\nwhich is a lot of fun, and once you have\n\n34\n00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:09.900\nfigured out how to do those step by\nsteps it becomes a lot easier for you.\n\n35\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.230\nThe target audience,\n\n36\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.390\nany Office user would be the perfect\nperson to watch these episodes.\n\n37\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.050\nNow, when I say Office,\n\n38\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.000\nnotice that here it is capitalized\nmeaning that Office as Microsoft Office.\n\n39\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.192\nYou use Word on a daily basis\nto create documents for\n\n40\n00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:29.712\nanything that you use in your office work.\n\n41\n00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:34.694\nWhich might be a home office, could be a\nlarge office, could be a large university,\n\n42\n00:02:34.694 --> 00:02:39.070\nall the different levels of where\nyour physical office might be.\n\n43\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.280\nBut again, in relationship to\nthe Office products from Microsoft.\n\n44\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.300\nAnd this is for,\nI would say, upper basics,\n\n45\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.660\nto where you understand how to\ninsert text into a Word document.\n\n46\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.124\nSo you're comfortable with inserting text,\n\n47\n00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:58.040\nyou really just wanna kinda fancy up\nyour documents, and add some of those\n\n48\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.289\ndifferent elements that will kind of add\na little bit of flair to your document.\n\n49\n00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:06.660\nAnd as well making some of those tasks\nthat you do to be repeatable, and\n\n50\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.860\nmake it easier for\nyou in that automation section.\n\n51\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.380\nSo this would be more towards,\nI would say, your advance users.\n\n52\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.520\nThis is a continuation from\nour Word Essentials series so\n\n53\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.600\nI will be referring to that series as\nwell throughout these different episodes.\n\n54\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.347\nSo make sure you go check that\nout in our course library.\n\n55\n00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:27.860\nWhat do you need to know\nabout before we get started?\n\n56\n00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.060\nA foundational knowledge of Word, such as,\ndo you know how to format your text?\n\n57\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.371\nAre you familiar with styles?\n\n58\n00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:37.820\nCuz I love styles, and\nI'll be talking about them all the time.\n\n59\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.730\nSo make sure you have a foundational\nknowledge of how to create styles, and\n\n60\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.590\nhow to use styles effectively.\n\n61\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.370\nAs well as page layout elements, such\nas section breaks, page breaks, how to\n\n62\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.660\ncreate columns, and those are again,\ncovered in that Word Essential shows.\n\n63\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.450\nBasic knowledge of how to use your Windows\noperating system, how to go to your\n\n64\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.972\nfile explorer, how to open files,\nhow to save files and when to print.\n\n65\n00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:00.778\nAnd of course,\n\n66\n00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:04.693\nsome familiarity with other Office\nproducts will be helpful here as well.\n\n67\n00:04:04.693 --> 00:04:09.133\nIf you know how to use Excel pretty well,\nthen that will help you in Word, or\n\n68\n00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:13.592\nsay you know how to use Outlook or\nPowerPoint that could be helpful as well.\n\n69\n00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:17.568\nThere's a lot of things that\ncrossover between the products, so\n\n70\n00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:21.991\nif you know a little bit about one,\nyou know a little bit about the other.\n\n71\n00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:26.090\nAnd the last parts I like to talk\nabout are these extra tidbits.\n\n72\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.070\nThere's always more than one\nway to do something in Word.\n\n73\n00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.950\nSo if I might be explaining ways one and\ntwo,\n\n74\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.580\nthere might be ways three and four, that\nyou might know about that I didn't cover.\n\n75\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.946\nThat's just the way it works\nwithin these Office products,\n\n76\n00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:43.861\nthere's always different ways.\n\n77\n00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:46.917\nAnd it's one I still learn about it too,\nwhere like, I didn't know you could\n\n78\n00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:50.100\nright-click and use that option or\nI didn't know this shortcut did that.\n\n79\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.920\nSo just know that there will be\nmultiple ways that I might not cover.\n\n80\n00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.280\nUpdates happen, yes, it does.\n\n81\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.840\nSo as an Office 365 subscriber,\nthe product is always updating.\n\n82\n00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.840\nAnd at the time of the recording,\nI am on a specific version of whatever\n\n83\n00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.960\nthe update was at in\nthe Office 365 subscription.\n\n84\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.224\nSo you might see different buttons or\ndifferent options, or\n\n85\n00:05:16.224 --> 00:05:19.232\nthings might have changed\na little bit from the time that\n\n86\n00:05:19.232 --> 00:05:22.688\nI recorded these episodes to\nthe time that you're watching it.\n\n87\n00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:27.076\nAnd that also being said, the way that\nyour network is organized, let's say,\n\n88\n00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:31.465\nif you are in a large organization, you\nmight not get updates as frequently, or\n\n89\n00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:34.440\nmaybe they've turned them off altogether.\n\n90\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.840\nSo things might be a little bit different,\nso if there's some slight variations or\n\n91\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.260\nI'm showing you something that you\nsee in your documents, it's like,\n\n92\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.020\nI don't have this available to me.\n\n93\n00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.310\nThat is most of the reasons why it\nwon't be is cuz of the updates and\n\n94\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.800\nwhat version you're on.\n\n95\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.640\nOr your network settings to where\nmaybe they've put a group policy on to\n\n96\n00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.100\nwhere you're not allowed to\ndo this particular function,\n\n97\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.980\nbecause they have locked that down.\n\n98\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.170\nSo those things happen.\n\n99\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.701\nSearching for answers,\nthe oracle of the Internet is out there.\n\n100\n00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.134\nThere's a lot of great information that\nyou can search through whatever search\n\n101\n00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:16.248\nengine you feel like to say, hey,\nI wanna learn how to do x, y, z in Word.\n\n102\n00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:19.670\nYou will have a ton of different\nwebsites that will be able to guide you\n\n103\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.744\nin the right direction, and the Microsoft\nhelp files are always really helpful.\n\n104\n00:06:23.744 --> 00:06:26.961\nThat's probably one of the first\nplaces I would start, and\n\n105\n00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.000\nthen go on to other places.\n\n106\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.003\nAnd most importantly, have fun.\n\n107\n00:06:31.003 --> 00:06:33.743\nI know that this can get\nreally frustrating sometimes,\n\n108\n00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.620\nespecially if you're fighting and\nlike why won't it just move over?\n\n109\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.550\nI've been there, I understand.\n\n110\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.540\nBut that's where you need to just take a\nbreath, turn it off, go do something else,\n\n111\n00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.180\ncome back and then it's poof,\nit magically works.\n\n112\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.460\nSo just try to keep that attitude of hey,\n\n113\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.340\nif I don't get it right the first\ntime I'll try it again.\n\n114\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.090\nEspecially when you're watching these\nepisodes, just have a good time.\n\n115\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.390\nWe like to cut up here and there and\n\n116\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.140\nkeep it light, and\njust keep it fun for all of you.\n\n117\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.213\nSo I hope you enjoy, and I hope to\nsee you soon in some episodes soon.\n\n118\n00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:06.141\n[LAUGH] Have a good time.\n\n119\n00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:11.476\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
