Mac.\n\n3\n00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.900\nIn this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.090\nwe're going to be covering exactly\nwhat is in this particular course.\n\n5\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.460\nWho is the target audience,\nwho is this made for?\n\n6\n00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.880\nWhat do we need to know about\nbefore we get started, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.380\nany tip bits of information\nthat we have extra?\n\n8\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.110\nIn this course, there are two main topics.\n\n9\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.960\nThere is the graphical elements and\nautomation.\n\n10\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.235\nSo this is where we're going to be\nfocusing on those elements that,\n\n11\n00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.860\nwell are graphics, things like images.\n\n12\n00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.980\nWe're gonna talk about how you can\nput images into your document,\n\n13\n00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.470\nall about the important textwrap, and\neven a little bit of document and\n\n14\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.190\nimage resolutions and\nhow you should kind of be aware\n\n15\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.600\nof the sizes of your images when you go\nahead and place them into your Word files.\n\n16\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.300\nWe're also going to be getting into\nshapes and how to format them,\n\n17\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.310\nhow to make them,\nhow to make them different colors,\n\n18\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.380\nand talk about all the fun stuff\nyou can do with the styles.\n\n19\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.900\nWe're going to talk\nabout SmartArt as well.\n\n20\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.765\nI love me some SmartArt.\n\n21\n00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:14.045\nIt's a nice way to be able to display\nyour information in a graphical manner.\n\n22\n00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.960\nGive a little bit more oomph to that\ninformation within your Word documents and\n\n23\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.350\nyour different reports where\nthings like org charts and\n\n24\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.620\ndifferent ways that you want to\ndemonstrate cycles or diagrams.\n\n25\n00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.210\nThat would be what we have for SmartArt.\n\n26\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.310\nWe're also going to be\ngetting into tables.\n\n27\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.140\nTables is where you go ahead and organize\ninformation into rows and columns.\n\n28\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.060\nYou might think, hm tables don't seem\nlike images and graphics, but it\n\n29\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.910\nis that graphical element of a different\nway of representing that information.\n\n30\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.920\nAnd how it works differently in a table\nformat and how that table interacts\n\n31\n00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.525\nlike a graphical element within\nthe rest of your document.\n\n32\n00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:01.555\nWe'll also be getting into charts\nwhere we will be making some\n\n33\n00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.195\nclustered column charts.\n\n34\n00:02:03.195 --> 00:02:05.195\nWe'll be making some pie charts and\n\n35\n00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:08.875\njust understanding the foundations\nof charts because there's a lot of\n\n36\n00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.385\nterminology that is associated with\ncharts that it kind of throws people off.\n\n37\n00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:15.895\nSo we really kind of start at\na foundational level and then go ahead and\n\n38\n00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:19.150\ninsert as another graphical element.\n\n39\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.900\nLet me get into automation.\n\n40\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.500\nThese are things to help make your working\nin Word faster and more efficient.\n\n41\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.918\nI'm going to start with templates.\n\n42\n00:02:28.918 --> 00:02:34.280\nEverybody loves templates but I feel\nthat people kinda use the terminology\n\n43\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.780\na little bit, well, not exactly how\nyou're suppose to use it in Word.\n\n44\n00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.430\nSo we clarify what\nexactly is a template and\n\n45\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.350\nhow to correctly use a template in Word.\n\n46\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.060\nWe also get into macros.\n\n47\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.910\nHow you can record your steps and\nbe able to play them back.\n\n48\n00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.786\nThat can really take the time that it\nwould do for multiple steps just kinda\n\n49\n00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:57.740\nput it all into one little clickable\nbutton and be able to run that anyways.\n\n50\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.736\nBut of course, there are some down sides,\n\n51\n00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:05.481\nsome security issues that we need\nto cover within those episodes and\n\n52\n00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:11.500\nwe do a good job of letting you know how\nto be safe with your macros in using Word.\n\n53\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.040\nGet into some linked objects\nabout putting in some Excel\n\n54\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.400\ndata into your Word document, how you can\nlink back to that particular file, and\n\n55\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.150\nall the nuances that are with that.\n\n56\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.300\nAnd then we get into\nthe ever popular mail merge.\n\n57\n00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.260\nWe go into making some\ndifferent letters and\n\n58\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.410\nwe do labels and\nenvelopes and lots of fun.\n\n59\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.160\nSo who is this for?\n\n60\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.190\nAll Office users with a capital O, meaning\nthat this is for the Office 365 users.\n\n61\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.382\nIt doesn't matter if you're in a physical\noffice or if you're at a home office or\n\n62\n00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:47.200\njust, you know,\nyou're in your living room.\n\n63\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.690\nSo that's why we have\nthat capital O there.\n\n64\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.676\nAnd I call this the upper\nbasics to advanced level.\n\n65\n00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:56.934\nSo this is where,\nkind of going into that prerequisites,\n\n66\n00:03:56.934 --> 00:04:01.530\nyou're gonna need to have a little bit\nof a foundational knowledge of Word.\n\n67\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.360\nWe have the Word Essentials series, so\n\n68\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.830\nthat is more like a precursor\nto this particular course.\n\n69\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.230\nSo things like you need to know\nabout like what is a style.\n\n70\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.460\nYou need to know about page layout,\nhow to select text, how to format text.\n\n71\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.690\nAll of those kind of foundations\nof Word would be very helpful for\n\n72\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.190\nthis particular series.\n\n73\n00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.150\nThen you do need to know a little bit\nabout your Macintosh operating system,\n\n74\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.900\nunderstanding what the Finder is.\n\n75\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.650\nWe do get into a little bit more\nof a keyboard shortcuts in this\n\n76\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.160\nparticular series, so\njust having familiarity with that.\n\n77\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.580\nAnd, of course,\nbeing familiar with other Office products.\n\n78\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.390\nWe will be talking\na little bit about Excel.\n\n79\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.210\nIf you've never used Excel,\n\n80\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.610\nyou might wanna watch a show that we\nhave in our course library about that.\n\n81\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.330\nBut knowing one helps with other Office\nproducts, so that's always a good thing.\n\n82\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.420\nWe do have exercise files and\nepisode notes that accompany every single\n\n83\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.190\none of these particular videos that\nyou're going to be watching, so\n\n84\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.860\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n85\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.090\nThey should all be available to you\nright here within this course overview.\n\n86\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.740\nMeaning, all of the exercise files for\n\n87\n00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.040\nevery episode within this show,\nso check that out.\n\n88\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.760\nAnd if they're ever missing or if I'm\nreferring to a file that's not in that,\n\n89\n00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.910\nlet us know.\n\n90\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.320\nWe need to know and make sure that we\nhave all of our ducks in a row for\n\n91\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.900\nyou guys to be able to follow along\nwith me and have lots of fun.\n\n92\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.210\nAnd talking about fun,\nwe have some extras.\n\n93\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.910\nThis is always something I talk\nabout in all of my course overviews,\n\n94\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.730\nis there's always other options.\n\n95\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.500\nThere's a whole bunch of\nways to do things in Word,\n\n96\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.206\nso if I haven't covered all of them,\nthere's a lot of them.\n\n97\n00:05:43.206 --> 00:05:48.210\nUpdates do happen and different versions,\nbeing that this is an Office\n\n98\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.300\n365 product and is always updating,\nyou might be on an older version or\n\n99\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.990\na younger version than\nthe one that I'm using.\n\n100\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.000\nSo definitely check that out,\n\n101\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.610\nyou can always see if you need to\nhave updates from your Help menu.\n\n102\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.398\nAnd you can always check out\nwhat version of a product\n\n103\n00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:10.219\nthat you're using through your\naccount settings in the home tab or\n\n104\n00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.833\nthe backstage view when\nyou go into the file menu,\n\n105\n00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:19.374\nyou should have some options there to\nshow exactly what version you're on.\n\n106\n00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:23.061\nBecause that may make a difference as\nto what you're seeing on your screen\n\n107\n00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:25.030\nversus what I'm showing on my screen.\n\n108\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.930\nAlways searching for answers.\n\n109\n00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.280\nThe internet is a wealth\nof information out there.\n\n110\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.360\nI do reference a lot of the Microsoft\nhelp files within the notes.\n\n111\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.670\nThat should be a good place to start.\n\n112\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.070\nBut do some searches on your own to\nget those answers that you might need.\n\n113\n00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.310\nEverybody uses these products differently.\n\n114\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.030\nSo maybe you're really interested in mail\nmerge, well we have some episodes on that.\n\n115\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.590\nMaybe you don't really use charts but\nit's always good to know\n\n116\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.820\nthat it's available and you never know\ndown the road when you might need that.\n\n117\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.020\nAnd always have fun.\n\n118\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.460\nI know it can be frustrating sometimes\nwhen you're trying to figure out like why\n\n119\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.600\ndoesn't this chart wanna move around.\n\n120\n00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.170\nWell, we got that wordwrap on it.\n\n121\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.990\nBut just remember to just kinda, while\nwe're learning, have some fun in here.\n\n122\n00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.280\nWe like to have fun and I hope you do too.\n\n123\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.039\nAnd I will see you in\nsome future episodes.\n\n124\n00:07:11.039 -->

Wow factors?\n\n13\n00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:45.466\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes some wows in there and\neverything like that.\n\n14\n00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.052\nAnd just doing more than formatting text.\n\n15\n00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:51.214\nSo we're gonna be concentrating in\nthis particular talk about graphical\n\n16\n00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:54.631\nelements and the best place to start with\ngraphical elements is well graphics.\n\n17\n00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:57.511\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pictures that's what I usually think of\n\n18\n00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:01.413\nso we have pictures of our Mr.\nFuego Pants and our bishop Timothy.\n\n19\n00:01:01.413 --> 00:01:06.029\nMy cats, or course, you guys are like who\nare these things you're talking about.\n\n20\n00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:07.562\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's the cats.\n\n21\n00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:12.323\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well I'm super excited because\nnumber one, I've got a chance to host with\n\n22\n00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:17.660\nyou before, taking a look at some advanced\nWord, working here in a PC environment.\n\n23\n00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.290\nBut in this show we're\nreally gonna be looking at\n\n24\n00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.590\nhow we tackle that from a Mac\nuser perspective, right?\n\n25\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.490\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah, and\n\n26\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.300\nthat's where even if you haven't\nwatched the Word Essentials for Mac.\n\n27\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.730\nI definitely suggest you do it,\n\n28\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.770\nis a continuation of that particular\nshow but of course it can be by itself.\n\n29\n00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.020\nSo you don't have to necessarily\nhave that as a prerequisite for\n\n30\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.150\nthis particular show.\n\n31\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.330\nBut yeah, there are a lot of\ndifferences when you start getting into\n\n32\n00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.390\nthese more advanced features\nof any of the Office products.\n\n33\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.606\nWhen you go over to Mac,\nit is not the same as the PC.\n\n34\n00:01:49.606 --> 00:01:51.463\nSo I will be doing a lot of contrasting.\n\n35\n00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:52.742\n&gt;&gt; Comparisons?\n\n36\n00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:57.143\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so if you're used to\nthis in Windows, it's not gonna be here,\n\n37\n00:01:57.143 --> 00:01:58.307\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:58.307 --> 00:02:01.366\nAnd a lot of test people are like,\nbut I don't use Windows, I'm on a Mac.\n\n39\n00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:05.648\nI'm like yeah, but a, maybe a lot of\nus I know at least in my perspective,\n\n40\n00:02:05.648 --> 00:02:08.564\nI go back and\nforth between different platforms.\n\n41\n00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:12.736\nAnd that's where my perspective is from,\nis using both of\n\n42\n00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:16.534\nthese different platforms, so\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of interesting how\n\n43\n00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:19.805\nyou're saying you don't really know\nexactly how you'll be using it and that I,\n\n44\n00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.264\npersonally, I don't know about.\n\n45\n00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:24.951\nA lot of viewers out there watching this,\nbut, whenever I'm actually\n\n46\n00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:28.466\nusing Word I'm not necessarily\na power user or anything like that.\n\n47\n00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:33.429\nAnd if I am using it it's usually because\nits some kind of requirement like\n\n48\n00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:38.232\neither through my job or my kids\nhomework [LAUGH] or something like that,\n\n49\n00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:40.490\nand sometimes its on a deadline.\n\n50\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.090\nIt might not be the coolest topic or\nwhatever, so you're kind of already like,\n\n51\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.800\nlet's get this done.\n\n52\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.500\nBut I'm excited to be here because\nI wanna see different tips and\n\n53\n00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.050\nthings that can help me make that\nprocess a little more fun and exciting.\n\n54\n00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a lot of times when\nyou're doing Word documents like\n\n55\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.920\nany type of project.\n\n56\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.093\nYou want those graphical elements to\nhelp kind of tell that story rather than\n\n57\n00:03:02.093 --> 00:03:02.753\njust text.\n\n58\n00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:04.985\nSo that's where we're gonna start but\n\n59\n00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.833\nbefore we even add images\ninto our Word document.\n\n60\n00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:12.565\nI wanna just talk about kind of like\ngraphic design 101 if you wanna say.\n\n61\n00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:13.746\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n62\n00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:15.952\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of just kind of getting familiar with\n\n63\n00:03:15.952 --> 00:03:20.970\nimages resolution file types because it's\nsomething that's near dear to my heart.\n\n64\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.074\nI love to talk about it so\n\n65\n00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:25.575\nthat's why I made its own episode about\nit because I can get long-winded.\n\n66\n00:03:25.575 --> 00:03:27.782\nDon't worry I wont go too off the rails.\n\n67\n00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:31.008\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've got a PowerPoint presentation to\n\n68\n00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.553\nkeep us concise but it's interesting\njust to kind of get a general\n\n69\n00:03:34.553 --> 00:03:37.146\nidea even if you're not\ndoing graphic design.\n\n70\n00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:40.486\nJust what is a JPEG, what is\nthe resolution that we're talking about,\n\n71\n00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.160\nwhy do my images look weird?\n\n72\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.170\nThose kinds of things.\n\n73\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.111\nSo I'm gonna jump on and into this idea of\na PowerPoint presentation, I'm not in like\n\n74\n00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.472\nthe slide show view, because I just\ndidn't feel like doing it that way.\n\n75\n00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:54.265\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna talk about images here,\n\n76\n00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:55.574\nso File Types.\n\n77\n00:03:55.574 --> 00:03:57.900\nAll right,\nwhen we take pictures on our phone,\n\n78\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.401\nI mean because normally nowadays\neverybody has a smart phone, right?\n\n79\n00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:03.241\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you go ahead and snap that picture.\n\n80\n00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:07.727\nRight, exactly,\nyou post it online all that kind of stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.456\nThere are different types of files\nassociated with images just like you have\n\n82\n00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:14.760\na Word document, Excel file,\na PowerPoint presentation.\n\n83\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.464\nAll those different file types, just kinda\nexplain what the type of information\n\n84\n00:04:19.464 --> 00:04:22.241\nthat's in the file,\nthat's what it all does.\n\n85\n00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.254\nI kinda did that sentence\na little backwards, but okay.\n\n86\n00:04:24.254 --> 00:04:26.257\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay we see the extension types\n\n87\n00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:29.422\nhere so I'm just hoping you'll\nexplain the details of each.\n\n88\n00:04:29.422 --> 00:04:31.994\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so let's start with JPG.\n\n89\n00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:33.246\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right JPG,\n\n90\n00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:35.578\nthere's usually sometimes an E in there,\n\n91\n00:04:35.578 --> 00:04:39.878\nlike if you do a four letter extension\nthat's why they have the PEG, the JPEG.\n\n92\n00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:43.192\nThat actually seems for\njoint photograph experts group.\n\n93\n00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:43.762\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n94\n00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:45.345\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nlittle trivia question there for you.\n\n95\n00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:46.616\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n96\n00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:50.313\nthat's the file form that most people are\nfamiliar with, because it's the one that\n\n97\n00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:54.136\nyou normally associate with photographs,\nlike the things that come off your phones.\n\n98\n00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:59.590\nAnd everything like that are going\nto normally be any JPEG file format.\n\n99\n00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.940\nNow the thing with a JPEG, and\nall these files, actually,\n\n100\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.940\nthey're all raster-based file formats.\n\n101\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.538\nWhat that means is that\nyou're having pixels.\n\n102\n00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:14.400\nNormally, we kinda know about pixels,\npixels are everywhere, our TVs,\n\n103\n00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.490\nour monitors and everything.\n\n104\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.130\nAnd we're gonna get into\nthe world of resolution as well.\n\n105\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.422\nBut right now, we're just talking\nabout pixel based images.\n\n106\n00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:27.997\nAnd with a JPEG, it doesn't have any\ntransparency support and you're like,\n\n107\n00:05:27.997 --> 00:05:29.952\nokay, well what does that mean?\n\n108\n00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:32.540\n[LAUGH] It's usually here,\nI'm gonna jump one slide.\n\n109\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.215\nIt's one of these types of things,\nI always get people that go, I always get\n\n110\n00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:42.375\nthis white background with my picture and\nI don't know why it's not doing this.\n\n111\n00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:46.715\nIt's not see through, and\nthat's what I usually get with people.\n\n112\n00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:50.885\nYeah and that's a huge difference right\nhere, of the different types of files.\n\n113\n00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:57.210\nA JPEG file does not have the,\nability to support transparency,\n\n114\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.050\nbut a GIFfile,\na GIF file does support transparency.\n\n115\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.627\nSo a lot of times when you're using\nclip art or different things, and\n\n116\n00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:06.427\nif you're putting it on a white piece\nof paper, you'd probably never know\n\n117\n00:06:06.427 --> 00:06:09.112\nthe difference, but things like\nPowerPoint this is a big difference.\n\n118\n00:06:09.112 --> 00:06:13.792\nAnd it's just because of the type\nof file that that particular\n\n119\n00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:18.922\npicture was saved in and\nthen what it supports or doesn't support.\n\n120\n00:06:18.922 --> 00:06:23.831\nSo going back to this slide, that's\nthe big difference here between JPEG and\n\n121\n00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:25.978\nGIFor sometimes knows as a GIF.\n\n122\n00:06:25.978 --> 00:06:29.820\nActually the creator of that file format,\nhe won an award,\n\n123\n00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.800\nlike a web achievement award some time.\n\n124\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.030\nAnd he said, it is pronounced GIF even\nthough everybody pronounced it as GIF.\n\n125\n00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.266\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I've never heard\nit like that before.\n\n126\n00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:06:41.224 --> 00:06:44.428\n&gt;&gt; And it's graphical interchange format,\n\n128\n00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:48.527\nnow that I said that it's\nsomewhere close to that [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:06:48.527 --> 00:06:49.925\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n130\n00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:54.856\n&gt;&gt; But the GIF file format, it support\ntransparency but the other thing about\n\n131\n00:06:54.856 --> 00:07:00.189\nthe gift is that it doesn't have the same\nlevel of color support that a JPEG does.\n\n132\n00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:05.066\nThat actually only supports up to\n256 colors while a JPEG can support\n\n133\n00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:06.945\nup to 16 million colors.\n\n134\n00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:10.682\nSo that's why JPEG photographs you\nprobably wanna keep those together.\n\n135\n00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:12.562\nGIF might be better for logos.\n\n136\n00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:14.728\n&gt;&gt; Logos,\nthat's exactly what I was thinking,\n\n137\n00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:16.892\ncuz you know if you have like posters or\nflyer,\n\n138\n00:07:16.892 --> 00:07:20.075\nyou don't wanna have that white\nsquare on there cuz it's colored.\n\n139\n00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:22.747\nOr like I was gonna say ombre but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:07:22.747 --> 00:07:24.650\n&gt;&gt; It seems like you see the word gradient\n\n141\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.700\nbeing used in these Office products,\nso gradient background or something?\n\n142\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.940\n&gt;&gt; And you're actually falling\nright into all these things,\n\n143\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.340\nthat ombre that we would know about,\nright?\n\n144\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.152\nThis is where you have another\nfile format that's call a PNG or\n\n145\n00:07:39.152 --> 00:07:44.063\na P-N-G Portable Network Graphic,\nthat actually, if you look back at here,\n\n146\n00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:46.284\nit's like the best of both worlds.\n\n147\n00:07:46.284 --> 00:07:51.041\nIt can support the large\ncolor amount like a JPEG, but\n\n148\n00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:55.980\nit can also support\ntransparency like a GIF.\n\n149\n00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.620\nAnd then it gets it.\n\n150\n00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.001\nAnd actually there's two different,\nthere's a ping eight and\n\n151\n00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:01.360\na ping twenty four.\n\n152\n00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.260\nA ping eight is actually exactly like\na gif so it only support 256 colors.\n\n153\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.420\nAnd it only has what's known\nas an index transparency.\n\n154\n00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.450\nWhat index transparency\nmeans it's either on or off.\n\n155\n00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.890\nIt's either transparent or\nit's not transparent.\n\n156\n00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.860\nas opposed to a png24.\n\n157\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.100\nYou can see right here,\nI'll zoom in a little bit so you can see,\n\n158\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.360\nthat ambre that we're talking about, you\nhave a drop shadow here, on this flower\n\n159\n00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.980\nas opposed to you can see over here where\nthis one does not have a drop shadow.\n\n160\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.660\nSo this is a multilevel\ntransparency support.\n\n161\n00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.818\nIt's an 8-bit transparency support rather\nthan a 1-bit transparency support if\n\n162\n00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:40.495\nyou're like, wow you're talking too techy,\njust look at the pictures.\n\n163\n00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:45.630\n[LAUGH] You can actually have that\nvarying degrees of transparency support\n\n164\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.140\nin a png file that you\ndon't get with a gif.\n\n165\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.000\nSo it's a really cool file format\nthat a lot of people tend to use and\n\n166\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.210\nthese are things you're going to run into\nthis Images or people send you files.\n\n167\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:00.770\nLike here,\n\n168\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.990\nwe have all these pictures that we want\nyou to put into this Word document.\n\n169\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.360\nYou might be working with JPEGs,\nGIFs, PNGs, and\n\n170\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.510\nyou might also be working\nwith the TIFF file format.\n\n171\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.200\nNow the TIFF file format,\nTagged Image File Format,\n\n172\n00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.490\nthat's another one that\nyou see with images.\n\n173\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:22.130\nOr a logo, I've I make logos, and\nI do graphic design on the side.\n\n174\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.100\nI will make a company logo, and\nI will make it in every single\n\n175\n00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.470\none of these file formats,\nbecause of the different supports.\n\n176\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.670\nOnes with white backgrounds,\none with transparencies,\n\n177\n00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.050\none with drop shadows, one with flat\ncolors, one with multicolor supports.\n\n178\n00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.440\nI mean these are all people\nlike me that do graphic design.\n\n179\n00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.210\nThis is my world.\n\n180\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:40.804\n&gt;&gt;

Well, it's actually the first thing\nthat comes to my mind is like, what if\n\n188\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.600\nyou're working for a company and you\nalready have some kind of, like, access to\n\n189\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.840\npaid photographs or to paid images,\nI should say, not just photographs.\n\n190\n00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.530\nIf I can talk here,\n\n191\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.320\nspecifically what we're looking at is\nthe differences between those, so.\n\n192\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.210\nIf you have the access and\nthat’s part of your job function and\n\n193\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.090\nyou’re required to go ahead and select\nthe right one, knowing the difference can\n\n194\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.430\nreally help enhance that document or\nwhatever it is you’re working on.\n\n195\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.510\n&gt;&gt; That is\n&gt;&gt; I couldn’t have said it better myself.\n\n196\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.447\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n197\n00:10:28.447 --> 00:10:30.810\n&gt;&gt; You probably could have,\nbecause I was stuttering over my words.\n\n198\n00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Years.\n\n199\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.590\n&gt;&gt; No, I did it all the time,\nso it's all good.\n\n200\n00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.203\nWe make a great team.\n\n201\n00:10:34.203 --> 00:10:36.871\n&gt;&gt;

This irks me.\n\n211\n00:11:01.082 --> 00:11:04.256\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I see it all the time [INAUDIBLE].\n\n212\n00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:05.098\n&gt;&gt; Mm-Hm.\n\n213\n00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:05.665\nYes.\n\n214\n00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.220\nAnd this is so common.\n\n215\n00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.590\nLike this guy right over here.\n\n216\n00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.600\nWhen you see Bishop\nover here on the right,\n\n217\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.200\nhe doesn't look as good as this\nguy right over here does he?\n\n218\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n219\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.320\n&gt;&gt; No, he's pixellated, right?\n\n220\n00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.270\nAnd that's when a lot of people\nsay like I got this picture but\n\n221\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.410\nthen I make it bigger and\nit just looks all pixellated.\n\n222\n00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.470\nI'm like.\n\n223\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.190\nYeah because it didn't have\nthe right resolution to begin with.\n\n224\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.030\nSo what is resolution?\n\n225\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:34.300\nWe hear this term I think, nowadays,\nall over the place back to the monitors.\n\n226\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.180\nWe talk about our\nresolution of our monitors.\n\n227\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.690\nWe talk about the resolution\nof our televisions.\n\n228\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.931\nLike right now don't they have 4K or\nsomething like that.\n\n229\n00:11:40.931 --> 00:11:44.216\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's pretty ridiculous.\n\n230\n00:11:44.216 --> 00:11:47.404\nOutside of my price range!\n\n231\n00:11:47.404 --> 00:11:52.166\n&gt;&gt; Exactly yes, that's what I was thinking\nto so I will stick with the 3K or\n\n232\n00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:54.310\nwhatever the other thing is.\n\n233\n00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.490\nYeah, but that's where you come into.\n\n234\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.004\nAlso, when you hear about resolution and\nit's high resolution monitors,\n\n235\n00:12:01.004 --> 00:12:03.775\nyou always think,\nthe bigger the better, right?\n\n236\n00:12:03.775 --> 00:12:06.130\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So you want as much resolution as\n\n237\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.890\npossible.\n\n238\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.610\nWell not always the case when it comes\nto graphics in the sense of design and\n\n239\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.710\nwhat modality and\nwhat medium that I'm working with.\n\n240\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.006\nMeaning, am I using images for a website?\n\n241\n00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:24.390\nAm I using images for\ncommercially printed material?\n\n242\n00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.762\nThat's the big one.\n\n243\n00:12:25.762 --> 00:12:28.522\nWith the screen,\nif it looks good on the screen.\n\n244\n00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:29.053\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n245\n00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:31.190\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna look fine, right?\n\n246\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.380\nBut there is something about the actual\nfile size, like the byte information.\n\n247\n00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.610\nThat if I had this really, really, really\nbig picture, and I made it really small on\n\n248\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.240\na website, well it still thinks it's this\nmuch information, so you might have.\n\n249\n00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.360\nLoad time issues, and\nI'm sure we've all been to a website,\n\n250\n00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.890\nwhere you get everything and\nit's like there's the picture.\n\n251\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.250\nIt takes forever for the picture to show\nup, that's because they didn't optimize.\n\n252\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.860\nThey didn't optimize their web graphics,\n\n253\n00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:03.410\nwhere it's still thinking that it is\na 3000 by 3000 pixel photograph but\n\n254\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:08.300\nthey made it only 600 by 400, so\nit keeps all that file information.\n\n255\n00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:13.085\nSo that's something on the website of like\ntoo big and sometimes not a good thing.\n\n256\n00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:15.944\n&gt;&gt; So just knowing what you're\ngonna be doing with that image.\n\n257\n00:13:15.944 --> 00:13:16.922\nLike you said, for\n\n258\n00:13:16.922 --> 00:13:21.680\nprint you got the higher quality versus\nweb you're looking for speed optimization.\n\n259\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.870\nExactly and that's the other one\nwhere you do commercial printing.\n\n260\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.290\nNow I'm talking commercial printing.\n\n261\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.860\nI keep trying to throw\nthat word in too there.\n\n262\n00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.686\nBecause like your desktop printers,\neven those fancy printers that\n\n263\n00:13:33.686 --> 00:13:37.705\nyou have at work that does all the,\nflips it over and staples it.\n\n264\n00:13:37.705 --> 00:13:38.548\n&gt;&gt; Collates, yeah.\n\n265\n00:13:38.548 --> 00:13:39.437\n&gt;&gt; That's it [LAUGH].\n\n266\n00:13:39.437 --> 00:13:41.029\nI was trying to find that word.\n\n267\n00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.670\nEven with those-\n&gt;&gt; Or that's duplexing, sorry.\n\n268\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.820\nCollate is when it goes in order.\n\n269\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, yes.\n\n270\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.887\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, it's close around there.\n\n272\n00:13:48.887 --> 00:13:50.813\nSo [LAUGH] it's one of those features that\n\n273\n00:13:50.813 --> 00:13:54.924\nthose fancy printers do.\nBut that's still desktop printing.\n\n274\n00:13:54.924 --> 00:13:57.389\nYou're not sending it to a print provider\n\n275\n00:13:57.389 --> 00:14:02.520\nto be able to then put it on a big press\nor a digital press, and things like that.\n\n276\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:08.605\nWhen you send it to places like that,\nhaving this 300 ppi, or pixels per inch,\n\n277\n00:14:08.605 --> 00:14:12.210\nbecause that's what we talk about\nresolution in terms of photographs and\n\n278\n00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.500\ngraphic design.\n\n279\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.490\nYou need to make sure you\nhave that resolution set.\n\n280\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:22.965\nBecause, the way that the dots of ink come\ntogether, how close they are to where\n\n281\n00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:28.461\nit's on the paper, does make a difference\nof the quality of the printed image.\n\n282\n00:14:28.461 --> 00:14:33.052\nSo these are things that I, I mean when\nI get a flyer that's printed out and\n\n283\n00:14:33.052 --> 00:14:35.905\nI see an image like this,\nit I cringe inside.\n\n284\n00:14:35.905 --> 00:14:37.090\n[LAUGH] You know.\n\n285\n00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:41.740\n&gt;&gt; I totally get it, when I was in high\nschool, I was the yearbook editor, so\n\n286\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.920\nseeing the images being published, even\nlike differences between different shades\n\n287\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.450\nof black, and especially the types\nof images made a huge difference.\n\n288\n00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.680\nAnd then later on I worked for\na newspaper company.\n\n289\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.540\nSo, sometimes when you're talking about\nlarge ad that are covering a large\n\n290\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:01.550\nportion of the page, it makes a huge\ndifference in the quality there.\n\n291\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.460\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; You would think, like newspaper print,\n\n292\n00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:10.300\nthe paper is pretty porous and it wouldn't\nreally matter, but it definitely does.\n\n293\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.020\n&gt;&gt; You're singing the words\nthat I love to hear.\n\n294\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.783\n&gt;&gt; Preach to the chorus.\n\n295\n00:15:13.783 --> 00:15:14.952\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n296\n00:15:14.952 --> 00:15:15.656\nI love it.\n\n297\n00:15:15.656 --> 00:15:21.062\nAnd talking about these pixel dimensions,\nbecause you have resolution.\n\n298\n00:15:21.062 --> 00:15:26.244\nWhich normally you change in an image\nediting program such as Photoshop and\n\n299\n00:15:26.244 --> 00:15:27.568\nthings like that.\n\n300\n00:15:27.568 --> 00:15:32.405\nI remember we were talking about basic\nimage stuff concept scenario thing,\n\n301\n00:15:32.405 --> 00:15:35.664\nand how we get it into Word and\neverything related.\n\n302\n00:15:35.664 --> 00:15:38.373\nThis will all come back when we\ntalk about compressing your images.\n\n303\n00:15:38.373 --> 00:15:41.323\nIt'd just be like, I don't know why\nI need to know this about Word.\n\n304\n00:15:41.323 --> 00:15:44.760\nYou're talking about Photoshop\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but it all comes together\n\n305\n00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.100\n&gt;&gt; It all has to come from somewhere.\n\n306\n00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.890\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n\n307\n00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.830\nAnd if I'm going to change the resolution,\n\n308\n00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.340\nyou usually do it in\nthose types of products.\n\n309\n00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.264\nBut how your PPI, pixels per inch, and\n\n310\n00:15:54.264 --> 00:15:59.061\nthe resolution all comes together\nis you've got to start with.\n\n311\n00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:01.400\nYour total number of pixels.\n\n312\n00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.911\nThe actual image dimensions needs\nto have enough to where if I need\n\n313\n00:16:05.911 --> 00:16:09.355\nlike Cherokee was just saying\nI need to go ahead and\n\n314\n00:16:09.355 --> 00:16:13.360\nhave a image printed on\nthe front cover of a magazine.\n\n315\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.165\nThat needs to be 8 by 10 inches wide,\n\n316\n00:16:16.165 --> 00:16:21.095\nbut then if I'm supposed to get\n300 ppi to get that resolution up,\n\n317\n00:16:21.095 --> 00:16:25.770\nI need to have enough pixels\naltogether to be able to kind of squish\n\n318\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:30.200\nthem all together to make that\nsame end result physical size.\n\n319\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.260\nSo it's all a mathematical equation,\nreally, so it's important to understand,\n\n320\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.355\nand again, going a little off the rails,\nit's known as resampling.\n\n321\n00:16:38.355 --> 00:16:41.065\nResampling means change\nthe total number of pixels.\n\n322\n00:16:41.065 --> 00:16:43.635\nWhen you increase\nthe resolution of something,\n\n323\n00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:46.605\nlike in Photoshop,\nyou uncheck that resampling box.\n\n324\n00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:51.932\nTake all my images or my pixels and\ngo ahead and change the resolution\n\n325\n00:16:51.932 --> 00:16:56.711\nwhich would change the overall inches and\nso on and so forth.\n\n326\n00:16:56.711 --> 00:17:00.770\nSo it's just one of those things\nthat you need to know about.\n\n327\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.480\nIn relationship to Word, you really\nneed to concentrate on these things.\n\n328\n00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.100\nThe pixel dimensions of your image.\n\n329\n00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:12.480\nYou don't totally have to worry about\nthis stuff being completely honest.\n\n330\n00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.350\nAnd if you're gonna be sending\nstuff to a commercial printer,\n\n331\n00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.090\nprobably not gonna be using Word to do it.\n\n332\n00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.380\nAnd if you are, you might wanna\njump over in design or illustrator,\n\n333\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.390\nbecause it's like, the next step up.\n\n334\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.069\nI've see people design some things\nin Word where I'm like, whoa,\n\n335\n00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.003\nI didn't even know that\nwould be even possible.\n\n336\n00:17:28.003 --> 00:17:31.860\n[LAUGH] But it's just like,\nwhat each product is meant for.\n\n337\n00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.459\nAnd Word is not necessarily\nthe best choice for\n\n338\n00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:40.080\npage layout designing for\na commercial printed material.\n\n339\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm even thinking,\nMicrosoft has Publisher.\n\n340\n00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:50.230\nSo that would be\na transition type product?\n\n341\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.730\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\nexcept they don't have Publisher for Mac.\n\n342\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.570\nIt's a PC only product.\n\n343\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.590\nBut, yes, it is kind of a nice in between,\nand it does kind of go towards that.\n\n344\n00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:04.430\nBut, again, you still need to\nunderstand just the whole concept of\n\n345\n00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.044\nresolution pixel dimensions.\n\n346\n00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:09.177\nSo let's move back over here, and\nI'm gonna just finish these couple slides.\n\n347\n00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:12.682\nAnd then I'm gonna come back and circle\naround to those pixel dimensions and\n\n348\n00:18:12.682 --> 00:18:16.420\nlooking at images that I have here on my\ncomputer and kind of putting it together.\n\n349\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:22.540\nBut in your Office product the cool thing\nis, is that you can do a lot of neat image\n\n350\n00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.780\nediting in the sense of color corrections,\ncropping, and borders, and stuff that.\n\n351\n00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:34.070\nIt's all built in to Office products\nthat you would have to use Photoshop or\n\n352\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.820\nother products before all of these cool\nupdates, and then note of the most recent\n\n353\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:43.620\nversion to 2016 that's been around\nthat you can do like some cool.\n\n354\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.780\nIt's almost like Instagram filters or\nthose types of\n\n355\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.170\nthings where you can really change all\nthe quality or look of your photograph.\n\n356\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.010\nYou can do it all here\nin your Office products.\n\n357\n00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.930\nSo you can crop things out.\n\n358\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.410\nYou can make it,\nput little hearts around it.\n\n359\n00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.430\nAnd so we're gonna be going over all\nof these things of what you can do with\n\n360\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:05.950\nimages inside of your Office products,\nspecifically Word in the format episode.\n\n361\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.380\nBut that just goes ahead and\ncompletes my PowerPoint presentation, so\n\n362\n00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.025\nI'll shut this down, and then show you\nsome of the images I have on my computer.\n\n363\n00:19:15.025 --> 00:19:19.932\nNow, these were taken,\npretty much all of them with my iPhone.\n\n364\n00:19:19.932 --> 00:19:22.618\nSo I guess I'm an Apple girl.\n\n365\n00:19:22.618 --> 00:19:26.258\nSo have these pictures and\nyou can see that I have Most of them,\n\n366\n00:19:26.258 --> 00:19:28.150\nactually all of them are JPEGs.\n\n367\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.230\nI don’t really have many others\nthat are in different file formats.\n\n368\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.380\nProbably should for\nexample purposes, but that’s okay.\n\n369\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:33.889\nWe’ll get there.\n\n370\n00:19:33.889 --> 00:19:34.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n371\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.590\nSo now when I’m looking at this, these\njust all look like regular photographs and\n\n372\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.662\nthat looks fine, right?\n\n373\n00:19:40.662 --> 00:19:43.990\nBut these files have\ndifferent file dimensions.\n\n374\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.050\nLook down here where we have the kitties.\n\n375\n00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.870\nWe have kitties medium,\nsmall, tiny, and regular.\n\n376\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.450\nWhat does that mean?\n\n377\n00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.330\nThey all look the same\nhere in my icon mode.\n\n378\n00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:59.400\nIf I go over to my list mode,\njust in this, this is where in Mac,\n\n379\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.000\nyou don't have an option in your list\nviews to add the file dimensions.\n\n380\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.680\nI will say as as multi-platform person.\n\n381\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.170\nI do love the PCs.\n\n382\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.870\nWe'll go ahead and just put up here and\nadd image dimensions and\n\n383\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.070\nit puts it right there.\n\n384\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.388\n&gt;&gt; Hm, I didn't even know that existed.\n\n385\n00:20:16.388 --> 00:20:17.730\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, some errors of graph is like me,\n\n387\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.220\nI always do that.\n\n388\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:26.270\nSo I need to know the pixel\ndimensions of these files.\n\n389\n00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.420\nEven before I get to that,\njust look at the file sizes.\n\n390\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.980\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was going to ask you.\n\n391\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.640\nI always pay attention to the file sizes.\n\n392\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.970\nBut what you told us about\nresizing with the pixels,\n\n393\n00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.540\nthat could be a little I guess tricky,\nif I'm just relying on that info.\n\n394\n00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.176\n&gt;&gt; But they actually go right together.\n\n395\n00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:44.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what I always thought.\n\n396\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.615\n&gt;&gt; So the number.\n&gt;&gt; But I was like, I don't know now,\n\n397\n00:20:46.615 --> 00:20:49.662\nnow that you added that little bit\nof information saying that you can\n\n398\n00:20:49.662 --> 00:20:50.555\nmanipulate that.\n\n399\n00:20:50.555 --> 00:20:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, but it does make it to\n\n400\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.540\nwhatever the amount of pixels that\nare in that picture determines the size.\n\n401\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, example like right here,\n\n402\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.750\nthis says 2.2 megabytes.\n\n403\n00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:06.760\nThis one is 7k kilobytes, that's\na huge difference in size, isn't it?\n\n404\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So this is like a bigger picture and\n\n405\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.770\nthis is a smaller picture.\n\n406\n00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.470\nNow this is also getting into more of\nlike your Mac OS stuff, not just Windows.\n\n407\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.910\nBut it's little things like\nthis that always make me happy.\n\n408\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.930\nLike I actually just learned something\nrecently where you can put on\n\n409\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.860\nthe pixel dimensions in this view and I'll\nshow you how to do it in just a second.\n\n410\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.190\nBut I always come over to this view.\n\n411\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.130\nNow this is where I believe this\nis called the column view in here.\n\n412\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.830\nSo if I look at this,\nlet's look at this photograph.\n\n413\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.830\nOkay, actually this is Columbia,\nI was there earlier this year.\n\n414\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:45.020\nAnd you can see that I have,\nit says when it was taken.\n\n415\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:50.200\nAnd look at the dimensions,\nit's 4,000 pixels by 3,000 pixels.\n\n416\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.910\nThat's a big picture, isn't it?\n\n417\n00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.250\n&gt;&gt; Did you take that with your iPhone?\n\n418\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:53.928\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n419\n00:21:53.928 --> 00:21:56.108\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and talking about that,\n\n420\n00:21:56.108 --> 00:22:00.000\nhave you ever tried to send\na photograph from your phone?\n\n421\n00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.875\nYou go ahead and pick the picture and\nthen you want to text it to somebody.\n\n422\n00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:04.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n423\n00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.220\n&gt;&gt; It usually pops up with something at\nthe bottom that says do you want to send\n\n424\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.520\nit as a small, medium,\nor large, doesn't it?\n\n425\n00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.740\n&gt;&gt; Or actual size.\n\n426\n00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n427\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.720\nThat's where your phones are actually\nresizing it for you, for transport,\n\n428\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.090\nbecause if I send this to you,\nthis two meg file, and\n\n429\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.990\nI want to send you seven of them.\n\n430\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.148\nThat's a lot of information\ntraveling through your phone, right?\n\n431\n00:22:25.148 --> 00:22:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually have that happened\nquite a bit especially if I'm in an area\n\n432\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.710\nwhere I don't have as good of a network.\n\n433\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.840\nSo I get like a text message and\n\n434\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.580\nsomeone's asking me, what do you\nthink about this dress, or who knows.\n\n435\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, uh-huh.\n\n436\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.340\n&gt;&gt; What it is really, and\nthen you're like, hm, I don't know,\n\n437\n00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.330\nI can't see the image.\n\n438\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.295\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n439\n00:22:42.295 --> 00:22:44.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you sent it at a smaller size,\n\n440\n00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.110\nthen it's all about the bigger\ninformation, the more it has to travel.\n\n441\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.780\nSo that's why your phones\nactually give you that option.\n\n442\n00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:55.420\nLike, this really big picture,\ndo you want me to go ahead and resample?\n\n443\n00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.630\nTalking about that\nterminology that I threw out.\n\n444\n00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.540\nIt resamples your photographs.\n\n445\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.258\nAnd when the person receives it,\nthey receive the smaller version of it.\n\n446\n00:23:03.258 --> 00:23:08.230\nThat's a double-edged sword sometimes,\nin the sense of, I send you this.\n\n447\n00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.700\nIt doesn't even have to be through text,\nit can be through email.\n\n448\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.920\nI send you a smaller photograph, but if\nyou're supposed to put that in the front\n\n449\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.530\npage of the magazine,\nI've already re-sized it.\n\n450\n00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.820\n&gt;&gt; So it seems like I'm kind of forfeiting\nthat optimization for the speed,\n\n451\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.910\nthe network speed versus that quality.\n\n452\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.100\nSo it's kind of a give or take there.\n\n453\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.470\n&gt;&gt; And that's where you just have to\nknow when and where to do all of this.\n\n454\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.800\nIf I knew that you were printing this\nout on the cover of the magazine,\n\n455\n00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.160\nI would make sure to send\nyou like that actual size.\n\n456\n00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.920\nI would not have our phones or\nour emails, clients like say,\n\n457\n00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.660\nhey, do you want me to\nchange the size of it?\n\n458\n00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.770\nI think it's great that they do that,\n\n459\n00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.320\nit's just understanding why\nit's telling you to do that.\n\n460\n00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.100\nSo you could see that this photograph,\nhere are the kitties JPEG.\n\n461\n00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.823\nThis is back towards\nlike the 3000 by 4000.\n\n462\n00:23:50.823 --> 00:23:56.772\nBut if I go up to the kitties medium,\nsee I have the 1200 by 1600.\n\n463\n00:23:56.772 --> 00:23:59.566\nLittle smaller of a file, not too crazy.\n\n464\n00:23:59.566 --> 00:24:03.968\nBut if I head and go down to the small,\nnotice I sampled that down to 300 by 400,\n\n465\n00:24:03.968 --> 00:24:05.856\nand then I got the kitties playing.\n\n466\n00:24:05.856 --> 00:24:10.774\nYou can actually see here in the preview\nthat it looks a little blurry.\n\n467\n00:24:10.774 --> 00:24:14.860\nThat's because there is only\n60 pixels by 80 pixels.\n\n468\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.940\nThat's not a lot of information.\n\n469\n00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.920\nNow, this is be great if it's going as\na really small picture on a website,\n\n470\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.990\nwonderful.\n\n471\n00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:26.432\nThis would not look good printed\nunless it's really, really small.\n\n472\n00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:30.620\nAnd that's where people take these small\nfiles, they make them bigger in Word or\n\n473\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.540\nPowerPoint, and it's like,\nit just doesn't look good.\n\n474\n00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.550\nYou gotta start with\nenough information for\n\n475\n00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.390\nyou to be able to start changing things.\n\n476\n00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.700\nSo those are just some, just going back\ninto your files and understanding them.\n\n477\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:48.230\nNow, another thing in your MacOS that I\nwould always do, like maybe I'm back here\n\n478\n00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.430\nin this grid view, but\nI really want to see the information.\n\n479\n00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.110\nIf you do command i,\nwhich is like information, command\n\n480\n00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.410\ni brings up all of the metadata that\ncomes along with all of your photographs.\n\n481\n00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.610\nSo you can see, like when it's created,\nlike the RGB, it was on my iPhone 5s,\n\n482\n00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.390\nyou know, those types of stuff.\n\n483\n00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.940\nSo that always comes\nwith all of your files,\n\n484\n00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.050\nit's just the kind of hidden information.\n\n485\n00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.540\nSo a lot of times I'll just do command i\nso I can look at the different dimensions.\n\n486\n00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.680\nBut, like I said,\nI just learned this recently, so\n\n487\n00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.760\nit's like, I love these new tips and\ntricks, I'm passing along to you.\n\n488\n00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.664\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Vonne.\n\n489\n00:25:21.664 --> 00:25:22.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n490\n00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.830\nThat's what we do here, we love to share.\n\n491\n00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:29.525\nSo in the grid view, or the icon view,\ndon't be in the list view and\n\n492\n00:25:29.525 --> 00:25:31.015\ndon't be in the column view.\n\n493\n00:25:31.015 --> 00:25:36.255\nIn the grid view of your MacOS Finder,\nif you go into View and\n\n494\n00:25:36.255 --> 00:25:38.465\nyou go to Show View Options.\n\n495\n00:25:38.465 --> 00:25:41.355\nAnd I've actually been to this\ndialog box a couple times,\n\n496\n00:25:41.355 --> 00:25:46.210\nwhich is making my Finder do all\nthe things that I want to do.\n\n497\n00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.840\nBut in this grid view,\ndo you see where it says show item info?\n\n498\n00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.850\nIf I check that on, look at what it does.\n\n499\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.470\n&gt;&gt; Fancy.\n\n500\n00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.560\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nIt puts the image dimensions right there.\n\n501\n00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.240\nI'm like, this is awesome.\n\n502\n00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.130\nI was really excited about\nshowing you guys that,\n\n503\n00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.740\nbecause I just learned of this recently.\n\n504\n00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.899\nCuz I've always just been using this,\nbut sometimes like, then I have to like,\n\n505\n00:26:04.899 --> 00:26:06.860\nyou know,\nclick on each one to bring up the image.\n\n506\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.397\nI just want see it all one place,\nwell now I can.\n\n507\n00:26:10.397 --> 00:26:12.550\nI just go to the icon view and\n\n508\n00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.720\nchange those preferences in my Finder,\npretty neat.\n\n509\n00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.850\n&gt;&gt; I don't work with graphic\ndesign that much anymore.\n\n510\n00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.560\nBut hey, I mean even like knowing\nyour profile photo sizes and stuff.\n\n511\n00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.070\nYou're like, there there we go,\nyou don't even have to crop it.\n\n512\n00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.290\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n513\n00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.010\n&gt;&gt; And I mean,\n\n514\n00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:32.630\nyou are just on the ball today with\njust leading me into the very next thing\n\n515\n00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.270\nthat I wanna talk about.\n\n516\n00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:39.310\nWhich is using preview in your MacOS,\nbecause if I'm here in my files and\n\n517\n00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.320\nI want to open up let's say,\nthis picture right here.\n\n518\n00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.680\nIf I double click it by default,\nit opens up in Preview.\n\n519\n00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.900\nNow, preview can do some cool\nthings that you can resize those\n\n520\n00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.080\nphotographs cuz this is\na really big picture, right?\n\n521\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.040\nBut I know I need to make it smaller.\n\n522\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.900\nYou don't actually have to have\nPhotoshop or any of those other\n\n523\n00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.270\nprograms that I mentioned,\nyou could do it right here in Preview.\n\n524\n00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:04.220\nThis little button right here looks\nlike a little toolbar or a toolbox.\n\n525\n00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.520\nIt shows the markup toolbar and\n\n526\n00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.320\nit has some things in here that\nyou can do that's pretty neat.\n\n527\n00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.203\nLike this button right here,\nit says, Adjust Size.\n\n528\n00:27:13.203 --> 00:27:15.482\nIt looks like,\nit almost looks like a crop, okay?\n\n529\n00:27:15.482 --> 00:27:21.272\nBut if I take this, it brings up, this\nis the same thing that I do in Photoshop\n\n530\n00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:27.438\nall day long is come into the Image Size,\nand I'm doing it right here in Preview.\n\n531\n00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:28.505\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n532\n00:27:28.505 --> 00:27:31.332\nSo right here,\nyou might have this in inches, so I would,\n\n533\n00:27:31.332 --> 00:27:33.770\nI personally would change this to pixels.\n\n534\n00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.870\nNotice I can change the resolution,\nI can do all this kind of stuff.\n\n535\n00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:42.240\nSo that thing I was telling you,\nif I need this graphic to be 300 ppi,\n\n536\n00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.530\nalways when you're changing\nthe resolution, always uncheck resample.\n\n537\n00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.160\nAnd you see how it kinda\nlocks all these things down?\n\n538\n00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:56.090\nSo watch if I increase the resolution, the\nwidth and height in inches will go down.\n\n539\n00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.660\nThe pixels didn't change,\nI still have the same pixels, okay?\n\n540\n00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.890\nIt's the physical inches that's\ngoing to go ahead and decrease.\n\n541\n00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:09.140\nResolution goes up, the width and\nheight in inches will go down.\n\n542\n00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.530\nThat's just the way it's supposed to go.\n\n543\n00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.530\nIt doesn't do this cuz when you resample,\n\n544\n00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.430\nif I had like stopped that,\nI just hit the escape key.\n\n545\n00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:23.670\nAnd I kept the resampling, I'm like, yeah\nI'm just gonna go ahead and make this 300.\n\n546\n00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.270\nIt's doing it, but it's not right.\n\n547\n00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.110\nIt kept the 56 inches and 42 inches, and\n\n548\n00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.540\nit just made a whole bunch of\ninformation that didn't exist before.\n\n549\n00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.410\nYou don't want your computer.\n\n550\n00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.210\n&gt;&gt; So what does that do for\nthe output, the quality of that image?\n\n551\n00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.250\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, you probably wouldn't\nsee that much of a difference.\n\n552\n00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n553\n00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.030\n&gt;&gt; But, it's about the whole,\nlike working with what you have.\n\n554\n00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:52.540\nWhen it is making a whole bunch more\npixel information, that the computer\n\n555\n00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.000\nis deciding how the image is, cuz like\nthe width and height stay the same.\n\n556\n00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.930\nSo, the only way to make your resolution,\npixels per inch,\n\n557\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.250\nis to increase the overall pixels.\n\n558\n00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.788\nSo you just made your\nfile size a lot bigger.\n\n559\n00:29:03.788 --> 00:29:06.670\nYou just added a lot more\ninformation that didn't exist, and\n\n560\n00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.880\nmaybe the computer doesn't\nalways get it right.\n\n561\n00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.680\nWith this photograph, you probably\nwouldn't see that much of a difference.\n\n562\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.218\nYou know, it all depends.\n\n563\n00:29:15.218 --> 00:29:20.340\nIf you wanna do it the correct way,\nyou gotta uncheck resample,\n\n564\n00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.660\nchange the resolution, and\nthat's what it's supposed to do.\n\n565\n00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.020\nNow, there's another thing you can\ndo if just changing the resolution.\n\n566\n00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.920\nSay I needed to make this,\nI have to have it 800 pixels wide.\n\n567\n00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.090\nIt's just what I've\nbeen told I have to do.\n\n568\n00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.760\nYou can resize it here,\nkeep the resampling on,\n\n569\n00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.490\nchange this to pixels, and\nthen just make this 800.\n\n570\n00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.220\nAnd notice, look at what it says.\n\n571\n00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.190\nIt was 2 megs, now it's 90.\n\n572\n00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.646\nThat's how I made all of\nthe kitties small, kitties medium.\n\n573\n00:29:48.646 --> 00:29:52.130\nI did it right here in Preview,\nand then I can just go ahead and\n\n574\n00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.720\nsay, yep that's exactly what I want.\n\n575\n00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.325\nI click okay, the only thing I would say\nin Preview is that you can't do a file\n\n576\n00:29:59.325 --> 00:30:04.170\nsave as, you would need to duplicate\nthis cuz, see there's no save as.\n\n577\n00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.178\n&gt;&gt; It's just the nature of this.\n\n578\n00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:08.300\n&gt;&gt; You just rename it something different,\nlike small version of sunset [LAUGH].\n\n579\n00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly I would duplicate this,\nthis is my new version.\n\n580\n00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.670\nAnd then I would, so yeah,\nsmall sunset, or what have you.\n\n581\n00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:21.200\nAnd then in this one I\nwould save this file.\n\n582\n00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.590\nThis is my original,\nI would not close that file.\n\n583\n00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:28.365\nSo, notice I have this one at 4,000,\nand sunset small,\n\n584\n00:30:28.365 --> 00:30:31.280\nyou can see that I've got it at 800x600.\n\n585\n00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.600\nSo that's one thing that you do need help.\n\n586\n00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.460\n&gt;&gt; And you can definitely see\nthat relationship with the actual\n\n587\n00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.660\nfile size there with the smaller one.\n\n588\n00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.450\nAnd I think that one was what,\n90 kilobytes?\n\n589\n00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.840\nSo pretty small.\n\n590\n00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 88 now versus 2 megs.\n\n591\n00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.760\nSo my other suggestion would\nbe before I even do it,\n\n592\n00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.660\nI actually duplicate\nthe original file here.\n\n593\n00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.790\nLike I would take this one,\nand I would just.\n\n594\n00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.150\n&gt;&gt; And then work with a copy?\n\n595\n00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:56.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n596\n00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.540\nI would duplicate this, and\nthen open this up in preview.\n\n597\n00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.440\nGo ahead and change my stuff in here.\n\n598\n00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.880\nLet's make this like 400 pixels cuz\nI know I need to put it on a website.\n\n599\n00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.510\nClick okay, save this.\n\n600\n00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.780\nAnd so that way it's like all right I'm\njust saving that particular file and\n\n601\n00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.350\nnow I've got the two different versions.\n\n602\n00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.550\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So a few little things,\n\n603\n00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.800\ndefinitely wanted to throw out, you know,\n\n604\n00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.360\nworking with Preview to be\nable to size your images.\n\n605\n00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.510\nCuz it's pretty neat that you can do it\nwithout going to all those other image\n\n606\n00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.770\nediting programs like I mentioned.\n\n607\n00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:32.170\nAnd just know that there are some things\nthat you do need to do outside of Word.\n\n608\n00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.960\nWord is not a graphic editor.\n\n609\n00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.308\nIt's got a lot of cool\nfeatures that you can do, but,\n\n610\n00:31:37.308 --> 00:31:39.460\nlike you know with changing the colors and\nstuff.\n\n611\n00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.000\nBut the resolution and the size and\nyou really should just have\n\n612\n00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.410\nan understanding of it outside of Word,\nknowing those file types now.\n\n613\n00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.320\nThat white box thing is a JPEG file\nversus GIF, which is transparency.\n\n614\n00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.180\nSo just a little introduction to images.\n\n615\n00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.870\nThere's tons of this stuff online if\nyou wanna just, just go ahead and\n\n616\n00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.515\nconsult the oracle and just say,\nyou know, image types.\n\n617\n00:32:01.515 --> 00:32:03.784\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And, you know, file resolution,\n\n618\n00:32:03.784 --> 00:32:05.360\nthere's lots of information about it.\n\n619\n00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.670\nAnd I probably talk about it in\nquite a few other episodes too.\n\n620\n00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, I feel like I'm\nready to go ahead and order\n\n621\n00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.890\na whole bunch of shirts with my picture\non them for all my friends and family.\n\n622\n00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.925\nI'm sure they would love\nthat as a gift this year.\n\n623\n00:32:15.925 --> 00:32:20.386\nAnd I'd be like, yeah, Vonne taught me all\nabout the different sizes, so here you go.\n\n624\n00:32:20.386 --> 00:32:22.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I want one of those shirts.\n\n625\n00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you so\nmuch for time today, Vonne.\n\n626\n00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.480\nAnd thank you for your time as well, but\nwe're just getting started here with\n\n627\n00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.880\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Advanced for\nMac users.\n\n628\n00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.450\nThank you for joining us but\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n629\n00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.860\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n630\n00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n631\n00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.157\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at OfficePro.\n\n632\n00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:44.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm wonderful, I'm so glad to be back.\n\n10\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.410\nHow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, so I'm actually really\nexcited because now that we've learned\n\n12\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.150\nabout what kind of images there are\nexisting out there in the wild Word west.\n\n13\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.300\nWe now need to think about what we're\ngonna be doing with those images, right?\n\n14\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.590\nSo hopefully you'll be able\nto shed some light and\n\n15\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.125\nI'll be able to have some\nreally great graphics.\n\n16\n00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.704\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're still gonna go ahead and\n\n17\n00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:55.630\nhave our cats.\n\n18\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.781\nI mean we've gotta stick with the cats.\n\n19\n00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Adding images into Word it's, well,\n\n20\n00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:02.385\nyou just go ahead and\ngo to the Insert tab.\n\n21\n00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:04.572\nCuz I think it sounds logical, right?\n\n22\n00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:08.180\nYou wanna add something, you wanna insert\na picture, so you go to the Insert tab,\n\n23\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.140\nand then we have a couple options.\n\n24\n00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.670\nAnd then I'll do a little comparing and\n\n25\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.400\ncontrasting to Windows cuz there's\none thing that is kind of,\n\n26\n00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.240\nin my mind missing but that's just me\ncuz we're in Mac and that's okay so.\n\n27\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're all right with that so,\n\n28\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.430\nwhy don't we go ahead and\njump down in to our document.\n\n29\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.570\nI just have a new document started and\n\n30\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.020\nwe're gonna add into existing documents\nthat have texts and everything and\n\n31\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.020\nthe next step is we're gonna\nstart talking about formatting.\n\n32\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.560\nIn this, all we're gonna do is add them,\n\n33\n00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.380\nthat's the whole kind of context\nof this particular episode.\n\n34\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.358\nSo let's go over that Insert tab,\nand notice that we have Pictures,\n\n35\n00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:48.041\neven I keep saying image,\nthey have picture.\n\n36\n00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.176\nI'm pretty sure it's image in windows, and\n\n37\n00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.109\nnow I'm thinking about like I\ndon't even remember so [LAUGH].\n\n38\n00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.893\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n39\n00:01:53.893 --> 00:01:56.760\n&gt;&gt; But it's either pictures or\nimages and you can see that\n\n40\n00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.780\nI have two different options here,\nI can insert from the photo browser or\n\n41\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.310\nI can insert from the picture from file.\n\n42\n00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.910\nNow well, what's the difference?\n\n43\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.690\n&gt;&gt; File sounds pretty self explanatory,\nI get that, I can navigate to the path.\n\n44\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.211\nBut what about I don't know what\nthe browser is you might have to help me\n\n45\n00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:14.784\nwith this one.\n\n46\n00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:20.646\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is the Mac specific thing\nbecause in your Mac OS you have photos,\n\n47\n00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:23.510\nthe place where you actually have.\n\n48\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.720\nI took it out of the dock but\nit's the colorful picture thing,\n\n49\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.330\nwhich you see on your iPhone and\nthings like that.\n\n50\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.022\nSo that's actually what I'll do here so\nwhy don't we go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:37.230\nopen these two operators quickly so if\nyou see photo browser, this is my photos.\n\n52\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.880\nYou can see the icon up there at\nthe top that it's actually going into\n\n53\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.870\nthat particular application.\n\n54\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.160\nAnd that's how a Mac OS does a lot of how\nit stores your photographs and how you\n\n55\n00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.960\ndo your photo steams and your importing in\nfrom your iPhone, it goes right in photos.\n\n56\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.359\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is kind of similar,\nI know Windows environment to file explore\n\n57\n00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.144\nand just be navigating\nto that photo directory.\n\n58\n00:03:01.144 --> 00:03:02.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like yes.\n\n59\n00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:06.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But look at this one it's from picture\n\n60\n00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:10.090\nfrom file,\nthat just takes you out to your finder.\n\n61\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.115\nWhich would be the equivalent\nof Windows Explorer.\n\n62\n00:03:12.115 --> 00:03:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay so not exactly.\n\n63\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's where it's a very Mac\nspecific thing of your photo browser\n\n64\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.120\ncuz like in Windows you\nhave your Pictures folder.\n\n65\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.670\nBut really you put your pictures wherever\nyou wanna put your pictures, right?\n\n66\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.970\nMac is a little bit more specific and\n\n67\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.830\nI don't know if I wanna say intuitive,\nbecause you just put your pictures in it.\n\n68\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.990\nYou connect your phone to your Mac,\nit's gonna say,\n\n69\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.480\ndo you wanna put your\nphotos in your photos?\n\n70\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.400\nYes exactly,\n[LAUGH] that’s just where it goes.\n\n71\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.475\nSo it is very much like Windows,\n\n72\n00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:48.550\ncuz it’s just two different\nplaces where you store it.\n\n73\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.200\nBut if you are a Mac user like me,\n\n74\n00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.410\nwhen you put your photos into Photos,\nthe actual application.\n\n75\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.035\nIt creates a library and\nsometimes moving that around can be,\n\n76\n00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:03.954\nI found it pretty easy but\nother people might find it challenging.\n\n77\n00:04:03.954 --> 00:04:08.312\nBecause it does just kind of have that\nextra bubble if you want to say of where\n\n78\n00:04:08.312 --> 00:04:13.175\nyour pictures go into rather than just a\nregular folder in your conference system.\n\n79\n00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:16.849\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I was kind of wondering\nwith that browser, does that OS look for\n\n80\n00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.523\njust those images Carte Blanche or\nsay, if you put them on your desktop,\n\n81\n00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:21.930\nit will also show up there?\n\n82\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.431\nOr is it only looking in\nthat specific directory?\n\n83\n00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:26.783\n&gt;&gt; It goes specifically to\nthe photos app in a sense and so\n\n84\n00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:29.180\nlet's look at it again one more time.\n\n85\n00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.680\nSo I just wanna had-\n&gt;&gt;

Bleeding over the edges or anything.\n\n149\n00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you only see like one little\ncorner of sky because it's so big.\n\n150\n00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.052\nIt doesn't do that when\nyou insert the picture.\n\n151\n00:07:58.052 --> 00:08:03.230\nSo that's kinda nice it just contains\nit with how that big photograph is.\n\n152\n00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.629\nNow I’m just gonna hit the Delete key on\nmy keyboard just to get rid of it, but\n\n153\n00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:09.628\nI do wanna show you if I went back and\nentered the picture from file.\n\n154\n00:08:09.628 --> 00:08:14.478\nWe know from the last episode\nthat we have a kitty's tiny, and\n\n155\n00:08:14.478 --> 00:08:18.070\nthat’s only 60 pixels by 80 pixels.\n\n156\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.170\nAnd if I insert that,\nnotice that's how big it is and\n\n157\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.342\nif we zoom in on this,\nyou can see it doesn't really,\n\n158\n00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:27.890\nit kind of looks pixelated,\nit's a really small picture.\n\n159\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.817\nAnd we'll get into sizing later, but\n\n160\n00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:33.730\njust for demonstration purposes-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n161\n00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.731\nyou mean we're not supposed to just pull\nthe corner and drag it on out, Vonne?\n\n162\n00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:38.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean you can, but\n\n163\n00:08:38.903 --> 00:08:40.630\nyou're gonna get a pixelated picture.\n\n164\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.137\nThat's just how it goes,\n\n165\n00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:46.390\nbecause the image did not have enough\ninformation in there to begin with.\n\n166\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.098\nBut if I went and put in the kitties,\neven the medium one,\n\n167\n00:08:50.098 --> 00:08:52.193\nthat's still a decent amount.\n\n168\n00:08:52.193 --> 00:08:53.423\n&gt;&gt; An improvement.\n\n169\n00:08:53.423 --> 00:08:57.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna go ahead and,\nthat looks much better.\n\n170\n00:08:57.692 --> 00:08:59.210\nThey're so cute.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.900\n&gt;&gt;

Minimize.\n&gt;&gt; Minimized, yes.\n\n240\n00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:36.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now if I bring this back up,\n\n241\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.330\nlet's go ahead and I'm using my command\nTab by the way to switch back and\n\n242\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.480\nforth between my applications.\n\n243\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.690\nIf I go to the screen shot,\nwell there's the PowerPoint.\n\n244\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.780\nSo you need to make sure you have all\nof the things that you're working in,\n\n245\n00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.900\nyour windows or\napplications opened and maximized.\n\n246\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.930\nThey're not minimized in there so\nnow you can choose,\n\n247\n00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:00.108\nhey maybe I'm doing a whole thing\nabout a tutorial using PowerPoint.\n\n248\n00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:05.830\nAnd I wanna show the whole screen of\nwhat's going on here in PowerPoint.\n\n249\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:11.649\nI can just insert it as a screenshot and\nit just poof, there you go I love that.\n\n250\n00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:17.680\nNow sometimes I don't need to have\nthe whole Window of what I'm working on.\n\n251\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.560\nWindow meaning this versus this,\nwell there's my finder, sorry.\n\n252\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.460\nSafari, so on and so forth,\nI just want a piece of it.\n\n253\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.957\nI really only want to bring up this\nlittle part of this particular Window or\n\n254\n00:13:31.957 --> 00:13:34.625\nfile or whatever you have going on.\n\n255\n00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:38.050\nThat's where you can use\nthe screen clipping.\n\n256\n00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:42.355\nNow the thing about the screen clipping,\nlet me show you, if I go down here,\n\n257\n00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:45.090\nit's just gonna clip out\npart of your screen.\n\n258\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.120\nBut watch, when I click this you\nhave to be very careful about\n\n259\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.090\nhow your Windows are organized, right?\n\n260\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.930\nNow notice, I went ahead, and\nit's right on the Safari,\n\n261\n00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.950\nbut I'm gonna hit\nthe Escape key by the way.\n\n262\n00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.560\nOnce you're in it, and you're like,\nwait it's the wrong one.\n\n263\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.900\nHit the Escape and\nit will go ahead and bring that down.\n\n264\n00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.830\nBecause it will minimize Word,\ndim down everything else on your screen.\n\n265\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.730\nIt almost kinda locks it in place and\nthen you go ahead and\n\n266\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.880\ncut out the part you want.\n\n267\n00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.607\n&gt;&gt; That could be pretty nerve wracking\nespecially if you're working on a document\n\n268\n00:14:13.607 --> 00:14:17.406\nand you didn't hits the E and you made\nsome changes and you're like, I wanna go.\n\n269\n00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:18.145\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I've\n\n270\n00:14:18.145 --> 00:14:18.878\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:19.983\n&gt;&gt; I've gotten myself pretty confused.\n\n272\n00:14:19.983 --> 00:14:21.049\nI'm like, where am I?\n\n273\n00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:25.809\nBut what I would need to do, if I wanted\nto cut out part of the PowerPoint,\n\n274\n00:14:25.809 --> 00:14:29.480\nyou have to get to what\nyou want clipped out.\n\n275\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.150\nThen go ahead and bring up Word, so\nthat way it's like a stacking order.\n\n276\n00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:39.170\n&gt;&gt; So are you manually clipping,\nwith a cropping tool, or a drawing tool?\n\n277\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.260\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, so\nif I go to screen clipping,\n\n278\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.750\nnotice, it sucked it down to\nwhatever is right behind Word.\n\n279\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.608\nAnd that's where I was kinda flipping back\nand forth between my applications to get\n\n280\n00:14:48.608 --> 00:14:51.600\nPowerPoint because maybe I just\nreally wanted to take this out-\n\n281\n00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.263\n&gt;&gt; So it has to be closest, logically, or\n\n282\n00:14:55.263 --> 00:14:56.365\nyeah.\n\n283\n00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:58.527\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's gotta be right underneath\n\n284\n00:14:58.527 --> 00:14:59.190\nit, yeah.\n\n285\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.488\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now I can take,\n\n286\n00:15:00.488 --> 00:15:03.817\nand you can see my I-beam,\nit looks kind of a little cross-hair,\n\n287\n00:15:03.817 --> 00:15:05.850\nit's right up here, it's kinda hard.\n\n288\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:06.840\n&gt;&gt; I see it.\n\n289\n00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now if I take,\n\n290\n00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.480\ncuz I really only want this little part\nyou see I just click, hold, and drag,\n\n291\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:17.860\nI'm just randomly picking a spot let go\nand it pops in just that little piece.\n\n292\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.090\nAnd that's what I use this a lot for\nwithin an application.\n\n293\n00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:25.040\nIf I only wanna show you\nthis new slide button so\n\n294\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.840\nI'll kind of organize where my windows\nare in relationship to Word, go ahead and\n\n295\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.242\nsay insert screen clipping, grab that\nlittle piece out, and then I've got that.\n\n296\n00:15:35.242 --> 00:15:37.263\nI really-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great for tutorials because,\n\n297\n00:15:37.263 --> 00:15:40.732\nI mean you could even write on top\nof it and say, click this button.\n\n298\n00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:41.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n299\n00:15:41.235 --> 00:15:43.227\nyes cuz we're gonna be inserting shapes,\n\n300\n00:15:43.227 --> 00:15:45.840\nand then I go ahead and\ndo my stacking order and all that.\n\n301\n00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.340\nAnd so yes, I use this lot, again,\n\n302\n00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.400\nthe biggest suggestion is making sure\nyou have the right stacking order.\n\n303\n00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.262\nAnd again, I'm using that Cmd tab\nto get if I wanted something out of\n\n304\n00:15:57.262 --> 00:16:00.945\nSafari got to have this then\ngo ahead bring up Word.\n\n305\n00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:03.555\nThen do my screen clipping, and\n\n306\n00:16:03.555 --> 00:16:08.300\nyou can see that now I'm back in Mac or\nSafari's upfront.\n\n307\n00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.870\nRemember, Esc, we're gonna go ahead and\ncancel that and you can move out of there.\n\n308\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:16.761\nSo full windows or screen-clippings and\n\n309\n00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:21.470\nit's again, you're leaning back in,\nhey, sometimes I wanna write on them.\n\n310\n00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:27.280\nSo this is outside of Word,\nthis is back on your Mac OS,\n\n311\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.580\nbecause there are ways, and\nthat's why I brought this website up.\n\n312\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.770\nThere are ways to you can\ntake a screenshot in Mac,\n\n313\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:37.370\nthat I do a lot, you know in\nWindows you have the snipping tool?\n\n314\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.201\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n315\n00:16:38.201 --> 00:16:40.760\nthis is like the Mac version\nof the snipping tool.\n\n316\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.506\n&gt;&gt; I love the snipping tool.\n\n317\n00:16:41.506 --> 00:16:42.388\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\n\n318\n00:16:42.388 --> 00:16:44.518\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's why I love to show\n\n319\n00:16:44.518 --> 00:16:45.660\nthis stuff.\n\n320\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.010\nSo, you could see that,\nif you do Shift+Cmd+3,\n\n321\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.140\nthat just takes the whole\nscreenshot of your whole desktop.\n\n322\n00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.790\nLike, if I did that right now, it actually\nwent, I don't have my sound on right now.\n\n323\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.620\nIt does that little [SOUND].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n324\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.878\n&gt;&gt; You know, where it makes that picture\n\n325\n00:16:58.878 --> 00:17:00.899\nsound\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, what does it sound like?\n\n326\n00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:04.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I could turn it on if you want.\n\n327\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I kind of like my sound effects better.\n\n328\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.544\n&gt;&gt; I'm just messing with you.\n\n329\n00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:12.429\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But see it went ahead and\n\n330\n00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:17.594\nmade that screenshot of my whole desktop\nby doing that particular command.\n\n331\n00:17:17.594 --> 00:17:23.159\nBut if I wanted a piece of my screen,\nwhere the snipping tool,\n\n332\n00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:28.403\ncoming back over to here,\nif you do Shift+Cmd+4 then,\n\n333\n00:17:28.403 --> 00:17:31.268\nhere I'll do it-\n&gt;&gt; It'll be more of a cropping type\n\n334\n00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:32.030\nof feature?\n\n335\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I can come out here and say,\n\n336\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.044\nI just want like this portion of\nthe screen for whatever reason.\n\n337\n00:17:38.044 --> 00:17:41.884\nAnd then notice it makes this,\nactually this is a PNG,\n\n338\n00:17:41.884 --> 00:17:44.565\ntalking about file formats, right?\n\n339\n00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:45.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n340\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.420\nnow I can come here into my\npreview by just opening it.\n\n341\n00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.600\nJust like the last program,\nor the last show that we did,\n\n342\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.420\nI can use my markup toolbar, and\nI can come over to this pen and be like,\n\n343\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.300\nI really want you to concentrate\nright here at this little button.\n\n344\n00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.840\nOkay, I was trying to make an arrow.\n\n345\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.592\nBut you get the idea that I can\ngo ahead and just draw on this\n\n346\n00:18:07.592 --> 00:18:13.150\nparticular file and\nthen lets just save this as my screenshot.\n\n347\n00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.237\nBecause I do like to write on\nthe pictures but lots of time,\n\n348\n00:18:16.237 --> 00:18:19.020\nI'll do it outside of Word\ncuz this is easier for me.\n\n349\n00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.867\nI just edit and\ndraw right on the image and\n\n350\n00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:27.290\nthen in Word,\nI come back into here, come on.\n\n351\n00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.260\nYou want to come back, there we go.\n\n352\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.731\nAnd we'll make a new document.\n\n353\n00:18:31.731 --> 00:18:35.597\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, you're not the only person that\nmust enjoy this because like I said,\n\n354\n00:18:35.597 --> 00:18:36.550\nI do as well.\n\n355\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.290\nAnd although on a PC we use\nsomething called the Snipping Tool.\n\n356\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:45.090\nBut even in Apple's Mobile OS,\nso iOS, they now have\n\n357\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.070\nthe feature where you can actually take\nthat screenshot and then edit it and work\n\n358\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.190\nwith it a little easier I think because\nit's just becoming, it's just so popular.\n\n359\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.744\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely and I relay like that.\n\n360\n00:18:55.744 --> 00:18:58.840\nAnd I will say that Word decided to\nget a little weird on me for a second.\n\n361\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.227\nSo I'm glad you're talking\nthere cuz I just went ahead and\n\n362\n00:19:01.227 --> 00:19:03.280\ngrabbed up another\ndocument really quickly.\n\n363\n00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.131\nCuz I just wanted to show you go ahead and\ndo the snipping and\n\n364\n00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:13.180\nediting outside of Word,\nthen you can just drag and drop it.\n\n365\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.310\nI use both,\nif I don't need to mark up the picture,\n\n366\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.300\nI'll go into the Insert and\ndo the screen clipping.\n\n367\n00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:27.080\nIf I need to draw on it I'll do it outside\nof Word, do all the stuff in preview,\n\n368\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.088\nand then drag and drop that picture in,\nso pretty cool stuff.\n\n369\n00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:31.545\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and there we go, and\n\n370\n00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:34.091\nI think we need to do\na little bit of a restart,\n\n371\n00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:36.843\nbecause Word has decided\nto kind of lock up on me.\n\n372\n00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.610\nSo it's a perfect way to\nend the episode [LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.119\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a great plan,\n\n374\n00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:42.864\nVonne but you don't want to miss anything,\n\n375\n00:19:42.864 --> 00:19:45.000\nso stay tuned for\nwhat we have headed your way.\n\n376\n00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.840\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n377\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.460\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n378\n00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.230\n&gt;&gt;

Thank you,\nit's always a pleasure to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.440\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n11\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.400\n&gt;&gt; So like you said we're going\nto be formatting our images.\n\n12\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.910\nNow, we're going to be\ngetting into the resizing.\n\n13\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.390\nWe're gonna be cropping.\n\n14\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.270\nWe're gonna maybe make it black and\nwhite, do all those different things.\n\n15\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.870\nAnd some really cool stuff that they now\nhave built into your Office products.\n\n16\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.170\nThey've had it around for\na couple of years, but I still,\n\n17\n00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.010\nevery time I teach this stuff, I'm always\njust I don't know it still gets me.\n\n18\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.730\nI'm like wow you can do\nall of this right here.\n\n19\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.253\nIt's still pretty fantastic to me, even\nthough it's been like quite some time.\n\n20\n00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:06.840\n&gt;&gt; Well you mentioned, and I think it was\nthe first show we talked about like hey\n\n21\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.840\nthis might not be your product of choice\nif you are doing this full time as\n\n22\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.220\nyou know and sending images to print.\n\n23\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.235\nBut it is really cool that,\nhey, I don't have to go out and\n\n24\n00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:23.230\nhave this additional expense, it's just\nintegrated right here in this product.\n\n25\n00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and a lot of\nthe things that you see in Photoshop,\n\n26\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.660\nit's almost like the same name,\nthe same filter.\n\n27\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.220\nIt's really, it's pretty neat.\n\n28\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.400\nSo that's what we're gonna be\ncovering in this particular episode.\n\n29\n00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.590\nSo why don't we get started.\n\n30\n00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.710\nI have two documents actually.\n\n31\n00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.227\nI have just a blank document, and I also\nhave a file called AddGraphics.tscx,\n\n32\n00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:45.180\nit's in your exercises file, so\nthat you can go and follow along.\n\n33\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.535\nBecause I wanted to use the pictures\nin relationship to what you're probably\n\n34\n00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:53.590\ngonna be using, Word, which there's\ngonna be words around it [LAUGH].\n\n35\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.600\nSo we need to talk about word wrap and\nhow like moving our images and\n\n36\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.970\nplacing them makes a big deal and what\nbuttons that we need to push for that.\n\n37\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.490\nBut why don't we start with just adding an\nimage here into this particular document.\n\n38\n00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.070\nBecause we're first gonna talk about\nresizing your images and cropping or\n\n39\n00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.170\nmoving them around.\n\n40\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.420\nSo those are the two ones\nwe need to go with first.\n\n41\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.490\nLet's go with, let's just take Mr.\n\n42\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.900\nFuego Pants back out here again and\nwe will drag and drop him.\n\n43\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380\nI'm just using like from\nthe finder dragging and\n\n44\n00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.990\ndropping it into our Word document.\n\n45\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.020\nAnd so\nyou can see this is a pretty big picture.\n\n46\n00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.560\nSo if I zoom out of this file\nit takes almost like the whole.\n\n47\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.733\nWow, that actually looks kind of nice,\nright?\n\n48\n00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:38.705\n[LAUGH] It fits the whole page,\nall the margins all there.\n\n49\n00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:42.030\nIt's a nice like framed photograph,\nif you want to say.\n\n50\n00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.605\nSo with this, he's kind of big, though.\n\n51\n00:02:44.605 --> 00:02:47.890\nSo I need to make him\na little bit smaller.\n\n52\n00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.910\nSo you need to watch your\nmouse cursor icons with\n\n53\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.520\nanything that you do in\nyour Office products.\n\n54\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.260\nBut when you're working with images,\nyou're gonna see some different ones.\n\n55\n00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.580\nYou can see that I get my four-pointed\narrow with like a little half arrow on it\n\n56\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.320\nwhen I hover over the picture.\n\n57\n00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.300\nJust that, that just means that I'm\nover something that can be selected.\n\n58\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.810\nSo if you click on it,\n\n59\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.562\nalso notice around the corners you\nsee that the little dots come up.\n\n60\n00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:15.220\nDots, squares, whatever you want\nto call that particular shape.\n\n61\n00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess they really are squares,\n\n62\n00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:17.310\neven though I call them dots.\n\n63\n00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.010\nThose are just indicating that\nyou have the image selected.\n\n64\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.596\nThe other way you know you have the image\nselected is up towards the top you get\n\n65\n00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:26.610\nthis little swirly thing.\n\n66\n00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.650\nRight there, that swirly thing\nswirls it around, it rotates it.\n\n67\n00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All my technical terminology for\n\n68\n00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:33.152\nthis stuff.\n\n69\n00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:33.711\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n\n70\n00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:37.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The other way you know the picture is\n\n71\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.160\nselected is up on the ribbon\nyou get our contextual tab.\n\n72\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.240\nThe tab that comes up only if\nyou have that item selected.\n\n73\n00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.715\nFor example, if I click off of this\nphotograph, notice it goes away,\n\n74\n00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:54.560\nsingle-click on the image brings\nup that Picture Format tab,\n\n75\n00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.040\nwhich will give you all of things that\nyou can do to format your picture.\n\n76\n00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.230\nSo, we'll be coming back to\na lot of these different things.\n\n77\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.000\nAnd because of the resolution\nof my monitor and\n\n78\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.150\nhow wide my document is, notice how,\nlook, all these other buttons came up.\n\n79\n00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.020\nSo you might see a lot more things\non your Picture Format tab than\n\n80\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.750\nyou see on my screen just\nbecause of the resolution and\n\n81\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.490\nthe size of the window that I\nhave within the Word application.\n\n82\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.500\nSo that's how you know that\nyou have the picture selected.\n\n83\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.000\nSo what about resizing this image?\n\n84\n00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.620\nI wanna make this smaller.\n\n85\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.110\nDo not grab from the sides.\n\n86\n00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.640\nWell, I would suggest for you not to grab\nfrom the top, bottom, left or right.\n\n87\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.908\nBecause it's not gonna\nkeep it in proportion.\n\n88\n00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:46.971\nIt's not gonna constrain your\nproportions and it's gonna squash or\n\n89\n00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:48.570\nstretch your picture.\n\n90\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.420\nIf you go from any corner, and for\nthis one I tend to go to the bottom right.\n\n91\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.000\nI take the bottom right and\nI get the two-pointed arrows.\n\n92\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.380\nMight be hard to see on my monitor, but\nthere you can see it a little bit better.\n\n93\n00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.920\nThat's in the case I'll\nbe able to resize it,\n\n94\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.885\nyou just don't have to hold the Shift key.\n\n95\n00:05:04.885 --> 00:05:06.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know some of you,\n\n96\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.650\n&gt;&gt; I know, that's my go-to, my life saver,\n\n97\n00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.770\nlike don't you mess up my picture.\n\n98\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.800\nHold down the Shift key.\n\n99\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, well, the cool thing is\nin your Office products if you go from\n\n100\n00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.050\na corner,\nyou don't have to hold the Shift key.\n\n101\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.600\n&gt;&gt; Hah.\n&gt;&gt; It will automatically do that for you.\n\n102\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.380\nSee, it's not squashing\nit one way the other.\n\n103\n00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because I went from a corner.\n\n104\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.308\nIf I had gone from the side, see, that's\nwhere you're gonna get your squashing.\n\n105\n00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:31.770\nAnd that's why you don't wanna do it.\n\n106\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.632\nAnd I just did a Command + Z,\nby the way, to undo, for\n\n107\n00:05:34.632 --> 00:05:36.552\nyou all not seeing what I'm doing.\n\n108\n00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:37.954\nI'm using keyboard shortcuts.\n\n109\n00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:40.830\nSo that's just something to know\nin all of your Office products.\n\n110\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.640\nCorner, proportions are constrained, yes.\n\n111\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.138\nDon't wanna squash Mr. Fuego Pants.\n\n112\n00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:50.670\nSometimes I wanna squash him cuz he\ncan get really annoying like this\n\n113\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.840\nmorning when he was pawing at the door.\n\n114\n00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.708\nIt's like, it's 5:30, stop.\n\n115\n00:05:56.708 --> 00:06:02.070\nSo [LAUGH] so those are the ways that you\ncould go ahead and resize your pictures.\n\n116\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.470\nNow, let me zoom in a little bit on this.\n\n117\n00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.500\nYou can also rotate the picture,\n\n118\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.990\nwhile we're talking about these\ndifferent options that we can do.\n\n119\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.870\nIf you get to that top, now for\n\n120\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.960\nsome reason mine is not looking\nlike the swirly arrows.\n\n121\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.090\nBut normally if you go on that little\ndot up there it should do the swirlies.\n\n122\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.530\nIt's just doing a little\nweird visual thing on me.\n\n123\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.460\nBut if I click and hold,\nthat's what you're supposed to look like.\n\n124\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.380\nAnd notice I can go ahead and\nrotate this photograph around.\n\n125\n00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.840\nNow, the reason why it did some weird\nkind of like twistings in there,\n\n126\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.090\nwas the way that I have\nthe word wrap on it.\n\n127\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.390\nWe'll get to that in a little bit.\n\n128\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.435\nBut I just wanted to let you know that\nthose are the buttons that you see on\n\n129\n00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:46.930\na selected image and\nthe different things that you can do.\n\n130\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.640\nGo by a corner, you can do this,\nbut you're gonna stretch it.\n\n131\n00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.140\nAnd it looks kinda weird.\n\n132\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.560\nSo [LAUGH] if you do that always do\nthe undo if you wanna get back and\n\n133\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.560\nI can kinda just get back to\nwhere I wanted to start from.\n\n134\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.550\nNow, the thing is, sometimes I\ncan get this totally messed up.\n\n135\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.400\nWhat if I squashed it, and\nmaybe I can't undo this.\n\n136\n00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.860\nI can't stop and go back.\n\n137\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.258\nI just need a way of like,\ncan I just like-\n\n138\n00:07:15.258 --> 00:07:16.246\n&gt;&gt; Unsquish him.\n\n139\n00:07:16.246 --> 00:07:17.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n140\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.350\nCan I unsquish him?\n\n141\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.250\nThat's a perfect way to say it.\n\n142\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.260\nI want to reset the photograph.\n\n143\n00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.470\nSo I wanted to throw this out there\nin the very beginning because\n\n144\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.700\nwe're gonna kinda circle back\naround to what this button does,\n\n145\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.565\nbecause it has a few little weird things\nwith it that you just need to be aware of.\n\n146\n00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:36.570\nIt's this button right here,\n\n147\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.878\nit probably has some more next to\nit if you have a wider resolution.\n\n148\n00:07:39.878 --> 00:07:44.410\nYou have reset picture but\nthen you also have reset picture in size.\n\n149\n00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.640\nNow right now you're thinking, we'll\njust reset it and you click on it and\n\n150\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.666\nit doesn't work.\n\n151\n00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:51.084\nYou're like hm.\n\n152\n00:07:51.084 --> 00:07:53.489\nThe reason why that one, the first option,\n\n153\n00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:57.066\nthe reset picture would be if you\nhad added things like borders and\n\n154\n00:07:57.066 --> 00:08:00.204\ncolor corrections that we'll\nget to a little bit later.\n\n155\n00:08:00.204 --> 00:08:04.860\nBut that's what the reset picture is\ngonna do, take all that stuff off.\n\n156\n00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.168\nThe reset picture and\nsize makes sense, right?\n\n157\n00:08:09.168 --> 00:08:10.870\nIt's gonna change the size\nof the image too.\n\n158\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.720\nSo watch what happens, I'm gonna\nzoom out this so you can see this.\n\n159\n00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.500\nI'm gonna click on that, I'm gonna go\nto the, reset picture and size and\n\n160\n00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.248\nit's like what is that,\nwhere did fuego go.\n\n161\n00:08:21.248 --> 00:08:26.150\n[LAUGH] He's gone no it's just\nbecause remember that whole\n\n162\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.610\nthing about Image resolution,\nremember how big that photograph was.\n\n163\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:35.930\nIt was 2500 by 3200 pixels,\nthat's a big picture right?\n\n164\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.290\nThat's where it resized it and it didn't\ncare about the boundaries of the page.\n\n165\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.140\nIt did nicely when we inserted\nto fit nice and pretty.\n\n166\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.250\nIt's showing its native size which can be\na little alarming at first because you're\n\n167\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.870\nlike\n&gt;&gt; Where does the photo go?\n\n168\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.910\n&gt;&gt; And so then you say, it got in the\ncorner and you start sizing it down and\n\n169\n00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:00.300\nit's just like I can't even get it\nto where I have to take it back.\n\n170\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.190\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you had an image that\nyou had shot in raw for the format, and\n\n171\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.590\nit wasn't a larger image to work with.\n\n172\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.610\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yes.\n\n173\n00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.420\nI mean, it's keeping all of that\ninformation and when you click Reset\n\n174\n00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.360\nthe Size, it will go to its native format\nand won't pay attention, but the cool\n\n175\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.350\nthing is, did it on purpose to show you\nanother way of resizing your images.\n\n176\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.660\nYes, we can do it visually\nby the handles but\n\n177\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.180\nhonest picture format tab is over here.\n\n178\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.490\nI can change the width and\n\n179\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:37.090\nheight right in these fields where I\ncan type in that particular numbers.\n\n180\n00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.580\nNotice that right here it is constrained.\n\n181\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.245\nYou probably want to keep those\non when you're doing photographs.\n\n182\n00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:44.007\n&gt;&gt; So we're not seeing that distortion?\n\n183\n00:09:44.007 --> 00:09:45.541\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're not squashing Fuego.\n\n184\n00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:46.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The technical term.\n\n185\n00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\ncuz we're very technical here.\n\n186\n00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.470\nSo we go here and if I change the height,\ncuz 38 inches, that's pretty big.\n\n187\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.900\nLet's just start with four and now,\nyou're like, it didn't change anything.\n\n188\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.770\nYou have to hit the tab key or just\nclick out of this cuz it has to accept-\n\n189\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.410\n&gt;&gt; Just to see that height to width ratio?\n\n190\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.637\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it has to know,\nyou're done this this?\n\n191\n00:10:08.637 --> 00:10:10.260\nOkay, let me go ahead and\nchange the height for you.\n\n192\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.540\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's the easiest way and\n\n193\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.780\nthat's where it's a four by\nthree picture and lovely.\n\n194\n00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.690\nMaybe then you change it back to, maybe\nit's six inches wide and then hit the tab,\n\n195\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.930\nand then it changes the height.\n\n196\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.350\nSo it keeps it there, so\nyou can get it back to a reasonable\n\n197\n00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.260\nsize within your document and then you\ncan go back and change it visually.\n\n198\n00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.740\nBecause maybe you don't know that\nit needs to be 408 by 306, but\n\n199\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.950\nat least it gets it down\nto a specific size.\n\n200\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.650\nOr, you already know,\nyou go ahead and put that there.\n\n201\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.440\nSo, that's pretty cool.\n\n202\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.810\nLet's go over to moving your image around,\nand\n\n203\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:53.050\nnow on a regular document I can take this,\nregular meaning there's no other text.\n\n204\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.110\nI have a brand new file.\n\n205\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.620\nIf I take this, let me make it smaller,\n\n206\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.270\nand we're not really worried about what\nwe're looking at cuz it's it's okay.\n\n207\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:07.100\nIf I get the four pointed arrow and I\nstart dragging this around it It doesn't.\n\n208\n00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:12.335\nIt doesn't act like it's own\nindividual object because\n\n209\n00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:17.906\nof the default positioning and\nword wrapping of this image.\n\n210\n00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:23.190\nSo, by itself with nothing else around it,\nit's not going to move.\n\n211\n00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.786\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm really excited about this part Vaughn,\n\n212\n00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:32.234\nbecause I always default to the what\nis it it's the dog and the stripes.\n\n213\n00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the doggy yes,\nyes, the doggy button.\n\n214\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.770\n&gt;&gt; That's my safe zone and I don't\nknow what the other ones really do so.\n\n215\n00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well perfect yes\nyou'll lead me right in,\n\n216\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.492\nyou're leading the dog right\nto the food or something.\n\n217\n00:11:44.492 --> 00:11:45.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n219\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.330\nThe whole way that the image\nmove within the document.\n\n220\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.910\nSo I have this within some text and\nthis one's a little bit smaller just so\n\n221\n00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.050\nI can maybe don't have to size it as much.\n\n222\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.090\nWell still pretty big.\n\n223\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.220\nLet's go ahead and take Mr.\nFuego and we'll make him smaller.\n\n224\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.640\nNotice that I just dragged and dropped it.\n\n225\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.820\nBy default it has this word wrap on it.\n\n226\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.260\nI can move this, but watch,\nsee there should be, yeah,\n\n227\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.960\ndo you see that tiny little\nblack line that's going with it?\n\n228\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.070\nBecause I'm moving it and\nit has to anchor itself or\n\n229\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.350\nattach itself In the text which\nreally is in your paragraph, right?\n\n230\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.390\nSo if I let go here, all right,\nwell I want to go ahead and move so\n\n231\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:34.500\nit can move in relationships to\nthe other information on the page.\n\n232\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.730\nBut how the rest of the text moves\naround it is kind of important.\n\n233\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:46.514\nSo we go to the doggy button.\n\n234\n00:12:46.514 --> 00:12:51.090\nThe dog button is where you can go\n\n235\n00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.210\nmake it a little bit bigger to find the\nwrap text and they stopped using the dog.\n\n236\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:55.900\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n237\n00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.880\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; So now people just think I'm crazy.\n\n238\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.100\nWell, they probably already do\nthink that but now it's solidified.\n\n239\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.945\nYep, she's crazy.\n\n240\n00:13:01.945 --> 00:13:04.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It used to be a dog,\nand I still say it.\n\n241\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.710\nSo we're both crazy.\n\n242\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:12.480\nSo yeah, it uses this little arc now this\nlittle like rainbow thing in here and\n\n243\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.460\nso this is where it has in line with text.\n\n244\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.460\nAnd you can actually see it.\n\n245\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.610\nIt's just acting like a regular\ncharacter but it's really big and so\n\n246\n00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.280\nnow the text goes around it.\n\n247\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.600\nSo you have square type through.\n\n248\n00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.020\n&gt;&gt; Type it was the one that I would\njust randomly pick because I'm like yep,\n\n249\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.330\nI know that this fits\nthe way I want it to fit.\n\n250\n00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:33.750\nIf you want to move it\nindependently around that,\n\n251\n00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.790\njust go to the doggy, and choose tight.\n\n252\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.680\nSquare and tight are the same thing.\n\n253\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.740\nTight just makes it so that there's not\nas much space around the picture in\n\n254\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:51.170\nrelationship to the words but so\nSquare and Tight, let's go with Square.\n\n255\n00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.660\nAnd notice that all the text wraps around\nit and now it's like you can move wherever\n\n256\n00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.110\nyou want it to move, and\nit moves the text accordingly.\n\n257\n00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.416\nSo that actually looks kind of nice in\nrelationship to, it's not a rabbit,\n\n258\n00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:04.304\nit's a fuego.\n\n259\n00:14:04.304 --> 00:14:07.273\nHe kind of looks like a bunny cuz\nhe has massive ears but [LAUGH].\n\n260\n00:14:07.273 --> 00:14:11.276\nSo you can see that that's how you\ncan move the text around, but there's\n\n261\n00:14:11.276 --> 00:14:15.840\nsometimes where you might want to explore\nsome of those other word wrappings.\n\n262\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.630\nTo where I want this\npicture right here but\n\n263\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.830\nI want the text to only be on the top or\nthe bottom, not on the sides.\n\n264\n00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.460\nSo if I went to the wrap text and\ndid top and bottom.\n\n265\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.320\nSee how it changes there.\n\n266\n00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.320\nSo you can kinda put it to where\nit's breaking between paragraphs.\n\n267\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.720\nSo it spaces it out.\n\n268\n00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.050\nIf you wanted that particular one.\n\n269\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.060\nThere's some other ones where\nyou could do it behind the text,\n\n270\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.870\nkind of almost like a watermark or\na picture, and things like that.\n\n271\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.680\nSometimes it might be hard to\ngrab it if text is on top of it.\n\n272\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.430\nSo make sure you have some white\nspace in between there to find it\n\n273\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.910\nand then you could also do like\ncustom word wrap and everything.\n\n274\n00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.240\nGoes a little bit beyond what we really\nneed to do just if it's a square picture\n\n275\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.280\nwe're fine, but think about if you had,\nback to like that gif that\n\n276\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.780\nhad a transparent background and wanted\nthe text like wrap around the flower.\n\n277\n00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.940\nYou can go through and\nactually add edit points that will\n\n278\n00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.990\nmake the boundary that you kind of\ncustom create for, it's pretty neat.\n\n279\n00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.480\nI would definitely suggest\nplaying around with that.\n\n280\n00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:29.060\nNow the other thing that talks about\nthis move with text so let's go back to.\n\n281\n00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.180\nYou know what,\nlet's go back to the top and bottom.\n\n282\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.520\nSo I think it demonstrates this\nparticular concept pretty well.\n\n283\n00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.960\nSo I have this text and\nthis picture where I want.\n\n284\n00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.720\nIf I came into this, notice if I start\n\n285\n00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:54.360\ntyping do you see how it's\nactually moving the picture down.\n\n286\n00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.600\nThat's what it means, move with text.\n\n287\n00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.413\n&gt;&gt; That's nice.\n\n288\n00:15:57.413 --> 00:15:59.863\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthat way if I add in more information,\n\n289\n00:15:59.863 --> 00:16:04.053\nbecause this picture is in relationship\nto where this particular paragraph is.\n\n290\n00:16:04.053 --> 00:16:08.482\nIf I went back to that photograph and\nwent over to the Wrap Text and\n\n291\n00:16:08.482 --> 00:16:12.184\nI did Fix Position on Page,\nkind of explains itself.\n\n292\n00:16:12.184 --> 00:16:15.651\nIt's going to stay, and\nif any text gets added,\n\n293\n00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:18.451\nthe picture's not gonna move with it.\n\n294\n00:16:18.451 --> 00:16:20.390\nSo those are some different options.\n\n295\n00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.054\nAnd just for fun,\nlet's go into this More Layout Options.\n\n296\n00:16:23.054 --> 00:16:24.830\nThere's the dog, so-\n&gt;&gt; There he is.\n\n297\n00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.308\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know., he's still here.\n\n298\n00:16:26.308 --> 00:16:29.605\nAnd that's what is used to look like and\nthat's what that button looks like.\n\n299\n00:16:29.605 --> 00:16:34.015\nBut this is just more information and\nthis is where the distance from text,\n\n300\n00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:36.467\nyou could see that tight versus squares.\n\n301\n00:16:36.467 --> 00:16:38.001\nIt's actually not showing you\nany difference right now.\n\n302\n00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:45.590\nBut you can change how much space\nit pushes off from the image.\n\n303\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.490\nSo more space around\nthe image with the text.\n\n304\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.700\nThose are some other\noptions that you can do.\n\n305\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.560\nDialog box,\nas opposed to just using the presets.\n\n306\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.832\nYou can do it manually which is easy.\n\n307\n00:16:57.832 --> 00:17:00.732\n&gt;&gt; Also, when you had that window open,\nI saw the option there and\n\n308\n00:17:00.732 --> 00:17:03.759\ncertain ways you could align that\ntext to be flush with the photo.\n\n309\n00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:08.761\nWhich going back to my old school days\nworking in journalism, you can add\n\n310\n00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:13.766\nsome really interesting graphical\nelements if you have a little style.\n\n311\n00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.323\nAnd you wanna kind of pull it out and\n\n312\n00:17:15.323 --> 00:17:17.707\nhave that text come from\none particular direction.\n\n313\n00:17:17.707 --> 00:17:18.717\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, definitely.\n\n314\n00:17:18.717 --> 00:17:20.028\nAnd there's all sorts of\nthings that you can do.\n\n315\n00:17:20.028 --> 00:17:24.871\nAnd this word-wrapping is with shapes,\ncuz we're gonna do all these episodes\n\n316\n00:17:24.871 --> 00:17:28.570\non shapes and everything, so\nit's any graphical element.\n\n317\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Whether it's a table,\n\n318\n00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.870\na smart art, a chart.\n\n319\n00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.577\nThese different wrapping techniques\nis kind of important to go\n\n320\n00:17:37.577 --> 00:17:42.459\nthrough all graphical elements and\nhow you want it to go through or\n\n321\n00:17:42.459 --> 00:17:46.208\nin front or\njust square around your Information.\n\n322\n00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:47.106\nPretty cool.\n\n323\n00:17:47.106 --> 00:17:49.547\nLet's cancel out of that.\n\n324\n00:17:49.547 --> 00:17:53.730\nAnd so that's how we can move our images.\n\n325\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.319\nWhere are we gonna go next?\n\n326\n00:17:55.319 --> 00:17:59.102\nLet's go back over to our\ndocument with just Mr.\n\n327\n00:17:59.102 --> 00:18:02.618\nFuego by himself,\nmakes it a little easier.\n\n328\n00:18:02.618 --> 00:18:07.840\nCuz now we're just kinda concentrating\non the editing of the image.\n\n329\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.620\nAnd all of the stuff that we have,\nlike the placement and the wrapping,\n\n330\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.990\nthat all kinda goes with it.\n\n331\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.820\nSo I wanna kinda concentrate on this part.\n\n332\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.840\nCropping, I don't maybe need all\nthis extra part of the tree.\n\n333\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.640\nI just wanna see him and\nnot so much tree around him.\n\n334\n00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.000\nThat's what crop does.\n\n335\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.160\nSo select the picture on\nthe format picture tool tab.\n\n336\n00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.460\nCome over to crop, now I'm just gonna drop\nthis down to just show you there are some\n\n337\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.900\nother options in here that we will get to.\n\n338\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.120\nLet's go with a straight up crop.\n\n339\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.240\n&gt;&gt; And it's so interesting,\nwhenever I see these little icons,\n\n340\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.800\nand there's just that generational\nkind of gap sometimes.\n\n341\n00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.010\nI'm a little bit older, so looking at\na lot of these icons, especially when you\n\n342\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.980\nsee that floppy, well, back in the day,\nyeah, I did work with floppies.\n\n343\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.920\nAnd even with this cropping tool.\n\n344\n00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.000\nAnd I think we spoke about this\nin our other show one time.\n\n345\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.819\nThat was the actual shape\nof that tool that you used.\n\n346\n00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:04.521\nAnd it had this sliding bar to keep\nyour ratio proportional there.\n\n347\n00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:07.865\nAnd you would use like\nan actual grease pencil, so\n\n348\n00:19:07.865 --> 00:19:11.288\nthat when the publisher\nwould receive that photo,\n\n349\n00:19:11.288 --> 00:19:15.764\nthey could actually either physically\ncut or overlay that photo.\n\n350\n00:19:15.764 --> 00:19:17.360\nSo it's only showing a portion of it.\n\n351\n00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know it's funny when\nwe're like, back in the day.\n\n352\n00:19:20.931 --> 00:19:21.438\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n353\n00:19:21.438 --> 00:19:23.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the kids are like, wait,\n\n354\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:28.709\nthere was an actual metal tool that you\nhad to put and I'm like, yes, it existed.\n\n355\n00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:29.699\nIt came from somewhere.\n\n356\n00:19:29.699 --> 00:19:32.793\n[LAUGH] But yeah,\nthat's a pretty cool thing.\n\n357\n00:19:32.793 --> 00:19:37.494\nAnd this like right here, all of these\nlittle triangles, I'll call them,\n\n358\n00:19:37.494 --> 00:19:41.394\nthe edges and I'll zoom in just\na little bit so you can see that.\n\n359\n00:19:41.394 --> 00:19:45.194\nThis is where I can take and\njust crop the photo out.\n\n360\n00:19:45.194 --> 00:19:51.667\nJust designating that area that I want to\nkeep and the area that I want to discard.\n\n361\n00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:58.529\nNow I say discard because it really\ndoesn't eliminate the information.\n\n362\n00:19:58.529 --> 00:20:00.950\nAnd a lot of times people are like,\nwell, I went ahead and copied.\n\n363\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.959\nBut how do I just like say, yes, I'm done?\n\n364\n00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:06.308\nYou could just click out.\n\n365\n00:20:06.308 --> 00:20:08.866\nJust click off of the picture,\nand it goes ahead and does it.\n\n366\n00:20:08.866 --> 00:20:11.720\nYou could also hit Enter on your keyboard,\nif that makes you feel better.\n\n367\n00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.656\nJust say, like, yep, I'm done.\n\n368\n00:20:13.656 --> 00:20:17.103\nThat did not delete the information,\nwhich is nice.\n\n369\n00:20:17.103 --> 00:20:20.625\nSo if I click back on the picture,\ncuz maybe I wanted a little bit more of\n\n370\n00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:24.380\nthat tree trunk, select the picture,\ncome over to the crop.\n\n371\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.060\nAnd notice that it's still all there.\n\n372\n00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.790\nSo I can extend this\nout a little bit more.\n\n373\n00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:34.241\nOr maybe I've cropped this a little\ntoo much, or I wanna move this down.\n\n374\n00:20:34.241 --> 00:20:40.330\nNotice if I bring my mouse onto the\npicture, it's moving it within the frame.\n\n375\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.400\nIf you have a matted photograph and\nyou're moving the photo underneath it,\n\n376\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.552\nit's the same idea.\n\n377\n00:20:45.552 --> 00:20:48.205\nSo in a sense, what we are doing,\nwe're masking,\n\n378\n00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:51.122\nmatting, however you wanna\nuse your own terminology.\n\n379\n00:20:51.122 --> 00:20:56.490\nBut we're saying I don't want to\nsee certain parts of this picture.\n\n380\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.910\nAnd that's how you can crop.\n\n381\n00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.030\nAnd I'll hit Enter just to accept that.\n\n382\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.360\nAnd knowing that it doesn't get rid of it,\nyou can always come back.\n\n383\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.560\nYou don't have it, oops, I cropped too\nmuch, delete, get the picture back.\n\n384\n00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.463\nNo, it's all still there.\n\n385\n00:21:08.463 --> 00:21:09.533\nIt's pretty neat.\n\n386\n00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:13.243\nNow, there are some specific things\nthat you can do with this crop.\n\n387\n00:21:13.243 --> 00:21:18.693\nLike let's say I needed to crop\nit to a specific aspect ratio.\n\n388\n00:21:18.693 --> 00:21:23.260\nThese are a lot of times your photo sizes,\nyour two by threes, three by fives,\n\n389\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.850\nfour by six, those kinds of things.\n\n390\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.200\nBut it's giving you the specific ones.\n\n391\n00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.160\nAnd notice you also have Portrait and\nLandscape version.\n\n392\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.510\nThis is a portrait photograph,\nit's more up and down than across.\n\n393\n00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:41.670\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo a 3 x 5 aspect ratio, well.\n\n394\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.225\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty similar to\nwhat you already had, right?\n\n395\n00:21:44.225 --> 00:21:47.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nI'm gonna hit escape, by the way.\n\n396\n00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.930\nThat's another way to get rid of it.\n\n397\n00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.160\nLet's go to the landscape one, even though\nthis is not a landscape photograph.\n\n398\n00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.710\nLet's do a 4 x 3.\n\n399\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.570\nThere, now you can see a specific\ndifference of, All right,\n\n400\n00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.220\nit's just keeping that 4 x 3 aspect ratio,\nor 16 x 9.\n\n401\n00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.975\nWhatever aspect ration you want to have,\nyour width and height.\n\n402\n00:22:04.975 --> 00:22:08.713\nAnd then from here,\nI can move the photograph.\n\n403\n00:22:08.713 --> 00:22:12.778\nOr even come back at it to where I\ndon't want to change the crop size.\n\n404\n00:22:12.778 --> 00:22:15.077\nI just wanna change\nthe size of the picture.\n\n405\n00:22:15.077 --> 00:22:18.763\nI can come out into here grab a corner.\n\n406\n00:22:18.763 --> 00:22:21.522\nOops, oo,\ngotta hold your Shift key on this one.\n\n407\n00:22:21.522 --> 00:22:24.510\nWhoo, I almost got too far out of there.\n\n408\n00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.350\nSo remember before I said you\ndon't have to hold the Shift key?\n\n409\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.490\nIn this situation,\n\n410\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.550\nyou would definitely need to hold that\nShift key to keep it proportioned.\n\n411\n00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.680\nSo I can size the picture down.\n\n412\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.290\nCome into where I've got\nit framed just right.\n\n413\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:42.830\nAnd so notice I can move the crop like I\ndid in the other example versus the image.\n\n414\n00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:47.775\nYou have different controls over which\nparts are being sized, moved around and\n\n415\n00:22:47.775 --> 00:22:49.400\nchanged.\n\n416\n00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.830\nSo now I'll hit enter or\n\n417\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.620\njust click off and\nnow I have it cropped with specific size.\n\n418\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.960\nPretty cool.\n\n419\n00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.130\nNow some other things you can do with your\ncrops is I have a specific aspect ratio,\n\n420\n00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.540\nso I'm making my frame.\n\n421\n00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.200\nI can use either fill or fit.\n\n422\n00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.998\nSo if I use fill, it's going to\ntry to fill the photograph into\n\n423\n00:23:10.998 --> 00:23:14.335\nthat particular crop as much as possible.\n\n424\n00:23:14.335 --> 00:23:19.703\nSo you could see, because of this\nportrait picture with a landscape crop-\n\n425\n00:23:19.703 --> 00:23:22.647\n&gt;&gt; It takes the full width of that photo,\n\n426\n00:23:22.647 --> 00:23:26.334\nregardless of if his head\nis being chopped off.\n\n427\n00:23:26.334 --> 00:23:28.341\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly, so\n\n428\n00:23:28.341 --> 00:23:29.970\nthen we can move it around.\n\n429\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.920\nSo his head's not being chopped off.\n\n430\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.020\nBut yeah, that fill is going to do that.\n\n431\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:42.760\nClick on the other one, let's go\nto this one and we will go to fit.\n\n432\n00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.090\nAnd so, you see how, well,\n\n433\n00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:48.950\nI'm fitting the picture in the crop\nwhich notice that doesn't work, does it?\n\n434\n00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:49.470\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n435\n00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.960\nit is trying to do what\nyou're commanding it to do.\n\n436\n00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.658\nFit this photograph in to this crop.\n\n437\n00:23:55.658 --> 00:23:59.270\nSo you have to play around with it and\nwhich one works a little bit better for\n\n438\n00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.780\nyour particular choice of crop and\nhow you're going to do that.\n\n439\n00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.270\nI'm going to hit Enter, and\nthis is one of my favorites.\n\n440\n00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.600\nI'm just gonna make this\na little bit bigger.\n\n441\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:14.147\nAnd let's go to crop to a specific shape.\n\n442\n00:24:14.147 --> 00:24:15.333\nThat's.\n[LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:24:15.333 --> 00:24:16.425\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I've ever\n\n444\n00:24:16.425 --> 00:24:17.480\ndone this before.\n\n445\n00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n446\n00:24:18.264 --> 00:24:20.456\n&gt;&gt; It's fun.\n&gt;&gt; I saw your heart on the Powerpoint\n\n447\n00:24:20.456 --> 00:24:22.583\npresentation, so-\n&gt;&gt; And this is where we got it.\n\n448\n00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:23.511\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, all right.\n\n449\n00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:26.220\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna crop it to,\nI'm gonna choose the heart.\n\n450\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.970\nJust cuz it's my Fuego.\n\n451\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.340\nSo I notice, isn't that cute?\n\n452\n00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.570\nAnd you can use the same fills and\nfits within the shape\n\n453\n00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:40.230\nto try to see how it's going to fill.\n\n454\n00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.890\nI usually choose Fill more than Fit for\nthe most part.\n\n455\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.060\nAnd then I can kinda move this down\na little bit so I can get that photo.\n\n456\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.950\nBut just be careful, cuz if you did that,\n\n457\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.509\nnotice it-\n&gt;&gt; That blank space.\n\n458\n00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:50.199\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n459\n00:24:50.199 --> 00:24:55.780\nI could also change this to maybe make it\na little bit different shape of a heart.\n\n460\n00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.460\nSo I can change the crop size or\nshape size in this\n\n461\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:06.090\nsense to modify and then in the middle\nmove the photograph around.\n\n462\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.640\nYeah, right there, that looks good.\n\n463\n00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.100\nAnd then say, isn't that cute and\nso I can crop it to a shape, neat.\n\n464\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.190\nSo I really like to use that one.\n\n465\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.630\nIt's kinda fun.\n\n466\n00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.347\nI will give you a suggestion that when\nwe get into some other of our color\n\n467\n00:25:20.347 --> 00:25:24.952\ncorrections and our styles and everything,\nlike, I really wanna crop this shape.\n\n468\n00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:28.822\nBut then you go on and put a preset on\nit and then it takes out the shape.\n\n469\n00:25:28.822 --> 00:25:33.118\nYou have to kind of format,\nwe'll say changing the styles and\n\n470\n00:25:33.118 --> 00:25:37.507\nwhat you want the picture to look like,\nand then crop it shape.\n\n471\n00:25:37.507 --> 00:25:39.396\nAnd it'll stay all together.\n\n472\n00:25:39.396 --> 00:25:40.113\nI'll show you in a little bit.\n\n473\n00:25:40.113 --> 00:25:42.087\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, I'm not really\nsure what you're talking about.\n\n474\n00:25:42.087 --> 00:25:43.582\nBut I'm sure you'll explain it.\n\n475\n00:25:43.582 --> 00:25:46.517\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I realize as I'm going\nthrough this, it's making sense.\n\n476\n00:25:46.517 --> 00:25:48.486\nIt's actually kinda half\nmaking sense in my brain.\n\n477\n00:25:48.486 --> 00:25:50.930\nI'm like, this is something you\njust really need to show them.\n\n478\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:56.430\nBut I do have more to show, but I do\nrealize that just doing the moving and\n\n479\n00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.570\nthe size and cropping,\nthat's a lot of basic stuff.\n\n480\n00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.081\nI wanted to really concentrate on that so\nyou can see all the different ways.\n\n481\n00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:09.716\nBut I didn't get into all those cool\npresets and all the filters I told you.\n\n482\n00:26:09.716 --> 00:26:13.300\nSo I think we're gonna have to come\nback for a part two on this one.\n\n483\n00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.620\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe can allow that to happen, Vonne.\n\n484\n00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.419\nThank you for your time.\n\n485\n00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:19.914\nAnd thank you for your time as well,\nbut you don't wanna miss part two for\n\n486\n00:26:19.914 --> 00:26:21.128\nthis particular topic.\n\n487\n00:26:21.128 --> 00:26:23.736\nWe're gonna learn more about\nformatting here, but for this show,\n\n488\n00:26:23.736 --> 00:26:25.260\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n489\n00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.670\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n490\n00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.760\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, cuz we have a little bit of\nartistic creativity with this aspect here\n\n23\n00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:10.170\nthat we'll be looking at, right?\n\n24\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are, and we're gonna\nget into all sorts of colors, and\n\n25\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.990\nyou know I'm gonna make something pink.\n\n26\n00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.116\nSo [LAUGH],\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.650\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we get started.\n\n28\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.220\nI actually am in the same place that I\nwas, that I ended off in the last episode.\n\n29\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.400\nWe have Mr. Fragglepants, in a heart\n\n30\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.575\nthat we had used with our current Crop\nto Shape, and that's all that fun stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:33.685\nSo we're gonna come over here\ninto this picture styles first.\n\n32\n00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:37.894\nNow, styles and again, you might see\na little cross bigger with all your\n\n33\n00:01:37.894 --> 00:01:40.186\nresolution and everything like that.\n\n34\n00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:41.955\nA style is just a named group or format.\n\n35\n00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:45.511\nYou have heard me talk about styles\nall day long in the Essentials,\n\n36\n00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:47.175\ncuz I love making some styles.\n\n37\n00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:50.520\nWell, it's just a bunch of\ndifferent formatting together.\n\n38\n00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.860\nWell these styles, all come from\na combination of your border,\n\n39\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.030\nyour picture border an outline.\n\n40\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.080\nWhat color you want it to be,\nwhat size you want it to be, and\n\n41\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.100\ndoes it have like dashed lines or not\ndashed lines, so those are your borders.\n\n42\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.290\nAnd then a combination of effect, so\nwe're saying what is a picture style?\n\n43\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.930\nCombination of border and effects.\n\n44\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.160\nNow, there's a ton of different effects.\n\n45\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.590\nI'm not gonna go through each\none of these individually.\n\n46\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.550\nWe would be here forever.\n\n47\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.920\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever seen those documents\nwhere it looks like someone just learned\n\n48\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.430\nabout all the effects and\ndecided to use them all on the same image?\n\n49\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.213\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I have seen those [LAUGH].\n\n50\n00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:27.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're just like you found\n\n51\n00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:29.964\nthe little treasure chest.\n\n52\n00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:32.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna put every single piece of\n\n53\n00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:35.215\nflare you can on that can't you [LAUGH].\n\n54\n00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:38.437\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So using these tastefully I say that,\n\n55\n00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:41.160\nand I'm gonna go and\nmake this really kinda crazy.\n\n56\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.800\nBut less is more sometimes,\nand know your audience, and\n\n57\n00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.990\nknow when and where to use everything.\n\n58\n00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.890\nBut if you wanna get kinda crazy,\nyou can see that we have some Shadows.\n\n59\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.830\nThis is where you can add a drop shadow or\nan inner shadow.\n\n60\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.330\nAnd if I scroll down,\nI have some perspective shadows.\n\n61\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.630\nI always liked these, I think it gives\njust a little bit of a pizzazz in there.\n\n62\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.077\nSo you can see that, it's nice that it\ngives you a preview in a sense of it with\n\n63\n00:03:07.077 --> 00:03:11.473\ndifferent icons to let you know what\nis this particular effect going to do.\n\n64\n00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:13.270\nThen you have your Reflections.\n\n65\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.899\nThese are kinda cool, whereas a nice crisp\nday on a lake that shows where the sky and\n\n66\n00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:20.952\nearth begins, and journey.\n\n67\n00:03:20.952 --> 00:03:22.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And all that stuffs.\n\n68\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.570\nSo we've got those ones there.\n\n69\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.059\nWe have our Glows, where we have\nthe different colors of the themes and\n\n70\n00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.419\nthe different levels of\nglowings that you can have.\n\n71\n00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.723\nAnd notice that on each one of these,\nit has these options down at the bottom,\n\n72\n00:03:37.723 --> 00:03:41.735\nShadow options or Reflection options,\nyou get the idea.\n\n73\n00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:43.892\nGlow options, what does that mean?\n\n74\n00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:46.125\n[LAUGH] More options.\n\n75\n00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:53.025\nThen the buttons Soft Edges, kind of give\nyou a diffused look out towards the edge.\n\n76\n00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.905\nWe have our Bubbles and 3-D Rotations.\n\n77\n00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:58.735\nSo you can see all the different\nthings that you can put on there.\n\n78\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.290\nBut the styles is where they just kind of\nput some of them together which is nice.\n\n79\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.180\nSo one of my favorites\nto go to is this one.\n\n80\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.820\nThis Rotated White and\n\n81\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.210\ndo notice that the crop that I did\nwith the heart, see it takes if off.\n\n82\n00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.065\nAnd now that's a thing that I was trying\nto explain at the very end of the episode.\n\n83\n00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:18.960\n&gt;&gt; I see, yes.\n\n84\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see I could have just\nclicked the button [LAUGH] and\n\n85\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.790\nmade it a lot easier than\ntrying to explain with words.\n\n86\n00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.410\nBut yeah, so it won't keep your crop\nto shape with this particular style.\n\n87\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.338\nBut it's kind of cute.\n\n88\n00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:30.200\nIt's kind of rotated.\n\n89\n00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.631\nIt looks like it's raised up on the edge.\n\n90\n00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:34.210\nIt's got that drop shadow.\n\n91\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.910\n&gt;&gt;

So you can really detail how\nyou want that shadow to appear.\n\n138\n00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:08.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and you can just start pulling\nthese different levers all over the place.\n\n139\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.670\nSo if you want even more options,\n\n140\n00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.990\nthat you can have,\ngo to the Format Picture task pane.\n\n141\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.580\nAnd just a few more as I'm going\nthrough here, let's look at these\n\n142\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.750\ndifferent buttons at the top because you\ncould see that I have like Fill and Line.\n\n143\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.705\nWell, I'm not really gonna be able to\nchange the fill cuz it's a picture, but\n\n144\n00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:31.930\nthat's where you can go ahead and\nchange your line or your border.\n\n145\n00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.075\nSo you can have a gradient border\non there if you wanted to.\n\n146\n00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:42.050\nYou couldn't get to that from here, notice\nits just like there's just weight and\n\n147\n00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.650\noutline colors, but\nyou can have a gradient border around it.\n\n148\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.990\nYou just had to get into this particular\ntask pane to give you some other options.\n\n149\n00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.870\nAnd again, I'm not going through\nevery single one of these things.\n\n150\n00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.795\nIt's way too much information, and it\nreally is, once you find out where it is,\n\n151\n00:07:57.795 --> 00:08:00.391\nlike you said, you're going to throw\nall the stuff on it that you want.\n\n152\n00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:02.862\n&gt;&gt;

I remember,\nwhen this technology first came out and\n\n253\n00:12:38.443 --> 00:12:40.730\nit was like over decade\nago with Photoshop.\n\n254\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.810\nYeah, this is where you normally would\nhave to go to Photoshop to go ahead and\n\n255\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.009\nremove the background and\nget your magnetic lasso tool and\n\n256\n00:12:50.009 --> 00:12:53.320\ninvert the selection, and delete,\nand all this kinda fun stuff.\n\n257\n00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.760\nBut this one is where you can\ndo it right within office.\n\n258\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.650\n&gt;&gt; I've never tried it this way, so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is where,\n\n259\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.690\nif it's a good photograph\nin a sense like here,\n\n260\n00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:07.610\nsee how there is a lot of different color,\nit's a very defined edge.\n\n261\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.570\nVery pink, very green.\n\n262\n00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.991\nSo when you have a photograph like this.\n\n263\n00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:15.506\n&gt;&gt; With that distinct contrast there.\n\n264\n00:13:15.506 --> 00:13:18.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, that's where it's\ngoing to come into play a lot easier.\n\n265\n00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.550\nNow, I'm going to make\nthis a little bit smaller.\n\n266\n00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:26.820\nJust so we can fit it on the screen right\nthere, so it's a little bit easier to see.\n\n267\n00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.605\nYou know what?\n\n268\n00:13:27.605 --> 00:13:30.350\nLet's put this on its own page.\n\n269\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.280\nThere we go.\n\n270\n00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.900\nSo now,\nif I take the picture that's selected,\n\n271\n00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.420\ncome over here to the picture format,\nand we go to remove background.\n\n272\n00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.050\nNow, this is also one of those weird\npictures where the color that I'm\n\n273\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.338\ngoing to, where Photoshop,\nnot Photoshop, this is Word.\n\n274\n00:13:47.338 --> 00:13:48.454\n[LAUGH].\n\n275\n00:13:48.454 --> 00:13:51.780\nWhere Word adds what it's suppose\nto remove is also pink, so\n\n276\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.200\nit can be a little misleading, but\njust roll with me for right now.\n\n277\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so every picture would\nstill have this fuchsia color?\n\n278\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.090\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n279\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.805\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n\n280\n00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:00.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.850\n&gt;&gt; So now here, again, I told you,\n\n282\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.320\nI have a picture that it\nwill work perfectly on.\n\n283\n00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.580\nOoh, come on.\n\n284\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:11.390\nIf I just hit ENTER or click off of this,\nit took all of the green away.\n\n285\n00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:15.145\nSo that's where that defined\nedge is gonna be really easy.\n\n286\n00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:18.470\nIt's like, hey,\nthis is everything that I want to delete.\n\n287\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.090\n&gt;&gt; Can you zoom in a little,\nI wanna check.\n\n288\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.689\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mm-hm, yeah.\n\n289\n00:14:20.689 --> 00:14:21.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, so\n\n290\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.280\nI mean it actually did a pretty decent-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n291\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.586\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Better than I could do by hand.\n\n292\n00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:27.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n293\n00:14:27.246 --> 00:14:29.560\n&gt;&gt;

I could see where we may have some\nissues but I'm not sure, so let's wait.\n\n309\n00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, one,\nit's trying to cut out its eyes, and\n\n310\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.622\nthat's gonna look really scary.\n\n311\n00:15:16.622 --> 00:15:17.710\n[LAUGH] Yeah, and so\n\n312\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.180\nyou can see it got enough, but\nthis whole area's a little weird.\n\n313\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.540\nI don't want it to, cuz remember\nthe fuchsia is where it's going to remove.\n\n314\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.660\nI don't want it to remove his eyeballs.\n\n315\n00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.840\nI want it to remove some parts,\nand this didn't come in.\n\n316\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.930\nSo this is where you can add into\nmore of what you wanna take away.\n\n317\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:38.688\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n318\n00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:43.285\nthen also add back in what\nyou don't wanna remove.\n\n319\n00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:44.690\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, I got it.\n\n320\n00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, [LAUGH] cuz I feel like,\n\n321\n00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.270\ndid I just totally-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.770\n&gt;&gt; Make myself go in a circle?\n\n323\n00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.649\nSo notice it has a little\nminus sign right here.\n\n324\n00:15:52.649 --> 00:15:57.948\nIf I click, hold and drag,\nwhat it's doing is, I'm making a line\n\n325\n00:15:57.948 --> 00:16:03.730\nacross the part, designate this\nas an area that I want to remove.\n\n326\n00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.886\nAnd notice that it kind of picked up.\n\n327\n00:16:05.886 --> 00:16:08.786\nIt was all like the greens and\nthe whites, so get rid of that.\n\n328\n00:16:08.786 --> 00:16:11.570\nOkay now I want you to get rid of this.\n\n329\n00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.292\nIt's taking a little longer just because\nthis is a pretty big picture and this is,\n\n330\n00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:19.322\nit's a pretty taxing command to do.\n\n331\n00:16:19.322 --> 00:16:22.740\n&gt;&gt; A lot of computations\nof processing power.\n\n332\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.423\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, and\nthat's why you do the tech stuff.\n\n333\n00:16:24.423 --> 00:16:26.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I do the office stuff.\n\n334\n00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:29.890\n[LAUGH] Exactly, so\nyou can see that I can come into here and\n\n335\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.965\njust start dragging the lines as\nto where I want to delete this.\n\n336\n00:16:33.965 --> 00:16:36.485\nWell it's not really working,\nthis is kind of hard to see.\n\n337\n00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:41.241\nBut notice if I have this where it's\nadding, I have this little X over it,\n\n338\n00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:42.560\nkind of hard to see.\n\n339\n00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.387\nI don't want that point to be there\nanymore and see it got rid of that,\n\n340\n00:16:47.387 --> 00:16:51.400\nadd the plus would mean keep,\nminus would say take away.\n\n341\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.520\nSo this is the part where right\nhere I want to add that back in.\n\n342\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.570\nAnd notice it does have that plus sign\nnow, so if I just kinda drag a line\n\n343\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.890\nover his eye, it detected that boundary.\n\n344\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.690\n&gt;&gt; And how did you toggle back\nfrom the plus and the minus key?\n\n345\n00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.930\n&gt;&gt; It's actually,\nnotice it does it automatically.\n\n346\n00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.872\nI'm not holding anything, see,\nthis is an area that we're keeping.\n\n347\n00:17:12.872 --> 00:17:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n348\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.618\n&gt;&gt; So when my mouse is over it,\nit automatically goes.\n\n349\n00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.800\n&gt;&gt; Just the inverse of whatever it is,\nduh.\n\n350\n00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.775\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, that's a great question,\n\n351\n00:17:19.775 --> 00:17:23.850\nbecause at first I'm like wait,\nI'm not holding anything.\n\n352\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.180\nIt's just doing it.\n\n353\n00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.490\nSo now it's saying this is\ngoing to be taken away.\n\n354\n00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.680\nNo, I wanna add that back in so\nI draw a line.\n\n355\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:36.870\nAnd if came right there, see that's where\nI'm gonna try to draw a little line.\n\n356\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.382\nNotice this is where I'm getting,\nthere's gonna be pieces here.\n\n357\n00:17:39.382 --> 00:17:41.450\n&gt;&gt; A little bit, that's pretty good.\n\n358\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.630\n&gt;&gt; You can see the jagged\nedges around this.\n\n359\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.380\nI know this isn't gonna\nbe a very clean well-.\n\n360\n00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:48.950\n&gt;&gt; For a free tool.\n\n361\n00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.012\nWell, free being relative here\nif you've already licensed for\n\n362\n00:17:53.012 --> 00:17:54.900\nMicrosoft Office products.\n\n363\n00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.180\n&gt;&gt; Correct and\nnot having to use Photoshop.\n\n364\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.560\nSo this is where yeah, the nature\n\n365\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.530\nof the photograph itself is gonna make\na difference as to when you hit Enter.\n\n366\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:12.028\nSee It did it, but it's pretty jagged.\n\n367\n00:18:12.028 --> 00:18:14.500\nIt's just how it works.\n\n368\n00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.440\n&gt;&gt; I wonder then,\ncould you take it a step further and\n\n369\n00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.260\nuse that diffusing tool kind of like\na feathering tool in Photoshop?\n\n370\n00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.770\n&gt;&gt; You could.\nI mean, you totally could do it.\n\n371\n00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.580\nIt's still going to be, I was trying\nto find, it was over here, sorry.\n\n372\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.805\nI know which one you're talking about,\nbut I forgot where it was.\n\n373\n00:18:30.805 --> 00:18:37.030\nYeah, you could do the soft edges and\nyou could kinda, that's a lot.\n\n374\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.226\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you could go with,\n\n375\n00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:39.760\nlet's maybe do it that way.\n\n376\n00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.737\nYeah, you can kind of\nfluff it up a little bit.\n\n377\n00:18:43.737 --> 00:18:46.899\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, but that is actually,\n\n378\n00:18:46.899 --> 00:18:48.340\nthat's pretty good.\n\n379\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.350\nGood combination.\n\n380\n00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.409\nSo that's where you can change\nall of those different things.\n\n381\n00:18:53.409 --> 00:18:57.315\nThe remove background,\nit's a pretty cool command built into your\n\n382\n00:18:57.315 --> 00:19:02.060\nOffice products but it doesn't always\nget it exactly right every single time.\n\n383\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:07.610\nSo just be aware of those types of things.\n\n384\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.840\nLet's do this, let's zoom out.\n\n385\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.018\nYou know what, why don't we just go\nahead and close this new document and\n\n386\n00:19:14.018 --> 00:19:15.650\nnot save the changes.\n\n387\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:21.050\nKinda giving me a whole brand new,\nI just did a command N for file new.\n\n388\n00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.019\nA full reset, if you wanna say.\n\n389\n00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:26.170\nCuz where do I want to go next?\n\n390\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.310\nOoh, I wanna talk about\ncompressing images.\n\n391\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.470\nSo yeah, that was all the fun stuff\nof adding color and everything.\n\n392\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.010\nNow we're gonna get into some more\nof the technical stuff, we'll say.\n\n393\n00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.436\nLet's take this picture and this is, yep,\n\n394\n00:19:38.436 --> 00:19:42.118\nthis is when we were in the fort\nup in Colombia, it's pretty cool.\n\n395\n00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:43.148\n&gt;&gt; It looks cool.\n\n396\n00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:44.884\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was really neat.\n\n397\n00:19:44.884 --> 00:19:49.240\nIt [LAUGH] Lot different in Columbia,\nthere wasn't any safety bars or\n\n398\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.600\nanything like that.\n\n399\n00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.915\nSo it's like don't get to far to the edge.\n\n400\n00:19:51.915 --> 00:19:53.270\n[LAUGH] But you could see everything.\n\n401\n00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.057\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes that makes me wonder\nabout as many signs as we have here.\n\n402\n00:19:57.057 --> 00:20:02.220\n&gt;&gt; It was one that I noticed enough,\nwere I'm like wow, there's no barriers.\n\n403\n00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.950\nAnd there's no signs that\nsay don't get too close.\n\n404\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.319\nIt was pretty interesting,\nbut it was amazing.\n\n405\n00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:12.100\nSo, this is one of those, this is a\npicture, this is a really big photograph.\n\n406\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:16.393\nIf you could see back here that\nthis was the 4.000 by 3,000,\n\n407\n00:20:16.393 --> 00:20:18.260\nit's somewhere in there.\n\n408\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.376\nJust trust me that it's\na really big picture.\n\n409\n00:20:21.376 --> 00:20:26.750\nSo if I take this and make it smaller and\nwe can zoom in on the document right here.\n\n410\n00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.980\nAnd maybe I'll go ahead and\ncrop this out a little bit.\n\n411\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.920\nLet's take and crop out some of\nthis right here and over there.\n\n412\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:39.140\nSo it's just, there we go, just a picture\nof my husband, just hanging out there.\n\n413\n00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.790\nTaking this picture, I was really big,\nmade it really small.\n\n414\n00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.529\nIf this is just one photograph probably\nwouldn't be that big of deal, right?\n\n415\n00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:49.929\nBut what if you have 50 pages and\n\n416\n00:20:49.929 --> 00:20:54.885\nyou've got a ton of images\nin this particular document.\n\n417\n00:20:54.885 --> 00:20:57.410\nThere's a lot of information\nthat you don't need.\n\n418\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.387\n&gt;&gt; So we're just like bloating our\nparticular file with fat, excess, or\n\n419\n00:21:01.387 --> 00:21:02.060\nunneeded.\n\n420\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.408\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, because we made it really\nsmall so you don't need those 4000 pixels.\n\n421\n00:21:07.408 --> 00:21:10.836\nAnd, I've cropped information out,\nI don't really need that anymore.\n\n422\n00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:16.430\nThis is where compressing your images\nwill help to optimize your file size.\n\n423\n00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.390\nI don't wanna bloat this file with lots of\nextra information because there's no link\n\n424\n00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.766\nback to this original image.\n\n425\n00:21:21.766 --> 00:21:29.250\nThis whole image is in this document, like\nit's in there and it's not gonna go away.\n\n426\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.780\nSo if I come over here to\nthe picture format and\n\n427\n00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.900\ngo to this particular button right here,\nthis Compress Pictures, click on it.\n\n428\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.824\nThis is where, what do I want to do?\n\n429\n00:21:39.824 --> 00:21:43.496\nRemember the resolution that we\ntalked about in the first episode?\n\n430\n00:21:43.496 --> 00:21:46.710\nLook at now, we have some understandings\nof why is this 96 and 72.\n\n431\n00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:51.638\nThere's this weird thing with PC and\nMac is like, Mac's native resolution or\n\n432\n00:21:51.638 --> 00:21:56.866\nscreen resolution is 96 and Windows is\n72 so that's why it doesn't say 72 for\n\n433\n00:21:56.866 --> 00:22:00.522\nscreen, it's just one of\nthose little nuances.\n\n434\n00:22:00.522 --> 00:22:04.970\nAnd those you can see that it has a middle\nof the road, high definition, or high\n\n435\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:11.450\nquality that has that 300 ppi, so I don't\nreally need my quality to be that high.\n\n436\n00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:15.102\nI might just set this to just a normal,\nkind of middle of the road 150.\n\n437\n00:22:15.102 --> 00:22:19.140\nStill gonna look good on\na regular desktop printing.\n\n438\n00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.630\nWill still be fine on my screen viewer and\nit won't bloat my file size too much so\n\n439\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.776\nthat's why I pick 150.\n\n440\n00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:25.871\nFor me personally.\n\n441\n00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:30.630\n&gt;&gt; Yvonne, is this a one way operation or\nwhat if I wanted to go back and enlarge\n\n442\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:35.210\nthat but am I gonna affect the quality or\ncan I decompress further down the road?\n\n443\n00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.770\n&gt;&gt; That is really a good question.\n\n444\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:37.910\nOnce you choose this,\n\n445\n00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.030\nwhen you're going to compress your\npictures, The information's gone.\n\n446\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now if you did a small adjustment,\n\n447\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.800\nlike I wanna go from here to here,\nthat's not gonna be that big a deal.\n\n448\n00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.730\nYou go from here to here,\n\n449\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.300\nyou're gonna get some pixelation because\nyou took all that information out.\n\n450\n00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:51.910\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n451\n00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.290\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, this is something\nyou wanna do at the very end.\n\n452\n00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.880\nLike you're done, everything's set.\n\n453\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.476\nThis is like the final step for\npreparing your document, I would say.\n\n454\n00:23:02.476 --> 00:23:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n455\n00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.730\n&gt;&gt; And notice it will delete all\nthe cropped areas of your pictures.\n\n456\n00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.720\nAnd then this is where, do you want to do\nit to all of the pictures on your file?\n\n457\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.628\nThat would be kind of nice if you had\n50 images in here, it's like yes,\n\n458\n00:23:13.628 --> 00:23:15.160\ncompress everybody.\n\n459\n00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.180\nGood, or\nis it just on this one selected picture?\n\n460\n00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.290\nI'm gonna choose all cuz I only have one.\n\n461\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.962\nBut it's a,\nI don't wanna say lesser known thing,\n\n462\n00:23:22.962 --> 00:23:26.450\nit's an important thing to me because-\n&gt;&gt; I've never heard of it.\n\n463\n00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.620\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n465\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it just one of those,\n\n466\n00:23:29.395 --> 00:23:32.377\nthis is more of the technical stuff\n&gt;&gt; Me as the designer and\n\n467\n00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:35.620\nthe I wanna make sure all my\nfiles are optimized properly.\n\n468\n00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.292\nThis is something that I would do.\n\n469\n00:23:36.292 --> 00:23:40.222\n&gt;&gt; Well I mean if you think about it it's\nactually pretty smart because if you're\n\n470\n00:23:40.222 --> 00:23:44.210\nworking and dealing with these types of\nfiles all the time and you're looking at\n\n471\n00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.505\nstorage limitations and exponentially\nthat could save you some money there.\n\n472\n00:23:48.505 --> 00:23:49.790\n&gt;&gt; Definitely yes this\nis good stuff to do.\n\n473\n00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.140\nSo let's go ahead and click OK.\n\n474\n00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.640\nAnd notice that I didn't really get any\nwarning, I didn't get any, it just like.\n\n475\n00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.172\nIt looks the same, it should.\n\n476\n00:23:56.172 --> 00:24:01.721\nYour images should not change,\nin the quality, the look on your page,\n\n477\n00:24:01.721 --> 00:24:06.178\nis more of the file size that\nyou'll see a difference in.\n\n478\n00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:08.805\nSo, that's where you're going to go with.\n\n479\n00:24:08.805 --> 00:24:13.890\nLet's go over a few other\nlittle buttons in here.\n\n480\n00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.920\nI'm going to change the style on this one,\nlet's just go with that.\n\n481\n00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.301\nSo I've done some formating to this image,\nbut you know what?\n\n482\n00:24:21.301 --> 00:24:22.681\nI don't want that picture anymore,\n\n483\n00:24:22.681 --> 00:24:25.570\nI wanna change it, that's why you\nhave the Change Picture button.\n\n484\n00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.100\nCuz people like well,\nwhy wouldn't I just go ahead and\n\n485\n00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.970\ninsert a new one and\njust do the same thing?\n\n486\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.180\nIt's just one last set.\n\n487\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.290\n&gt;&gt; Less things, yeah.\n\n488\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so keep everything that\nI have with the formatting,\n\n489\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.330\nand the colors, and all that stuff.\n\n490\n00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.860\nGo to Change Picture, and\nlet's go in and change it to.\n\n491\n00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.040\nNow, I am gonna keep, since this is\nmore of a portrait aspect ratio,\n\n492\n00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.170\nI'm gonna choose a portrait picture.\n\n493\n00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:48.820\nIf you go back and\nforth from portrait to landscape,\n\n494\n00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.780\nit might get a little wonky sometimes.\n\n495\n00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.050\nIt might just be fine, so just giving\nyou a small little warning, and\n\n496\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.260\nnotice that perfect.\n\n497\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.880\nKeeps the same style, keeps the same size,\nand everything, I just went ahead and\n\n498\n00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.900\nchanged out the photo.\n\n499\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.720\nSometimes your colors will, like if\nI put on, I think it's one of these.\n\n500\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.953\nIf I color it and then change the picture,\nit's probably gonna prove me wrong.\n\n501\n00:25:11.953 --> 00:25:16.750\nOkay, good, yay,\nsee it didn't stay orange.\n\n502\n00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:21.790\nSometimes it won't keep everything, but\nat least it doesn't change the size and\n\n503\n00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:26.260\nthe positioning and everything, so\nthat's kind of a neat thing there.\n\n504\n00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:34.260\nAll right, let's move on to,\nooh alternate text, this is important.\n\n505\n00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.850\nIt's a thing that everybody\nshould be aware of and utilize,\n\n506\n00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:44.990\nbecause alternate text is in\nrelationship to accessibility, right?\n\n507\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.140\nBecause we can see this photograph,\nbut for\n\n508\n00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.560\nimages that are non-sighted, we need\nto be able to describe this photograph.\n\n509\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.150\nBecause anybody that is visually impaired,\nthey have normally,\n\n510\n00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:04.350\na setup to where a combination of\nhardware and software that will read\n\n511\n00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:09.140\nthe images and the different things\nthat are on their screen to them.\n\n512\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.506\nAnd this is why adding a description,\nthis metadata,\n\n513\n00:26:12.506 --> 00:26:17.860\nthis alternate text to this photograph,\nthat's where it's going to come into play.\n\n514\n00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.876\nAnd I know a lot of organizations,\nespecially working for\n\n515\n00:26:19.876 --> 00:26:21.080\ndifferent government agencies.\n\n516\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.400\nI mean, you do have like\na certain level of ADA compliance.\n\n517\n00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Compliance, for sure.\n\n518\n00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.070\nI mean not only is it\nthe nice thing to do,\n\n519\n00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:35.070\nbut just to make sure\nthe companies are abiding by that.\n\n520\n00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.960\nAnd making sure that this\ninformation is accessible for all.\n\n521\n00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.120\nAnd it's really cool the way\nthat they go ahead and\n\n522\n00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.100\nactually leverage this metadata in\nalgorithms to even help sort and filter.\n\n523\n00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.814\nAnd provide information in an easily\nreadily available format, so\n\n524\n00:26:48.814 --> 00:26:49.931\nit's pretty cool.\n\n525\n00:26:49.931 --> 00:26:55.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's not that much more that\nwe need to do to add alternate text.\n\n526\n00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:01.070\nI'm gonna a little detour in Windows,\nand that's why I kept in the show notes.\n\n527\n00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.795\nIf you look at the episode notes for\nthis particular episode,\n\n528\n00:27:04.795 --> 00:27:08.088\nleft a bunch of information\nin there about intelligent\n\n529\n00:27:08.088 --> 00:27:13.010\nservices that will automatically\nadd alternate text to your images.\n\n530\n00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.638\nIt's only on a PC though.\n\n531\n00:27:13.638 --> 00:27:17.143\nAnd I did a lot of testing that\nI believe it has something to\n\n532\n00:27:17.143 --> 00:27:21.170\ndo with the level of subscription\nthat we have with our products.\n\n533\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.237\nCuz we are on an enterprise level license,\nand so we got it a little early.\n\n534\n00:27:24.237 --> 00:27:27.429\nSo just know that I kept it in the notes,\nand\n\n535\n00:27:27.429 --> 00:27:32.500\nyou're reading about it,\nit's not going to apply to Word for Mac.\n\n536\n00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.780\nBecause I think it's also, a lot of\nintelligent services are using the Bing-\n\n537\n00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n538\n00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.340\na lot of those,\neven just cognitive services in general.\n\n539\n00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.930\nThis is something that,\nVonne's kind of ahead of the game here,\n\n540\n00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.860\nwhile explaining that in this show.\n\n541\n00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.370\nBecause I think it's one of those\ntechnologies that are gonna\n\n542\n00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.330\nbe rapidly developing in the near future.\n\n543\n00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I've also seen third party\nproducts that will do a lot of your\n\n544\n00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.710\naccessibility stuff, like adding alternate\ntext to your images automatically.\n\n545\n00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:04.650\nIt does it outside, it can see the\npicture, it starts getting a little scary.\n\n546\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.870\n&gt;&gt; We're getting better with AI and\nthose algorithms, and\n\n547\n00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.110\nlooking at facial recognition and\nthings like that.\n\n548\n00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.030\nSo it's definitely improving.\n\n549\n00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it can be a little scary,\nlike how does it know who I am?\n\n550\n00:28:15.278 --> 00:28:15.814\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n551\n00:28:15.814 --> 00:28:18.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean, that's what's so\n\n552\n00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.140\ncool about technology, too.\n\n553\n00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.730\nSo just know that the Windows\nversion does have some\n\n554\n00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.400\nadding alternate text automatically.\n\n555\n00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.180\nBut regardless, how do you add\nalternate text to your image?\n\n556\n00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.730\nLet me show you,\nlet's come back down into this picture.\n\n557\n00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.740\nIt's in that Format Task pane,\nRight, the Format Picture that\n\n558\n00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.410\nwe went to that I pointed out like,\nwe're gonna come back to this later.\n\n559\n00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:38.440\nHere we are.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n560\n00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.950\n&gt;&gt; That little button right there,\n\n561\n00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:44.520\nwe can go to Alternate Text, and\nnotice we have a title and description.\n\n562\n00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:50.210\nAnd I also included in the episode notes,\nthis website that one,\n\n563\n00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.610\nit is how you can get to\nadding alternate text.\n\n564\n00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:59.510\nThis is just your Microsoft Help files\nto adding it to any graphical element.\n\n565\n00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.980\nThis could be a picture,\n\n566\n00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.202\na shape, SmartArt,\nall these things that we're going to add.\n\n567\n00:29:04.202 --> 00:29:09.688\nSo it's just telling you about how you can\nget to it in all of your Office products.\n\n568\n00:29:09.688 --> 00:29:13.979\nI added this one in here from this blog,\nfrom Terrill Thompson,\n\n569\n00:29:13.979 --> 00:29:17.630\nwhich I thought was really interesting.\n\n570\n00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:22.120\nAnd I'll try to keep this short, because\nthis article explains it really well.\n\n571\n00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.040\nBut there's something like when, cuz I\nknow about alternate text from doing HTML.\n\n572\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:32.420\nWhere I would add an image, and\nthere's your tags and your attributes.\n\n573\n00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.530\nAnd you have an alt text or\nalt attribute to be able to speak it.\n\n574\n00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.698\nAnd this is something that you might\nencounter to where you don't see\n\n575\n00:29:39.698 --> 00:29:40.360\nthe picture.\n\n576\n00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.230\nYou see an X but then you see words on\nthe picture of where it's supposed to be.\n\n577\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.930\nThat's where it's introduced, and\n\n578\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.060\nit talks about the alt versus the long\ndescription and how that kinda changed.\n\n579\n00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.620\nBut I always thought you\nwould just use alt, and\n\n580\n00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.253\nyou don't have to do long description,\nright?\n\n581\n00:29:56.253 --> 00:30:01.807\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean, you did incorporate\nthis information in the, what was it,\n\n582\n00:30:01.807 --> 00:30:07.580\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Advanced for\nPC or for our Microsoft environments.\n\n583\n00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:13.527\nSo you always have that show to check out\nif you wanna learn more about that, too.\n\n584\n00:30:13.527 --> 00:30:16.629\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we're working on\nthat show together weren't we?\n\n585\n00:30:16.629 --> 00:30:17.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [CROSSTALK] together, yeah.\n\n586\n00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.189\n&gt;&gt; It's like deja vu!\n\n587\n00:30:19.189 --> 00:30:22.733\n[LAUGH] Yeah, and this is back I would\nalways add the alt and the title and\n\n588\n00:30:22.733 --> 00:30:25.756\nsay how it's gonna correlate,\nand the long description.\n\n589\n00:30:25.756 --> 00:30:27.539\nAnd I was like, they don't really need,\nit reads the title.\n\n590\n00:30:27.539 --> 00:30:31.610\nWell this one kinda showed me\nhow different screen readers and\n\n591\n00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.915\nthe technology, how it treats\nthe difference between a title and\n\n592\n00:30:35.915 --> 00:30:39.057\ndescription, and it's pretty interesting.\n\n593\n00:30:39.057 --> 00:30:45.044\nAnd just to kinda summarize it, down the\nbottom, you wanna just remember one thing,\n\n594\n00:30:45.044 --> 00:30:50.310\nuse the description not the title,\nwhich I always had it backwards.\n\n595\n00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.540\nI thought it was just tile,\nnot the description.\n\n596\n00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.356\nWell all these things\nthat actually looks for\n\n597\n00:30:54.356 --> 00:30:56.137\nthe description over the title, who knew?\n\n598\n00:30:56.137 --> 00:30:58.170\nThought that was pretty cool.\n\n599\n00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:03.600\nSo back to here, this is where you would\nwanna add a description of this picture.\n\n600\n00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:09.460\nYou could say man standing\non ledge [LAUGH] of a fort.\n\n601\n00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.700\nI don't know if anybody-\n&gt;&gt; Stone.\n\n602\n00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n603\n00:31:13.475 --> 00:31:15.315\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wall or something.\n\n604\n00:31:15.315 --> 00:31:18.800\nBut then people would be like\nStonewall Jackson or anything.\n\n605\n00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.400\n&gt;&gt; Of a stone wall.\n\n606\n00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.290\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, this is kind of where it\nstill gets a little tricky sometimes\n\n607\n00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:29.035\ntrying to make it as generic but\nspecific as possible.\n\n608\n00:31:29.035 --> 00:31:29.705\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n609\n00:31:29.705 --> 00:31:30.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little like\n\n610\n00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.240\nhow do I say this?\n\n611\n00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.578\nAnd I don't even know where to go.\n\n612\n00:31:33.578 --> 00:31:38.690\nBut maybe for both, I would probably\ndo the same thing in the title and\n\n613\n00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.600\ndescription, just duplicate it.\n\n614\n00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.430\nThat way, you kinda cover all your bases.\n\n615\n00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.320\nBut I just thought that article was really\ninteresting that it looks more towards\n\n616\n00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.517\nthe description than the title.\n\n617\n00:31:47.517 --> 00:31:51.810\nI always had it backwards,\nso something to know about.\n\n618\n00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:56.300\nAnd then one other thing about alternate\ntext that I wanted to point out is that,\n\n619\n00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.670\nif I insert a picture,\nthis will take just a second.\n\n620\n00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.760\nIf I go to Insert a Picture &gt; From File,\nand I go to,\n\n621\n00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.230\nlet's just pick this one, okay?\n\n622\n00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.210\nNotice in the alt text\nthere's nothing in there.\n\n623\n00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:16.100\nBut if I had brought in\na picture from dragging and\n\n624\n00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:21.510\ndropping it, watch what happens\nhere to the alternate text box.\n\n625\n00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.050\nLet me select it first,\n\n626\n00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.980\nit will automatically add\nthe file path in the description.\n\n627\n00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.860\nIt's just how it works.\n\n628\n00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.298\nWhich you should be aware of,\n\n629\n00:32:31.298 --> 00:32:35.217\nbecause that's probably not what you want\nthe description of the picture to be.\n\n630\n00:32:35.217 --> 00:32:39.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, it makes sense to you here\nlocally, but whenever you're uploading it\n\n631\n00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.560\nto a website or something,\nit loses it loses that relevance there.\n\n632\n00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.213\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz this doesn't mean\nanything to anybody else, so\n\n633\n00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:47.930\nthat's something you've\ngotta be careful of.\n\n634\n00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.780\nIf you want to just make sure you always\navoid that, always go to the Insert Photo\n\n635\n00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:57.230\nor Insert Image dialog box,\nor that command.\n\n636\n00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:01.740\nDon't do the drag and\ndrop from outside into Word.\n\n637\n00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.390\nI saw some stuff online\nwhere people were like,\n\n638\n00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.270\nyou can write this macro to\nmake sure it always does.\n\n639\n00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.410\nIt's just the nature of the program.\n\n640\n00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:11.240\nSo if it's something to be aware of,\nand if you don't want it to happen,\n\n641\n00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.200\ngo this way when adding your images or\nyour pictures into your document.\n\n642\n00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.420\nDon't go the drag and drop way,\ncuz that's what's gonna happen.\n\n643\n00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.480\nSo I think we covered everything\nthat I wanted to in my notes,\n\n644\n00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.570\nI'm just looking to make sure.\n\n645\n00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.585\nWe talked about that alternate test text,\ndid all the fun pizzazz stuff, so\n\n646\n00:33:27.585 --> 00:33:30.555\nlots of different things to use for\nformatting your images.\n\n647\n00:33:30.555 --> 00:33:32.417\nI could do two full parts with that one.\n\n648\n00:33:32.417 --> 00:33:34.745\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; Just having too much fun over here.\n\n649\n00:33:34.745 --> 00:33:37.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well I think that leaves us\nwith a great deal of information, Vonne.\n\n650\n00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.268\nSo we can go and\nstart getting creative and crafty, or\n\n651\n00:33:41.268 --> 00:33:44.692\njust at least enhancing our work or\nwhatever it is.\n\n652\n00:33:44.692 --> 00:33:46.592\nThank you for that, I appreciate it.\n\n653\n00:33:46.592 --> 00:33:48.072\nAnd thank you for joining us as well.\n\n654\n00:33:48.072 --> 00:33:50.652\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n655\n00:33:50.652 --> 00:33:52.214\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n656\n00:33:52.214 --> 00:33:53.956\n&gt;&gt;

Thank you so much for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.891\nAlways a pleasure to be back.\n\n10\n00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:32.391\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I feel like, today, ladies and\n\n11\n00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.240\ngentlemen, this episode is\nbrought to you by the letter H.\n\n12\n00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.080\nHere with our shapes.\n\n13\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we're going to cover the alphabet\n\n14\n00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.190\nand shapes today.\n\n15\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.360\nBut no, what're we really looking at?\n\n16\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.498\n&gt;&gt; We're covering shapes.\n\n17\n00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:42.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n19\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.530\nit's going to be things like a circle,\nand a square.\n\n20\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Whoo.\n&gt;&gt; And a pentagon that we couldn't figure\n\n21\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.521\nout with how many shapes.\n\n22\n00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.025\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:54.390\n&gt;&gt; It's like we probably should be\n\n24\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.906\nwatching Sesame Street right now,\n\n25\n00:00:55.906 --> 00:00:58.380\nand reminding ourselves of\nwhat the differences are.\n\n26\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.010\nBut luckily, that Microsoft goes ahead and\nhas a whole shape gallery for us,\n\n27\n00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.741\nthat we just go ahead and\npick that, say, I wanna draw that.\n\n28\n00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:09.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're going to do today.\n\n29\n00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:12.345\nAnd then we're gonna get\nback into formatting it, and\n\n30\n00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:16.129\nthis is continuing on with our\ngraphical elements within Word.\n\n31\n00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:21.120\nAnd there's actually a few things that\nwe're gonna go over today in the realm of\n\n32\n00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.485\nword wrap and positioning, that I didn't\ntechnically cover in the Images episode,\n\n33\n00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:31.110\nbut it all applies because well,\nthey're all graphical elements.\n\n34\n00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.612\nSo it's kind of one for\nall, all for one, hooray.\n\n35\n00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:36.338\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know where that came from.\n\n36\n00:01:36.338 --> 00:01:37.698\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:38.867\n&gt;&gt; But why don't we go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:39.460\nget started.\n\n39\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.660\nI have a blank document,\nbecause it's nice to go ahead and\n\n40\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.220\nget, just some shapes going.\n\n41\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.300\nAnd then I do have another file,\nand I'm just using my Cmd+Tilde\n\n42\n00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.190\nto switch between open documents\nwithin the application.\n\n43\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.615\n&gt;&gt; That's some fancy wizardry right there.\n\n44\n00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:55.685\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n45\n00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:58.270\nI love that shortcut,\nit's one of my favorites of Cmd+Tilde.\n\n46\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.040\nLove it.\n\n47\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.020\nAnd with Windows, it's always the Alt+Tab.\n\n48\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.770\nSo we can cycle through.\n\n49\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.620\nBut within an application\nthat's all of the applications.\n\n50\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.740\nIf you're in a specific program\nyou can use the Cmd+Tilde.\n\n51\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.590\nAnd it doesn't do the Cmd+Tab\nwhere it's all the open apps.\n\n52\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.080\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; So that's kinda nice.\n\n53\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.220\nIn Word, actually, that is Cmd+F6.\n\n54\n00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n55\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.625\n&gt;&gt; In case you wanna know.\n\n56\n00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those weirder shortcuts.\n\n57\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.736\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna try that.\n\n58\n00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:26.856\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's for\n\n59\n00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:28.474\nopen documents in the-\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n60\n00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:32.800\nthat's just one of my huge pet peeves, is\ntrying to position things and everything.\n\n61\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.730\nSo if I can just flip through quickly,\nI don't even have to worry about all that.\n\n62\n00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.730\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I am the same way [LAUGH].\n\n63\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.780\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nflip over to this blank document.\n\n64\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.280\nAnd I need to add some shapes,\nwe're going to insert a shape so\n\n65\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.830\nthat's over on our Insert\ntab on our ribbon.\n\n66\n00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.430\nAnd we have in our illustrations group,\nwe have shapes.\n\n67\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.380\nWe click that down, and there's all\nof our crayons, as I call them.\n\n68\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.450\nThey're shapes, but\nI equate it to a box of crayons.\n\n69\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.110\nIn a sense that like I want to grab\nthe purple crayon out of the box.\n\n70\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.580\nSo I say, there's my purple crayon,\nand that gets in my hand.\n\n71\n00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.960\nAnd it doesn't do anything until\nI draw on a piece of paper.\n\n72\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.460\nIt's the same thing with your shapes.\n\n73\n00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.900\nBecause if I want to add a circle,\nI'll come down in here,\n\n74\n00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.430\nand I have some recently used shapes,\n\n75\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.400\nso if yours aren't up at the top that's\nbecause you haven't used them yet.\n\n76\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.840\nSo down here are basic shapes,\nI'll just go ahead and click the circle.\n\n77\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.575\nAnd then it doesn't do anything.\n\n78\n00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:25.220\nIt's that whole like,\n\n79\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.780\nyou got the crayon in your hand,\nnow you have to draw on a piece of paper.\n\n80\n00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.210\nSo that's one thing that people say,\nlike, it didn't happen.\n\n81\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.900\nYou gotta do it.\n\n82\n00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.380\nSo now your mouse cursor turns\ninto a little crosshair, so\n\n83\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.520\nthere are two ways to go ahead and\nput this shape onto the paper.\n\n84\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.990\nYou can single click once, and\nit just adds the shape in its default\n\n85\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.460\nsize, and\nproportions to whatever the shape is.\n\n86\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.080\nSo that's one way you can do it.\n\n87\n00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.990\nIt's gonna go ahead and\nthrow out that right now.\n\n88\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.330\nLook what happens up on our ribbon.\n\n89\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.180\nWe get our shape format contextual\ntab because we have a shape selected,\n\n90\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.010\nwhich will be coming back\nto us in just a little bit.\n\n91\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.250\nBut I'm just gonna click off into\nnowhere to deselect that shape.\n\n92\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.690\nCome back over into our insert, and\nthen go back and pick that same circle.\n\n93\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.398\nAnd show you the second way of\ninserting a shape into your document,\n\n94\n00:04:15.398 --> 00:04:17.296\nyou just click, hold, and drag.\n\n95\n00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:19.976\nNow if I click, hold and\ndrag with my mouse,\n\n96\n00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:23.055\nnotice that I can make\nthis whatever size I want.\n\n97\n00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:27.625\nI can make it more of an oval flat,\noval long-\n\n98\n00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:28.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:29.690\n&gt;&gt; I don't think those are the tech words.\n\n100\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.911\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I'm like, oblong?\n\n101\n00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.343\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was thinking,\n\n102\n00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:34.410\nI'm doing the same thing in my head.\n\n103\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.320\nI'm like, it's an oval and\nit's long [LAUGH].\n\n104\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.545\nI'm glad we're on the same wavelength.\n\n105\n00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:42.355\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, I know, this is so silly.\n\n106\n00:04:42.355 --> 00:04:45.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But we're right there,\nso we're good.\n\n107\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.100\nNow, I'm still holding my mouse\nbutton down, just so you know,\n\n108\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.930\nwhile I'm just dragging this around.\n\n109\n00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.405\nSo I can make it in an oblong,\noval, flat thing.\n\n110\n00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:55.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or I can hold my Shift key.\n\n111\n00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.400\nAnd if I keep my Shift key held down\nwhile I'm holding that mouse still,\n\n112\n00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.540\nit will constrain the proportions and\nmake a perfect circle.\n\n113\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.070\nIf you're going to do that, just make\nsure you let go of the mouse first and\n\n114\n00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.410\nthen your Shift key.\n\n115\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.960\nBecause sometimes if you just ever so\nslightly let go of that shift key first it\n\n116\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.780\nwill then go back to our\noblong oval flat thing.\n\n117\n00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So those are your two ways.\n\n118\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.240\nSingle click or click hold and\n\n119\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.239\ndrag using that Shift key to\nmaintain your proportions.\n\n120\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.170\nNow, once you have this in,\n\n121\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.310\nyou have your mouse cursor icons\nof the four pointed arrows,\n\n122\n00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.870\nmeaning that you are over something,\nlike an object that can be selected.\n\n123\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.680\nSo if I wanted to select this smaller\ncircle again, I single click.\n\n124\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.279\n&gt;&gt; That's Pluto.\n\n125\n00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.892\n&gt;&gt; Is that pizza?\n\n126\n00:05:39.892 --> 00:05:42.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So then what's this one?\n\n127\n00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:45.220\n&gt;&gt; Earth [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was like, gosh,\n\n128\n00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.780\nnow I've got to remember planet names.\n\n129\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.440\nMy very excited mother\njust served us nachos.\n\n130\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.050\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n131\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.370\nYeah it's like all people\nseem to need delicious pizza.\n\n132\n00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.902\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; For the iOS or OS models.\n\n133\n00:05:57.902 --> 00:05:59.852\n[CROSSTALK] Those things.\n\n134\n00:05:59.852 --> 00:06:01.005\nI did take that class and passed it.\n\n135\n00:06:01.005 --> 00:06:03.423\n[CROSSTALK] I love those.\n\n136\n00:06:03.423 --> 00:06:05.326\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n137\n00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:07.680\nyou're going to have to remind\nme about one for the planets.\n\n138\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.630\nSo yes, we have Earth and Pluto, and\nnow if I wanted to select Earth or Pluto,\n\n139\n00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.050\nyou could see I just go and\nfind those four pointed arrows.\n\n140\n00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.150\nSelect it, get the bounding box around it.\n\n141\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.320\nAnd now, you can move these\nindependently as their own objects.\n\n142\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.930\nAs opposed to remember when we put in\nan image back in that particular episode,\n\n143\n00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.420\nI couldn't just move it around\nfreely on the page automatically.\n\n144\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.942\nSo that's just like a slight\ndifference between shapes and\n\n145\n00:06:34.942 --> 00:06:38.430\nimages cuz I could go ahead and\nmove this over here, move it over there.\n\n146\n00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.390\nIt doesn't matter if I have paragraphs or\nwhat-have-you,\n\n147\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.450\nbecause that's just the nature\nof a shape within Word.\n\n148\n00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.230\nSo moving it, we can also resize it,\nyou can grab a corner.\n\n149\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.270\nAnd with this one,\nwhat I supposed to the image,\n\n150\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.320\nimages described the current\nwith maintain the proportions.\n\n151\n00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.540\nIn this one you have to hold your Shift\nkey, once you hold your Shift key,\n\n152\n00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.090\nthen you can go ahead and sized this and\nkeep it proportional to itself or\n\n153\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.930\nyou can just let it go entire freely and\nmake it back into our oblong shapes.\n\n154\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.280\nBut I'll use that Shift key,\nmake it proportional,\n\n155\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.050\nbecause I'm pretty sure Pluto\nis a lot smaller than Earth.\n\n156\n00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.005\nSo I just made it a little bit smaller.\n\n157\n00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:16.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\n\n158\n00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.890\nSo, Pluto's gonna become a little\nbit more oblong for right now.\n\n159\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH],\n\n160\n00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:23.212\n&gt;&gt; Just to prove the point of\n\n161\n00:07:23.212 --> 00:07:26.337\nthe rotator icon at the top.\nBecause if you rotate a circle,\n\n162\n00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:27.820\nyou can't really tell.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n163\n00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.591\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:30.095\n&gt;&gt; So once I come in here,\n\n165\n00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:35.008\nI can go ahead and freely rotate this to\nthe angle that I want it to be, and so\n\n166\n00:07:35.008 --> 00:07:37.571\non and so forth.\nNow what if you don't\n\n167\n00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:41.801\nwant this anymore like sorry Pluto you\ngotta go away, you can just hit the delete\n\n168\n00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:43.780\nkey on your keyboard\n&gt;&gt; That happens.\n\n169\n00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.815\n&gt;&gt; It did because dropped,\nit's not a planet anymore.\n\n170\n00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:46.900\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n171\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.390\n&gt;&gt; See look at what we're doing here,\nit is like Sesame Street, right?\n\n172\n00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.640\nAnd Pluto is not a planet.\n\n173\n00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.070\nIt's a rock formation or something.\n\n174\n00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.430\n&gt;&gt; Dwarf star, maybe, now?\n\n175\n00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.348\n&gt;&gt; I will defer to that.\n\n176\n00:07:59.348 --> 00:08:01.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because as soon as I started talking,\n\n177\n00:08:01.744 --> 00:08:05.173\nI'm like I actually don't know what\nthey classify it as now anymore.\n\n178\n00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:07.928\nI'm not sure.\n[LAUGH] We'll have to look that up.\n\n179\n00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:10.940\n&gt;&gt; I think we'll go\nwith dwarf star though.\n\n180\n00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.626\nSpeaking of star,\nwhy don't we put in a star?\n\n181\n00:08:14.626 --> 00:08:16.700\nAnd then we can represent Pluto.\n\n182\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.340\n&gt;&gt; I think it might be something else.\n\n183\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.250\nI'm gonna Google while you're looking.\n\n184\n00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, perfect.\n\n185\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.980\nWe're gonna go ahead and make a star\nin our solar system right here.\n\n186\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.202\nTo go ahead and add that shape in.\n\n187\n00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:33.140\nAnd let's add one more just for\nfun, let's add our lightning bolt.\n\n188\n00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.680\nWe've gone off our planets,\nbut it's still Earthy science-\n\n189\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.440\n&gt;&gt; Nature.\n\n190\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.810\n&gt;&gt; Nature, yep, there we go [LAUGH].\n\n191\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'll just go ahead and click,\n\n192\n00:08:41.749 --> 00:08:42.530\nhold, and drag.\n\n193\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.596\n&gt;&gt; Dwarf planet, it is not a star [LAUGH].\n\n194\n00:08:44.596 --> 00:08:45.236\n&gt;&gt; It's a dwarf planet.\n\n195\n00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:46.995\nHey, he got half of it.\n\n196\n00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:49.013\n[LAUGH] I say that's passing,\nright there, so.\n\n197\n00:08:49.013 --> 00:08:52.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So now I've got my lightning,\n\n198\n00:08:52.887 --> 00:08:57.794\nI can rotate this to go ahead and\nturn it around a little bit, and\n\n199\n00:08:57.794 --> 00:08:59.840\nso on and so forth.\n\n200\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.450\nNow, the rotating is one thing you can do.\n\n201\n00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.312\nBut you can also flip it,\n\n202\n00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:09.763\nyou can flip this around a little\nbit to where if you wanted.\n\n203\n00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:12.694\nAnd I had to come down to this arrange,\ncuz again\n\n204\n00:09:12.694 --> 00:09:17.480\nwith the resolution you're probably\ngonna see all of these buttons in here.\n\n205\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.240\nBecause I was looking for this button,\nand I actually got a little scared.\n\n206\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.540\nI'm like wait, where did it go?\n\n207\n00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.780\nI'm like wait,\nit's gotta be in the arrange group, and\n\n208\n00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.860\nthat's why I couldn't see it.\n\n209\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.190\nBecause this lightning,\nI think I can rotate it but\n\n210\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.250\nI really want to turn it around.\n\n211\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Flip it on a vertical axis.\n\n212\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Correct, that's what I want to do and\nso that's where using my rotate command\n\n213\n00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:43.540\non the ribbon you can see it can rotate\n90 degrees or I can flip it here.\n\n214\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.570\nSo if I flip it vertical, oops,\nthat's not the one I want.\n\n215\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.530\nThat's okay, if you don't like it, undo\ncommand Z, and then flip it horizontal.\n\n216\n00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.790\nThat's the one I wanted to do.\n\n217\n00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.460\nSo just pick one and\nif it doesn't do it, do the other one.\n\n218\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.110\nSo that's where I wanted to kinda come\ndown, so it starts to look exactly, or\n\n219\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.658\nvery close,\nto my favorite hockey team's logo.\n\n220\n00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:04.377\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] and\n\n221\n00:10:04.377 --> 00:10:08.070\nit really proves the point of\nusing that flip horizontal.\n\n222\n00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.047\nSo that's how you can rotate it or use\nthe handle to go ahead and move it around.\n\n223\n00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:15.610\nNow, I don't have this in\nrelationship to text right now.\n\n224\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.120\nSo right now they're just kind\nof free forming elements and\n\n225\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.580\nwe're gonna use that to kind of\nto format and so on and so forth.\n\n226\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.130\nBut how we're going to use it\nwithin a word document with text,\n\n227\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.280\nlet's see how that goes.\n\n228\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.070\nGo on to insert, we're going to go with\nthe star again and it is down here, yep.\n\n229\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.050\nThere it is, stars and banners.\n\n230\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.337\nSelect my star, click hold and\ndrag and draw a star.\n\n231\n00:10:39.337 --> 00:10:43.530\nI'm not holding my shift key\njust to kind be fancy free.\n\n232\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.390\nNotice that it went ahead and\nput it in and\n\n233\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.890\nit also added that word wrap a little\ndifferently than it added with the image.\n\n234\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.620\nThe image,\n\n235\n00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.340\nit acted like a character within\nthe text that's inline with the text.\n\n236\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.495\nBut with the shape, it's known as through.\n\n237\n00:11:00.495 --> 00:11:03.745\nLet's look at this,\nlet's go back to the wrap text or\n\n238\n00:11:03.745 --> 00:11:07.519\nthe doggy that turned into\na rainbow somewhere along the way.\n\n239\n00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:11.447\nWe've got here,\nnotice it's on this through and so\n\n240\n00:11:11.447 --> 00:11:17.655\nall the text is wrapping around the shape\nboundary, which is pretty cool.\n\n241\n00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:19.775\nAnd it moves anywhere that it needs to.\n\n242\n00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:24.340\nAnd it does have this Move with\nText Automatically in that and of course,\n\n243\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.240\nreminding us of what that means,\nif I started adding more text,\n\n244\n00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.580\nthat actually didn't move with the text,\nbut that's okay.\n\n245\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.870\nBut if we needed to, we can attach it and\n\n246\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.920\nwe'll go over those\ndifferent options right now.\n\n247\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.760\nSo that was a little bit of a fail,\nbut that's all right.\n\n248\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.730\nSo we've got the text\nmoving around the star.\n\n249\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.470\nLet's come back over to that wrap again.\n\n250\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.550\nSo this is where we went over the wrapping\noptions with the image if were it was\n\n251\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.970\ninline with and that's where you can\nsee how it behaves like an image.\n\n252\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.250\nI'm gonna do a command z to undo that.\n\n253\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.800\nSo you can change these different\nthings but in this one I really wanted.\n\n254\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.340\nTo talk about these two things,\nthe square and the type.\n\n255\n00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.750\nBecause we did talk about\nthis in the image and\n\n256\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.820\nI just said like it keeps some texts\naround it a little bit more or less.\n\n257\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.940\nWell, that was with a picture that\ndoesn't have any transparency or\n\n258\n00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.730\nany things like this\nwhere it's just a shape.\n\n259\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.460\n&gt;&gt; We're basically forcing it out\nto the remitter of the square or\n\n260\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.610\nrectangle or whatever?\n\n261\n00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.500\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n262\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:31.760\nRight here, the bounding box of the star,\nthat is the option of using the square.\n\n263\n00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.090\nIf I use the Tight, notice that it goes\nahead and gets a little tighter around.\n\n264\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:41.290\nAnd just because I wanted to throw\nthis in with the images, and\n\n265\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.320\nI had mentioned it, of where,\nyou can go ahead and edit the points.\n\n266\n00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.820\nAnd we'll do that too, but I have a flower\nright here that does have transparency.\n\n267\n00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.500\nIt is GIF file format,\nback to when we talked about those\n\n268\n00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.670\nimage basics about the different\nfile types and what they support.\n\n269\n00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.480\nIf I pull in this GIF file, and\nlet's go ahead and minimize that down.\n\n270\n00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.110\nNotice it's doing any of the word\nwrapping right by default, which is fine.\n\n271\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.580\nI'm just using this to size it down.\n\n272\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.580\nIf I come in to here,\nlet me move this down,\n\n273\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.680\nlet's come over here to the wrap of\nthe text, and I'm going to go with square.\n\n274\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.830\nThat was one that it just\nwrapped square around.\n\n275\n00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.910\nIf I change this to tight, notice that\nI didn't even have to change anything\n\n276\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.160\nbecause of transparency,\nit did find The boundaries of that flower.\n\n277\n00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.630\nAnd that's where it's going to wrap\nthe text tightly around it versus square.\n\n278\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:40.650\nSo anytime you have transparency,\nthat's where it will look different.\n\n279\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.490\nI was demonstrating on a square JPEG so\n\n280\n00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.050\nthat's where it didn't\nreally make any difference.\n\n281\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.500\nAnyways, along those same lines,\n\n282\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:53.970\nwhere the text is wrapping around either\nof these shapes or this transparent GIF.\n\n283\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.268\nIt does depend on like the size or\nthe length of the word.\n\n284\n00:13:58.268 --> 00:14:03.197\nSo when you start moving around it\ndoes kind of adjust itself Based on\n\n285\n00:14:03.197 --> 00:14:04.760\nwhat words are here.\n\n286\n00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.840\nNotice this is a little bit\ncloser versus that one.\n\n287\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.820\nThere's a lot of white space around\nthis kind of top area of the star, so\n\n288\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.860\nyou could change that.\n\n289\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:20.765\nNot necessarily through the different\noptions here on the wrap text,\n\n290\n00:14:20.765 --> 00:14:24.180\nYou can go into this Edit Wrap Boundary.\n\n291\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.820\nAnd that's something that I kind of,\nsomething I glossed over in the image one.\n\n292\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.950\nBecause I didn't really have an example\nready for me to show, but now I do.\n\n293\n00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.740\nSo if I go to Edit Wrap Boundary,\nnotice it's kind of in\n\n294\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:41.220\nthese weird points of where it's\nfinding the boundary of that word wrap.\n\n295\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.180\nSo each one of these points can be moved.\n\n296\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.850\nIf I want to move this down,\nyou see how now, this kind of extra space,\n\n297\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.040\nI can control that a little bit better,\n\n298\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.640\nto where the text wraps a little\nbit more around right here.\n\n299\n00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.710\nI just won't really do anything right\nnow because there's no text around it.\n\n300\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:02.880\nBut notice if I like move this up,\nI can even come into,\n\n301\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.730\nnow I've got to go back into that again.\n\n302\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.530\nGet into where, it goes a little bit more.\n\n303\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.583\nAnd it's not really working so\nmuch in this particular area, but\n\n304\n00:15:11.583 --> 00:15:15.410\nI just want to let you know that you\ncan go further inside of the shape.\n\n305\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:20.815\nSo if you wanted to kind of customize\nthe text wrap on any object,\n\n306\n00:15:20.815 --> 00:15:23.285\nyou can do that and\njust grab the different points.\n\n307\n00:15:23.285 --> 00:15:25.985\n&gt;&gt; You might even be\nable to cheat a little\n\n308\n00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:29.105\nbit by using the space\nbar if it's not perfect.\n\n309\n00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:32.310\nEven if you go in a little bit and\nthen just kind of space it out.\n\n310\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can, and I mean that's\nwhere adding space in the text,\n\n311\n00:15:35.286 --> 00:15:37.210\nit does change the flow-\n&gt;&gt; Messes, yeah.\n\n312\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.720\nSo if you wanted to move it\nthat would be a headache.\n\n313\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.150\n&gt;&gt; But if its like this is where I'm never\ngoing to move, my text is done, yeah,\n\n314\n00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.480\nsure, show in those extra spaces.\n\n315\n00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.690\nWe all do those little like\nyou're not supposed to do that.\n\n316\n00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.210\nNo, totally you can do that.\n\n317\n00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.767\nIt's always good to kind\nof find the work around and\n\n318\n00:15:52.767 --> 00:15:54.674\nmake it do exactly what you want to do.\n\n319\n00:15:54.674 --> 00:15:56.055\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n320\n00:15:56.055 --> 00:16:00.360\nNow the positioning, this is something\nyou can do with any graphical object.\n\n321\n00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.610\nI am zooming out a little bit more, so\nyou can see this on the whole page.\n\n322\n00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:08.075\nBack over here on a range and\nposition This is something where it's\n\n323\n00:16:08.075 --> 00:16:12.310\ntalking about where you want it,\nin relationship to the page.\n\n324\n00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.890\nIf I wanted this on the top left corner\nof the page, I can put that there.\n\n325\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.950\nIf I wanted it in the middle,\nI think you're getting the idea here,\n\n326\n00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:26.040\nis you can change the position\nff where it fits on the page.\n\n327\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.230\nAnd that if you added more information,\nyou see how it's more of a fixed position\n\n328\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:36.670\non the page rather than kinda\nflowing with the flow of the text.\n\n329\n00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.640\nSo those are different things\nthat you can do with positioning\n\n330\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.410\nthat it does correlate with word wrap,\nbut it's a separate button.\n\n331\n00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:49.330\nAnd so that's why I wanted\nto throw that in together.\n\n332\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.490\nEnough about resizing,\nrotating, moving around,\n\n333\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.660\nmapping position, I want to get it on\nthe page in relationship to our text.\n\n334\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.800\nLet me go ahead and\ngo back to our regular shapes,\n\n335\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.510\nlet's talk a little bit\nmore about formatting them.\n\n336\n00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.780\nI don't necessarily want them to be blue.\n\n337\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.160\nI want it to be pink, and rainbows,\nand all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n338\n00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is already\nreminding me of the 80s, so\n\n339\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.372\nwe should go with, yes,\nvibrant neon colors.\n\n340\n00:17:15.372 --> 00:17:17.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some lime green.\n\n341\n00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n342\n00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:18.718\nAnd electric blue.\n\n343\n00:17:18.718 --> 00:17:19.800\nI like this.\n\n344\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.320\nOkay, let's go.\n\n345\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.500\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n346\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.530\n&gt;&gt; So I have to select [INAUDIBLE] I have\nto make sure I have whatever shape that I\n\n347\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:32.800\nwant selected, come over here to the Shape\nFormat tab, and I can start formatting.\n\n348\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.670\nRight over here we have the shape fill,\nthat would be the inside, and\n\n349\n00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.830\nthen the little crayon next to it,\nthat's the outline.\n\n350\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:45.600\nIf I default to saying fills and strokes,\nthat's just the terminology we use for\n\n351\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.510\nany vector graphics,\nespecially in Illustrator or InDesign.\n\n352\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:55.400\nAnd I'm very used to kinda calling them\nby those particular vocabulary words.\n\n353\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.120\nHere they call it Fills and Outlines.\n\n354\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.128\nSo an outline it's a stroke,\nstroke is an outline.\n\n355\n00:18:00.128 --> 00:18:01.763\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n356\n00:18:01.763 --> 00:18:03.660\n&gt;&gt; Click on to the drop down and\nwe've got all.\n\n357\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.966\n&gt;&gt; Different strokes for different folks.\n\n358\n00:18:04.966 --> 00:18:07.263\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I love it.\n\n359\n00:18:07.263 --> 00:18:08.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're just coming out with all\n\n360\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.245\nsorts of cool stuffs today, aren't you?\n\n361\n00:18:10.245 --> 00:18:11.235\n[LAUGH] I love it.\n\n362\n00:18:11.235 --> 00:18:14.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we've got our solid colors this\n\n363\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:19.070\nis based on our theme, we could always go\nand change our color themes back over in\n\n364\n00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.640\nthe design, just in case you're\nwondering where that is.\n\n365\n00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.280\nI accidentally collapsed my ribbon.\n\n366\n00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.700\nSo you can choose what colors we have,\nand the special colors.\n\n367\n00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.530\nWe did talk about this in the Word\nessentials class in the styles,\n\n368\n00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.090\nsets, and themes, or\nthemes and style sets.\n\n369\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.730\nSomething to that effect, so\nif you want more information on that\n\n370\n00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.700\ndefinitely go ahead and\nwatch that episode.\n\n371\n00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.630\nSo I'm coming back over here, but\nI want to add some other colors,\n\n372\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.170\nso we can always go to\nour more fill colors.\n\n373\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.540\nAnd we can also get in to our gradients,\nand our textures,\n\n374\n00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.650\nbecause of course-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.340\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft, they\n\n376\n00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.527\nlove that dead fish texture.\n\n377\n00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:54.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember that.\n\n378\n00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.970\nSo strange.\n\n379\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:55.973\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n380\n00:18:55.973 --> 00:18:58.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's been there forever.\n\n381\n00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:03.020\nSo we have some of our lime greens and\nour electric blues right here.\n\n382\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.910\nSo we could go ahead and do that.\n\n383\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.570\nBut if I did wanna rainbow,\nI can go into gradients and\n\n384\n00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.230\nthen there's down the bottom,\nthere's more gradients.\n\n385\n00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:16.365\nWhich actually is going to bring up\nthe format shape task pane, which we could\n\n386\n00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:21.674\nhave also gotten over to, or gone to the\nsame place over on that right hand side.\n\n387\n00:19:21.674 --> 00:19:23.160\n&gt;&gt; I've got another pneumonic for you.\n\n388\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; ROYGBIV.\n\n389\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:25.745\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n390\n00:19:25.745 --> 00:19:28.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Red, orange, yellow, green, blue,\n\n391\n00:19:28.123 --> 00:19:29.260\nindigo, and violet.\n\n392\n00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n393\n00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.079\nI talk about that in my color theory\nepisode in my Illustrator class.\n\n394\n00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:35.874\n&gt;&gt; Great [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Love talking about colors.\n\n395\n00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:39.710\n[LAUGH] When you do gradients\nin those different products.\n\n396\n00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:44.300\nLet me show you how to do this in Word,\nto over here on the right hand side and\n\n397\n00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.620\na lot of it's going to start\nto come in behind my head.\n\n398\n00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.190\nSo we'll just take me off screen.\n\n399\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.080\n[LAUGH] We've got our\ngradient fill right here.\n\n400\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.690\nAnd when I use my gradient fill,\nwe have some presets, but\n\n401\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:00.070\nit's only showing the theme colors\nin a dark to light or light to dark.\n\n402\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.910\nAnd then we have our different types.\n\n403\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.120\nWe have a linear, radial,\nrectangle, and path.\n\n404\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.480\nWe'll come back to that.\n\n405\n00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.340\nAfter we make our own colors.\n\n406\n00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.860\nCuz that's what I like.\n\n407\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.060\nSo down here, when you have a gradient,\nyou have a gradient ramp and\n\n408\n00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.650\nyou have color stops.\n\n409\n00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.780\nNow I'll call them houses,\nbecause they look like houses to me, so\n\n410\n00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.370\nthat's why I call them houses.\n\n411\n00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.200\nNow notice, this particular one we\nhave a white to a lighter blue,\n\n412\n00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.350\nto a darker blue, to a lighter blue.\n\n413\n00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.600\nThis is where you can select a house,\nand you can change its color.\n\n414\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.750\nI think we should make a very kind of a-\n&gt;&gt; Can we add houses?\n\n415\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.600\n&gt;&gt; We totally can.\n\n416\n00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Sweet.\n&gt;&gt; We can add colors.\n\n417\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.140\nWe're gonna go all Lisa Frank here.\n\n418\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.240\n&gt;&gt; I love Lisa Frank.\n\n419\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.320\nI was actually part of\nthe Lisa Frank fan club.\n\n420\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.810\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; True story.\n\n421\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:47.862\n&gt;&gt; My God, that's so cool.\n\n422\n00:20:47.862 --> 00:20:50.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm super impressed right now.\n\n423\n00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.728\n&gt;&gt; People especially the younger people,\nthey're like, what are they talking about?\n\n424\n00:20:54.728 --> 00:20:55.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, that is\n\n425\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.710\nthe coolest thing you could\nbe when you're eight or nine.\n\n426\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n427\n00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.368\n&gt;&gt; God, I had all of it.\n\n428\n00:21:01.368 --> 00:21:05.080\nSo we're gonna go with more colors,\ncuz all I did was select this house.\n\n429\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.680\nCame down to the color, and\nnow I'm going to come in and\n\n430\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.680\npick a very kinda hot pink, right there.\n\n431\n00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.300\nAnd now I've changed\nthe color of that house.\n\n432\n00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.790\nLet's come over to another house.\n\n433\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.780\nNow maybe I don't want four houses.\n\n434\n00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.640\nCuz you're asking about adding, well,\nyou can add and subtract houses.\n\n435\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.620\nSo all you have to do to get rid of one\nis select the house up here at the top,\n\n436\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.980\nyou can then remove this gradient house or\nstop.\n\n437\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.770\nAnd then I can take my house, and I can\nalso slide them up and down the ramp.\n\n438\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.880\nAnd this one we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose a yellow.\n\n439\n00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.520\nAnd then we'll choose this house, and\nwe'll choose a really vibrant blue.\n\n440\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.240\nAnd it starts to make our rainbow.\n\n441\n00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.841\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; But-\n\n442\n00:21:47.841 --> 00:21:48.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:21:48.365 --> 00:21:49.631\n&gt;&gt; We've got to have our purple\n\n444\n00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:50.378\nthere, right?\n\n445\n00:21:50.378 --> 00:21:52.489\nWe're gonna move this,\n&gt;&gt; Violet [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:21:52.489 --> 00:21:53.660\n&gt;&gt; Violet, yes.\n\n447\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.640\nViolet and indigo.\n\n448\n00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.060\nSo we'll come over here.\n\n449\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.240\nWe'll move it out.\n\n450\n00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.110\nBut now, I need another house.\n\n451\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.560\nSo just click the plus sign.\n\n452\n00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.280\nSo I add a house.\n\n453\n00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.480\nI added it in the middle as a green,\nwhich is kinda cool,\n\n454\n00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.760\nbecause depending on what house you\nselect when you add, it kinda takes and\n\n455\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.390\nadds in the middle, which would be\ncool if we wanted to move that over.\n\n456\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.280\nBut we can still move it over,\nand then just change the color.\n\n457\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We'll change that to a darker purple.\n\n458\n00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.980\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Now we're starting to get a nice\n\n459\n00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.830\nrainbow going here, lovely.\n\n460\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:27.010\nSo you can go ahead and customize your\ndifferent gradients that you want.\n\n461\n00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.200\nAnd add or remove houses,\nand then change the color.\n\n462\n00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.920\nAnd then once I have more of the colors\nup here on these different ones,\n\n463\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.410\nwhether you want it to be a lineal or a\nradial, now it's more of a circle whereas\n\n464\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:44.660\nthe direction of that, we can put it\nin the middle or put it off the side.\n\n465\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.430\nYou can also go with a-\n&gt;&gt; This looks like an infrared scan\n\n466\n00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.958\nor something.\n\n467\n00:22:47.958 --> 00:22:49.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\n\n468\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.800\nwe are scanning the universe.\n\n469\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are.\n\n470\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was looking for\nthose dwarf planets.\n\n471\n00:22:53.422 --> 00:22:55.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n472\n00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:58.090\nwe've got these different\nones with the path.\n\n473\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:03.450\nThis is where if you had this\napplied to say, one of these shapes,\n\n474\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.010\nit's gonna fall along the path.\n\n475\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.200\nSo that could be a lot of fun.\n\n476\n00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.260\nSo just changing the different types,\nthe direction,\n\n477\n00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.910\nand then the angle, if you had it\nas a linear gradient, notice that\n\n478\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:20.500\nthe linear gradient changes to what\ndirection, or angle you want to have that.\n\n479\n00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.140\nYou can do some cool fun stuff with that.\n\n480\n00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.620\nSo there we go.\n\n481\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.020\nWe've got our gradients as our fill for\nour shapes.\n\n482\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.940\nLot of fun stuff.\n\n483\n00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.950\nAnd you don't find gradients that\nare a whole bunch of different things.\n\n484\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:39.290\nYou could add a gradient\nrainbow outline to your image.\n\n485\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.750\nAnywhere where you find a gradient, and\n\n486\n00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:48.740\na gradient ramp to whatever element of\nyour graphical item, you can do all of it.\n\n487\n00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.625\nSo you do have to go into the format pane,\nthe format shape.\n\n488\n00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:56.340\nTaskmate, and\nthen you go ahead and do that.\n\n489\n00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.090\nAnd yes, you can add patterns and\ntextures.\n\n490\n00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.756\nYou can add that dead fish\nin there if you wanted to.\n\n491\n00:24:02.756 --> 00:24:07.553\nSo a lot more options come up in this\ntask pane over here on the right But\n\n492\n00:24:07.553 --> 00:24:13.179\ncoming back up to here notice that I have\nthe fills, as we were just concentrating\n\n493\n00:24:13.179 --> 00:24:18.270\non, but we can also add an outline\nmaybe want a pink outline on this.\n\n494\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.490\nYou can then come into the weight and\nmake it a little thicker.\n\n495\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:25.006\nYou could have done this over on the task\npane as well, notice there's that line\n\n496\n00:24:25.006 --> 00:24:28.053\nright there, you can expand it out and\ndo all the options from there.\n\n497\n00:24:28.053 --> 00:24:32.491\nAnd then you have the same effects\nthat we went over in the images,\n\n498\n00:24:32.491 --> 00:24:37.760\nwhere we could have the Glows and\nthe Soft Edges and the 3-D Rotations.\n\n499\n00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.290\nYou also have some Presets where\nit does all of this together.\n\n500\n00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:41.990\nAnd these,\n\n501\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:46.630\non shapes, they show up a little bit\nmore than if you did this on an image.\n\n502\n00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:47.330\nLike for example,\n\n503\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:52.330\nif I chose this particular preset\non a shape, that looks pretty cool.\n\n504\n00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou've got more angles to work with.\n\n505\n00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:54.680\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\n\n506\n00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.830\nif you did this on an image it just\ndoesn't do some of the shading just right.\n\n507\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.250\nSo you could go in and change these.\n\n508\n00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.390\nYou can start with the presets, and\nthen you can format from there.\n\n509\n00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.730\nYou also have your styles.\n\n510\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.270\nNow with your styles and your shape\nit's really just like your fills and\n\n511\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.010\nstrokes and/or not strokes and the effect.\n\n512\n00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.020\nSo, end up going through all\nthese different pieces and\n\n513\n00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.830\nadding what you want in\nthere can be a lot of fun.\n\n514\n00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:25.110\nSo just play around with that, select it,\nformat it how you want it to go.\n\n515\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.619\nSo let's move on to adding\ntext into our shape,\n\n516\n00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:32.494\ncuz I have this circle or\nrainbow Lisa Frank circle.\n\n517\n00:25:32.494 --> 00:25:36.946\nAnd I want to add,\nlet's add your name in there.\n\n518\n00:25:36.946 --> 00:25:37.763\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:25:37.763 --> 00:25:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\ncuz everything had to have our name on it.\n\n520\n00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.040\nWhich I could, I have never\nfound my name on any of those.\n\n521\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.679\n&gt;&gt; You're telling me.\n\n522\n00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:44.733\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n523\n00:25:44.733 --> 00:25:45.799\n&gt;&gt; I was like, you can actually\n\n524\n00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:46.336\nfeel my pain.\n\n525\n00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:49.440\nIt was customized license plates, pencils.\n\n526\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.018\n&gt;&gt; I did go on a vacation once\nto Cherokee, North Carolina, and\n\n527\n00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:54.428\nthat was like ta-dah!\n\n528\n00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:58.034\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man, yeah, there's no Vonne anywhere,\n\n529\n00:25:58.034 --> 00:26:02.808\n[LAUGH] especially the way I spell it too,\nso that was one of those things but\n\n530\n00:26:02.808 --> 00:26:06.129\nmy mom would make my own\nshirt like iron on letters.\n\n531\n00:26:06.129 --> 00:26:06.766\n&gt;&gt; Sweet.\n\n532\n00:26:06.766 --> 00:26:07.615\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n533\n00:26:07.615 --> 00:26:09.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, we can do them if you want.\n\n534\n00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.205\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we do both.\n\n535\n00:26:10.205 --> 00:26:11.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; How about that.\n\n536\n00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.260\nSo we're going to add text.\n\n537\n00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.200\nI feel like,\nhow do you add text to a shape.\n\n538\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.460\nIt's almost a little misleading\nbecause it's almost too simple.\n\n539\n00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.880\nYou just start typing.\n\n540\n00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:25.661\nYou select the shape and\njust put in Vonne and Cherokee.\n\n541\n00:26:25.661 --> 00:26:29.966\nNow, it's a really small right now and\nit's in white so you can't see it very\n\n542\n00:26:29.966 --> 00:26:33.623\nwell, but this is where just like\nwith any text you can select it.\n\n543\n00:26:33.623 --> 00:26:36.620\nBut then you go back\nover to your Home tab and\n\n544\n00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:42.202\nthis is where you can start changing\nthe font size, you could change the black,\n\n545\n00:26:42.202 --> 00:26:48.190\nthe color of the text, you can make it a\ndifferent font and all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n546\n00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:54.303\nAnd let's go into Cooper Black cuz\nthat's my favorite font right there.\n\n547\n00:26:54.303 --> 00:26:55.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's kind of like\n\n548\n00:26:55.748 --> 00:26:58.472\nthe iron on letters that would\ngo on my shirt my mom would do.\n\n549\n00:26:58.472 --> 00:26:59.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n550\n00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.230\n&gt;&gt; So we've got that and\nwe could say, Love Lisa, and\n\n551\n00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.610\nwe'll say, LF, right, for Lisa Frank.\n\n552\n00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.806\nSo, there we go, we can change all\nthose different things in there.\n\n553\n00:27:10.806 --> 00:27:12.640\nNow, I just gonna clicked off the site and\n\n554\n00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.810\nreally on to the edge of my shape\nbecause now I can come back over and\n\n555\n00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.600\ndo a few other things with my\ntext formatting if I wanted to.\n\n556\n00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.290\nYou have the text fill and you also\nhave the text stroke, if you wanted to.\n\n557\n00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.674\nIf you wanted to add\na white stroke on this,\n\n558\n00:27:29.674 --> 00:27:35.140\ndepending on the type of font you have,\nthe stroke might be too much.\n\n559\n00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially with thinner fonts,\nI think.\n\n560\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.670\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and\nyou can also change the size of it, but\n\n561\n00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.640\nthe weight of the stroke\ndoesn't really change much.\n\n562\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.200\nSo, you just gonna have to play around and\nsee what that looks like.\n\n563\n00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.840\nYou also have a whole bunch of\neffects that you can add on your text.\n\n564\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.141\nSo we had our effects on our shape and\n\n565\n00:27:54.141 --> 00:27:58.662\nwe also have the effects\non the text inside of it.\n\n566\n00:27:58.662 --> 00:28:00.720\nYou can also transform this.\n\n567\n00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.270\nYou can make it kind of go in an oval.\n\n568\n00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.070\nAll sorts of fun stuff.\n\n569\n00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.634\nNeat things,\nwe could add shadows more if I want to.\n\n570\n00:28:07.634 --> 00:28:12.536\n&gt;&gt; I remember when I was in elementary\nschool they had a preset of a rainbow\n\n571\n00:28:12.536 --> 00:28:15.700\ngradient for text, does that still exist?\n\n572\n00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.900\nThe word art one?\n\n573\n00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n574\n00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they took away that rainbow.\n\n575\n00:28:20.395 --> 00:28:22.015\nI know which one you're talking about.\n\n576\n00:28:22.015 --> 00:28:25.019\nYeah, they don't have it as\na default word art set anymore.\n\n577\n00:28:25.019 --> 00:28:25.749\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n578\n00:28:25.749 --> 00:28:27.397\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI'm a little bummed on that one.\n\n579\n00:28:27.397 --> 00:28:29.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know exactly what you're talking\n\n580\n00:28:29.323 --> 00:28:31.483\nabout on the older versions of\nany of our Office products.\n\n581\n00:28:31.483 --> 00:28:32.483\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm [LAUGH].\n\n582\n00:28:32.483 --> 00:28:34.303\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they kind of took it away,\n\n583\n00:28:34.303 --> 00:28:37.469\nI guess they wanted to be\na little bit more professional.\n\n584\n00:28:37.469 --> 00:28:38.119\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n585\n00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:38.668\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n586\n00:28:38.668 --> 00:28:40.046\n&gt;&gt; As we're sitting here and\n\n587\n00:28:40.046 --> 00:28:41.955\ntalking about rainbows and stars.\n\n588\n00:28:41.955 --> 00:28:47.112\n[LAUGH] Exactly, so that's how you\ncan add text to any of your shapes.\n\n589\n00:28:47.112 --> 00:28:52.640\nNow, some shapes might not really\nlend itself to adding text,\n\n590\n00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.450\nlike in this lightning,\nthat might be a little harder.\n\n591\n00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.713\nBut also the text direction whether\nyou want it to go horizontal or\n\n592\n00:29:00.713 --> 00:29:02.740\nrotating it within the shape.\n\n593\n00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.340\nI'm just doing command z right there.\n\n594\n00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.702\nAnd also how you align the text,\nyou can see where you can throw it more to\n\n595\n00:29:09.702 --> 00:29:13.289\nthe top of the shape, or\nto more of the bottom of the shape.\n\n596\n00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:15.765\nSo that's something you\ncan play around with.\n\n597\n00:29:15.765 --> 00:29:17.321\nSometimes it shows it in the middle but\n\n598\n00:29:17.321 --> 00:29:19.970\nit doesn't really look\nlike it's in the middle.\n\n599\n00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.060\nAs a circle, this is a pretty easy one.\n\n600\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.830\nYou get into your stars and\nyou are kind of not so\n\n601\n00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:30.332\nregular shapes, it might be\na little misleading on how it is.\n\n602\n00:29:30.332 --> 00:29:32.430\nOops, sorry,\nI accidentally clicked the create link and\n\n603\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.950\nI don't need that create link.\n\n604\n00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.255\nSo we're going to just stop and just undo.\n\n605\n00:29:37.255 --> 00:29:39.080\n[LAUGH] So I can get rid of that.\n\n606\n00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.170\nSo that's kind of some fun things you can\ndo with adding text into the shape and\n\n607\n00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.430\nthen how you can format it.\n\n608\n00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:50.120\nJust a few more small things before\nwe move off of adding our shapes and\n\n609\n00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.270\nformatting.\n\n610\n00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.640\nBecause once you get into here, we will\ntalk about all of the arrangements, and\n\n611\n00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.640\nwe'll get into the multiple\nshapes in the next episode.\n\n612\n00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.300\nBut I wanted to go over\nsome special shapes.\n\n613\n00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.250\nWhat I mean by special is some of them,\nthat you add in here,\n\n614\n00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.445\nhave these little yellow diamonds on them.\n\n615\n00:30:08.445 --> 00:30:10.900\nOne of them is the sun.\n\n616\n00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.560\nBack to our planets and solar system-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n617\n00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.450\n&gt;&gt; And science stuff.\n\n618\n00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.280\nNotice when I add the sun shape,\nthere is this little,\n\n619\n00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:22.190\nwell, it's actually not a diamond anymore,\nit's now a yellow square, okay?\n\n620\n00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.190\nBut it's yellow, nonetheless.\n\n621\n00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.590\nThis is where it will change the shape.\n\n622\n00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:32.234\nNotice when I grab that yellow dot now and\nclick hold and drag in,\n\n623\n00:30:32.234 --> 00:30:37.567\nsee how like the rays the sun gets like\nlonger and the middle gets smaller.\n\n624\n00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:40.693\nOr if I change this it goes out\nat the middle, it gets bigger and\n\n625\n00:30:40.693 --> 00:30:42.630\nthe rays gets a little smaller.\n\n626\n00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:43.320\nThat kind of thing.\n\n627\n00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.590\nSo some shapes have\nthis shape manipulation\n\n628\n00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.040\non it where you can mess around with it.\n\n629\n00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.758\nI think, in Word, it actually has\nwhere you can change the number\n\n630\n00:30:53.758 --> 00:30:57.149\nof rays on the sun,\ncuz I don't hsave it in the Mac version.\n\n631\n00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:58.313\nIt's only on the PC version.\n\n632\n00:30:58.313 --> 00:31:02.980\nBut then, the other thing you\ncould do is you can go in and\n\n633\n00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.460\nedit the points of the shape.\n\n634\n00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.070\nSo for example, if I really wanted,\nbecause this is pretty close too,\n\n635\n00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.676\nthe lightning logo.\n\n636\n00:31:10.676 --> 00:31:13.780\nBut there's been at the top's\na little bit extended out, and\n\n637\n00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.750\nthis is gonna get down a little bit more.\n\n638\n00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.448\nI can move this points,\nI can take this button.\n\n639\n00:31:20.448 --> 00:31:22.359\n&gt;&gt; I have a feeling this wouldn't\nhave been the first time you've\n\n640\n00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:23.018\ndone this see there?\n\n641\n00:31:23.018 --> 00:31:23.541\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n642\n00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:24.084\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n643\n00:31:24.084 --> 00:31:26.844\nevery time I do this it never\nends up looking like logo and\n\n644\n00:31:26.844 --> 00:31:28.972\nlike this is actually the closest it gets.\n\n645\n00:31:28.972 --> 00:31:30.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can edit the points and\n\n646\n00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.280\nnotice that each one,\nhere let me change this shape color so\n\n647\n00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.570\nthat you can see that a little bit better.\n\n648\n00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.590\nSee each one of these black\ndots indicates a point.\n\n649\n00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.280\nSo I can like, move that up a little bit.\n\n650\n00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.432\nThis gets extended out,\nmaybe just a little bit.\n\n651\n00:31:44.432 --> 00:31:46.700\nThat's pretty close actually.\n\n652\n00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.910\nThis moves up slightly.\n\n653\n00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.000\nBut you can see, each one of these points,\nI can go ahead and\n\n654\n00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.470\nmodify just a little bit.\n\n655\n00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:59.440\nTo go ahead and just manipulate\nthat shape taking this sun.\n\n656\n00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.850\nI can take and edit the points.\n\n657\n00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.810\nMaybe I want just that one\npoint to be a little further.\n\n658\n00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:05.730\nOoh, whoa, hello, that's really far up.\n\n659\n00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:10.630\nNow I don't want to get too far\ninto this because this goes into\n\n660\n00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:15.840\nunderstanding vectors and Bezier points\nand handles and what I call see saws.\n\n661\n00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.930\nAnd notice that you have these\nlittle like handles that you can use\n\n662\n00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:26.240\nto manipulate not just the point,\nbut how they curve.\n\n663\n00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.460\nAnd there's a whole science and\n\n664\n00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:33.330\nunderstanding of how the handles go in and\nout and how you can change them.\n\n665\n00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.052\nAnd how it kind of flows\neverything around.\n\n666\n00:32:36.052 --> 00:32:39.806\nI wanna do a whole extra episode on that.\n\n667\n00:32:39.806 --> 00:32:44.230\nMaybe in my prime, my word tips and tricks\nshow that I have planned in my head.\n\n668\n00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.730\nI just have whole a list of just little\nthings that I wanna show you all.\n\n669\n00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.038\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So just be on the look out for that,\n\n670\n00:32:50.038 --> 00:32:53.420\nlike, it's not in the library,\nI'll get to it I promise.\n\n671\n00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.780\n[LAUGH] But just play around with it\neven if you don't understand the whole,\n\n672\n00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.050\nwhy is this moving,\n\n673\n00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:03.840\njust keep tweaking it and hopefully\nyou could go ahead and edit the shape.\n\n674\n00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.992\nSo there are points,\n\n675\n00:33:04.992 --> 00:33:08.770\nthere are handles on some of those\npoints that changes the curve of it.\n\n676\n00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:12.309\nAt least you could go ahead and\nget in, get really in to that shape and\n\n677\n00:33:12.309 --> 00:33:13.560\nbe able to manipulate.\n\n678\n00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.530\nSo shapes, a lot of fun,\n\n679\n00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.330\na lot of cool things that are already\nin there and then how to format it, and\n\n680\n00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.640\nyou can go and make all the rainbow\ngradients to your heart's content.\n\n681\n00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.280\nAnd so I believe that's all I have\nin this episode, so we are done.\n\n682\n00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, so yeah, I don't know if\nwe did any justice to Sesame Street and\n\n683\n00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.990\nI think Neil deGrasse Tyson is crying over\nthere right now, but that's about it for\n\n684\n00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.150\nthis particular episode.\n\n685\n00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.100\nVonne, thank you so much for\nbeing with us today and thank you for\n\n686\n00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.170\njoining us as well.\n\n687\n00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.290\nBut for this show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n688\n00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.730\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n689\n00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:44.500\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n690\n00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.449\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n691\n00:33:46.449 --> 00:33:46.949\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It's going great.\n\n9\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.065\nI'm feeling very in tune and\naligned right now.\n\n10\n00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n\n11\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.810\n&gt;&gt; Not really, but\nwe're gonna get there [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n13\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like you said we're going\nto be aligning and grouping and\n\n14\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.850\narranging all of our shapes.\n\n15\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.570\nThis is really the episode [INAUDIBLE]\nwork with multiple shapes.\n\n16\n00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.350\nIn our previous episode, we just had\na single shape but we had multiples but\n\n17\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.560\nwe were only really using one at a time.\n\n18\n00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.151\n&gt;&gt; And not dealing with them as like\na cumulative array or something like that.\n\n19\n00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:02.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nyes I love how you went to array [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.910\n&gt;&gt; I think that's more of\nthe computer nerdy part.\n\n21\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I was just like yeah,\nthat's exactly what it is [LAUGH].\n\n22\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.625\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n23\n00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:13.253\nwe're gonna work with multiple shapes and\nthen just how to send them to the front,\n\n24\n00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:14.304\nbring them to the back or\n\n25\n00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:17.640\nI think that's the bring them to\nthe front, send them to the back.\n\n26\n00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.470\nAnd we're also going to talk about\nthe Selection pane, which is one of my\n\n27\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.790\nfavorite things in working with elements\nand objects within our Office products.\n\n28\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.030\nAt first I was like I don't know,\nMac has it.\n\n29\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.590\nBecause I thought it was maybe just\na Windows only thing, but it's in here.\n\n30\n00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.100\nAnd hopefully once I show you it,\nyou'll be as excited about it as I am.\n\n31\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.175\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Yay.\n\n38\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.240\n&gt;&gt; Yay, exactly.\n\n39\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.458\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, we're gonna get some\ncomments in the chat from this, or\n\n40\n00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:08.622\nin the forum at least.\n\n41\n00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:10.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I'm sure, it'll be like.\n\n42\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.895\n&gt;&gt; What's wrong with you girls?\n\n43\n00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is supposed to be for\noffice use, well, you know what?\n\n44\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.240\nWe like to have fun here.\n\n45\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.564\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So keep it light and\n\n46\n00:02:17.564 --> 00:02:20.190\nyes, we're-\n&gt;&gt; You might already be bogged\n\n47\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.055\ndown with enough office stuff, right?\n\n48\n00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:22.747\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n49\n00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:25.649\nI mean who doesnt wanna\nmake rainbow hearts?\n\n50\n00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:26.597\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:27.151\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n52\n00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:31.509\nif I wanted another heart here,\nI can of course do a copy/paste,\n\n53\n00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.060\njust like we do with any elements.\n\n54\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.850\nWe could go ahead and copy, and\nthen we can click off and we can paste,\n\n55\n00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.050\nand it makes another one, a duplicate.\n\n56\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.830\nMaybe I'll make this one a little bit\nsmaller and I'll keep my shift key there,\n\n57\n00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.080\nso it will keep\nthe proportions constrained.\n\n58\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.380\nTotally fine with doing copy and paste,\nbut I have a cute little method that\n\n59\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.890\nI like to duplicate and\nthat's where you have an item selected.\n\n60\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.490\nYou hold your Option key, and\n\n61\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.080\nthen you drag, and then you let go of\nyour mouse, and it makes a duplicate.\n\n62\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.210\nSo Alt+drag is a very common thing in\nreally all of your Mac OS in a sense.\n\n63\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.340\nNow I'm using it specifically here in\nWord, but if you're like Alt+drag a file,\n\n64\n00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.060\nthat's like copying a file from\none way into another and so\n\n65\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.910\non and so forth,\nin Microsoft It is usually control.\n\n66\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.540\nControl is how you go ahead and duplicate\nit and that is actually here yes if you\n\n67\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.200\nwant [LAUGH] She is like mind blowing\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n68\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can control drag and\nmake multiple objects in there so\n\n69\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.920\nbut in mac it is alt.\n\n70\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.730\nSo wonderful so I have got a couple, let\nus do a couple more and maybe a few more,\n\n71\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.200\nand we'll change some sizes.\n\n72\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.730\nWe'll make this one a little bit smaller,\nmaybe make this one a little bit smaller,\n\n73\n00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.402\neven, a little bit smaller even more?\n\n74\n00:03:51.402 --> 00:03:53.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Okay, yep, we're doing good.\n\n75\n00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.980\n[LAUGH] So I just got some varying\nsizes of my different hearts.\n\n76\n00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.814\nAnd why don't we go ahead and\n\n77\n00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:03.951\nthrow in some color in there to\nmake them really cute and pretty.\n\n78\n00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:09.790\nDo some greens and got to get some pink\nin there and maybe some purple right?\n\n79\n00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.850\nWe'll just get a few\nrainbow colors in there.\n\n80\n00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.010\nSo I've got multiple shapes.\n\n81\n00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.720\nNow I can move them individual or\nmaybe I decided I want them\n\n82\n00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.340\nall or maybe a few of them to\nhave a different color outline.\n\n83\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.140\nSo I like this heart and this one.\n\n84\n00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.090\nWell, instead of doing\neach one individually,\n\n85\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.640\nwhy not just select them both,\nand then apply that format.\n\n86\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.850\nSo to select multiple objects you hold\nyour shift key down, hold the shift and\n\n87\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.810\nthen single click.\n\n88\n00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.680\nYou always look for the boxes.\n\n89\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.538\nSometimes I just look for the handle,\neven though I'm not rotating it, it just\n\n90\n00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:49.475\nkind of an indication that these are the\nmultiple elements that I have selected.\n\n91\n00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:54.452\nAnd then I can change this to maybe\nhave an orange stroke and then, sorry,\n\n92\n00:04:54.452 --> 00:04:58.910\noutline, maybe make this a little thicker,\nso on and so forth.\n\n93\n00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.830\nGreat, so you can select multiple elements\nor objects by holding that Shift key and\n\n94\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.720\nthen doing whatever you want with them.\n\n95\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.700\nMoving them, formatting them,\nmaking them a different size, great.\n\n96\n00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.820\nNow stacking order and\nhow we arrange things.\n\n97\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.028\nThis does correlate into\nthe order in which you drew them,\n\n98\n00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:24.187\nadded them, or\nin this case duplicated them.\n\n99\n00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:29.570\nAnd I kind of mixed them all up and I\ndon't remember which one I changed first.\n\n100\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.330\nBut notice that this blue one,\nI know this was the first one that I had.\n\n101\n00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.580\nIf I take this pink part and\nI drag it over,\n\n102\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.730\nnotice that the pink heart\nis on top of the blue heart,\n\n103\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.260\nbecause blue is first then anything\nthat I add just kind of goes up.\n\n104\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.740\nI think of it as going up [LAUGH].\n\n105\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.830\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n106\n00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.670\n&gt;&gt; If I take this heart and move it here,\nnotice that this is in the middle of it.\n\n107\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.200\nIt not necessarily means that it's\ngoing to be blue, yellow, pink,\n\n108\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.430\nbecause this green one, actually this\ngreen one goes on top of all of them.\n\n109\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.520\nAnd this purple, looks like it goes\nbetween the green and the pink.\n\n110\n00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.275\nEverybody has a different order\nin which they were made and\n\n111\n00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:18.780\nthis is where you can start changing them.\n\n112\n00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.204\nBut bring to the front or\nsend to the back, or\n\n113\n00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:27.020\nbring forward and send backward.\n\n114\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.780\nThe backward and\n\n115\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.460\nforward would be all the way to the top or\nall the way to the bottom.\n\n116\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.069\nThe bring to front or\nsend to back would just be one step.\n\n117\n00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.966\nWith this purple one, I know that that\nneeds to be all the way in front of\n\n118\n00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:46.065\neverybody, so I am going to come up\nhere Here to my shape format tab.\n\n119\n00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:49.821\nOn my ribbon,\nI'll go over into the arranged group and\n\n120\n00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:55.226\nfind the bring forward, but notice I\nhave the bring to front, bring forward.\n\n121\n00:06:55.226 --> 00:06:59.105\nSo you can see the different ones and\nactually I believe bring to front,\n\n122\n00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:01.195\nI think I said that backwards.\n\n123\n00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:06.100\nI believe I said bring I think the way I\njust described it, was a little reversed.\n\n124\n00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.950\nJust if it doesn't go all the way\nto front, choose the other one.\n\n125\n00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.830\nBut I know that bring to front,\nmeans to bring all the way to the front.\n\n126\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.112\nI think I said forward before.\n\n127\n00:07:13.112 --> 00:07:14.068\nYou get the idea.\n\n128\n00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:19.530\n[LAUGH] But doing all this with multiple\nelements, sometimes I really don't know\n\n129\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:25.760\nwhere they sit in this whole stacking\norder that I keep mentioning.\n\n130\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.700\nWe have a Selection pane, I love this.\n\n131\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.840\nIf you turn on the selection pane it\njust brings over a pane to the right\n\n132\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:41.290\nthat assist you in selecting objects and\nalso change in the stocking order.\n\n133\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.250\nNeat, love it.\n\n134\n00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.030\nNow, notice it has one,\ntwo, three, four, five.\n\n135\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.224\nThat's just because well they're just\none heart and then I duplicated it.\n\n136\n00:07:48.224 --> 00:07:53.830\nIf I let's say added a star, and I'm\ncoming over here onto the Shapes Format.\n\n137\n00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.871\nI can add more shapes right over here\nfrom the Left, If I take my star tool and\n\n138\n00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:03.034\ndraw a star notice now that's\ngoing to be 5-point star six,\n\n139\n00:08:03.034 --> 00:08:06.430\nlike it's the sixth element that you drew.\n\n140\n00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.660\nIf I Alt+drag and\nthen make another really,\n\n141\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.530\nreally big star then that's\ngoing to notice that it's seven.\n\n142\n00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.760\nBut it's all the way at the top.\n\n143\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.250\nSee it's all the way in the front.\n\n144\n00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:24.570\nSo if I wanted that to go all the way\nbehind everybody, could use the buttons.\n\n145\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.950\nJust use the selection pane.\n\n146\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.580\nI can take this here, and\nnow it just becomes dragging and\n\n147\n00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.430\ndropping, like layers.\n\n148\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.915\nI click, hold, and drag, and\nnotice that line comes up and\n\n149\n00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:39.940\nwherever I want that to be in\nthe order and let go, there you go.\n\n150\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.020\nSo that's really the same\nas send to back or\n\n151\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:48.180\nI could send forward or\nsend to one layer at a time.\n\n152\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.621\nSo this just makes it to me\nmuch easier to kind of see all\n\n153\n00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:57.180\nthe elements in this stacking order and\ngo from there.\n\n154\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.320\nPrint in and notice if I click\non each one, it selects them.\n\n155\n00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.404\n&gt;&gt; Ye hey, you can tell.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n156\n00:09:01.404 --> 00:09:04.333\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering that when it first came\nup, well they're all labelled the same,\n\n157\n00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:05.080\nbut how do you tell?\n\n158\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.463\nWell, there you go.\n\n159\n00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:10.291\n&gt;&gt; The other thing that's nice to do\nis this eyeball that's over here,\n\n160\n00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:13.459\nI use this a lot in a lot of my\ngraphic editing programs is,\n\n161\n00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:15.760\nI don't know which one's which.\n\n162\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.112\nI just poked the eyeball out,\nmeaning I turn it off.\n\n163\n00:09:19.112 --> 00:09:19.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's that one.\n\n164\n00:09:19.612 --> 00:09:20.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n165\n00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:22.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz you really are like taking\n\n166\n00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:24.493\nyour finger and poking the eye out.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:09:24.493 --> 00:09:25.793\n&gt;&gt; So you take [LAUGH] that, and then\n\n168\n00:09:25.793 --> 00:09:31.296\nyou can turn it on and off, and just kind\nof identify, okay, I see what that one is.\n\n169\n00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:32.487\nThat's that one.\n\n170\n00:09:32.487 --> 00:09:35.770\nThe other thing you can do from here,\nis you can rename them.\n\n171\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.420\nIf you double click on this,\nthen I can name this, this is a.\n\n172\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.593\n&gt;&gt; Blue heart, there you go.\n\n173\n00:09:43.593 --> 00:09:48.690\n&gt;&gt; And now I'm giving it my own\nname there so I can start labeling.\n\n174\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.610\nI'm not gonna go through and\nlabel each one of them,\n\n175\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.370\nbut you can see how you can do this.\n\n176\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.600\nI can instead of doing this five\npoint star, I can say big star.\n\n177\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.230\nAnd now makes a little\nbit more sense to me.\n\n178\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.890\nAnd if I don't really wanna see it\nright now, just turn the eyeball.\n\n179\n00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:05.901\nI didn't delete it.\n\n180\n00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:09.855\nThat's the other nice thing, is I'm not\nreally ready to work with a big star right\n\n181\n00:10:09.855 --> 00:10:12.420\nnow, so I'll just hide it for\na little bit.\n\n182\n00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.258\nMaybe I don't wanna work with\nthis star right now either, but\n\n183\n00:10:15.258 --> 00:10:16.633\nI don't want to get rid of it.\n\n184\n00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:19.290\nEyeball off, change the visibility.\n\n185\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.860\nNotice you also have the Show All and\n\n186\n00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.830\nHide All buttons that you could use\nto go ahead and change the elements.\n\n187\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.760\nSo now this is going to be for\nselecting your elements,\n\n188\n00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.620\nnot necessarily your paragraphs and\nthings.\n\n189\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:38.600\nBecause it doesn't really see that, so it\nis specifically with working with shapes,\n\n190\n00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.920\nand images, and so on and so forth.\n\n191\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.790\nSo I really,\nreally like the selection pane.\n\n192\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.290\nLet's go ahead and\nkind of stack these the way we want.\n\n193\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.240\nI wanna get this heart here and\nthis heart here.\n\n194\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.738\nThat one needs to go in front.\n\n195\n00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:56.600\nSo I'm gonna come over here to selection\npane, drag it out, move this purple one.\n\n196\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.471\nRight, you see where we are going.\n\n197\n00:10:57.471 --> 00:11:01.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about alignment now.\n\n198\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.952\nI would like to align\nthese three elements and\n\n199\n00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:08.993\nI'm purposely moving them around so\nwe can kinda use this.\n\n200\n00:11:08.993 --> 00:11:11.520\nNow I want them to be right\non top of each other.\n\n201\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.702\nSo I really want them to be\naligned this way and this way.\n\n202\n00:11:14.702 --> 00:11:15.441\n&gt;&gt; Centered, it's nice.\n\n203\n00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:16.870\n&gt;&gt; What I would call center, center.\n\n204\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.830\nSo you have your horizontal and\nyour vertical axis.\n\n205\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.330\nTo align multiple elements,\nyou have to select all the elements first.\n\n206\n00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.520\nSo using your Shift key to go ahead and\nclick on each one of those.\n\n207\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.006\nComing back up here to\nthe shape format tab and\n\n208\n00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:35.783\nin the arranged group you\nhave the align button.\n\n209\n00:11:35.783 --> 00:11:41.530\nAnd notice you just kind of watch those\nicons here of aligning the horizontals or\n\n210\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.720\nreally like up and downs.\n\n211\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.190\nThe verticals which are across\nwhich is kind of strange,\n\n212\n00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.720\ncuz I'm thinking this would be\nhorizontal and that would be vertical.\n\n213\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got a little mixed up on\nthat last show we were talking about.\n\n214\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.840\nI'm like a vertical flip, but no.\n\n215\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's where you just look at the buttons.\n\n216\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.144\n[LAUGH] Look at the icons, cuz this\none here on the Align Left would be\n\n217\n00:12:01.144 --> 00:12:06.100\nalign all the left edges, and\nthey go ahead and align to the left.\n\n218\n00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.070\nI'm gonna command Z to Undo that,\noops, well.\n\n219\n00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.390\nNow, I gotta select them both\ntogether again, here we go.\n\n220\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.020\nComing back over to the aligns, and\nso you can see which ones you want.\n\n221\n00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.260\nDo you want to align the tops?\n\n222\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.980\nDo you want to align the lefts,\nthe centers?\n\n223\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.450\nSo you have to figure out what\nposition you want them to be.\n\n224\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.790\nThe other one must kind of cool.\n\n225\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:32.466\nAnd let me move this off for a couple\nof times, cuz I use this command a lot.\n\n226\n00:12:32.466 --> 00:12:38.540\nSorry my computer is lagging\njust slightly is the distribute.\n\n227\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.350\nI want to distribute the white\nspace between them so\n\n228\n00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.570\ndistributing them equally vertically or\nhorizontally.\n\n229\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.720\nThat's a very nice command right there,\nnow it was close enough.\n\n230\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.570\nAnd then if I come back up to here and\nalign the tops,\n\n231\n00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:58.320\nyou can see how you can just pick\nthese different alignment options.\n\n232\n00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.210\nOr distribution options to be able to\ncreate exactly what you want there and\n\n233\n00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.770\nhow you want them aligned.\n\n234\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.712\n&gt;&gt; So much easier then the way\nthat I would do things and\n\n235\n00:13:07.712 --> 00:13:10.605\n[COUGH] I'll tell you but\nit is embarrassing.\n\n236\n00:13:10.605 --> 00:13:13.225\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would literally make a box either\n\n237\n00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:17.226\nthe full length of the page or\nthe full length of the object and\n\n238\n00:13:17.226 --> 00:13:20.931\nsee where those little dots lined and\nthen draw a ruler.\n\n239\n00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:23.220\nPut a line there and then line things up.\n\n240\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.170\nBut that is like a ridiculous amount of\nwork compared to what you just showed.\n\n241\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know what you're talking about\nbecause I tend to go that way sometimes\n\n242\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.986\ntoo [LAUGH].\n\n243\n00:13:30.986 --> 00:13:33.149\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes, just using these buttons,\n\n244\n00:13:33.149 --> 00:13:34.940\nit does make it a lot easier.\n\n245\n00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.990\nAnd the other thing to notice is,\n\n246\n00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:42.720\nbehind my head you see that they're\naligning to the selected objects\n\n247\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:48.560\nwhich is different than aligning to\nthe page or aligning to the margin.\n\n248\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.230\nSo if i chose Align to Margin,\nnow nothing changes right now,\n\n249\n00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:57.820\nit's when I come back and say align the\ntops, it's gonna the top of the margin.\n\n250\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.109\nBefore we were just aligning the objects\nin relationship to each other,\n\n251\n00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:05.708\nbut changing where they go to\nwhich is kind of a neat feature.\n\n252\n00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:06.258\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:14:06.258 --> 00:14:10.044\n&gt;&gt; This gets a little bit more into things\nI would see normally in Photoshop or\n\n254\n00:14:10.044 --> 00:14:11.545\nIllustrator and InDesign.\n\n255\n00:14:11.545 --> 00:14:15.573\n&gt;&gt; Well, you still have those margins and\nwhat are they called, borders or\n\n256\n00:14:15.573 --> 00:14:16.771\nrulers here in Word?\n\n257\n00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:17.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n258\n00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so they still exist, so hey.\n\n259\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.438\n&gt;&gt; They totally do, and\nthat way if I have my margins, but\n\n260\n00:14:23.438 --> 00:14:29.464\nif I wanted to go to the page, that goes\nall the way up to the top of the page.\n\n261\n00:14:29.464 --> 00:14:31.910\nNow, will it print to\nthe edge of your page?\n\n262\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.570\nNot on your regular desktop printers.\n\n263\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.863\nBut at least you can see that if you're\nmaking something that needed to go all\n\n264\n00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:40.258\nthe way to the borders of the shape,\nbecause you're not necessarily printing\n\n265\n00:14:40.258 --> 00:14:42.697\nit, you're distributing it\nelectronically in a PDF.\n\n266\n00:14:42.697 --> 00:14:43.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n267\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.430\n&gt;&gt; And you want to have the shape\ngo all the way to the edge.\n\n268\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.380\nI can see why, you might want to\nhave those different elements.\n\n269\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.990\nSo, the aligns and the options you\nhave of where they are aligning to and\n\n270\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.862\nhow they distribute right here\nwithin this menu is pretty neat.\n\n271\n00:14:58.862 --> 00:15:03.094\nI'm gonna go back to align selected\nobjects because what I really want is,\n\n272\n00:15:03.094 --> 00:15:07.740\nI want to align the centers this way, and\nthen I want to align the centers this way.\n\n273\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.139\nThere we go, so\nnow we start getting our heart [LAUGH].\n\n274\n00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:12.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And really what I wanna do is,\n\n275\n00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:14.240\nI wanna grab all of these guys.\n\n276\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.112\nSo, I need to Shift+click and\nselect all of them.\n\n277\n00:15:18.112 --> 00:15:20.240\nI could've been doing this through\nthe selection pane by the way,\n\n278\n00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.210\nI could of just select the first one,\nhold my Shift key and\n\n279\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.670\nselect the top one in a range selection.\n\n280\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.471\nSo you could use as selection\npanel which is pretty cool.\n\n281\n00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:34.604\n&gt;&gt; Now sometimes, Vonne, when I've worked\nwith programs like Word and similar,\n\n282\n00:15:34.604 --> 00:15:38.278\nwhen you have mouse selected like this\nif you have them nice and pretty.\n\n283\n00:15:38.278 --> 00:15:41.442\nThe way you want them and\nyou go ahead, and group them together.\n\n284\n00:15:41.442 --> 00:15:43.772\nYou can do that, but\nif we group them together,\n\n285\n00:15:43.772 --> 00:15:47.780\ncan we still use a function like this or\ndoes it kind of take away from that?\n\n286\n00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.899\n&gt;&gt; You're taking us right\ndown the perfect path.\n\n287\n00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:52.136\n[LAUGH] Perfect lead in too.\n\n288\n00:15:52.136 --> 00:15:53.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly where we're going.\n\n289\n00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:57.156\nYes, you can and to your question.\n\n290\n00:15:57.156 --> 00:16:02.060\nYes, when you group it you'll think,\nI could only act or you know manipulate.\n\n291\n00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Manipulate as a whole.\n\n292\n00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.210\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n293\n00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:09.710\nYou can manipulate individual pieces\nof the group without having to ungroup\n\n294\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.000\nit first, do what you need to do, slice\nit all again and group back together.\n\n295\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nthat is exactly this one is, right.\n\n296\n00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.634\n&gt;&gt; And keeping the selection pane open,\n\n297\n00:16:17.634 --> 00:16:21.191\nthey'll be able to see\nthe grouping a lot easier.\n\n298\n00:16:21.191 --> 00:16:22.862\nSo let us go, let us go on that path.\n\n299\n00:16:22.862 --> 00:16:25.060\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n300\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.850\n&gt;&gt; Let us take our hearts and let us get\nthem all aligned nice and pretty and\n\n301\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.650\nlet us line center, center.\n\n302\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.030\nThose is that the middle?\n\n303\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.270\nOkay, the middle, there,\nthat's what I wanted.\n\n304\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.200\nI think I aligned the tops.\n\n305\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.960\nSo now I'm starting to get my Lisa Frank\n\n306\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.940\nhearts\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.658\n&gt;&gt; Nothing to them.\n\n308\n00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:45.710\nSo I've go them all aligned and\nI had used my shift key when making all\n\n309\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.050\nof these shapes so that's why it\nlooks pretty cool in my mind [LAUGH].\n\n310\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.180\nI would like this to now\nbe one whole element.\n\n311\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.630\nCuz I want to move it around.\n\n312\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.300\nI want to put it places.\n\n313\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.609\nAnd once it's in a group I can do\nthe word wraps and all that kinda stuff.\n\n314\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.240\nI'm gonna come back over here and\nuse that Shift+Click of that range and\n\n315\n00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.670\nselect all of these different hearts.\n\n316\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.360\nAnd now to group them,\nyou can right-click.\n\n317\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.840\nA lot of the things that I'm doing up\non the ribbon, like the arranging and\n\n318\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.400\nthe group option,\nyou can right-click on it.\n\n319\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.572\nOr going up to that group up here,\nand the shape format, and\n\n320\n00:17:21.572 --> 00:17:26.080\nthen we go to arrange, and\nthen we go to group right here.\n\n321\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.700\nSo, select it, we group it.\n\n322\n00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.590\nAnd now you see the bounding\nbox goes around the whole thing\n\n323\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.170\nand in the selection pane,\nit just says group 8.\n\n324\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.430\nAnd notice, there's like a triangle\nnow here like expanding clamps because\n\n325\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.630\nthese five elements\nare part of this group.\n\n326\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.770\n&gt;&gt; And I still recognize them as\nindividual entities, so that's cool.\n\n327\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you don't fuse together.\n\n328\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.210\nThere's still pieces,\njust acting as one group.\n\n329\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.780\nSo now if Alt+Drag this guy,\n\n330\n00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.562\nI can make multiple hearts and\ngroups, and that's really cute.\n\n331\n00:18:03.562 --> 00:18:05.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n332\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.340\nBut maybe on this particular one,\n\n333\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:14.850\nI want to change that middle heart\ninto like a different shade of purple.\n\n334\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:15.850\nHow do I get into it?\n\n335\n00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:20.030\nNow I don't know if you can see it,\nit might be hard to see on the screen,\n\n336\n00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.764\nbut do you see how it's,\nthere's like these kind of grayish lines.\n\n337\n00:18:23.764 --> 00:18:25.150\n&gt;&gt; They're very fine.\n\n338\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they're tiny.\n\n339\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.150\nWhat that's indicating is I had the group\nselected, but then if I find something\n\n340\n00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.070\nthat has like that really faint\ngray outline and I single click.\n\n341\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.940\nI'm actually selecting the individual\ncomponent of that group.\n\n342\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.270\nSo it's like click once on the group.\n\n343\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.170\nSingle click once on\nthe element of the group.\n\n344\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:52.450\nAnd now notice, if I change this to light\ngreen, I've changed that once piece.\n\n345\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.980\nIf I had single-clicked on\nthe whole group, whoops.\n\n346\n00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.630\nThere, there's the whole group.\n\n347\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:02.840\nAnd then I come over into the shape color,\nnotice that it changes all of them.\n\n348\n00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.780\nNow those are the outlines, by the way.\n\n349\n00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.720\nLike an actual stroke color that we\nhad added to each one of them, so\n\n350\n00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.480\nthat's why you're seeing those.\n\n351\n00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.570\nSo I didn't want all of\nthem to be modified.\n\n352\n00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.390\nI just wanted one piece so\nthat's that click,\n\n353\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.930\nclick to get into changing\nyour shape color.\n\n354\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.210\nSo that's kind of nice or\nusing their selection pane over here.\n\n355\n00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.030\nIf I wanted to get to that particular\nheart, I don't even know which one it\n\n356\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.700\nis [LAUGH], but I clicked it here,\nand selected that particular heart.\n\n357\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.810\nBecause we have it all just like heart 19,\n20, and\n\n358\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.880\n15, it might be a little difficult or\nmore difficult to see, but\n\n359\n00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.570\nyou can see like where the bounding boxes\ngo, so I don't need to ungroup them.\n\n360\n00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:53.850\nAnd that kind of fun and pretty and\nwe have all of our alignments and\n\n361\n00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.890\nI think those are some\nbeautiful rainbow hearts.\n\n362\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.520\nThey are gorgeous.\n\n363\n00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.750\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; You might be moving out to Arizona now.\n\n364\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.660\n&gt;&gt; Right. Ooh.

00:00:18.490\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n4\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.721\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look at\nSmartArt instead of unintelligent art.\n\n5\n00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:29.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think, what's PC here?\n\n6\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n7\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.350\n&gt;&gt; And of course you know,\nVonne, smartest one of them all,\n\n8\n00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.390\nis here to explain what smart,\nif I can even say it, SmartArt is.\n\n9\n00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.070\nHow we can use it, create it,\nand manipulate it and everything.\n\n10\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.488\n&gt;&gt; Exactly [LAUGH] I was\nsitting here just like\n\n11\n00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:51.810\n&gt;&gt; You're watching just like an explosion,\n\n12\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.704\na dumpster fire over here and you're yeah,\n&gt;&gt; But you're right,\n\n13\n00:00:56.704 --> 00:01:03.541\ni mean this is really cool that we have\nart that's smart as opposed to not smart.\n\n14\n00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:08.160\n[LAUGH] Yes, unintelligent art\nis not what we want to do.\n\n15\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.548\nAnd the cool thing about\nthe SmartArt graphics.\n\n16\n00:01:10.548 --> 00:01:14.740\nIs that it kinda takes out us\nhaving to think about how to\n\n17\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.948\nmake a graphical representation\nof our information.\n\n18\n00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:23.428\nAnd it gives us a whole gallery of,\nthat looks good and perfect,\n\n19\n00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:27.040\nbecause sometimes,\nyou have a list of information.\n\n20\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.520\nIf I have just cats, dogs and\n\n21\n00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.700\nhorses and I have that in a bulleted list,\ncuz, that's really what it is.\n\n22\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.889\nI'm trying to say that these are the\nanimals that we have on the farm that I'm\n\n23\n00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.596\ncreating up in my head, okay.\n\n24\n00:01:39.596 --> 00:01:44.500\nWell, I mean it's just\na list of information.\n\n25\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.564\nWouldn't it be cooler if you had a little\nbit more pizzazz, a little bit more flare.\n\n26\n00:01:48.564 --> 00:01:53.759\nAnd had those in some nice colored\nsquares and it still represents that\n\n27\n00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.880\nwe have three categories of animals,\nit's just not in boring text.\n\n28\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.120\nIt's in a graphical representation.\n\n29\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.590\n&gt;&gt; So I have to tell you, I actually had\nsomeone look at my resume one time and\n\n30\n00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.550\nshe kind of helped me beef it up a bit.\n\n31\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.930\nAnd the main thing that they wanted\nto do was to condense it to one\n\n32\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.630\npage like most people don't\nlike to read nowadays.\n\n33\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.520\nSo hey I only want to look at one page.\n\n34\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.700\nBut they incorporated exactly what\nyou were talking about, Vonn.\n\n35\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.440\nA lot of different logos that\nrepresented like operating systems and\n\n36\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.910\nthings that I knew.\n\n37\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.690\nAnd they just put them in graphics and\n\n38\n00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.310\nmade like a bar across\nwhere my information was.\n\n39\n00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.530\nAnd it was part of the aesthetic appeal\nto it and I thought It was colorful,\n\n40\n00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.350\nit was different.\n\n41\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.500\nI'm like, I love it.\n\n42\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit still conveys the whole information\n\n43\n00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.690\nthat you're trying to get across.\n\n44\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.190\nAnd so that's what throw\nit into SmartArt graphic.\n\n45\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.130\nAnd the nice thing is they have\na lot of pre-made libraries in this\n\n46\n00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.710\ngallery for you.\n\n47\n00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.870\nAnd you can just go ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.600\nchoose what type of SmartArt you want,\nput in the information.\n\n49\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.770\nAnd honestly just keeping\na lot of the defaults\n\n50\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.240\nI think it's the easiest way to go.\n\n51\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.950\nSo why don't we jump down in and show\nyou some examples of well, exactly that?\n\n52\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.815\n&gt;&gt; Cats, Dogs, and Horses.\n\n53\n00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.750\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, those are our animals.\n\n54\n00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.940\nAnd so\nhere instead of just using a bolded list,\n\n55\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.370\nthis just makes it a little cuter,\na little prettier, just different, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.140\nSo now we're going to go, or I was saying\nright before this show, okay, so Cherokee,\n\n57\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.250\nwe're gonna go kind of backwards.\n\n58\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.740\nIn the sense of I'm gonna show\nyou a finished versions of it.\n\n59\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.640\nI'm gonna show you how you can\nmanipulate it and everything and\n\n60\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.840\nthen I'll show you how to actually add it.\n\n61\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.670\nSo, because there are a few like,\njust very slight things to know about\n\n62\n00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.720\nworking in a SmartArt graphic\nthat can throw people off.\n\n63\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.480\nThey're pretty easy once you identify it.\n\n64\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.590\nBut I just know from teaching this\na lot of times, it's like, gosh,\n\n65\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.670\nwhy is it all changing?\n\n66\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.350\nYou've just got to be careful\nabout where you're clicking, so\n\n67\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.260\nthat's the biggest one.\n\n68\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.430\nSo this is just a representation\nof categories, we can say there.\n\n69\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.920\nAnd here, here's another one, okay,\nwhat type of cats do we have on this farm?\n\n70\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.389\nWe have Pumpkin and Pooma,\nwe call them the gen one cats instead of\n\n71\n00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.130\nthe gen two cats if you're\nfollowing along with and Bishop.\n\n72\n00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.950\nThat's the second round.\n\n73\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.290\nThe first round was Pumpkin and\n\n74\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.570\nPooma, those were the original ones\nthat we always had pictures of.\n\n75\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.290\nSo and then dogs growing up I\nhad Albert and Woofie okay.\n\n76\n00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.470\nHis name was Woofie.\n\n77\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.500\nAnd then horses on our farm,\nwe had Arthur and Burlington.\n\n78\n00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.382\nBurlington was my horse.\n\n79\n00:04:24.382 --> 00:04:28.860\nSo we've got that here in\na nice kind of different\n\n80\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.330\ngraphical representation of just arrows,\nlike a multilevel list.\n\n81\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.190\nSo they have different\ntypes of graphics there.\n\n82\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.210\nScroll down, let's look at this.\n\n83\n00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.310\nI got really creative on this one right?\n\n84\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.930\nOne, two, three, this would be like steps.\n\n85\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.620\nLike we're going to do step one first,\nand then we move onto step two.\n\n86\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.840\nSo this would be more of\na process type of graphic.\n\n87\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.990\nSame here and notice I have\na different kind of look on this,\n\n88\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.640\nit's got like some 3D.\n\n89\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.410\nIt looks like it's kind of leaning down.\n\n90\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.340\nLike the cycles of a cat,\nlike to sleep and eat and\n\n91\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.310\nplay then meow,\nthen do it all over again, right?\n\n92\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.190\nSo this is the cycle that we can use that.\n\n93\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.730\nAlso I'm showing some things like notice\nhere how we have like a border around\n\n94\n00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:22.160\nthe whole thing versus\na border around the shapes.\n\n95\n00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.380\nLet's go around a little bit more.\n\n96\n00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.430\nHere I went ahead and\nthrew in our hierarchy right?\n\n97\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.510\nThis is an org chart, things that you\nneed to represent hey our structure\n\n98\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.510\nof our company here and\nlike Who is our fearless leader?\n\n99\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.910\nThat would be Tim.\n\n100\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.160\nWell, Renee is Tim's assistant.\n\n101\n00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.720\nAnd then we have that we're\nkind of under Angie/Dawn,\n\n102\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.960\nbut Angie really dictates our schedule.\n\n103\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.430\nAnd then Brad, which we have our fantastic\ndirectors, Meagan and Tanisha, right?\n\n104\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.260\nMeagan with us right now.\n\n105\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.800\nSo we've got that.\n\n106\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.490\nGive you a little shout out.\n\n107\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.150\nAnd just some different things\nthat we have here to just give\n\n108\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.450\nyou a little kind of nice\ngraphical piece of information.\n\n109\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.660\nI like them, I think they're really cool.\n\n110\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.308\nNow I have on this page just like how\nwe're going to incorporate within a text\n\n111\n00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:11.882\ndocument.\n\n112\n00:06:11.882 --> 00:06:14.370\nSo we'll come back around to\nthat in just a little bit.\n\n113\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.050\nSo let's go back up into here.\n\n114\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.620\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm just curious,\n\n115\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.540\nhave those flowchart looking components\nbeen in Microsoft Word for a while,\n\n116\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.372\nbecause I almost feel like,\nwhere's this been all my life?\n\n117\n00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:31.309\nI graduated to Microsoft Visio at one\npoint in my career because I had to\n\n118\n00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:36.347\ndo network documentation, but\ngoodness, if I would have known this.\n\n119\n00:06:36.347 --> 00:06:38.560\nOr did it exist back then, do you think?\n\n120\n00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.780\n&gt;&gt; It did, they just made it fancier.\n\n121\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.920\nSo inserting an org chart, they called it\nan organizational chart or a hierarchy.\n\n122\n00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.540\nI think it was insert object,\nthis is back awhile before they had Smart.\n\n123\n00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.610\nSmart has been around,\nI wanna say since 2007.\n\n124\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.280\nMaybe, maybe, but\ndon't quote me on that one.\n\n125\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.540\nBut it has been there for quite some time,\nso, and I'll show you how to do it.\n\n126\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.760\nSo coming back down into here,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n127\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.740\nselect this because a SmartArt\ngraphic works as one whole graphic.\n\n128\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.210\nNow if I click on, let's say, cats.\n\n129\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.360\nNow there's a couple things that\npop up here that you need to\n\n130\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.760\ntake notice of and let's go here that.\n\n131\n00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.770\nNotice there's a box around\nthe whole element but\n\n132\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:35.228\nwhen I had my mouse cursor over cats\nnotice I have the dots on that one shape.\n\n133\n00:07:35.228 --> 00:07:40.660\nBecause a SmartArt graphic is\nreally just a collection of shapes\n\n134\n00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.610\nall together in one piece that\nwe can go ahead and manipulate.\n\n135\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.730\nSo just be careful about\nwhere you're selecting.\n\n136\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.300\nLet me just go ahead and\nshow you the other parts.\n\n137\n00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.644\nThis thing came up,\nwhich might not come up by default,\n\n138\n00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:58.569\nthis is the text pane,\nbecause this really is just a bolded list.\n\n139\n00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:00.122\nYou can see it and its.\n\n140\n00:08:00.122 --> 00:08:05.880\nText form and then the graphic\nrepresentation over here in the SmartArt.\n\n141\n00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.430\nThere's this little triangle thing to the\nleft-hand side, and if I click on that,\n\n142\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:15.900\nthat's just where it collapses or\nexpands that text pane.\n\n143\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.410\nAnother thing to point out.\n\n144\n00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.940\nUp here, because it's a different element,\nwe've got our contextual tabs and\n\n145\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.310\nwe have our SmartArt Design tab and\nwe have our Format tab,\n\n146\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.720\nwhich we will go through and\nlook at some of the different things.\n\n147\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.120\nBut notice over here,\n\n148\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.780\non the SmartArt Design tab,\nthe text pane over on the left?\n\n149\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:39.130\nYou can use that button or command on the\nribbon to go ahead and bring this guy up.\n\n150\n00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.430\nSo that's where we are just\ngoing to able to add it as text.\n\n151\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:48.090\nNow back into what we're selecting and\nhow we can start moving and\n\n152\n00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:53.490\ngetting the right piece selected to\naffect the right thing that we want.\n\n153\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:58.380\nIf I wanted to move the whole thing,\nthe whole graphic,\n\n154\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.950\nyou've gotta come out to the border.\n\n155\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.550\nThe very outside, like right here.\n\n156\n00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.720\nAnd if I click right there,\nnotice how it deselected cats.\n\n157\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.370\nNow I have the whole thing selected.\n\n158\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.710\n&gt;&gt; I could see where\nthat could be an issue.\n\n159\n00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n160\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.789\nI said it's very easy, but\nyou just have to be very aware of it.\n\n161\n00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Precise.\n\n162\n00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:26.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes and you have to know that is not\nthe same as selecting right on the edge.\n\n163\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.240\nThat is the whole piece.\n\n164\n00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.856\nBecause if I take, and with the whole\nthing selected grab the bottom corner,\n\n165\n00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:36.000\nyou can see how now I can go ahead and\nresize the entire graphic.\n\n166\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.480\nI could move this whole thing now.\n\n167\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.810\nMoving it works just like\nan image in the sense that\n\n168\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:49.600\nit does not free-flow around\nthe page like a shape.\n\n169\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.200\nSo if you're in some of our other episodes\nwe've talked about adding an image and\n\n170\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.990\nadding a shape and\nhow they kind of natively act\n\n171\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.480\nas this element that you can either move\naround or not move around like an image.\n\n172\n00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.710\nAnd so that's why I can't just\nlike free-formally move it around.\n\n173\n00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.470\n&gt;&gt; Do we have the option like you\nshowed us before, where it said hey,\n\n174\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.010\ntop left-hand corner or\nbottom right-hand corner of the page, or\n\n175\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.320\nsomething like that?\n\n176\n00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:15.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes we do.\n\n177\n00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.074\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n178\n00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:18.851\n&gt;&gt; Because it's a graphical element,\nright?\n\n179\n00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:21.900\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So just like an image or a shape,\n\n180\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.300\nI have the same thing over on that Format\ntab, over on the range where I have\n\n181\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.910\nthe word wrap and the position\nof where I want it in the page.\n\n182\n00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.080\nAnd notice that right now,\nit's in line with the text.\n\n183\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:40.120\nSo if I wanted this whole SmartArt\ngraphic to act like I can move it,\n\n184\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.720\nthen yeah, you could throw it into square.\n\n185\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.719\nAnd now I can grab this and\nI can kind of oops, see?\n\n186\n00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:47.350\nI grabbed the wrong piece.\n\n187\n00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.650\nGotta go right there.\n\n188\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.530\nAnd here, I'll come over to this edge.\n\n189\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.080\nSee now I can start moving it around.\n\n190\n00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.348\nNow everything on my page has that.\n\n191\n00:10:56.348 --> 00:10:57.830\nThey're all SmartArts.\n\n192\n00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.200\nBut let's go back down here to where\nit has it in relationship to text.\n\n193\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.880\nSo we'll come into here.\n\n194\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.690\nGotta make sure I'm on the whole thing.\n\n195\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.710\nDon't be on that one shape and\ndo the word wrap.\n\n196\n00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.490\nNot the right one.\n\n197\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.650\nThe whole SmartArt graphic.\n\n198\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.560\nNow, if I use this wrap with square,\nnow I can go ahead and\n\n199\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.110\nmove it around as a full\ngraphic element and so on and\n\n200\n00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.930\nso forth, cuz I got the whole piece of it.\n\n201\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:28.880\nSo good point, and I have all those\nsame options, the aligns, the send back.\n\n202\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.120\nBut kinda going on that same align,\nI'm just doing Cmd+Z to go back.\n\n203\n00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.510\nAnd I wanna turn on that Show and Hide\ncharacters to just let you know that right\n\n204\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.890\nhere, see this SmartArt graphic\nis in a paragraph right now.\n\n205\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.170\nAnd it's back on its default word wrap,\n\n206\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.538\nmeaning that it's just in line\nwith text just to show you.\n\n207\n00:11:49.538 --> 00:11:54.730\nSo I Cmd+Z back enough to where it's\nkind of into its default place.\n\n208\n00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:58.690\nCuz in this particular document,\n\n209\n00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.650\nI kind of like the way that\nit's In between the paragraph.\n\n210\n00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.736\nSo I wanna keep it that way.\n\n211\n00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:07.570\nSorry, I'm getting a little\ncrazy on the zooming.\n\n212\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.690\nI will get you back down.\n\n213\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.810\nSo this is another one\nthat trips people up.\n\n214\n00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.670\nAnd it kind of goes along with\npositioning, but it's really alignment\n\n215\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:22.440\nof the text versus the whole element\nin relationship to the paragraph.\n\n216\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.150\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n217\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.350\nI get a lot of people who say,\nI wanna center it.\n\n218\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.080\nSo they click on one of the elements and\nthey're like,\n\n219\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.260\nwell I know you told me to\nselect the whole thing.\n\n220\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.670\nSo they come over here,\nget the whole item selected.\n\n221\n00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.230\nThen they come over here to the Home\ntab and they're like, I wanna center.\n\n222\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.730\nCenter, it's not centering.\n\n223\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.510\nNotice if I go to the left center right,\nwhat is it doing?\n\n224\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.180\n&gt;&gt; Centering, or\nchanging the alignment of the text.\n\n225\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Inside of the shapes\nof all of the shapes.\n\n226\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.952\nSo it's not necessarily the alignment\nof the text and the shapes.\n\n227\n00:12:53.952 --> 00:12:58.155\nYou want the whole-\n&gt;&gt; In relation to the page.\n\n228\n00:12:58.155 --> 00:13:00.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes, or in this particular sense,\nthe paragraph.\n\n229\n00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.620\n&gt;&gt; The text, okay.\n\n230\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.655\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo if I click here,\n\n231\n00:13:02.655 --> 00:13:05.200\ncuz this is paragraph-level formatting,\nright?\n\n232\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.570\nIf I put my cursor in\nthe paragraph just to the right\n\n233\n00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:16.820\nof this element, you treat it just like\nthis would be a regular text thing.\n\n234\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.560\nYou click the center now, you see there?\n\n235\n00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.110\nHm.\n\n236\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.483\n&gt;&gt; Never would I have guessed.\n\n237\n00:13:21.483 --> 00:13:22.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n238\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.370\n&gt;&gt; I can see why.\n\n239\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.240\n&gt;&gt; Small, right?\n\n240\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.230\nVery small.\n\n241\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.530\nI want this whole paragraph,\nit's the same as if I did this.\n\n242\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.840\nI want this paragraph to be centered.\n\n243\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.230\nYou click on the paragraph and\nyou center it.\n\n244\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Same with this text.\n\n245\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.510\nI can select all the text,\nand center it, but\n\n246\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:43.290\nit's the paragraph that's formatted,\nnot the text within the shapes.\n\n247\n00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.980\nThat's where the difference is,\nand why people are like,\n\n248\n00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.690\nI'm clicking the center button and\nit doesn't work.\n\n249\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.540\nWell, it's the wrong element.\n\n250\n00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.160\nOkay.\n\n251\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.145\nBecause if I go here, and now also\nnotice I just have this one piece of\n\n252\n00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:58.375\nthe SmartArt and\nit's changing the format from there.\n\n253\n00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:03.965\nAnd notice if I change the font\ncolor here, just got that one, nope.\n\n254\n00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:09.325\nCome out here to the whole element\nchange all of the formats and\n\n255\n00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:12.410\nchanges in the sizes and\nso on and so forth.\n\n256\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.190\nBut I can't use the center button,\n\n257\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:19.306\nI've got to get into the paragraph to\nalign the element of the paragraph.\n\n258\n00:14:19.306 --> 00:14:21.198\nTiny, but important.\n\n259\n00:14:21.198 --> 00:14:24.015\n[LAUGH] And everybody wants to do this.\n\n260\n00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:24.920\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n261\n00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.540\nA few things about in this\ngraphic that we can do,\n\n262\n00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.450\nyou can resize individual pieces of it.\n\n263\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.570\nThat's a lot.\n\n264\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.080\nOkay, and so notice,\nI can make that if you wanted to.\n\n265\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.240\nAll right so, horses, dogs.\n\n266\n00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.830\nI can format every individual\npiece of a SmartArt graphic\n\n267\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.710\njust like I would a shape.\n\n268\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:52.670\nAnd coming back up here into the Format\ntab, you can go into the shape color,\n\n269\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.860\nthe shape outline,\nthe effect of just that one piece.\n\n270\n00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.011\nYou could get into adding WordArt and\ntext fills and\n\n271\n00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:03.440\ncolors to just the text of\nthis one shape as well.\n\n272\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.640\nSo each individual object can\nbe manipulated individually.\n\n273\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.330\nBut the thing is to me,\nwhen you start doing this, I don't know.\n\n274\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:16.180\nTo me it loses its conformity of why you'd\n\n275\n00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.890\nkinda wanna use a SmartArt graphic,\nto make it kinda look uniform.\n\n276\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.090\nAnd I've really kind of thrown this\nthing all out of whack, right?\n\n277\n00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.270\nI've changed this to be a different size,\nit's got a different color.\n\n278\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:33.290\nCan I have an easy way of just\nputting it back to the default?\n\n279\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:38.000\nLet's just go back to all the same colors,\nall the same sizes.\n\n280\n00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.430\nIf you select the whole SmartArt graphic\ngoing off to that edge, and you go to\n\n281\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.900\nthe SmartArt Design tab over on the\nright-hand side, there is a Reset Graphic.\n\n282\n00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.940\nI really like this,\nbecause I do the same thing.\n\n283\n00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.050\nI will go ahead and start really tweaking\nand it's like, I need to go back.\n\n284\n00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.899\nI reset it and perfect.\n\n285\n00:15:56.899 --> 00:15:58.418\nIt just goes back to the default.\n\n286\n00:15:58.418 --> 00:16:00.203\nNow, it didn't do the colors.\n\n287\n00:16:00.203 --> 00:16:03.731\nThis is where in this particular\ntab you can change the colors.\n\n288\n00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:06.800\nAnd we'll go through a lot of this more.\n\n289\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.287\nAnd notice how I can have the whole\nSmartArt change the colors,\n\n290\n00:16:11.287 --> 00:16:14.600\nchange the type of effects,\nand everything.\n\n291\n00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.090\nThat whole gallery of,\nremember we saw that with the cats.\n\n292\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.490\nThey were laying down the cycle.\n\n293\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:26.230\nThese are just I picked just all of\nthe different preset makes it really easy.\n\n294\n00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.610\nI would say that the colors.\n\n295\n00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.790\nWhere are these colors coming from?\n\n296\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.270\nLet's move back up into there.\n\n297\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.580\nWe've talked about how\nwe could position it and\n\n298\n00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.450\nchange it in relationship of the text and\ndocument.\n\n299\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:41.970\nComing back up here,\nyou can see that it has all of the same\n\n300\n00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:47.520\ncolor themes because it is\npulling from your design themes.\n\n301\n00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.310\nIf I go back over to my design tab and\nwe have our themes all together\n\n302\n00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.450\nthat determine like the font and\nthe different default effects.\n\n303\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.120\nIf I turn this into like say the droplet.\n\n304\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.880\nNotice now all of my colors change,\nand all of these,\n\n305\n00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.300\nbecause they're all using theme colors.\n\n306\n00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:11.600\nChange the theme, change the colors,\nand notice I made my own, so\n\n307\n00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.750\nI can make them,\ngonna get all those bright rainbow colors.\n\n308\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.200\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n\n309\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.090\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n310\n00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.336\n&gt;&gt; Someone who has been\ntrained in that and\n\n311\n00:17:19.336 --> 00:17:21.470\nhas like an artistic eye and\nthis is great for.\n\n312\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:28.420\nBut if you're not and you just wanna use\nsomething that I guess is a little safer,\n\n313\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.570\naesthetically pleasing, it's pretty\ncool to have those options there.\n\n314\n00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.053\nWhat was I gonna say?\n\n315\n00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.580\nI was gonna say, early 1990s.\n\n316\n00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.710\nYou remember those website\nwhere everything was just like\n\n317\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.960\na hodge podge of colors and randomness?\n\n318\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.300\nCrazy fruit salad is\nwhat they called those.\n\n319\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.790\nAnd that's kind of like, what my goal is,\n\n320\n00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.260\nwhat I'm creating a document is I\njust don't want that to happen.\n\n321\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.905\nIf it's anything other than that,\nthen I'm good.\n\n322\n00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:52.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Crazy fruit salad.\n\n323\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.200\nAs soon as you said it I'm like, yeah.\n\n324\n00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.161\nI know exactly what you're talking about.\n\n325\n00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:57.039\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:17:57.039 --> 00:17:58.539\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's why having those\n\n327\n00:17:58.539 --> 00:18:01.250\nthemes of where they've added\ncolors that look good together.\n\n328\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.720\nAnd the nice thing is when you\nadd this SmartArt graphic.\n\n329\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.250\nThat's why I'm saying honestly just\nkeep all the defaults, go ahead and\n\n330\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.960\nuse the library, use the default colors\nchange the theme to where I want\n\n331\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.780\nmore pinks rather than the office colors,\nbut at least they're adding colors that\n\n332\n00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.150\nlook good together and that fonts that are\nsupposed to look good together as well.\n\n333\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.170\nSo that's always a really nice thing.\n\n334\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:28.950\nSo I've gone through all of the kind of\nformatting, the backwards, right, where\n\n335\n00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.510\nI've already got the stuff in and created\nand now I'm showing you how to tweak it.\n\n336\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.635\n&gt;&gt; How to create them.\n\n337\n00:18:34.635 --> 00:18:37.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, how do I get\nthis actually into my document?\n\n338\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.290\nAnd make those hierarchies and\nmy cycle diagrams and everything.\n\n339\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.730\nHere's the diagram.\n\n340\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.290\nInsert diagram.\n\n341\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that does sound familiar.\n\n342\n00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's like objects and\ndiagrams.\n\n343\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.197\nIt's bringing back,\ntalk about '90s, right?\n\n344\n00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:51.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n345\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.300\n&gt;&gt; It is in the diagrams.\n\n346\n00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.360\nThat's where it was.\n\n347\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.700\nLet's just make a new document.\n\n348\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.220\nI'm just doing a command N.\n\n349\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.550\nI'm in Mac.\n\n350\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.400\nSo I've got my document.\n\n351\n00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.600\nWe're gonna go over here to the Inserts\ntab and then there is SmartArt.\n\n352\n00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.320\nSo we've got our SmartArt and\n\n353\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.450\nwe have our different types of the\ngalleries that we've got like the lists.\n\n354\n00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.200\nAnd we had just our cats,\ndogs, and horses.\n\n355\n00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.090\nWe have our process,\nour step one, two, and three.\n\n356\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:23.720\nWe had the cycle, the hierarchy,\nhow things relate to each other.\n\n357\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.220\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n358\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:24.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n359\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and there's a ton of them in here.\n\n360\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.140\nThe matrix, and pyramids.\n\n361\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.560\nAnd you can see, as somebody who\nis trying to convey information,\n\n362\n00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.845\nsometimes it is so much easier to just\ndraw it out, draw it as a picture.\n\n363\n00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:42.175\n[LAUGH] I know a lot of us as instructors,\nwe start to talk about something, and\n\n364\n00:19:42.175 --> 00:19:45.045\nwe're like here, we take out a piece\nof paper, and we start drawing it or\n\n365\n00:19:45.045 --> 00:19:46.795\nwe always go up to the whiteboard.\n\n366\n00:19:46.795 --> 00:19:48.205\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And start drawing a diagram.\n\n367\n00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:50.365\n&gt;&gt; I'm definitely a visual person,\nbut it's kind of strange.\n\n368\n00:19:50.365 --> 00:19:55.405\nNot everyone is visual, so even having\nlike, incorporating the text here with\n\n369\n00:19:55.405 --> 00:20:00.780\nthese graphical elements is kind of\nbroadening your capabilities there.\n\n370\n00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.721\n&gt;&gt; It's smart,\nit's being smart for you, right?\n\n371\n00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:06.660\n[LAUGH] That's why we have it as SmartArt.\n\n372\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.260\nSo you can pick one, and\nwe'll just start with a very basic one,\n\n373\n00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.970\nwe'll start with a list.\n\n374\n00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.330\nAnd once I add it, boom, there we go.\n\n375\n00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.590\nIt's got five shapes.\n\n376\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:21.020\nNow how we add text into\nourSmartArt You can either do it\n\n377\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:26.240\nin the shape itself or\nyou can use the west view.\n\n378\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.650\nLet's just go with the shapes for\nnow where it says text, shape is selected,\n\n379\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.720\nyou just start typing.\n\n380\n00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:38.750\nSo, we're going to say, Cat, and\nthen I click over here and I will say Dog.\n\n381\n00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.300\nThen we'll come over here and\nwe will type in Horses, but notice how,\n\n382\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.260\nlook at that see as soon as I type in the\nword horses which was bigger than cat and\n\n383\n00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:55.190\ndog it automatically changed the size of\nall of the text so it needs to be uniform.\n\n384\n00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.870\nSo I like that it does that for you.\n\n385\n00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.060\nAnd again you don't have to think,\nit's being smart for us.\n\n386\n00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.220\nSo if we made a longer word.\n\n387\n00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.590\nI'm drawing a blank and\nI don't want to spell things wrong.\n\n388\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.160\nSo if we said alligator.\n\n389\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.560\nAnd is that how you spell alligator?\n\n390\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n391\n00:21:12.085 --> 00:21:14.330\n[LAUGH] Notice it's a longer word.\n\n392\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.810\nEverything went ahead and got smaller.\n\n393\n00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.360\nAnd we'll just, you know what,\nwe're gonna change this.\n\n394\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.850\nAnd notice the text changed.\n\n395\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.800\nWe're gonna go with Bunny.\n\n396\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.950\nGotta throw a bunny in there.\n\n397\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.430\nAnd I don't need a fifth piece.\n\n398\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.520\nI only have four animals on this farm.\n\n399\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.645\nIf I select the shape, notice like\nmy I-beam is kinda hard to see.\n\n400\n00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:41.950\nBut my I-beam is over the word text versus\nthe four point arrow over the shade,\n\n401\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.480\nso you do want to make sure\nyou have the shape selected.\n\n402\n00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.420\nIf I don't want that,\njust hit delete on your keyboard, and\n\n403\n00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:53.210\nthen you notice how it automatically\nadjusts there to accommodate less shapes.\n\n404\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.610\nYeah, and what if I needed more?\n\n405\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.030\nMaybe I need six instead of five.\n\n406\n00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.500\nYou can do two things.\n\n407\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.550\nSo when we're working on the shapes part\nof it, up here on the SmartArt design tab,\n\n408\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.380\nI can add a shape.\n\n409\n00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.385\nNow this drop-down on this\nparticular type of SmartArt,\n\n410\n00:22:11.385 --> 00:22:14.170\nI have shape after, before, or above.\n\n411\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:20.070\nWhen we get into doing our org chart,\nthat's where you have shape below and\n\n412\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.710\nsubordinate, and all those kind of\nthings of how it goes up and down.\n\n413\n00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.660\n&gt;&gt; Adding those layers of complexity,\nliterally.\n\n414\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in a hierarchy of\nthat particular org chart.\n\n415\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.920\nWell I'll just go after and\nthen it adds another one, and\n\n416\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.920\nthen I can add another shape, and so\nI can have six blocks of animals cuz then\n\n417\n00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.525\nwe can go ahead and\nadd a pig And we'll add a bird.\n\n418\n00:22:43.525 --> 00:22:44.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n419\n00:22:44.485 --> 00:22:48.540\n[LAUGH] So I just went ahead and\nadded all my elements in there.\n\n420\n00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.800\nI do want to format the whole thing.\n\n421\n00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.640\nSo coming up over here to changing\nthe colors I'll pick the colorful,\n\n422\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.350\nperfect, and it's adding it as\nall of them I want to maybe\n\n423\n00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:05.720\nthrow a little [INAUDIBLE] maybe\nkinda add it a little bit more.\n\n424\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.980\n&gt;&gt; You can name your farm, Vaughan.\n\n425\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.477\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nwe're gonna name it Bunny Hills.\n\n426\n00:23:11.477 --> 00:23:12.151\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n427\n00:23:12.151 --> 00:23:15.020\n&gt;&gt; Here we go [LAUGH].\n\n428\n00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.150\nIt can't do me an offer for a second like,\nwhat I'm going to name that so, but notice\n\n429\n00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:24.120\nyou could go ahead and add everything from\nthe styles really quickly, easily and\n\n430\n00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.950\njust a few clicks, I went ahead and\nadded the SmartArt gallery.\n\n431\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.370\nI put in the text and the shapes, added\nsome shapes, threw them some colors and\n\n432\n00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.580\na sound.\n\n433\n00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.600\nThat's looks pretty nice.\n\n434\n00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.300\nI think so.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n435\n00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.640\nthe most important part is that it didn't\ntake you very long, and it was quick.\n\n436\n00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.100\nBecause we wanna be, I don't know about\nyou, I'm speaking out of turn here.\n\n437\n00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.130\nBut, at least in my mind,\nI wanna be efficient at work\n\n438\n00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:50.450\nbecause then that leaves more time to\ndo other projects or learn new things.\n\n439\n00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.820\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nthat's why this thing is so cool.\n\n440\n00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.497\nIt's just a couple of clicks and\nI've got a good looking graphic.\n\n441\n00:23:56.497 --> 00:23:59.530\nA graphical representation\nof my information.\n\n442\n00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there we go.\n\n443\n00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:04.809\nOther thing is,\nmaybe I don't want the squares.\n\n444\n00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:08.380\nWell notice you could change it,\nbecause it's still just a list.\n\n445\n00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.140\nMaybe I want some hexagons and\n\n446\n00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:10.850\nooh that's a lot of-\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n447\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:11.650\nThat looks cool.\n\n448\n00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.233\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\nIt kinda takes away the [CROSSTALK].\n\n449\n00:24:14.233 --> 00:24:15.903\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's tiny.\n\n450\n00:24:15.903 --> 00:24:17.483\nBut it looks scientific.\n\n451\n00:24:17.483 --> 00:24:19.610\n&gt;&gt; And\nnotice that you have some other ones.\n\n452\n00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.030\nNow certain galleries or\n\n453\n00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.470\ncertain types of smart looks\nbetter with other types of lists.\n\n454\n00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.380\nCuz right here I could put in a picture\nof a cat and find each one, so\n\n455\n00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.540\nit's really fun.\n\n456\n00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.851\nThe easiest way is to really\njust play around with it.\n\n457\n00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:35.500\nThat one looks a little weird.\n\n458\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.500\nSo they don't all work for\nvery simple ones.\n\n459\n00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.140\nNow this one is like a relationship.\n\n460\n00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.500\nOne, I just like the colors of\nthe circles and everything.\n\n461\n00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.590\nSo you do want to make sure that it's\nconveying the right information for\n\n462\n00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.910\nthe right purpose.\n\n463\n00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:54.524\nSo maybe sticking with just\nthe basic squares would be fine.\n\n464\n00:24:54.524 --> 00:24:58.110\nNow I'm gonna click over to the right\nhand side, hit enter a couple of times.\n\n465\n00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.560\nTo throw in some other ones.\n\n466\n00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.830\nLet's just do a couple other examples.\n\n467\n00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.090\nThat's not a shape, we want the Smart Art.\n\n468\n00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.370\nLet's go with our list because that one\nwhere I showed you where I had cat and\n\n469\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.580\nthen the names of the cats.\n\n470\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:15.250\nMultilevel list you can see that some\nof these different types of galleries\n\n471\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:19.890\nlook a little better for multilevel lists.\n\n472\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.200\nSo I want to hear that's also go ahead and\n\n473\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.910\ntalk about the text box\nthat comes with it.\n\n474\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.152\nYou can add all the information from\nthis panel rather than the shapes.\n\n475\n00:25:30.152 --> 00:25:31.350\nSo if I typed in.\n\n476\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:40.711\nI'm just using my arrow keys, using my\narrow to get down and I could say pumpkin.\n\n477\n00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:46.630\nThen if I hit enter, notice this is just\nlike adding a bulleted list into anything.\n\n478\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:51.544\nI could go ahead and say pooma and\nthen maybe maybe one more.\n\n479\n00:25:51.544 --> 00:25:53.775\nAnd we'll say fuego.\n\n480\n00:25:53.775 --> 00:25:55.257\nWe have that bishop there too.\n\n481\n00:25:55.257 --> 00:25:57.400\n[LAUGH] And then I get there.\n\n482\n00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.920\nIf I don't need any more of this, like the\nwhole adding and subtracting that we did\n\n483\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.240\nup here of the shapes, you just add it or\nsubtract it like text.\n\n484\n00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.910\nI just delete, backspace, backspace,\ndelete and I get back here.\n\n485\n00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:16.840\nNow I'm just in the secondary\nlevel of this list.\n\n486\n00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.720\nIf I hit enter, then want to get\nout to make dog use that shift tab.\n\n487\n00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.380\nThe tab and\nthe shift are how you create a list.\n\n488\n00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:31.330\nThat takes you out and\nnow I can say dog enter.\n\n489\n00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.121\nNope I want to go end tab.\n\n490\n00:26:34.121 --> 00:26:38.746\nSo you just write like a regular list and\nwe can say you know Albert and\n\n491\n00:26:38.746 --> 00:26:41.640\nWolfie and so on and so forth.\n\n492\n00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.824\nAnd if you want to use it\nin a list version you can.\n\n493\n00:26:43.824 --> 00:26:47.531\nThere's some buttons up here but\nI tend to just use the tab and\n\n494\n00:26:47.531 --> 00:26:50.230\nthe shift tab to go ahead and\ncreate my list.\n\n495\n00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.310\nAnd this particular one is good for that.\n\n496\n00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.700\nSame thing would be for\nlike the cycle and the process.\n\n497\n00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.830\nYou want to add shapes delete shapes\nusing the ribbon or the text box.\n\n498\n00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.460\nWe'll go ahead and do that.\n\n499\n00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.840\nLet's, I'm gonna do a page break and\nzoom in.\n\n500\n00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.090\nBecause I wanted to show\nyou that hierarchy.\n\n501\n00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.520\nCuz there are a few things\nin the hierarchy that.\n\n502\n00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.350\nJust understanding of them.\n\n503\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:18.559\nLet's go with insert, smart art and\nwe'll go with our hierarchy.\n\n504\n00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:21.180\nLet's go with that first one make it easy.\n\n505\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.470\nAnd here is our diagram.\n\n506\n00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.373\nI tend to go with the boxes rather than\nthe text pane for this particular one.\n\n507\n00:27:30.373 --> 00:27:32.640\nCuz it's more visual for me.\n\n508\n00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.190\nSo, I see it in boxes\nin a regular org chart.\n\n509\n00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.930\nSo now I just go ahead and add.\n\n510\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.760\nWe know Tim is the leader.\n\n511\n00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.628\nAnd this is Renee, so\nthis is an assistant.\n\n512\n00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:48.285\nNow let's just pretend that\nTim doesn't have an assistant,\n\n513\n00:27:48.285 --> 00:27:50.740\nwhich he really does need an assistant.\n\n514\n00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.780\n[LAUGH] But\nright here if I just hit delete,\n\n515\n00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:58.050\nnotice that it took that out\nof the default structure.\n\n516\n00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:03.080\nBut let's say we have Tim as the top and\nthen whose underneath Tim?\n\n517\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:08.010\nWe'll go with Angie and\nthen we'll go with Brad.\n\n518\n00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.100\nWe have the production and then the host.\n\n519\n00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.690\nI don't have a third level.\n\n520\n00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.248\nNow, we know that we have other\ndirectors on that same level.\n\n521\n00:28:17.248 --> 00:28:21.710\nBut for now I'm just gonna get that\n[INAUDIBLE] arrow and delete that out.\n\n522\n00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:22.550\nEverything adjust.\n\n523\n00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.310\nOkay, so let's say that Angie,\nshe has people underneath her, like us.\n\n524\n00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.160\n&gt;&gt; Subordinates.\n\n525\n00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, so you have to make\nsure you're on the right level and\n\n526\n00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:39.100\nthe right piece,\nof where you wanna add things to.\n\n527\n00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:43.540\nSo if I went to add the shape this\nis where we have add an assistant.\n\n528\n00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:48.680\nRemember Renee as Tim's assistant,\nmaybe, Angie has an assistant.\n\n529\n00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:55.150\nThat's not necessarily the same as\nus as people under her, it's over.\n\n530\n00:28:55.150 --> 00:29:00.510\nYes, so that's where you can have to pick\nisn't an assistant is it a shape below.\n\n531\n00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.090\nIt is so we go below.\n\n532\n00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.810\nAnd notice that we can go ahead and\nadd that in.\n\n533\n00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.255\nAnd everything adjusts, oops sorry.\n\n534\n00:29:08.255 --> 00:29:09.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n535\n00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:13.000\nI'm just wondering why the line\nisn't coming down the middle.\n\n536\n00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n537\n00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.880\nWell it always goes off to the left or\nthe right.\n\n538\n00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n539\n00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.258\n&gt;&gt; But, good point.\n\n540\n00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:21.310\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] one item?\n\n541\n00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.105\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Right now okay\nI'll let you keep that thought.\n\n542\n00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:24.621\nCuz I like where you're going.\n\n543\n00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:26.000\nCuz I did the same thing.\n\n544\n00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.700\nSo oops, let's not add an assistant.\n\n545\n00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.090\nWe're going to add a shade below.\n\n546\n00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.752\nAnd that way we have Megan and we have.\n\n547\n00:29:33.752 --> 00:29:38.681\nIf I added another shape it\nautomatically ends as below.\n\n548\n00:29:38.681 --> 00:29:41.810\nAnd then we can go ahead and\nput Titus and we can put.\n\n549\n00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.600\nYou know, a Taylor and Aubrey and\nwe could put everybody in there.\n\n550\n00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.680\nDon't forget Tisha.\n\n551\n00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.524\nSo we've got all those but\nlet's just say here, Cherokee guess what?\n\n552\n00:29:51.524 --> 00:29:53.030\nYou've been promoted.\n\n553\n00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.730\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; You are the director of all\n\n554\n00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:56.660\nthings rainbow.\n\n555\n00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I'll be your assistant.\n\n556\n00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n557\n00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.410\n&gt;&gt; So here notice.\n\n558\n00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.070\nThe buttons of promote.\n\n559\n00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:10.690\nIf I promote this, look you just\nwent up level into the directors.\n\n560\n00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.240\nOk well I have determined that\nI want to be the director or\n\n561\n00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.705\nrainbow so I'm going to demote you.\n\n562\n00:30:15.705 --> 00:30:17.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of course you are.\n\n563\n00:30:17.085 --> 00:30:19.368\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you've got the demote,\n\n564\n00:30:19.368 --> 00:30:23.510\nyou can go ahead and change levels\nof moving people up and down.\n\n565\n00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:27.660\nThe same way that if I was on\nthe same level of Angie and Brad.\n\n566\n00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:34.110\nIf I added a shape after or\nbefore, it's on the same line.\n\n567\n00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:38.620\nIt's like I'm adding another\ndirector rather than going below or\n\n568\n00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.220\nmoving people around.\n\n569\n00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.460\nSo that's where you just have to know,\nwhere is my cursor?\n\n570\n00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n571\n00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.560\n&gt;&gt; And where do I wanna add?\n\n572\n00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.030\nSame level or below.\n\n573\n00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.180\nAssistants?\n\n574\n00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.370\nAnd on here,\nsee this is one thing that I don't like.\n\n575\n00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.210\nSee how they are all going to the right.\n\n576\n00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.280\nOkay I'm going to take this one out.\n\n577\n00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280\nI'm just gonna take that out.\n\n578\n00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.940\nCan't necessarily get it\nto where there are like.\n\n579\n00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.980\nIt's like in the middle.\n\n580\n00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n581\n00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.760\n&gt;&gt; You could, it takes a lot of tweaking.\n\n582\n00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.110\nBut right here, you do have on Angie.\n\n583\n00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.161\nIf you change the layout.\n\n584\n00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:13.330\nNotice you can switch it\nover to like a left hanging.\n\n585\n00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then I just realized something.\n\n586\n00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.480\n&gt;&gt; But that doesn't look bad either.\n\n587\n00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.250\nI mean, that's more symmetrical.\n\n588\n00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.880\n&gt;&gt; I just realized that\nyou can do the middle.\n\n589\n00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.278\nI just forgot that it goes to standard.\n\n590\n00:31:21.278 --> 00:31:22.485\nWhooo!\n\n591\n00:31:22.485 --> 00:31:23.070\nOkay, good!\n\n592\n00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.300\nI'm glad you asked that question,\nbecause it's not a lot of tweaking.\n\n593\n00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.750\nYou just have to change the layout\nof where if I go left or\n\n594\n00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:33.670\nright hanging or I can go with both,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n595\n00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:34.730\n&gt;&gt; There, so there's different ways.\n\n596\n00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.700\nNow, it's kind of going in the middle.\n\n597\n00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.400\nIs that what you were?\n\n598\n00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:38.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n599\n00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect, well then there you go.\n\n600\n00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:43.682\nIt isn't ladies and gentlemen, I lied.\n\n601\n00:31:43.682 --> 00:31:50.070\nIt is the standard, but it is how it hangs\noff of or the layout from each shape.\n\n602\n00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.877\nBut you do have to make sure you're\nin the right place of where you\n\n603\n00:31:54.877 --> 00:31:57.025\nwant to change that layout.\n\n604\n00:31:57.025 --> 00:31:58.202\nAnd that's how it goes.\n\n605\n00:31:58.202 --> 00:32:02.393\nAnd you can change once again, the\npromote, the demote, move up, move down.\n\n606\n00:32:02.393 --> 00:32:03.970\nChange all around.\n\n607\n00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.920\nIt is all about where your cursor is, so.\n\n608\n00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.565\nGood, I forgot about\nthat standard honestly.\n\n609\n00:32:09.565 --> 00:32:13.090\n[laughter] So I'm glad it was\neasier than I was trying to go.\n\n610\n00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:14.980\n&gt;&gt; No, it's okay, I'm just a little like.\n\n611\n00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.165\nI'm a symmetry person for sure.\n\n612\n00:32:17.165 --> 00:32:17.745\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n613\n00:32:17.745 --> 00:32:19.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where the two\n\n614\n00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.330\nhanging sides as long as I can get one\ngoing this way and one going that way.\n\n615\n00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:22.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then I'm good.\n\n616\n00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.749\n&gt;&gt; That makes me feel better [LAUGH] and\nthat's the way I've always done it so\n\n617\n00:32:25.749 --> 00:32:27.678\nI've kind of always skipped\nover that standard one.\n\n618\n00:32:27.678 --> 00:32:30.950\nSo, I'm glad that you were here [LAUGH]\nto help and that we can answer it.\n\n619\n00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:35.250\nAnd I was already thinking about all\nthese way more complicated things to do.\n\n620\n00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.740\nAnd sometimes we tend to do that.\n\n621\n00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, always.\n\n622\n00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.000\n&gt;&gt; But that is why we're here,\n\n623\n00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.460\nto help you not do the same\nthing that I would do [LAUGH].\n\n624\n00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.964\n&gt;&gt; Well I've learned a ton so\nfar, so thank you for that Vonne.\n\n625\n00:32:43.964 --> 00:32:44.758\nAnd thank you for joining us.\n\n626\n00:32:44.758 --> 00:32:47.990\nVonne do you have any final thoughts or\nanything here that you'd like to add?\n\n627\n00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.010\n&gt;&gt; My only thing that I've\nkind of already said is,\n\n628\n00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:53.230\na lot of time it's easier\nto just keep the defaults.\n\n629\n00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.240\nJust add a style on it,\nchange the color and\n\n630\n00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.200\nthen you don't have to go into each\nshape and tweak them to that level.\n\n631\n00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.760\nJust take the defaults and\nit's all you do.\n\n632\n00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.070\n&gt;&gt; So don't overcomplicate.\n\n633\n00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes, see that?\n\n634\n00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.445\nStay smart.\n\n635\n00:33:05.445 --> 00:33:08.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well thank you Vonne.\n\n636\n00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.120\nI think that's about it for\n\n637\n00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.420\nthis particular episode,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n638\n00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.970\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n639\n00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:13.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n640\n00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.492\n&gt;&gt; See you next time\nhere at Office Pro TV.\n\n641\n00:33:16.492 --> 00:33:21.056\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.849\nWe're looking at Word here\nadvanced 2016 for Mac.\n\n4\n00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.670\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose and\nwith us today we have Mrs.\n\n5\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.870\nVonne Smith to help cover,\n\n6\n00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.204\nwhat are we going to be looking at tables-\n&gt;&gt; Tables.\n\n7\n00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:27.368\n&gt;&gt; And deduction.\n\n8\n00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:28.165\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n9\n00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:32.569\nAnd then bringing these different\ngraphical elements into little intro.\n\n10\n00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:35.860\nKind of get us used to\nwhatever we are talking about.\n\n11\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.082\nA lot of the times it's vocabulary.\n\n12\n00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:42.409\nWhen we did the images, we're talking\nabout resolution and pixels and\n\n13\n00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.510\nimage dimension and trial types.\n\n14\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.500\nBut here with tables, there isn't\na decent amount of just terminology\n\n15\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.370\nthat I like to just kind\nof introduce first.\n\n16\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.163\nLet's just give some examples, show you\nsome finished product, if you want to say.\n\n17\n00:00:57.163 --> 00:01:00.011\nAnd then in the next episodes we'll\ntalk about creating the tables and\n\n18\n00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:01.950\nthen how to format it and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n19\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.972\n&gt;&gt; Cool, so you mean I'll actually be able\nto understand what you're talking about in\n\n20\n00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:05.834\nthe subsequent shows.\n\n21\n00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:06.775\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah.\n\n22\n00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:08.487\n&gt;&gt; That's how I like to do it.\n\n24\n00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:13.330\n&gt;&gt; Let's introduce it, cuz I'm kind\nof a stickler for the vocabulary and\n\n25\n00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.056\nlearning the proper terminology and\nthe words for it.\n\n26\n00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:18.928\nBecause then I make up\nmy own to describe them.\n\n27\n00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:22.408\n[LAUGH] So it's kinda-\n&gt;&gt; Your disclaimer if you give\n\n28\n00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:24.938\nthe technical term and\nthen you throw out your own version-\n\n29\n00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:25.950\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n30\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.850\nExactly, yeah.\n\n31\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.290\nAnd then that,\nit's kinda like I know in the tech world.\n\n32\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.585\nThere's a onofact, right?\n\n33\n00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:34.168\nI was always like,\nwhat does that actually stand for?\n\n34\n00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:36.818\nLike what does the background?\n\n35\n00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:38.640\nDNS.\n\n36\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.688\nWhat is DNS actually stand for?\n\n37\n00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:42.644\nDomain name system.\n\n38\n00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:43.989\n&gt;&gt; Yep there you go.\n\n39\n00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:45.950\nYay.\n\n40\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.830\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou know I would always ask people and\n\n41\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.070\nI don't even remember\nwhat that stands for.\n\n42\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.230\nI'm like how do you not remember?\n\n43\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.340\nAnd then I do the same things so.\n\n44\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.720\nSo that's what we're going to go ahead and\nintroduce parts of a table.\n\n45\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.420\nI have a Power Point\npresentation ready for us to go.\n\n46\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.105\nYou will have a PDF version of it,\njust an easier way for me to go ahead and\n\n47\n00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:07.195\ndistribute it for you.\n\n48\n00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.735\nSo what is a table?\n\n49\n00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:15.350\nTable is comprised of rows and columns.\n\n50\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.210\nI knew that.\n\n51\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.660\nI know, but\nwe're starting from the beginning,\n\n52\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.080\ncuz you don't always want to assume,\ncuz you know it happens.\n\n53\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.730\n&gt;&gt; No, because even I'm talking about\ntechnical, if you're a database admin,\n\n54\n00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.550\nyou might even think that those rows\nare called tuples, or something.\n\n55\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n57\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.076\nI don't even know what a tuple is.\n\n58\n00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:34.734\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a fancy word for a row but\n\n59\n00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:36.312\nusually in databases.\n\n60\n00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:37.180\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n61\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well see now\n\n62\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.480\nyou're teaching me something.\n\n63\n00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.160\nYes, so this is not a tuple,\nor I guess we could call it.\n\n64\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.980\nBut if we're not in databases,\nwe're just in a regular table within Word,\n\n65\n00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.960\nso perfect.\n\n66\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.860\nI love this.\n\n67\n00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.956\nSee, one with words.\n\n68\n00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:54.304\n[LAUGH] And then where a row and\ncolumn intersect is known as a cell.\n\n69\n00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:59.244\nSo in this case, they eat is in a cell,\nit's in our one, two, three, four,\n\n70\n00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:02.600\nit's in the fourth row,\nin the first column.\n\n71\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.243\nAnd this is not Excel.\n\n72\n00:03:05.243 --> 00:03:07.719\nSo this is not a spreadsheet application.\n\n73\n00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.270\nAnd I'm actually using Power Point to go\nahead and demonstrate this terminology.\n\n74\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.478\nBut we are using tables as its own entity.\n\n75\n00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:20.451\nSo we don't need to refer to column a,\nb, c and row 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n76\n00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:24.790\nIt's just these are the rows and\nthe columns and where they are, the cells.\n\n77\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.587\nAnd so\nwe don't have to get that technical.\n\n78\n00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:33.818\nBut if you are used to Excel then this is\nprobably going to be very familiar to you.\n\n79\n00:03:33.818 --> 00:03:38.750\nNow, when you get into merged cells,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n80\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.553\nIt means you take cells and\nyou merge them together.\n\n81\n00:03:41.553 --> 00:03:46.680\n[LAUGH] It's where you have multiple\ncells expanding across columns or rows.\n\n82\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.950\nIt doesn't have to always\nbe across columns.\n\n83\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.815\nWere it becomes one big cell.\n\n84\n00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:53.290\nSo, this one where it says cat activity.\n\n85\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.884\nThis is really, it was originally one,\ntwo, three columns in this row,\n\n86\n00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:04.047\nbut we selected all those cells in\nthat row, and became one big one.\n\n87\n00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:07.020\nSo that's what you do\nwhen you merge cells.\n\n88\n00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.026\nAnd then, we got some other stuff\ngoing on here with our table layout.\n\n89\n00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:19.019\nThings that you can manipulate within\nyour layout like the height of the row.\n\n90\n00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.371\nYou see how this row is higher\nthan this row, where as the eat,\n\n91\n00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:24.980\nthe meow and the play.\n\n92\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.530\nThe same thing with the vertical and\nthe horizontal alignment.\n\n93\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.550\nHow does the text align\nitself within the cell?\n\n94\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.110\nThis one right here, this cat activity\nit's aligned horizontally centered.\n\n95\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.830\nIt's also aligned vertically centered.\n\n96\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.300\nAs opposed to the activity,\n\n97\n00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.160\nyou see it vertically aligned\ntowards the bottom of the cell.\n\n98\n00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.368\nAnd these are things that I'm\nkind of like a stickler for.\n\n99\n00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:51.315\nbecause I like to have the- I'm\na big vertical alignment person.\n\n100\n00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:53.790\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was just going to say, look,\n\n101\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.996\nmaybe if you're thinking,\ncenter everything all the time.\n\n102\n00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:59.616\n&gt;&gt; But it actually looks really nice,\n\n103\n00:04:59.616 --> 00:05:02.101\nhow you have it aligned to\nthe left there at the bottom.\n\n104\n00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:06.120\nSo that's not always the case,\nto just go with center everything.\n\n105\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI think there's certain situations where\n\n106\n00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.020\nthe left alignment,\nespecially when you have these labels, and\n\n107\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.150\nhow it differentiates from the text.\n\n108\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.831\nAnd this is all really\npersonal preference.\n\n109\n00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:18.540\n&gt;&gt; Relative, yeah, to what you like.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.273\nBut understanding that you do\nhave alignment this way and\n\n111\n00:05:22.273 --> 00:05:24.227\nyou have alignment this way.\n\n112\n00:05:24.227 --> 00:05:27.426\nAnd that's from a contents\nwithin the cells.\n\n113\n00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:28.690\nAnd so, how do we do that?\n\n114\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.390\nWell, that's coming up, but that's where\nwe're just, again, introducing these\n\n115\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.200\nterms and the different things that we're\ngoing to be working within our tables.\n\n116\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.131\nAnother thing would be\nthe direction of your text.\n\n117\n00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:44.829\nYou can see, Fuego and\nBishop is not this way, it's this way.\n\n118\n00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:46.740\nSo you can change that.\n\n119\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.240\nYou also have cell margins, and\nthis is an example over here.\n\n120\n00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.496\nAnd I can move this over,\nso you guys can see it.\n\n121\n00:05:52.496 --> 00:06:00.245\nSo notice that the spacing around\nthe content within the cells.\n\n122\n00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:01.847\nThat's a cell margin.\n\n123\n00:06:01.847 --> 00:06:04.715\nThis is also known in web design, in HTML,\n\n124\n00:06:04.715 --> 00:06:09.860\nwhich we would call that cell padding or\npadding the edges of the cells.\n\n125\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.910\nThere's also something along the lines\nin HTML known as cell spacing,\n\n126\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.610\nof the spaces between the cells.\n\n127\n00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.765\nIt's the insides of the padding,\noutsides, or the spacing.\n\n128\n00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:25.319\nAnd you do have that type of\nformatting of how you control your\n\n129\n00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.651\nlayout in tables within Word.\n\n130\n00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:31.940\nAnd this is just an illustration of,\nnotice how this cell margin,\n\n131\n00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.785\nthere's no margin,\nthe text is right up against the cell.\n\n132\n00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:40.028\nI've had people say there's to\nmuch white space in my cells,\n\n133\n00:06:40.028 --> 00:06:45.348\nI don't want them to be that fluffy,\nI've had people use that terminology.\n\n134\n00:06:45.348 --> 00:06:47.499\n&gt;&gt; I'm just sitting here thinking,\nI don't know,\n\n135\n00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:50.070\ncuz I know we've talked about\ntables before on the PC side.\n\n136\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:57.084\nBut did you tell me that the cell, the\npadding, for like a padded wall type cell?\n\n137\n00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:05.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I used that analogy of how to\nexplain padding of I'm in padded cell.\n\n138\n00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.513\nSo that way, there's a little\nfluff in between me and the wall.\n\n139\n00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:11.695\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nthat's where we get the fluff, got it.\n\n140\n00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:13.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad you remember that analogy.\n\n141\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.967\nI love to use that one, because sometimes\nI feel I might need one of those.\n\n142\n00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:18.386\n&gt;&gt; You should be in a padded cell.\n\n143\n00:07:18.386 --> 00:07:20.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n144\n00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.666\nJust kind of bounce around and everything.\n\n145\n00:07:23.666 --> 00:07:27.000\nOk so now, back to our tables.\n\n146\n00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.050\nHow you can distribute the rows and\ncolumns, like the actual width and\n\n147\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.635\nheight of all of the cells.\n\n148\n00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:36.758\nNotice how these are all uniform\nversus these cells here,\n\n149\n00:07:36.758 --> 00:07:38.787\nthe rows are a little wider.\n\n150\n00:07:38.787 --> 00:07:42.580\nAnd this particular column versus here.\n\n151\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.060\nAnd outside there's a column.\n\n152\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.530\nThis column is wider than this column and\nthis column.\n\n153\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.141\nSo you can use some cool just one\nclick button with being able to\n\n154\n00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:53.897\ndistribute those rows and columns.\n\n155\n00:07:53.897 --> 00:07:56.909\nThis row heights and columns widths.\n\n156\n00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.569\nSorry sometimes I flip right left.\n\n157\n00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:04.373\nYou can also get into some table styles,\nand I really like to apply styles,\n\n158\n00:08:04.373 --> 00:08:06.138\ncuz you know I love styles.\n\n159\n00:08:06.138 --> 00:08:10.840\nBut it's a lot easier to just kind\nof pick from a predetermined style\n\n160\n00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.884\nthat takes the overall formatting\nof your entire table and\n\n161\n00:08:14.884 --> 00:08:18.390\nmakes it look decently\nprofessional-looking.\n\n162\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.379\nSo you have that nice banded rows\nright here, so you can kind of\n\n163\n00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:26.919\ndifferentiate between the rows and\nthen it took all the borders away.\n\n164\n00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:31.251\nAnd this particular first column,\nthat should actually be first column,\n\n165\n00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:32.947\nnot first row, sorry guys.\n\n166\n00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:37.444\n[LAUGH] How that is formatted differently,\nand then this is a total row.\n\n167\n00:08:37.444 --> 00:08:41.748\nNow a total row does not\nalways signify a summing or\n\n168\n00:08:41.748 --> 00:08:46.920\nsome type of formula,\nlike I'm adding a total.\n\n169\n00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.549\nIt's really just the formatting.\n\n170\n00:08:48.549 --> 00:08:51.990\nDo you see how this particular one,\nhow it is bold,\n\n171\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.250\nit has a double line on the border,\nand then a thicker line at the bottom?\n\n172\n00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.340\nThat's what they determine as a total\nrow when we're using table styles and\n\n173\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.670\nI like to be efficient, right?\n\n174\n00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.859\nAnd we don't call it lazy,\nwe call it efficient.\n\n175\n00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:10.135\n[LAUGH] To be able to just go-\n&gt;&gt; Work smarter not harder.\n\n176\n00:09:10.135 --> 00:09:13.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, always.\n\n177\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.207\nSo you just go ahead and apply a style and\nthese little check boxes that come off and\n\n178\n00:09:17.207 --> 00:09:20.030\nactually I'll just show you because\nit is the same in PowerPoint,\n\n179\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.650\nthat we'll be going to\nthe same kind of tabs.\n\n180\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.010\nNotice it's just hey, look at this whole\ngallery of all these different ways that I\n\n181\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:34.770\ncan stylize or format my cells with\nborders and shading and I just click it.\n\n182\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.650\nClick a little few buttons over here and\nthen I'm done.\n\n183\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.637\nNow can you go ahead and\ndo individual cell formatting?\n\n184\n00:09:41.637 --> 00:09:43.077\nYes, you can make something.\n\n185\n00:09:43.077 --> 00:09:43.732\n&gt;&gt; Ugh.\n\n186\n00:09:43.732 --> 00:09:45.282\n&gt;&gt; Right, as beautiful as this.\n\n187\n00:09:45.282 --> 00:09:47.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n188\n00:09:47.261 --> 00:09:52.109\nbecause all of the styles is just\na collection of shading, borders,\n\n189\n00:09:52.109 --> 00:09:56.875\ndifferent effects, the word art\nstyles where it has like the orange\n\n190\n00:09:56.875 --> 00:10:01.660\noutlines on the white text,\na little bit of drop shadows and stuff.\n\n191\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.750\nAnd really just text\nformatting all together.\n\n192\n00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.570\nIs it bold?\n\n193\n00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.060\nIs it blue?\n\n194\n00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.750\nThose types of things,\nnow in this particular example,\n\n195\n00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.700\nthis is the parts of a table that\nI use for my PowerPoint shows.\n\n196\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.310\nIn PowerPoint, you can format the shading,\nor the colors if you want to say,\n\n197\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.670\nof a cell to be with gradients and\ntextures and photographs.\n\n198\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.070\nIn Word,\n\n199\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.605\nyou don't have as many options which is\nprobably kind of a good thing, right?\n\n200\n00:10:31.605 --> 00:10:34.783\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like limiting you in a normal\n\n201\n00:10:34.783 --> 00:10:35.721\ncapacity.\n\n202\n00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:36.950\nLet's be normal here.\n\n203\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't need to have\nthe dead fish all over the place.\n\n204\n00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:43.590\n[LAUGH] So you only have solid shading.\n\n205\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.930\nI think you had a little bit of textures,\nlike some kind of like crosshatching and\n\n206\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.760\nthings like that, but\nI'll show you once we get in there.\n\n207\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.600\n&gt;&gt; Subtleness.\n\n208\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if you're looking for\nthe flowers and\n\n209\n00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.480\nthe gradient, it's not available\nwhen formatting tables within Word.\n\n210\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.308\nPowerPoint, yes you can do that.\n\n211\n00:10:59.308 --> 00:11:04.168\nNow the biggest thing about working with\na table is making sure you understand\n\n212\n00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:06.420\nwhat your mouse cursors look like.\n\n213\n00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.620\nIt's all about that.\n\n214\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.968\nYou know, you've been watching\nhopefully some other episodes with me,\n\n215\n00:11:10.968 --> 00:11:13.727\nlike I'm always like,\nyou gotta watch that mouse cursors.\n\n216\n00:11:13.727 --> 00:11:16.210\nIt's all about the select to effect.\n\n217\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.736\nBecause if I want to effect\none particular cell,\n\n218\n00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:23.177\nI gotta know how how to\nget that thing selected.\n\n219\n00:11:23.177 --> 00:11:26.000\nCuz that's the whole name of the game.\n\n220\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.520\nSo that's what I'd like\nto go over now with\n\n221\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.320\nyou is going over those\nmouse cursor icons.\n\n222\n00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.110\nSo I'm gonna flip on over to Word now.\n\n223\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.982\nCuz I have a table inserted\ninto my Word document, so\n\n224\n00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:42.437\nI figure if we're talking about Word,\nI should probably get out of PowerPoint.\n\n225\n00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:43.817\n[LAUGH] So we've got this.\n\n226\n00:11:43.817 --> 00:11:48.083\nAnd now, right now I have my mouse cursor\njust kinda hanging out in nowhere land,\n\n227\n00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:49.481\nand I've got my i-beam.\n\n228\n00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:52.450\nCuz i-beam always indicates text.\n\n229\n00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.060\nIf I come down into my table, I'll zoom\nin for a little bit so hopefully you guys\n\n230\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.930\ncan see it and then I'll zoom in the whole\ncomputer when we get a little closer.\n\n231\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:05.985\nSo if I have my i-beam right here,\nnotice if I click, I'm selecting inside\n\n232\n00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:12.045\nof the cell, so I'm getting into the text\ncuz if I wanted to format this text,\n\n233\n00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:15.475\nI'd have to select it, just like I\nwould anywhere else in a Word document.\n\n234\n00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:18.046\nJust click, hold and drag, and we're good.\n\n235\n00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:22.282\nBut I wanna start selecting the cells,\nor the rows, or the columns,\n\n236\n00:12:22.282 --> 00:12:27.100\nthat's where my mouse cursor icons\nare gonna get a little different.\n\n237\n00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.010\nSo let's go over to here.\n\n238\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.150\nNotice how I'm in the cell, but\nI'm over a little to the left-hand side.\n\n239\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.740\nAnd notice how my mouse cursor\njust turns into a black arrow.\n\n240\n00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.460\nI am not out in the selection area.\n\n241\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.190\nSo that's a totally different area.\n\n242\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.359\nRemember that's outside in the margins.\n\n243\n00:12:48.359 --> 00:12:49.960\nI'm inside the cell.\n\n244\n00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.330\nIf I single click,\nnotice how it's selecting the whole cell.\n\n245\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.570\nNot the text.\n\n246\n00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.731\nThe text is the i-beam.\n\n247\n00:12:57.731 --> 00:13:02.946\nI-beam for text, arrow for the whole cell.\n\n248\n00:13:02.946 --> 00:13:06.784\nAnd if I wanted to select\nall of those cells.\n\n249\n00:13:06.784 --> 00:13:09.860\nLet's deselect first, let's kinda\njust click off into nowhere land.\n\n250\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.052\nIf I wanted to select all of these\ncells within this row, I can click,\n\n251\n00:13:14.052 --> 00:13:15.006\nhold and drag.\n\n252\n00:13:15.006 --> 00:13:18.499\nAnd you see how as soon\nas I go across a cell,\n\n253\n00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:24.321\nit goes from here where I'm selecting\nmy text to let's go ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:24.321 --> 00:13:29.682\nget all the cells, and this is how\nI can select a row if I wanted to.\n\n255\n00:13:29.682 --> 00:13:33.189\nJust click, hold and\ndrag, and it gets that.\n\n256\n00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:37.775\nNow there's a couple other things that\nyou're going to notice when you're working\n\n257\n00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:38.565\nin a table.\n\n258\n00:13:38.565 --> 00:13:40.846\nNow I came up here to the very top.\n\n259\n00:13:40.846 --> 00:13:44.110\nBecause yes this first\ncell is a merge cell.\n\n260\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.942\nIf I come up all the way about\nhere to almost like on the border,\n\n261\n00:13:47.942 --> 00:13:50.910\nthe top border of this table,\nyou see an arrow.\n\n262\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.550\nLike a black arrow pointing down.\n\n263\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.140\nThat indicates that I'm over the column.\n\n264\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.740\nAnd if I single-click,\nwell it actually selected the whole table.\n\n265\n00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.585\nSo that's because I have\nthe merged cell it's doing that.\n\n266\n00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:02.574\n&gt;&gt; The merged cell at the top?\n\n267\n00:14:02.574 --> 00:14:03.981\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just realized that.\n\n268\n00:14:03.981 --> 00:14:07.920\nSo if I did not have that merged cell,\nand you know what?\n\n269\n00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.050\nFor right now, you're just going to\npretend that ooh, I didn't do any of this.\n\n270\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.782\nLet me delete that row.\n\n271\n00:14:12.782 --> 00:14:13.294\nThere we go.\n\n272\n00:14:13.294 --> 00:14:14.929\n[LAUGH] So now I have it.\n\n273\n00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:17.153\nThat's what I was trying to get, okay?\n\n274\n00:14:17.153 --> 00:14:19.536\nSo let's turn this into\na teachable moment.\n\n275\n00:14:19.536 --> 00:14:25.321\nSo if you have a merged cell on that\nfirst row, it's not going to individually\n\n276\n00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:31.380\nselect that first column because it does\nmake sense now that I'm talking it out.\n\n277\n00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.310\nYeah, because it thinks\nthat it is the column.\n\n278\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.514\nSo it's gonna go ahead and\nselect everything.\n\n279\n00:14:36.514 --> 00:14:41.391\nBut without merged cells, you can\nnotice that you can get to the top and\n\n280\n00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:44.550\nbe able to select individual columns.\n\n281\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.910\nThe same thing you can do\nis going out into the rows.\n\n282\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.779\nI'm not out here,\nit might look like it but\n\n283\n00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:53.981\nsee there's an i-beam here and\nthen an arrow.\n\n284\n00:14:53.981 --> 00:14:57.840\nAnd then there's my arrow,\nso two different places.\n\n285\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.726\nSo I can go outside of my tables to\nbe able to select an entire row,\n\n286\n00:15:02.726 --> 00:15:04.726\nselect an entire column.\n\n287\n00:15:04.726 --> 00:15:07.445\nAnd if I wanted to\nselect multiple columns,\n\n288\n00:15:07.445 --> 00:15:11.900\nI could take that arrow pointing down and\nclick, hold, and drag.\n\n289\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.640\nSame thing with my rows if I\nwanted to select multiple rows.\n\n290\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.180\nBut lots of different\nthings to kind of look for,\n\n291\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.631\nthose icons of cell, row, column.\n\n292\n00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.135\nThen you also have the entire table.\n\n293\n00:15:26.135 --> 00:15:28.130\nI want everything to be selected.\n\n294\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:34.340\nAll of your tables are always going to be\nindicated by this little guy over here.\n\n295\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.910\nLet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n296\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.720\n&gt;&gt; I can imagine you'd have to spend a lot\nof time with tables to learn all these\n\n297\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.330\ntricks if you didn't explain it.\n\n298\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.054\nBecause literally, I would probably\njust accidentally do something and\n\n299\n00:15:45.054 --> 00:15:46.141\nbe like, okay?\n\n300\n00:15:46.141 --> 00:15:47.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That-\n\n301\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.126\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:15:49.126 --> 00:15:50.345\n&gt;&gt; Exactly why I'm doing this.\n\n303\n00:15:50.345 --> 00:15:53.460\nBecause I've had people that are like,\nman, tables?\n\n304\n00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.867\nI can't stand them, I fight with them.\n\n305\n00:15:54.867 --> 00:15:58.647\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I understand, cuz I do too.\n\n306\n00:15:58.647 --> 00:16:00.497\nBecause I'm just like,\n[SOUND] I'll just go.\n\n307\n00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:05.897\nYou kind of just jump in and\njust Not really pay attention.\n\n308\n00:16:05.897 --> 00:16:10.170\nSo that's why I said, slow it down,\nlook at what you're looking at.\n\n309\n00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.850\nAnd to me, it's like it's easy, but\n\n310\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.790\nonly because I'm really trying to\nemphasize those tiny little pieces.\n\n311\n00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.020\nIt's always the little\nthings that trip you up,\n\n312\n00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.730\nin all of, we were talking with Ronnie.\n\n313\n00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.640\nLiterally right before this episode,\n\n314\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.540\nRonnie was like I didn't\nknow I was working.\n\n315\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.940\nI spent all this time.\n\n316\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.060\nI checked one box off and\nthen I checked it back on and\n\n317\n00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.050\nthen magically this other thing popped up.\n\n318\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.510\nWe do it too folks.\n\n319\n00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.170\nBelieve us.\n\n320\n00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.250\nWe know your pain and\nthat's why we try to alleviate.\n\n321\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.730\nYes, and showing you those\nlittle mouse cursor icons.\n\n322\n00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.620\nUnderstand why that\nthing is being selected.\n\n323\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.710\nIt's cuz you might have moved it ever so\nslightly so, good points.\n\n324\n00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.090\nSo right up here do you see\nthe top left hand corner\n\n325\n00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.620\nof a table you get this four\npointed arrow in a box.\n\n326\n00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.720\nThat indicates that this is a table, and\n\n327\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.200\nif I click on it notice how\nit selects the whole table.\n\n328\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.780\nAnd I know where the end of the table\nis because of this tiny little dot.\n\n329\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.030\nAgain, it's a square.\n\n330\n00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.950\nI keep calling these dots squares.\n\n331\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:25.200\n&gt;&gt; It's so small you can barely see it so\nit looks like a dot.\n\n332\n00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI keep calling these squares dots, and\n\n333\n00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.710\nto me dots are circles.\n\n334\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.820\n&gt;&gt; It's true, it's true.\n\n335\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, terminology, getting hung\nup on the words and the vocabulary.\n\n336\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.440\nBut it's still that little thing there\ndow at the bottom right hand corner.\n\n337\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.330\nSo that indicates where\nthe end of the table is.\n\n338\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.520\nSo being able to select the whole table\n\n339\n00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.960\nthis is where hey if I\nwanted to move the table.\n\n340\n00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.580\nFormat all of the text in\nthe table to be a different font,\n\n341\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.190\nyou've got to select the whole table.\n\n342\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.100\nSo, that's where we're going.\n\n343\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.360\nSome other icons that you're\ngoing to encounter in here.\n\n344\n00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.420\nYou're like, we're not done?\n\n345\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.505\nNo, not yet.\n\n346\n00:18:02.505 --> 00:18:08.090\n[LAUGH] In between the cells,\nif I go right about here,\n\n347\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:13.250\nyou see my mouse cursor icon turns to\ntwo lines with arrows on top of them.\n\n348\n00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.310\nThat indicates that I'm on my row.\n\n349\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.890\nAnd this will change the row height.\n\n350\n00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:23.490\nIf I click hold and drag, notice it's\ngoing to make that row a little higher.\n\n351\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.560\nThe same thing with my column.\n\n352\n00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.770\nIf I come in between my columns, I get the\ntwo lines with the arrows going left and\n\n353\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.420\nright, that's where I can\nchange my column width.\n\n354\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.200\nYeah, row height, column width.\n\n355\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.950\nAnd then way down here,\nlet's see if I can move that over.\n\n356\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.830\nSee how I do have that dot\nat the end of the table\n\n357\n00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.940\nwhere if I hover over it,\nI get a diagonal sizing arrow.\n\n358\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.240\nThe two pointed arrow which means\nthat I can change the size.\n\n359\n00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.120\nAll these different pieces that\nI can change, width, height,\n\n360\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.040\nsizes, select change location, move.\n\n361\n00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.560\nYou got to watch your mouse cursor icon,\nbecause in one little spot like right in\n\n362\n00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:08.790\nthere like look at all the different icons\nthat I get right in this one little area.\n\n363\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:14.020\nThat would be selecting this particular\ncell with fuego, that would changing\n\n364\n00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:19.680\nthe column width,\nthis would be selecting that cell.\n\n365\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.030\nAnd then, the IV in the middle, right?\n\n366\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.300\n&gt;&gt; I can see it, yeah.\n\n367\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.120\nWhat happens when we go to that diagonal,\nVonne, and we pull it?\n\n368\n00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.590\nI'm really curious.\n\n369\n00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.090\nOkay.\n\n370\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.500\n&gt;&gt; You can make it bigger.\n\n371\n00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.330\n&gt;&gt; So\nour text gets larger with the spacing?\n\n372\n00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.715\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, sorry about that, guys.\n\n373\n00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:38.860\n[LAUGH] Okay,\nI'm getting a little crazy on my zooming.\n\n374\n00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.190\nLet's slow down Vaughn.\n\n375\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:45.480\nRemember what I told you guys,\nslow down, find where you are.\n\n376\n00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.935\nOkay, now we're better.\n\n377\n00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:52.950\n[LAUGH] Yes, it is resizing because we're\nstill in the topic of graphical elements.\n\n378\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.690\nYou might not think of tables\nas graphics but they really are.\n\n379\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.350\nIt's not just text in a paragraph.\n\n380\n00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:04.770\nIt's in a particular format or\njust how it acts.\n\n381\n00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.960\nSo it does act like a graphic.\n\n382\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.470\n&gt;&gt; That's nice.\n\n383\n00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.760\nSo you don't have to go in and\nchange the font size for\n\n384\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.015\nall of those individual pieces?\n\n385\n00:20:11.015 --> 00:20:14.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, cuz if I change this,\nright, the font is still 20.\n\n386\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.870\nIf I make it bigger the font is still 20.\n\n387\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.680\nBut do you see how I'm changing\nthe overall size of the table?\n\n388\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.190\nNot the content within the table.\n\n389\n00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.660\nThat's actually a really good\npoint to pull right there.\n\n390\n00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.780\nSame font size, just different boundaries,\n\n391\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.400\nif you want to say, of the rows, and\nthe columns, and the overall tables.\n\n392\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.880\nThat's how we can kind of move\nthat around and stretch it on out.\n\n393\n00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.400\nSo that's and that's the entire table,\n\n394\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.275\nversus changing the row height,\nor whoops see?\n\n395\n00:20:51.275 --> 00:20:54.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Tell myself to slow down.\n\n396\n00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.640\nChanging the column width.\n\n397\n00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.520\nBut now you see I changed that.\n\n398\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.380\nNotice that now it's kinda, it's staying\nlike in proportion we wanna say.\n\n399\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Of how I had changed.\n\n400\n00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.225\n&gt;&gt; Selected it.\n\n401\n00:21:04.225 --> 00:21:05.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, and\n\n402\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.530\nmodified those individual elements\nof the whole table, so yeah.\n\n403\n00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:14.500\nWe have the pieces, the cells,\nthe rows, columns, and then the table.\n\n404\n00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.170\n&gt;&gt; So it almost seems like it's\nmaintaining that ratio with that diagonal.\n\n405\n00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.990\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly what it's doing.\n\n406\n00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.180\nSome other things to point out while\nwe're going over our tables in Word.\n\n407\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:29.620\nJust like any graphical element,\nwe have our contextual tabs that come up,\n\n408\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.100\nfor us to be able to change\nthings like the table design.\n\n409\n00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.120\nI kind of showed you that in\nthe PowerPoint presentation.\n\n410\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.550\nWe also have a Layout tab, our Layout\ntab will be things like how to add rows,\n\n411\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.540\nhow to change the direction,\nthe design would be like the borders and\n\n412\n00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.180\nthe shading and the styles,\nand everything like that.\n\n413\n00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.790\nSo we're going to kind of take\nthese in different pieces\n\n414\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.630\nas we go through our different episodes.\n\n415\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.760\nHere are the things that\nI'd like to point out.\n\n416\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.560\nThe shown high character,\nnow that's nothing new.\n\n417\n00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.400\nWe've talked about that through almost\nPretty much all of our episodes.\n\n418\n00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.937\nOf where it's just wasn't\n[INAUDIBLE] characters.\n\n419\n00:22:06.937 --> 00:22:11.610\nThis is my paragraph, but\nnotice the icons that happen in a table.\n\n420\n00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:17.150\ndo you see these little-\n&gt;&gt; Almost like a diamond but not.\n\n421\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.470\n&gt;&gt; It's a square diamond.\n\n422\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.492\nYeah.\nExactly.\n\n423\n00:22:19.492 --> 00:22:21.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're making up more shapes again.\n\n424\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.860\n[LAUGH] These square diamond\ndots come up in each cell.\n\n425\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:32.080\nAnd then there's some squished ones\nover here that indicate the rows.\n\n426\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.840\nSo that's just the character\nthat comes out to show you where\n\n427\n00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.870\nthe boundaries of cell, the rows, and\nthen the dot at the end of the table.\n\n428\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.910\nNow that's just coming up automatically,\nbecause that's just the way it's going.\n\n429\n00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.012\nBut let me zoom back out of here.\n\n430\n00:22:50.012 --> 00:22:58.110\nHow it works within our text,\nif I had a document.\n\n431\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.460\nAnd this is what I'm\ngonna do really quick.\n\n432\n00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.210\nI'm gonna copy this,\nI'm gonna select the whole table.\n\n433\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.640\nNotice I went to the top left-hand corner.\n\n434\n00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.110\nAnd I did a command C right\nthere on my keyboard.\n\n435\n00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:13.280\nI'm going to come over here and I'm going\nto open up a file called Add Graphics.\n\n436\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.690\nI just need to get some text for us to do.\n\n437\n00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.110\nNow if I zoom in here,\n\n438\n00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.240\nI'd like to put the table maybe\nafter this particular paragraph.\n\n439\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.979\nSo I'm going to hit enter paste it, and\n\n440\n00:23:25.979 --> 00:23:30.801\n[SOUND] what's the table end up,\nlook what it, that's a little odd.\n\n441\n00:23:30.801 --> 00:23:32.824\nI wasn't really expecting it to do this.\n\n442\n00:23:32.824 --> 00:23:36.430\nWell, remember, it's a graphical element.\n\n443\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.180\nGraphical elements, like we did with our\nimages, like we did with our sheets.\n\n444\n00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.550\nThis has word wrap on it.\n\n445\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:50.150\nIt has all of those same characteristics\nthat a shape or an image does.\n\n446\n00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.910\nSo you can move this.\n\n447\n00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:56.562\nSee I can independently move this around,\ncuz maybe I do wanna go ahead and\n\n448\n00:23:56.562 --> 00:24:00.027\nput the table over here and\nkinda put it off to the side.\n\n449\n00:24:00.027 --> 00:24:04.561\nCuz This is a graphical representation\nof my data, but what if I really wanted\n\n450\n00:24:04.561 --> 00:24:09.450\nto keep it like right in between\nthe paragraphs and have it not do this.\n\n451\n00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.810\nI have to get in to a doggy, right,\nwe gotta get into that text wrap.\n\n452\n00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.900\nBut this is one with tables,\nit can be a little misleading.\n\n453\n00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.542\nCuz if we come over here to table design,\n\n454\n00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:23.290\nokay I don't see anything\nabout arranging or text wrap.\n\n455\n00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.200\nI come over to lay out,\noaky I see alignment, but\n\n456\n00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.190\nthat's the text alignment within\nthe tables, like the content.\n\n457\n00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.162\nI can't really find it, it's kinda hiding.\n\n458\n00:24:34.162 --> 00:24:39.280\nOkay so that's why I wanna show you,\nyou need to get into the table properties.\n\n459\n00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.270\nNow, your table properties,\nI am on my layout tab,\n\n460\n00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.710\nI got a button right over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n461\n00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:46.241\n&gt;&gt; Mm\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n\n462\n00:24:46.241 --> 00:24:46.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n463\n00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.700\n&gt;&gt; It's hiding, right?\n\n464\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.200\nI get into properties.\n\n465\n00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.960\nThere's the text wrapping, okay.\n\n466\n00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.685\nIt's got a round on it, and\n\n467\n00:24:54.685 --> 00:24:59.935\nI really wouldn't worry about it too much\nabout the alignment for right now because\n\n468\n00:24:59.935 --> 00:25:04.660\nI really just don't want the text to wrap\naround it so I had to get into here.\n\n469\n00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.820\nI had to get into my table properties.\n\n470\n00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.476\nAnd once I choose the none, now okay,\nthat's what well now it's like in.\n\n471\n00:25:12.476 --> 00:25:13.132\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n472\n00:25:13.132 --> 00:25:17.280\n&gt;&gt; It's below the one heading,\nbut then I can take this.\n\n473\n00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.800\nAnd I can move it down into\nthis paragraph, come on.\n\n474\n00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.950\nAnd I can, well let's go over here.\n\n475\n00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.890\nDid it take the wrapping off of it?\n\n476\n00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.720\nWell that's okay,\n\n477\n00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.210\nI'll show you the other way that you\ncan get to the table properties.\n\n478\n00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.330\nYou can right click on this, and\ncome to table properties, and hm,\n\n479\n00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.500\nyou know I bet you.\n\n480\n00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.660\n&gt;&gt; Strange.\n\n481\n00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.340\n&gt;&gt; I think I realized what just happened.\n\n482\n00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.270\nWhen I grabbed it and moved it,\nit automatically flipped it.\n\n483\n00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:40.960\n&gt;&gt; Defaulted back?\n\n484\n00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.430\nThat could get annoying.\n\n485\n00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.660\n&gt;&gt; I'm going with that right for\nright now.\n\n486\n00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but at least we know,\n\n487\n00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.850\nhey don't want it.\n\n488\n00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.420\n&gt;&gt; What do we do if that happens?\n\n489\n00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.465\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, go ahead, okay now I gotta get,\n\n490\n00:25:51.465 --> 00:25:52.290\nnow I'm good.\n\n491\n00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.310\nSo that's kind of\nan interesting one to do.\n\n492\n00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.760\nNow, one other thing that I wanted to\npoint out is right here, I have this.\n\n493\n00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:06.258\nI don't have the wrapping, but\nit's to the left of my page, right?\n\n494\n00:26:06.258 --> 00:26:10.700\nIf I look at this, I wanna center this\nwithin the actual page right there.\n\n495\n00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:17.498\nSo this is what, I've done this, and I've\nfought with this too, so I clicked in to.\n\n496\n00:26:17.498 --> 00:26:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Tried to like, move it over.\n\n497\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, I take this whole table and\nthen I click it okay, theres that but.\n\n498\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.887\nA lot of times what I'll do is\nI'll like select this here, and\n\n499\n00:26:27.887 --> 00:26:29.800\ntry to center it, but what did I just do?\n\n500\n00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.380\n&gt;&gt; Center within the table.\n\n501\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the text centered it, so\nit looks like I've selected all the cells.\n\n502\n00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.380\nBut, notice what I did, and I didn't\nreally point it out too well for you guys,\n\n503\n00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.398\nis this.\n\n504\n00:26:41.398 --> 00:26:42.510\nI click, hold, and drag and\n\n505\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:47.400\nI selected all the text in the cells,\nand then centered it.\n\n506\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.450\nNow, I need to make sure\nI select the whole table.\n\n507\n00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.350\nThis, and really quick,\ndo you see here how it's not highlighted?\n\n508\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.190\nWatch when I click this button\nup at the top left hand corner.\n\n509\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.700\nDo you see how now outside is highlighted?\n\n510\n00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a slight difference,\nbut I see it.\n\n511\n00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Now I have the whole table selected,\nnot all of the cells in the table.\n\n512\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.840\nAgain, really strange nuances but now with\nthis that's how I have to center the whole\n\n513\n00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.790\ntable within the parameters of the page,\nand really the margins.\n\n514\n00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.850\nSo, some kind of weird things with that.\n\n515\n00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.580\nAnd then just one last thing.\n\n516\n00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.040\nBack on here,\nthis is another one where, all right,\n\n517\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.130\nnotice in this one I have\nSelect-Mouse cursors.\n\n518\n00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.690\nEnter, Enter, Enter, Enter.\n\n519\n00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.190\nI have this table.\n\n520\n00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.670\nSo, I think all right let\nme get to the end here.\n\n521\n00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.670\nNow, look at where my cursor is.\n\n522\n00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:44.400\nYou see my cursor is not\noutside of the table.\n\n523\n00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.620\nSo, people get to here and try to Enter,\nand they're like wait, nope, wait, what?\n\n524\n00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.690\nNo, how can I,\nI can't get out of the table.\n\n525\n00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:59.480\nThat's because the table,\nit's gone back to that text wrapping.\n\n526\n00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.312\nIt doesn't have any wrapping so\nyou can move this anywhere.\n\n527\n00:28:04.312 --> 00:28:09.350\nSo, a lot of people come back out\nto here and hit all these Enters.\n\n528\n00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:15.400\nNo, that's not how you get around\nthe table, try to avoid doing that.\n\n529\n00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.440\nYou wanna just go back to where we\nwent before into the table properties.\n\n530\n00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.980\nChange it to a none text wrapping,\nand then do you see how I can get that\n\n531\n00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.130\nparagraph after, and\nI can go ahead and continue on.\n\n532\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Not dependent on those false\nformatting with those Enters there.\n\n533\n00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah, and that's why,\n\n534\n00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:43.538\nkeeping the show on high,\nunderstanding what all this means.\n\n535\n00:28:43.538 --> 00:28:47.372\nIt's got text wrap on it,\nI want it to act like a regular character,\n\n536\n00:28:47.372 --> 00:28:49.410\nif you wanna say, or regular word.\n\n537\n00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.490\nSo I wanna take the text wrapping off.\n\n538\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.760\nAnd then I can get to where I can\nhit Enter and get below that table.\n\n539\n00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.860\n&gt;&gt; And this was in a blank document\nwhere there was nothing after it.\n\n540\n00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.730\nWhen we had this one\nthere was already text so\n\n541\n00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.200\nit worked a little bit differently,\nso just those different things.\n\n542\n00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.650\nAnd I hope that this introduction\nhas just kind of taken the time for\n\n543\n00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.380\nyou to slow down, watch what I've done.\n\n544\n00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.360\nYou saw I even got tripped up a couple of\ntimes with clicking on the wrong thing.\n\n545\n00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.010\nLike no, I didn't want to change the\ncolumn width, or no I wanted to select it.\n\n546\n00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.780\nSo lots of different nuances of\nthe mouse cursors and how it all works.\n\n547\n00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.340\nSo, I hope that's a great introduction for\n\n548\n00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.620\nyou and now we'll get into the next\nepisode, how to create tables.\n\n549\n00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.580\nAnd then, after that, we're gonna format.\n\n550\n00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, well I think that was like\nthe closest thing I've had to meditation\n\n551\n00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.358\nin quite some time.\n\n552\n00:29:37.358 --> 00:29:38.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.175\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Vonne,

way.\n\n556\n00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.450\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n557\n00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.920\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n558\n00:29:46.920 -->

Advanced for Mac series.\n\n4\n00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.210\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.980\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at tables, but\n\n6\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.490\nspecifically we'll be taking a look\nat how to create and lay them out.\n\n7\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.310\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mrs. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.240\nThank you for\njoining us today Vonne, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.140\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, and in the last show\nyou kind of broke it on down for us.\n\n11\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.400\nYou told us what a table was,\nwhat the terminology associated with that.\n\n12\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.935\nYou even explained where we should\nput our clicker, our mouse cursor.\n\n13\n00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.780\n[LAUGH] So\na lot of good pointers there, but\n\n14\n00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.040\nwhere are we gonna begin for this show?\n\n15\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.040\n&gt;&gt; Now we're going to create what we saw.\n\n16\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.450\nWe already had a table in the document.\n\n17\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.940\nAnd yes, we were going over, didn't we\ndo the square diamond dots or something?\n\n18\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.106\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, making up all those little things\n\n20\n00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:00.080\nthat we saw there.\n\n21\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.840\nAnd the mouse cursor icons, which are so\nincredibly important to understand\n\n22\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840\nwhere you're clicking to get\nto where you need to go.\n\n23\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.340\nAnd so this is like,\nwhere do we click to insert the table?\n\n24\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.150\nWell, that's where we're gonna start, and\n\n25\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.420\nthen we'll start doing things like\nchanging the layout of adding and\n\n26\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.980\ndeleting columns, merging cells,\nchanging alignment.\n\n27\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.920\nEverything on that layout contextual\ntab once we put in the table.\n\n28\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.180\nSo why don't we get on down in here and\nget started?\n\n29\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.460\nSo I have just a blank document so we can\njust have a nice clean piece of paper.\n\n30\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.180\nIf we're going to insert a table,\nwhat tab do you think we're gonna go to?\n\n31\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.350\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know, insert.\n\n32\n00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.556\n&gt;&gt; Yay, ding, ding, ding, gold star.\n\n33\n00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:47.080\n[LAUGH] Exactly, we're gonna go ahead and\ninsert our table.\n\n34\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.090\nAnd we can go to here.\n\n35\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.060\nI guess I could say,\nyou could come over to the table menu, and\n\n36\n00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.410\nthere are some things in here\nthat we're going to be doing.\n\n37\n00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.660\nBut I'm gonna pretty much avoid\nthe menu in most of these episodes.\n\n38\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.000\nAnd I might throw it in\nthere once in a while.\n\n39\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.510\nBut just like in any of your Office for\n\n40\n00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.300\nMac products, you still have that menu,\nthat kinda legacy menu that I still love.\n\n41\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthat's why you're kind of shifting\n\n42\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.130\naway from that because I\ndidn't know that was legacy.\n\n43\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.510\nThat's why you prefer to show other ways?\n\n44\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.819\n&gt;&gt; I'm just calling it legacy.\n\n45\n00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.910\nIt's more of, you remember\nbecause they went to the ribbon.\n\n46\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.280\nAnd they got rid of all the menus.\n\n47\n00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.250\nLike you never had a File\nmenu in Office 4 PC.\n\n48\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.270\nYou don't go to File, New.\n\n49\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.010\nIt's that backstage view.\n\n50\n00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.960\nYou go to the tab.\n\n51\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.420\n&gt;&gt; You're talking to the on, you know\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so they don't really have,\n\n53\n00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.785\nI call them the old school menus.\n\n54\n00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:47.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it has the ribbon,\n\n55\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.910\nwhich we've really concentrating on.\n\n56\n00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.380\nBut it also has the menus there.\n\n57\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I remember,\nthere was no ribbon at that point in time.\n\n58\n00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.760\nSo that's why I'm calling it legacy.\n\n60\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.030\nI don't know, I just call them menus, so-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n61\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're gonna\n\n62\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.110\ncome over here to our Insert tab on our\nribbon, and we will go to Insert Table.\n\n63\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.770\nAnd I got this big grid going on here.\n\n64\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.480\nAs of now we have to\ndetermine how many rows and\n\n65\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.550\nhow many columns do we want in our table.\n\n66\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.550\nNow we're going to,\n\n67\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.090\nmaybe will try to recreate some of\nthe cat activity table that we had.\n\n68\n00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.350\nSo, have a get activity,\nwe had two cats so that was three columns.\n\n69\n00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.830\nI'm gonna purposely go\nwith just two columns.\n\n70\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.760\nSo we can get into the whole add and\ndelete and everything.\n\n71\n00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\nOkay.\n\n72\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.360\n&gt;&gt; But notice how when I hover my\nmouse over the different squares,\n\n73\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.190\nit's showing me like I'm\ndoing a four by five or\n\n74\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.140\na three by four,\nmeaning three columns, four rows.\n\n75\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Like a live preview there\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n76\n00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.650\nThe other thing in a PC,\nyou're actually seeing it on the page.\n\n77\n00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay, populating as you go.\n\n78\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of the live preview\nstuff that Office for PC shows.\n\n79\n00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.020\nYou don't really see that in Mac.\n\n80\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.830\nIt's not going to show you\nthe changing of the fonts and sizes.\n\n81\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.710\nIt just doesn't do that unfortunately.\n\n82\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.370\nBut we have up at the top\nwhere it's telling us\n\n83\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.490\nthat we'll insert a two by two table.\n\n84\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.430\nOnce I click on that\nlast square in that grid,\n\n85\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.070\nit then inserts that particular table.\n\n86\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.680\nNow I do have the show high characters on.\n\n87\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.040\nSo that's why you are seeing all those\ndiamond dot things that we are deserving.\n\n88\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.230\nSo I am going to turn those off for now.\n\n89\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.900\nJust to, because they can get a little\ndistracting in the tables for\n\n90\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.090\nme personally.\n\n91\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.770\nBut they do exist and I want you to know.\n\n92\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.530\nSo I have my table.\n\n93\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.450\nWe got our contextual tabs up.\n\n94\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.040\nGot my flashing cursor in here,\n\n95\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.900\nand this is where we can\nstart adding in our content.\n\n96\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.280\nBut let's go ahead and start getting\ninto adding and deleting rows first,\n\n97\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.710\nto get our table into the way we want\nto put the activity, Fuego and Bishop.\n\n98\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.710\nSo we need another column.\n\n99\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.640\nYou can come over here to the layout tab,\nand\n\n100\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.260\nnotice you have some buttons of the insert\nabove or below, that would be for rows.\n\n101\n00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.180\nAnd then you also have like insert columns\nto the left, or columns to the right.\n\n102\n00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.170\nWhat we find with using\nthose buttons on the ribbon,\n\n103\n00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.310\nyou can also do a lot of\nthings with right clicking.\n\n104\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.210\nAnd I tend to right click\nmore in a table than I do\n\n105\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.660\nin like a lot of other things just that\nkind of habit of which way I wanna go.\n\n106\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.310\nSo I've tender like I click a bit more,\nbut when you're going to be answering\n\n107\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.210\nrows and columns, or deleting rows and\ncolumns, what you think it's all about?\n\n108\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.130\nWhere your mouse cursor is,\nlike where am I, and\n\n109\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.760\nthen that's where it's going to be\ninserting to the left, or two the right.\n\n110\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.940\nSo if I'm here and\nI go to insert a column to the right,\n\n111\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.820\nat this point it doesn't really matter\ncuz it's gonna just make three and\n\n112\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.840\nI don't have any content in there.\n\n113\n00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.770\nSo I'm just gonna go to the right, and\nthen it adds a column to the right.\n\n114\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.540\nCool.\n\n115\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.330\nWhat about if I want it to\ninsert to insert another column?\n\n116\n00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.510\nIf I go over here and\nlet's say insert it to the left.\n\n117\n00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.940\nYou can see where it highlighted.\n\n118\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.270\nSee my cursor was in that last column,\nso it inserted to the left.\n\n119\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.310\nBut now you know what,\nI didn't really need a fourth column.\n\n120\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.370\nNow I'm at a point where I\nneed to delete something.\n\n121\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.620\nIf I want to delete that column,\nwhere's my mouse cursor?\n\n122\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.700\nI have to be in this column.\n\n123\n00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.030\nAnd if I go, I don't have to go to this\ncolumn but just know if you have a test.\n\n124\n00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.820\n&gt;&gt; So, if all of you want to select.\n\n125\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n126\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.730\nSo, I come into here and\nif I go to delete columns,\n\n127\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.350\ndelete that particular column\nwhere my cursor lives.\n\n128\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.840\nCool.\n\n129\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.950\nLet's get some text in here so\nat least we can start\n\n130\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.620\nreally showing where the rows and\ncolumns are going to be adding.\n\n131\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.820\nLet's talk about activity.\n\n132\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.740\nActivity, yeah, that works.\n\n133\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:59.410\nAnd then we'll say Mr.\nFuegopants and Mr. Bishop, Timothy.\n\n134\n00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.120\nDon't hit Enter, but why?\n\n135\n00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.990\nCuz I feel like it's a natural occurrence.\n\n136\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.740\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n137\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI want to get down to the next row, right?\n\n138\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.410\n&gt;&gt; I would too, yep.\n\n139\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.659\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's see what happens.\n\n140\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.810\nThat didn't work did it?\n\n141\n00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.640\nAnd I will turn on the show and hide for\n\n142\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.410\nthis one because you just\na paragraph in that cell.\n\n143\n00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.430\nThat get you down and\n\n144\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.190\nthis will also trip you up sometimes\nI've had it where people do this.\n\n145\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.330\nThey have two enters in there and\nI'm kind of\n\n146\n00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.730\njumping a little bit ahead where\nwe're gonna change the column height.\n\n147\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.095\nWhere they're like,\nI can't make any, why won't it go?\n\n148\n00:07:37.095 --> 00:07:38.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, I see.\n\n149\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.920\nYes.\n\n150\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.290\n&gt;&gt; Because they probably don't see it,\ncuz they have the show and hides off.\n\n151\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.690\nAnd they're like, there's all this extra\nspace, it won't let me change the height.\n\n152\n00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.780\nWell, it can't go any-\n&gt;&gt; Shorter, yeah,\n\n153\n00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.980\nI was gonna say less high [LAUGH].\n\n154\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.932\nBecause it's like no,\nthere's a paragraph in there.\n\n155\n00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:54.683\nI can't squash that thing.\n\n156\n00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:58.983\nSo it's forcing me to keep this.\n\n157\n00:07:58.983 --> 00:08:04.267\nThat's why I come in here, no I don't want\nthat paragraph, so let's go ahead and\n\n158\n00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:08.574\nforward delete that with our\nfunction delete on our Mac keyboard?\n\n159\n00:08:08.574 --> 00:08:09.430\n&gt;&gt; Laptop?\n\n160\n00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just cuz you have insert and\ndelete on a full size keyboard.\n\n161\n00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:13.950\n&gt;&gt; Got you, got you.\n\n162\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.289\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you probably actually have a,\ncuz you have a nice big one.\n\n163\n00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:17.140\n&gt;&gt; It's massive.\n\n164\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.137\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; People make fun of me all the time,\n\n165\n00:08:19.137 --> 00:08:20.773\nbut I have a giant computer over here.\n\n166\n00:08:20.773 --> 00:08:22.399\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like a big old brick.\n\n167\n00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:27.140\n[LAUGH] But\nhers is way more powerful than mine.\n\n168\n00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.960\n[LAUGH] She got like a ton of RAM in hers.\n\n169\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.860\nNot in this little guy.\n\n170\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:37.426\nBut yeah, so that's what why I was saying\non the laptop usually the function and\n\n171\n00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:43.420\nthe delete key or sometimes the control\ndelete does the forward delete.\n\n172\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.427\nAnd it's a Mac keyboard, so\nyou don't have a backspace.\n\n173\n00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:47.802\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's almost like another language for\n\n174\n00:08:47.802 --> 00:08:48.430\nme over there.\n\n175\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.329\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of those little nuances.\n\n176\n00:08:52.329 --> 00:08:53.182\n&gt;&gt; I do it when I have to.\n\n177\n00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:53.911\nThat's about it.\n\n178\n00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:56.108\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nice,\n\n179\n00:08:56.108 --> 00:08:58.639\nnow that I've gotten rid\nof all of those paragraphs.\n\n180\n00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:02.534\nAnd coming back to, I really wanted\nto get down into the next row.\n\n181\n00:09:02.534 --> 00:09:03.466\nNo, you can take your mouse.\n\n182\n00:09:03.466 --> 00:09:06.010\nYeah, you can go ahead and take your\nmouse and click your mouse there.\n\n183\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.790\nBut let's stay on the keyboard.\n\n184\n00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:13.854\nIf you enter the tab key, do you see how\nthat cycles me down to the next row?\n\n185\n00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:17.380\nOkay, cool, so\nnow I could say what's my next activity.\n\n186\n00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.229\nWe're gonna go ahead, they sleep a lot.\n\n187\n00:09:20.229 --> 00:09:22.030\nHow do I get one cell to the right?\n\n188\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.530\nI don't even think I even said this\nwhen I was typing in Fuego and\n\n189\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.460\nBishop, hit the Tab key.\n\n190\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n191\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.550\nso Tab takes you one cell to the right.\n\n192\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.472\n&gt;&gt; Just like a lot of forms and fields.\n\n193\n00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:38.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and lists, right,\nso if you wanna tab in.\n\n194\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.539\nSo we've got, Fuego sleeps a lot,\nwe're just gonna say 16 hours.\n\n195\n00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:43.962\nTab to get over to the next one.\n\n196\n00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:46.520\nBishop sleeps a little less.\n\n197\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.657\nNow I've gotten to the end of where\nI don't have any rows, right?\n\n198\n00:09:49.657 --> 00:09:50.800\nThat's okay.\n\n199\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.544\nWhen you're in the end of the table, and\n\n200\n00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:55.374\nhit the Tab key it's going to\nautomatically make a new row.\n\n201\n00:09:55.374 --> 00:09:58.761\nCool, so I don't really have to\ngo into doing the insert below,\n\n202\n00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:00.800\njust hit the Tab and keep going.\n\n203\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.830\nSo they like to eat.\n\n204\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.890\nFuego likes to eat at a lot.\n\n205\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.450\nBishop not so much, that's why he's the,\nwe call him the pencil.\n\n206\n00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.010\nHe's the pencil cat.\n\n207\n00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.621\nAnd Fuego's the sausage.\n\n208\n00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:10.850\n[LAUGH] So we've got that.\n\n209\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.020\nSo you can keep on going and\nhitting the Tab and the end and\n\n210\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.570\nwe'll just do just a few more,\nand perfect.\n\n211\n00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.790\nCool, so I know that my Tab is at,\nto get to the left,\n\n212\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.920\nI wasn't really wanting\nthe Fuego to have play 2 hours.\n\n213\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.703\nIt was supposed to be 4 hours.\n\n214\n00:10:29.703 --> 00:10:31.520\nUse my mouse, use your Shift+Tab.\n\n215\n00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.410\nIf you hold your Shift and\nclick the Tab, it takes you back.\n\n216\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.944\nAnd then I can just type in number 4.\n\n217\n00:10:36.944 --> 00:10:40.392\nSo if I Shift+Tab, Shift+Tab,\nyou see how it's like highlighting,\n\n218\n00:10:40.392 --> 00:10:41.990\nit's going backward.\n\n219\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.680\nAnd if I Tab, Tab, Tab, Tab.\n\n220\n00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.284\nSo Tab and Shift+Tab, a little bit\nof cool ways to get you around.\n\n221\n00:10:48.284 --> 00:10:52.290\n&gt;&gt; Does Shift-Tab work on those\nother fields and forms, too?\n\n222\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.278\nI mean,\nwe tried them on like other sites and\n\n223\n00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.383\nstuff-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n224\n00:10:54.383 --> 00:10:55.149\nDefinitely.\n\n225\n00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:55.662\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n226\n00:10:55.662 --> 00:10:56.396\nYay!\n\n227\n00:10:56.396 --> 00:10:58.010\n&gt;&gt; Works very nice.\n\n228\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.873\nYay, there you go.\n\n229\n00:10:59.873 --> 00:11:01.956\nIt's always the little things!\n\n230\n00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:03.800\n[LAUGH] So I need to come back up here.\n\n231\n00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.880\nI put my cursor into the activity,\nbecause I don't have my top cell,\n\n232\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.760\nthe one that I wanted to say activity,\ncat activity.\n\n233\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.440\nSo this is the point where I put my\ncursor into this particular cell.\n\n234\n00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.190\nI'm going to right-click, go to Insert,\nbecause I'm want a row above.\n\n235\n00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.810\nSo you could still go ahead and add rows\nbelow, because, yeah, I'm at the end, and\n\n236\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.960\nI'm hitting the Tab key, and\nit's making it automatically.\n\n237\n00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.784\nThat doesn't always mean that that's\nwhere you want to insert a row.\n\n238\n00:11:31.784 --> 00:11:33.040\nYou might be in the middle.\n\n239\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.650\nSo it's just knowing that you can\nright-click based on where your cursor is.\n\n240\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.560\nAnd I'm gonna go with rows above and\nit makes the row above.\n\n241\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.860\n&gt;&gt; And it's kind of interesting,\nyou've said, you have the mouse, but\n\n242\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.850\njust in case, and so\nI know in more technical aspects,\n\n243\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.330\nif I'm in a server closet, a lot of\ntimes they don't have a mouse attached,\n\n244\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.760\nbecause you're not normally doing that.\n\n245\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.030\nSo you have to use keyboard shortcuts and\nstuff, but\n\n246\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.410\nat least you have that option here, also.\n\n247\n00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.360\nIn case for, I don't know,\nwhatever reason that may be,\n\n248\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.080\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n249\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.430\nit's just other ways of doing things.\n\n250\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:13.310\nIt's like, yeah, instead of using a mouse,\nthe Shift+Tab, the tabs and being able,\n\n251\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.320\nthere's all sorts of shortcuts,\nlike select the whole table, and so on.\n\n252\n00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.120\nAnd you start to memorize\nthem the more you use them.\n\n253\n00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.550\nBut yeah, I tend to always go\nwith the right-clicking, too.\n\n254\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.580\nI don't know why.\n\n255\n00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.010\nJust the tables always do it for me.\n\n256\n00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.530\nAll right,\nlet's move on to a few other things.\n\n257\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.520\nWe know about adding and deleting.\n\n258\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.290\nWe know it's all about the cursor.\n\n259\n00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.120\nHow about merging cells?\n\n260\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.749\nI would like all of these\ncells to be merged across.\n\n261\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.680\nFirst thing is, you gotta select\nthe cells that you want to become one.\n\n262\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.420\nSo let's go ahead and\nselect all these across.\n\n263\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.875\nAnd where is my merge cells?\n\n264\n00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:51.490\nYeah, you can right-click right there,\nand you can go to merge cells.\n\n265\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.680\nSo let's come over that way out tab\njust to mix it up a little bit.\n\n266\n00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.630\nThere is the merge cells button, and\nnotice that the little diamond dot\n\n267\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.770\nthings are going to all become one and\nso now this is one whole cell.\n\n268\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:08.381\nCool, and then I can go ahead and click my\nI-beam in there and type in Cat Activity.\n\n269\n00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:12.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's a lot what they do.\n\n270\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.610\nThey don't do much except\nannoy me sometimes.\n\n271\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.930\nSo [LAUGH] let's change some\nrow heights and column widths.\n\n272\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.840\nYou probably saw me if you\nwatched the introduction,\n\n273\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.990\nyou saw me doing a little bit.\n\n274\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.732\nIt's all about the mouse cursor,\ngetting the lines and two arrows.\n\n275\n00:13:27.732 --> 00:13:31.600\nLet's click and drag this down and\nmake this a little higher.\n\n276\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.130\nAnd maybe we'll take this column and\n\n277\n00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:39.150\nwe'll make this a little less wide, but\nnotice something with your columns.\n\n278\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.570\nSee where I'm changing in\nbetween the activity and Fuego.\n\n279\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:47.000\nIt's moving this here,\nit's making this one less wide.\n\n280\n00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.500\nBut this one's getting a lot wider,\n\n281\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.820\nand it's not really moving\nthe edge of the table.\n\n282\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.860\nBut I come here, see here?\n\n283\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.140\nNotice, doesn't change this.\n\n284\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.830\nIt's all staying within the boundaries of\nwhat you have determined as your table.\n\n285\n00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.880\nBut if I wanted to move this,\nbut then also keep\n\n286\n00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:14.610\nthe size of the table kind of proportioned\nto it, let me show you what I mean.\n\n287\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.980\nI'm gonna hold your Shift key.\n\n288\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.340\nIf I hold the Shift key, get that same\nicon and then drag to see how it, look,\n\n289\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.350\nthe overall size,\nthe table is changing as well.\n\n290\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.700\nAnd that was something\nthat always bothered me,\n\n291\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.924\nbecause I really just wanted to\nkind of get everything to be small.\n\n292\n00:14:30.924 --> 00:14:32.176\nSo I start moving one column, and\n\n293\n00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.110\nthen I have to get every\nsingle column to move over.\n\n294\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.710\nSo holding this Shift key, and\nthen the same way in reverse,\n\n295\n00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.180\nyou see it's going to go ahead and\nchange that there.\n\n296\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.520\nSo that's a pretty cool\nlittle thing that you can do\n\n297\n00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.950\nwith holding your Shift key down to\nkeep the overall size of the table.\n\n298\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:52.489\nNow the row height, it doesn't really\nhave that as much, because if you change\n\n299\n00:14:52.489 --> 00:14:57.265\nthe row height, you're going to have to\nmove the height of the overall table down.\n\n300\n00:14:57.265 --> 00:14:59.200\nIt just doesn't work that way.\n\n301\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.840\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nchange some of those.\n\n302\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.170\nWe get our icons.\n\n303\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.435\nAnd we know how to do that.\n\n304\n00:15:04.435 --> 00:15:11.660\nBut sometimes it's not as easy\nnecessarily to know exactly\n\n305\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:17.730\nhow much of a height or width you're\nputting on one of your rows and columns.\n\n306\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.670\nSo coming up here to your layout tab,\nand going into your cell size,\n\n307\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.107\nthat can kind of help you in that.\n\n308\n00:15:25.107 --> 00:15:27.440\nAnd there's also something\nknown as your auto fit.\n\n309\n00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.850\nLet's do that.\n\n310\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.740\nLet's go in to your auto fit options,\nbecause this is something,\n\n311\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.650\nif you're familiar with Excel.\n\n312\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.260\nIf you had your columns,\n\n313\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.720\nif you go up in between your column\nheadings at between column A and B.\n\n314\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.464\nIf you double click in between those,\nit will automatically resize that\n\n315\n00:15:46.464 --> 00:15:50.440\ncolumn to be as wide as the largest\nvalue within that column.\n\n316\n00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.453\nWe have the same thing with columns and\ntables.\n\n317\n00:15:53.453 --> 00:16:00.460\nSo if I come into here and double click,\nI did the wrong place of double clicking.\n\n318\n00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.786\nThere we go,\nthat's what I was trying to do.\n\n319\n00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:05.007\nDo you see how it automatically, click,\n\n320\n00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:09.800\nclick, it automatically changes\nthe size of that whole row.\n\n321\n00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.000\nSorry, column, based on the largest value.\n\n322\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.580\nSo that can be kind of neat.\n\n323\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.620\nBut you could also have\ndone that from here.\n\n324\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.100\nYou see, instead of me double-clicking\nthroughout the whole thing,\n\n325\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.270\ndo you see how I have\nthis autofit contents?\n\n326\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.033\nAn autofit window.\n\n327\n00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:26.380\nLet's see what they do.\n\n328\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.430\nNow notice, I don't have\nanything selected, by the way.\n\n329\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.390\nI'm just putting my cursor\nsomewhere in the table.\n\n330\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.030\nI go to autofit window,\nneat, look at what it does.\n\n331\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:41.630\nIt takes the whole table and stretches\nit across to the edges of the margins,\n\n332\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.560\nthe whole page that you live in.\n\n333\n00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.900\nAnd that's another one that, I really\njust wanted it to fit everything, and\n\n334\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.240\nit was like the,\nit took me a while to find that button.\n\n335\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.540\nAnd I'm like, okay, that's nice.\n\n336\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.370\nSo if I go to autofit contents, that did\nexactly what I just did with the double\n\n337\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.700\nclicking, it just did it\nall on one fell swoop.\n\n338\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n339\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.801\n&gt;&gt; Little bit easier there.\n\n340\n00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:04.601\n&gt;&gt; A lot easier.\n\n341\n00:17:04.601 --> 00:17:05.241\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n342\n00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:08.834\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you, like exponentially,\nif you have a lot of rows or\n\n343\n00:17:08.834 --> 00:17:12.145\ncolumns, or you want it to really\njust tighten it up quickly.\n\n344\n00:17:12.145 --> 00:17:14.390\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nAnd all of these,\n\n345\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.380\nI tend to I sometimes forget that these\nlive here, so this is a lot easier if\n\n346\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.090\nI just come in here with my cursor,\nI have my cursor in the fuego column.\n\n347\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.840\nAnd I have my whip and\nif I just start like bumping this up,\n\n348\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.960\nI have to get to a point\nwhere it's going to, wait,\n\n349\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.570\nyou know what, let's go ahead and\ngo with, well, okay.\n\n350\n00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.340\nYou don't, okay.\n\n351\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.753\nLet's go ahead and\nselect that whole column first.\n\n352\n00:17:38.753 --> 00:17:40.550\nAnd then, this is, okay, let me back up,\n\n353\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:46.640\nI know why this is not behaving\nas much as I want it to be.\n\n354\n00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.640\nThat merged cell is kinda\nthrowing things off.\n\n355\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.840\n&gt;&gt; Making it wonky at the top.\n\n356\n00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.644\nI saw that when you shrunk it and it was a\nlittle bit longer and then it got shorter.\n\n357\n00:17:55.644 --> 00:17:56.736\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n358\n00:17:56.736 --> 00:17:59.750\nThis is one of those things, it happens.\n\n359\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.520\nAnd it's happening to me now.\n\n360\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.350\nSo what I would do if I, yeah I know\nthat I wanna have that cell merged.\n\n361\n00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:12.700\nWhat I'd do is I would unmerge it to\nbegin with, and then come back later,\n\n362\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.590\nand the get to where everything needs\nbe and then I'll merge it last.\n\n363\n00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.885\nSo I'm glad I did this, honestly.\n\n364\n00:18:18.885 --> 00:18:20.957\n[LAUGH] Because it reminds me of,\n\n365\n00:18:20.957 --> 00:18:24.266\nyou really kind of try to\nkeep that towards the end.\n\n366\n00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:28.041\nCuz it does kinda throw off some of\nthese width and height things, so\n\n367\n00:18:28.041 --> 00:18:31.900\nif I can merge a cell, you can actually\nunmerge it or you can split it.\n\n368\n00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.490\nTo make it easier on myself, personally,\nI'm just going to delete the whole row.\n\n369\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:38.005\n&gt;&gt; I knew it.\n\n370\n00:18:38.005 --> 00:18:41.131\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I'll come back and\nadd it back in later,\n\n371\n00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:42.220\nso-\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n372\n00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Cursor here,\ndelete the row, there we go.\n\n373\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.680\nNow, what I was trying to do,\nthat's what I was trying to do.\n\n374\n00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.600\nYou see with my cursor in that column,\nI could go ahead and bump this up, or\n\n375\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.950\nI can also bump up that height.\n\n376\n00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.490\nYou can also physically type in\nthe values that you want to have, and\n\n377\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.468\nnotice that it is doing it for\nthe entire column.\n\n378\n00:19:02.468 --> 00:19:08.140\nBe careful, ,just like how that merged\ncell can get you a little off in this,\n\n379\n00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.510\nwatch what happens if I do this.\n\n380\n00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.010\nIf I'm here and I select this one cell,\njust the cell, and\n\n381\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.270\nI start changing the width.\n\n382\n00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.440\nWait a second, see how it's kind\nof doing some weird things?\n\n383\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.330\nIt's changing the width of just that\none cell, and it's changing the row.\n\n384\n00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.880\nAnd now it's like, it's all kind of off.\n\n385\n00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.850\nYou want to try to avoid this.\n\n386\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:35.130\nYou don't want to have a single\ncell selected when you're changing.\n\n387\n00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.410\nI'm just doing my undo right now.\n\n388\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.188\nWhen you're changing the width and\nthe height base in these fields.\n\n389\n00:19:41.188 --> 00:19:45.460\nTry and just keep a single\nflashing cursor in that row or\n\n390\n00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.638\ncolumn, and then it will go ahead and\ndo all of them.\n\n391\n00:19:47.638 --> 00:19:49.611\nA lot easier.\n\n392\n00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:53.173\nI'm gonna take this and just extend\nthe whole edge of the table out,\n\n393\n00:19:53.173 --> 00:19:57.380\nbecause there's also a distribute\ncolumns and distribute width.\n\n394\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.500\nLittle bit easier to say,\nhey, just make them all even.\n\n395\n00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.330\nJust click that button.\n\n396\n00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.406\nMove, there we go,\neverybody has the same width,\n\n397\n00:20:05.406 --> 00:20:09.200\nand also distribute the rows there, too.\n\n398\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.380\nMaybe you want all the rows just to be\na little bit higher, select whole table,\n\n399\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.708\ncome to the upper left-hand corner,\nbump up the height a little bit,\n\n400\n00:20:16.708 --> 00:20:19.650\nlooks pretty nice.\n\n401\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:24.360\nI wanted a little bit more room,\nbut now, all the text, do see how?\n\n402\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.128\n&gt;&gt; It's aligned to the top?\n\n403\n00:20:25.128 --> 00:20:26.058\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n404\n00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.056\nI don't like that.\n\n405\n00:20:27.056 --> 00:20:31.240\n[LAUGH] I need to change\nthe vertical alignment.\n\n406\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.410\nI am gonna go ahead and select the whole\ntable because I want all of the cells\n\n407\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.390\nin the table to have the same alignment\nthat we're going to talk about, and\n\n408\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.208\nthat's over here on these buttons.\n\n409\n00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:48.437\nNotice that this, in the icons, you can\nsee, this is going to be like top left,\n\n410\n00:20:48.437 --> 00:20:53.810\ntop, well, I'll just say, aligned top\ncenter, right, and so on and so forth.\n\n411\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.690\nIf I wanted to change that, you just go\nahead and start clicking the buttons.\n\n412\n00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.000\nI personally would probably want\nthem to be aligned center center\n\n413\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.660\nI like the way that looks.\n\n414\n00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.520\nBut maybe I want to just have these cells.\n\n415\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.580\nSo notice, I just took my I-beam cursor,\n\n416\n00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.350\nselected down these rows,\nor columns, sorry.\n\n417\n00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.090\nAnd maybe I want those\naligned to the left.\n\n418\n00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:17.520\nSo you can change the text alignment,\ndepending on how you want it to look.\n\n419\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.250\nDo notice that with it,\nthat's selected or highlighted,\n\n420\n00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.440\nyou see that kinda white space around it?\n\n421\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.430\nThose are those cell margins\nthat we were talking about.\n\n422\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.750\nMaybe I wanna change that.\n\n423\n00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:33.380\nNow, because of the columns, sorry,\nthe row height changing the margins\n\n424\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.280\nhere might not be too big of a deal,\nbecause I have so much space in it.\n\n425\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.780\nBut it is gonna demonstrate\na point that I wanna make.\n\n426\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.900\nNotice that I have just\nthese cells selected.\n\n427\n00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:51.010\nI come over to my cell margins, and\nI'm gonna say, okay, let's go ahead and\n\n428\n00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:57.410\nchange this to have maybe a .01 all\naround, so that's just a tiny little bit.\n\n429\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.540\nWatch what's gonna happen\nto the whole thing.\n\n430\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.782\nIf I click OK, that didn't\nreally change anything [LAUGH].\n\n431\n00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:08.170\nLet's make a much better, a bigger change.\n\n432\n00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:13.010\nHalf an inch on everything,\nnow, let's change that.\n\n433\n00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.490\nOkay, that's what I was\ntrying to demonstrate.\n\n434\n00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.080\n&gt;&gt; It didn't just change that column.\n\n435\n00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.916\n&gt;&gt; It did\n&gt;&gt; Everything.\n\n436\n00:22:19.916 --> 00:22:21.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n437\n00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.890\n&gt;&gt; Because-\n\n438\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.130\n&gt;&gt; We're filling out each other's words.\n\n439\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:23.695\nI like this.\n\n440\n00:22:23.695 --> 00:22:25.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now if we could only do it for\n\n441\n00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.095\nthe rest of the show.\n\n442\n00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:28.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, let's see.\n\n443\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.115\nYeah, that might get a little weird.\n\n444\n00:22:31.115 --> 00:22:32.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n445\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.320\n&gt;&gt; But know what, you're right, cuz,\nand I wanted to demonstrate it.\n\n446\n00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.220\nAlways change the margins for\nall of your cells.\n\n447\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.190\nYou can't isolate or\n\n448\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:44.910\njust change the margins for one cell or\none column differently than all of it.\n\n449\n00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.470\nIt's the whole thing.\n\n450\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.620\nThe alignments, and yeah,\nI could change the width and\n\n451\n00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.370\nheight, which is still a little weird.\n\n452\n00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.199\nYou can't do it with cell margins.\n\n453\n00:22:55.482 --> 00:23:00.775\nI'm gonna undo that, just to kinda\nget us back to where we were before.\n\n454\n00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:03.880\nLet's just talk about text direction.\n\n455\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.040\nI want to change the orientation\nof the text within here.\n\n456\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.595\nI've just selected the text.\n\n457\n00:23:09.595 --> 00:23:11.905\nNotice we have our direction here.\n\n458\n00:23:11.905 --> 00:23:16.315\nAnd you just kind of keep clicking it,\nall the way around to change that.\n\n459\n00:23:16.315 --> 00:23:19.735\nAnd that's where I could\ndo something fun like, hey,\n\n460\n00:23:19.735 --> 00:23:22.297\nlet's insert a column to the left.\n\n461\n00:23:22.297 --> 00:23:25.005\nExcuse me, we're gonna select it.\n\n462\n00:23:25.005 --> 00:23:29.230\nIt was already selected,\nI probably should have just left it there.\n\n463\n00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.230\nWe can merge the cells.\n\n464\n00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.490\nRemember, we don't have to merge\na cell just across, it can go down.\n\n465\n00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:39.051\nAnd then, we could say like,\ncats are cool.\n\n466\n00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:40.981\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n467\n00:23:40.981 --> 00:23:45.150\nChange the text direction on that one,\nlet's flip it all the way around.\n\n468\n00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.940\nBut now these buttons, I wanna put it\nin the middle, and so on and so forth.\n\n469\n00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.140\nAnd so you change that.\n\n470\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.390\nI could then insert a row above.\n\n471\n00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:57.120\nI can then merge these cells,\nand I could say, cat.\n\n472\n00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.280\nWrong direction.\n\n473\n00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.290\nLet's turn that around.\n\n474\n00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:00.750\nCat activity.\n\n475\n00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.552\nSo there's a lot of different\nways that you can go ahead and\n\n476\n00:24:04.552 --> 00:24:10.536\nchange the layout of your tables by adding\nrows, autofitting, distributing, merging.\n\n477\n00:24:10.536 --> 00:24:14.555\nRemember that it can get a little weird\nif you're selecting one cell when you're\n\n478\n00:24:14.555 --> 00:24:17.800\nchanging the width and\nheight, so try to avoid that.\n\n479\n00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.270\nYou can split a cell and\nthere's nothing wrong with it.\n\n480\n00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:30.940\nBut anytime I take, say, a cell here and\nthen I split the cell Into two columns.\n\n481\n00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.140\nNow, you don't have one,\ntwo, three columns.\n\n482\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.920\nYou have this four columns, and now these\nbecome merged cells across two columns,\n\n483\n00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.380\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Which may have subsequent\n\n484\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.830\nrandom issues or\njust not expected behavior.\n\n485\n00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.681\nUniform behavior, I guess,\nis what I really want to say.\n\n486\n00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:53.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, even when I did the first thing\n\n487\n00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.667\nwhere I had that merge stay on the top and\nI was trying to-\n\n488\n00:24:55.667 --> 00:24:56.201\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n489\n00:24:56.201 --> 00:24:58.209\n&gt;&gt; Select the column or\neven change width and height.\n\n490\n00:24:58.209 --> 00:25:00.670\nAnd I'm glad that you noticed that,\nthat little, tiny bit.\n\n491\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.300\nAnd I'm like, I'm just gonna keep going\ncuz I'm gonna show them when I actually\n\n492\n00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.772\nselect the cell how it really changes.\n\n493\n00:25:05.772 --> 00:25:09.810\nBut yeah, there's nothing wrong\nwith merging and splitting cells.\n\n494\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.520\nI merge cells all day long, but it's just,\n\n495\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.970\nit can do some weird things sometimes in\nthe behaviors, so just be aware of it.\n\n496\n00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.040\nIt's okay.\n\n497\n00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.150\nI'm gonna undo that.\n\n498\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.290\nI try to keep tables as\ntable-y as possible.\n\n499\n00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.700\nKeep them in their purest form with\nmaybe just a few things like this.\n\n500\n00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.735\nBut I did do this,\n\n501\n00:25:29.735 --> 00:25:33.669\nafter the fact that I got everything\nthe way I wanted it in my layout.\n\n502\n00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:38.313\nSo I believe, looking over my notes\nI think I have covered all of\n\n503\n00:25:38.313 --> 00:25:43.746\nthe different things that I wanted to\nshow you about how to insert a table,\n\n504\n00:25:43.746 --> 00:25:46.320\nand then change the layout.\n\n505\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.690\nDid you know that we do have a part\ntwo coming on here, because I wanted\n\n506\n00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:54.520\nto show you just some alternative\nways of getting text into a document.\n\n507\n00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.220\nIn this one, we just did an insert table.\n\n508\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.220\nWe're gonna cover convert\ntext to table and\n\n509\n00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.840\nI've a couple of other little features,\nwith tables, specifically.\n\n510\n00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.980\nSo just make sure you come back for\na part two.\n\n511\n00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool\n&gt;&gt; I am glad that merging\n\n512\n00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.480\ncells is not what I thought it was.\n\n513\n00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.400\nWe are not dealing with genetic\nengineering in this episode,\n\n514\n00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.548\nbut we definitely have a lot more to\ncover, so you don't want to miss that.\n\n515\n00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:19.190\nThank you, Vonne, so much and\nthank you for being with us, as well, but\n\n516\n00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.600\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n517\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.830\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n518\n00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.586\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n519\n00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:24.816\n&gt;&gt;

series.\n\n3\n00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:18.360\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n4\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.810\nSo this is actually a part 2.\n\n5\n00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.520\nIn the last episode, Vonne showed\nus how to go ahead and create and\n\n6\n00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.130\nstart manipulating those\nlayouts of tables.\n\n7\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.592\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\ncontinue this show of table layoutting.\n\n8\n00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:34.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n9\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.860\nWe can roll with that.\n\n10\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.418\nWe can do some different layoutting.\n\n11\n00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:43.290\n[LAUGH] I really want to kind of show you\ndifferent ways to get a table into Word,\n\n12\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770\nbecause we just used the insert table.\n\n13\n00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.310\nAnd then we went through the little grid,\nand\n\n14\n00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.090\nwe said this is how many rows and\ncolumns we have.\n\n15\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.470\nBut there's some other techniques\nlike converting text into a table,\n\n16\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.950\nso I want to cover that and\nthen really just the old I got an Excel.\n\n17\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.150\nWhy do I have to recreate it?\n\n18\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.000\nJust copy and paste it, I mean,\nthat's pretty easy, isn't it?\n\n19\n00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.870\nMakes a table.\n\n20\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.130\nAnd then,\nI also wanted to throw in: Sorting and\n\n21\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.440\nformulas, which doesn't really kinda\nget into like creating tables.\n\n22\n00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.810\nI guess we can kinda throw it in a way,\n\n23\n00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.070\nbut I didn't really have anywhere\nelse to put these two little topics.\n\n24\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.190\nSo I went ahead and [INAUDIBLE],\n\n25\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.510\nwe'll put it in this part\ntwo of our creating tables.\n\n26\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.600\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n27\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.860\nI have a file called\nConvert Text to Table Content.\n\n28\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.680\nAnd let's zoom out of this.\n\n29\n00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.055\n&gt;&gt; I wonder what that means.\n\n30\n00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:32.555\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know!\n\n31\n00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:34.654\nI think that's what we're gonna do.\n\n32\n00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:36.297\n[LAUGH]!\n\n33\n00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:39.930\nLet's turn that button on right there.\n\n34\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.559\nWe're gonna convert text to tables.\n\n35\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.940\nWe're talking about delimiters.\n\n36\n00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.110\nWhat is a delimiter?\n\n37\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.720\nIt is a separating character.\n\n38\n00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.100\nThis right here, the space,\ntechnically, a delimiter.\n\n39\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.310\nIt is taking what is changing\nfrom one word to another,\n\n40\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.600\nwhat is the space in between?\n\n41\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.420\nWell, it's the space character.\n\n42\n00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.540\nSo that is the the separator of this.\n\n43\n00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.510\nHere, notice that what is this?\n\n44\n00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.340\nThat is a tab.\n\n45\n00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.230\nSo I have January, tab, 55 tab.\n\n46\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.230\nWe talked about tab stops\nin the Word essentials and\n\n47\n00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.080\nI love formatting tab stops.\n\n48\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.140\nThese actually are formatted, you can see\nright there there's a centerline tab stop.\n\n49\n00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.640\nActually that's a left, sorry.\n\n50\n00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.520\nAnd that's a left line tabs up.\n\n51\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.340\nAnd we weren't talking about\nmaking you know like make shift\n\n52\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.915\ncolumns in that episode.\n\n53\n00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:35.900\nMm-hm if I'm kind of pretending like I'm\nmaking columns then every time I change\n\n54\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.830\nmy paragraph I'm making rows, that must be\nan easy way to convert a text to a table.\n\n55\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.890\n&gt;&gt; Make real rows.\n\n56\n00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.665\nKind of like turn\nPinocchio into a real boy.\n\n57\n00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.950\nSo why don't we use anywhere there\nis a tab, that becomes a column.\n\n59\n00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.090\nAnywhere there is an enter,\nthere is a row.\n\n60\n00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.390\nAnd as long as it is uniform.\n\n61\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.560\nThat's kinda the key point right here.\n\n62\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.600\nIt is, there's no extra spaces,\nthere's no extra tabs in between here.\n\n63\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.290\nThere is a single tab between January,\n55, single tab, 13.\n\n64\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.498\n&gt;&gt; Is that equivalent to\nfive spacebar presses or no?\n\n65\n00:03:14.498 --> 00:03:18.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\nI don't know.\n\n66\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.960\nWe do talk about that on the show of like.\n\n67\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.550\nNormally, and I think maybe that's an age,\nI wanna say that's an age thing.\n\n68\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm like blushing over here.\n\n69\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.550\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it's\nreally an age thing, but\n\n70\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.112\nlike, on a typewriter, right,\nyou have to do the five spaces?\n\n71\n00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:36.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I usually always ask people that,\n\n72\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.610\nwhen I start teaching tabs, like,\nhow many spaces are in a tab?\n\n73\n00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.700\nAnd the normal answer is five.\n\n74\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.279\nBecause I think we've just been kind\nof taught that, in typing class-\n\n75\n00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:45.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.980\n&gt;&gt; Or what have you.\n\n77\n00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.460\nAnd that's kind of not right.\n\n78\n00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.394\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:51.394 --> 00:03:54.530\n&gt;&gt; In the sense that with tabs in word,\n\n80\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.430\nit's automatically going to\nstop at every default tab stop.\n\n81\n00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.800\nWhich is half of an inch.\n\n82\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay got a lot of mouse then.\n\n83\n00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nthat's where if I had something here.\n\n84\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.320\nJust a quick tab review.\n\n85\n00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.790\nEven if you've watched this episode,\n\n86\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.930\nsince you're here Cherokee I\nwant to go ahead and.\n\n87\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay cool [LAUGH].\n\n88\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.130\n&gt;&gt; I love talking about it too.\n\n89\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.990\nSo if I had let's just say a pillow and\nlet's zoom in so\n\n90\n00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.650\nyou can see this a little bit better.\n\n91\n00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.010\nAnd if I hit the Tab key,\nthere it is again, hello.\n\n92\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.460\nHi.\n\n93\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.400\nIf I hit Enter and type in Hi and then\ntab and then hello, you see, oops, sorry.\n\n94\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.910\nIf I turn this off, that doesn't look\nlike the same amount of space, does it?\n\n95\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n96\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.220\n&gt;&gt; So it's not a hard five spaces.\n\n97\n00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n98\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.230\nIt is stopping it every\nhalf inch on the ruler.\n\n99\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If I did this and said regarding, and\n\n100\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.660\nI hit the tab, you see there, they all\nhave a single tab in between it but\n\n101\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.130\nbecause this word regarding went\npast that half inch on the ruler.\n\n102\n00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.450\nIt went to the next default\ntab which is at the inch mark.\n\n103\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.860\n&gt;&gt; So if you want to create a delineator,\nyou need to go ahead and\n\n104\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.530\nnot hit the space bar times,\nbut you need to hit the tab.\n\n105\n00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n106\n00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.250\n&gt;&gt; And that's because if I had used spaces\nin here, there would be varying amounts of\n\n107\n00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.570\nspaces, to where it doesn't, to make\nthe physical white space that you want.\n\n108\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.490\nSo you wouldn't want to use any type\nof anything that is not uniform.\n\n109\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n110\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.720\n&gt;&gt; And since it only finds, if you were\nusing space as a delimitor if would think\n\n111\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.894\nthere would be five columns so\nkind of background.\n\n112\n00:05:33.894 --> 00:05:35.624\n&gt;&gt; Plus I'd be doing five times the amount\nof work, or four times the amount of work.\n\n113\n00:05:35.624 --> 00:05:38.852\nIf I could count,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just use that.\n\n114\n00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:43.307\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And formulate your tab stops.\n\n115\n00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:46.530\nSo great, really glad I always\nlike to talk about tabs so,\n\n116\n00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.440\nthat's what we've got here.\n\n117\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.040\nAnd I wanted to show you here that this\nexample, this is where it is separated by\n\n118\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.000\ncommas, because it is quite common to\nhave a comma-separated value file.\n\n119\n00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.700\nSometimes databases and everything, if I'm\nextracting or exporting information for\n\n120\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.130\nsomeone's proprietary system a lot of\ntimes it'll say, do you want a comma\n\n121\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.120\ndelimited CSV file, or sometimes\nthey even do like a text file, TXT.\n\n122\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.090\nThey'll say that it's a tab delimited.\n\n123\n00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.023\nSo, you need some type of\nthe ldeimiter that is, what'd I say?\n\n124\n00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:24.540\n[LAUGH] The same, right?\n\n125\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.460\n&gt;&gt; Uniform.\n&gt;&gt; Uniform!\n\n126\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.340\nYes, thank you!\n\n127\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.530\nI totally blanked on the word.\n\n128\n00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:36.380\nSo, if I take this text and I select it\nand I come over here to Insert Table.\n\n129\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.100\nYou don't do the grid.\n\n130\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.860\nNotice that it's not even giving me the\ngrid because I have selected text that I\n\n131\n00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.050\ncan Convert text to table.\n\n132\n00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.650\nSo I'll click that.\n\n133\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.480\nNotice that it does automatically find\nthere are going to be three columns,\n\n134\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.420\nfour rows, it's gonna change the width\nto be auto, that's fine for now,\n\n135\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.450\nand it's separating by tabs.\n\n136\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.350\nIt found that, click okay,\nand there you go, lovely, but\n\n137\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.756\nI can take that, and\nas long as uniform, I can go ahead and\n\n138\n00:07:07.756 --> 00:07:12.770\nI could to reverse just as you know\nif you any table that you have,\n\n139\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.150\nif you ever wanted to get it\nback into just strict text.\n\n140\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.210\nThat have that delimiter,\nnotice here on that lay out tab we have\n\n141\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.380\nthis button I believe,\nwhich is yes, table 2 text.\n\n142\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.500\nTake that.\n\n143\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.820\nWell then tell me what you want to have,\nthe separators.\n\n144\n00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.420\nDo I want it to be a paragraph,\na tab, a comma?\n\n145\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.670\nI could even just do a space.\n\n146\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.180\nI just want to have another with\na physical space and I click okay.\n\n147\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.650\nAnd it will do that.\n\n148\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.044\nYou can get your tables into text, but\nyou can also get your text into tables.\n\n149\n00:07:49.044 --> 00:07:54.053\nAnd notice that in this one when we\ngo ahead and go to the insert, and\n\n150\n00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:58.805\ngo to tables, and convert text to tables,\nit found the comma.\n\n151\n00:07:58.805 --> 00:08:02.784\nVersus the other one finding\nthe tab click OK, and\n\n152\n00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:07.637\nthere you go, so\nthat's how you can convert text to tables.\n\n153\n00:08:07.637 --> 00:08:11.081\nThere's some other ways that\nyou can get a table in, and so\n\n154\n00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:15.033\nI'm just gonna do a File New or\nCmd + N to get a blank piece of paper.\n\n155\n00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:17.931\nThere is one on there, if you noticed,\nwhen I went to the Insert,\n\n156\n00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:21.440\nI'm just gonna move this up a little bit,\nso it makes it a little easier for me.\n\n157\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.930\nIf I got to Insert, there is a Draw Table,\n\n158\n00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.960\nI just wanna freely draw a table,\ntotally can.\n\n159\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.790\nI'm gonna zoom out so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n160\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.820\nYou start with a pencil, and\nnow you've basically turned on the crayon.\n\n161\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.390\nIf I click hold and drag,\n\n162\n00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.459\nI wanna make like my whole\noutside perimeter of my table.\n\n163\n00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:50.290\nClick on drag and let go,\nuuh now, [LAUGH] It's drawing in\n\n164\n00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.270\nthe last type of border\nstyle that I had on\n\n165\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.540\nmy computer when I was just playing around\nwith everything before these episodes.\n\n166\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:05.081\nSo that's why it's orange, let's do this\n\n167\n00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:10.180\nto make it easier on us, let's do that.\n\n168\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.883\nAnd let's just go ahead and change this\nback to black and we'll change this border\n\n169\n00:09:14.883 --> 00:09:19.670\nstyle to normal and then we'll just\nahead and apply that to all borders.\n\n170\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.728\nWe'll get back into formatting\na little bit more but just so\n\n171\n00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:25.248\nit makes it a bit easier,\nso it's not all black.\n\n172\n00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:28.204\nLet's go back over into my Insert, and\n\n173\n00:09:28.204 --> 00:09:33.500\nI will go back into my Draw Table so\nnow I can continue drawing my table.\n\n174\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.050\nMaybe I wanna make a row here,\nI wanna make a column here and\n\n175\n00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.470\nI wanna make another row here and\nthen maybe split that column.\n\n176\n00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.031\nBecause I'm using this to\njust talk about the different\n\n177\n00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:52.090\ndepartments in my And\nI just want this layout, okay perfect.\n\n178\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.520\nSo you can do it, cuz think about it if\nI was trying to do this I would have to\n\n179\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.925\nlike, how many cells are going to\nmerge and what needs to not be merged?\n\n180\n00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:04.065\nAnd especially when I split this here,\nit might be easier if like I want to draw\n\n181\n00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:08.890\nthe compartments in like from my head\ndown on to here, take out a crayon and\n\n182\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:09.980\nstart doing that.\n\n183\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.584\nBut notice I can't draw another,\nand now I get in over here, and\n\n184\n00:10:14.584 --> 00:10:20.380\nI'm just trying to uuh now I'm getting\na little weird, but try to keep it where,\n\n185\n00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.658\nlike you draw the outside first and\nthen divided up inside.\n\n186\n00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:27.134\nThat's the easiest way to do this-\n&gt;&gt; I have to try this with\n\n187\n00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:27.686\nmy touch screen now.\n\n188\n00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:31.712\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because you can use tables when\n\n189\n00:10:31.712 --> 00:10:34.704\nwe start getting into boards and\nshadings and everything like that.\n\n190\n00:10:34.704 --> 00:10:39.040\nSo this could be where we're talking\nabout the divisions within our company.\n\n191\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.920\nThis is the main part of what we're gonna\ntalk about, and this is just a little side\n\n192\n00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.290\nnote so, you can use tables to break\nup your information if you want to.\n\n193\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.960\nAnd that's how you can draw another thing\nwith drawing tables I will tell you\n\n194\n00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.102\nis that you,\n\n195\n00:10:53.102 --> 00:10:58.640\nonce you to turn the draw table on\nsometimes you forget to like turn it off.\n\n196\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.860\nHere let me show you really quick,\nI'm just gonna do a New File again, and\n\n197\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.940\nI'm gonna come back into Insert and\ngo to Draw Table.\n\n198\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.536\nAnd I go to here and I go to here and I go\nto here and I'm like okay I'm done, but\n\n199\n00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:14.058\nnotice my mouse is still in the draw\nit's got the pencil on there.\n\n200\n00:11:14.058 --> 00:11:19.840\nI'm like I just wanted to stop and then\nto try and click off and it won't stop.\n\n201\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.352\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n202\n00:11:20.352 --> 00:11:25.070\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like you took the pen cap\noff and you need to put the cap back on.\n\n203\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.466\nYou come back over into Insert, you come\ndown to this dropdown with the table, and\n\n204\n00:11:29.466 --> 00:11:32.793\nsee how that checkbox is on\nthe draw table, just check it off.\n\n205\n00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:36.929\nIf I click this again, now I'm back\ninto cap is on the pen, I'm back into my\n\n206\n00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:41.538\nregular I-beam and then I can go ahead and\ndo all the different things I wanna do it.\n\n207\n00:11:41.538 --> 00:11:46.000\nSo, just something to notice or just keep\nin mind when you're using the draw table.\n\n208\n00:11:47.387 --> 00:11:51.770\nI'm gonna do a Select All and just\ndelete everything just to get us back.\n\n209\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.900\nBecause hey,\n\n210\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.060\nremember I said if you got Excel I\ndon't really wanna have to redo this.\n\n211\n00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.636\nI'm going to Cmd + Tab over into\nExcel I have a file called Shark Data.\n\n212\n00:12:01.636 --> 00:12:07.930\nAnd we have a little what would be a table\nhere its got rows, its got columns.\n\n213\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.909\nWhy don't I just use it?\n\n214\n00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:11.682\nNow, it does have this formating, and\n\n215\n00:12:11.682 --> 00:12:17.460\nthis is where it is formatted as a table\nin Excel totally different concept.\n\n216\n00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.640\nThat's Excel, this is Word, but I wanna\ntake these cells, so I'll click, hold, and\n\n217\n00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.630\ndrag with my white plus sign, Copy,\n\n218\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.530\njust a regular old Cmd + C.\n\n219\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:34.667\nCome back over in my new document,\nand them Cmd + V, paste.\n\n220\n00:12:34.667 --> 00:12:37.692\nNotice it did bring over the same shading,\nthe borders, but\n\n221\n00:12:37.692 --> 00:12:39.900\nyou do have your paste options, all right.\n\n222\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.596\nAnd I believe we covered this a little bit\nabout the word essentials when we did our\n\n223\n00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:49.430\ncopy and paste episode, and talking\nabout the importance of the smart tag.\n\n224\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.910\nAnd, you can always link it,\n\n225\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:55.000\nbut linking is another topic that\nwe will be talking about later.\n\n226\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.232\nAnd then notice match destination\ntable style, that's where I can,\n\n227\n00:13:00.232 --> 00:13:05.230\nokay, sometimes I don't wanna keep\nall the formatting from Excel.\n\n228\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.032\nI wanted to match just the normal\nblack out lines no fill table style\n\n229\n00:13:10.032 --> 00:13:14.114\nthat is by default so\njust ahead and use that smart tech.\n\n230\n00:13:14.114 --> 00:13:17.870\nSo that's an easy way to get your table\nover and then it's just a regular table\n\n231\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:23.790\nthere's no, Excel data is not embedded,\nit's not linked it's just cells and\n\n232\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:28.970\nnow you have your regular,\ntable tabs in Word to go ahead and format.\n\n233\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.796\nOtherwise, it's getting tables into Word.\n\n234\n00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:36.390\nLet's talk about sorts and filters.\n\n235\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.390\nThis is where let me go ahead oops\nI went too far you know what?\n\n236\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.600\nI forgot I didn't open the file yet.\n\n237\n00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.324\n[LAUGH] Let's come over to\na file called formulas and\n\n238\n00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:53.240\nsort, they got everything ready for us.\n\n239\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.030\nSince we're just talking about Excel,\nif we wanted to sort columns or\n\n240\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.569\nsort rows in Excel you can totally do this\nsortand filters is one of those things.\n\n241\n00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:09.970\nYou can do the same thing with tables in\nWord, just remember, this isn't Excel.\n\n242\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.953\nSo yes, you can do some cool things,\nlike sorting your information.\n\n243\n00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:17.650\nAnd I'll even show you how to insert\nsome very basic formulas right here.\n\n244\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.260\nBut if you're gonna be doing a lot\nof advanced calculations and\n\n245\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.210\nthings like that,\nWord is not the place to do it.\n\n246\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:24.690\n&gt;&gt; There's a solution for that.\n\n247\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:25.298\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right?\n\n248\n00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:30.209\nOur products are made for certain things,\nand I think sometimes people try to force\n\n249\n00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:34.159\nWord to do things it doesn't wanna do,\nand same thing with Excel.\n\n250\n00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:38.270\nPeople try to force Excel to do things\nlike a database when you really-\n\n251\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Need to make that jump or transition.\n\n252\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, every product has its kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Limitations.\n\n253\n00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:48.118\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm so\nlet's move down here to our Sort.\n\n254\n00:14:48.118 --> 00:14:51.305\nSo, this is already into a table,\nand I just have, all right,\n\n255\n00:14:51.305 --> 00:14:54.312\nwe've got a little thing going of like,\nwho I posted with,\n\n256\n00:14:54.312 --> 00:14:58.120\nthe different shows that we've been on and\nlike, how many episodes.\n\n257\n00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.826\nThis isn't total real numbers,\nI was just making it up for the most part.\n\n258\n00:15:01.826 --> 00:15:02.990\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n259\n00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.570\nsort this cuz right now you see right now\nthat we've got Daniel, then Mike and Zack.\n\n260\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.662\nCherokee well,\nI think you should be on top, right?\n\n261\n00:15:10.662 --> 00:15:11.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.407\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely,\n\n263\n00:15:13.407 --> 00:15:17.750\nsince you're at the top of the alphabet so\nI wanna sort this table.\n\n264\n00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.040\nClicking in this column but,\n\n265\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.980\nit doesn't really matter where you are as\nalong as you're somewhere in your table.\n\n266\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:28.399\nCuz over on our Layout tab,\nI have this Sort button over to the right.\n\n267\n00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:29.609\nAnd when I click it,\n\n268\n00:15:29.609 --> 00:15:34.820\nit's not just gonna automatically sort\nthat column that's more like Excel, right?\n\n269\n00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.811\nClick on the column, click the sort,\nand it does everything.\n\n270\n00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:40.202\nHere, it's going to then\nautomatically select the whole table,\n\n271\n00:15:40.202 --> 00:15:42.970\nand then bring up the sort dialogue box.\n\n272\n00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.562\nMy list does have heteros, it recognizes\nthat so, that's a good thing.\n\n273\n00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:52.252\nIf it doesn't, then it would just say,\nsort by Column A, Column B and\n\n274\n00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:54.651\nit would probably recognize that.\n\n275\n00:15:54.651 --> 00:16:00.557\nWhat I wanna sort by, I wanna sort by Host\nAnd the reason why there's a then by is\n\n276\n00:16:00.557 --> 00:16:06.930\ncuz I was messing around with this before\nthe episode, so we could make, we review.\n\n277\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:07.748\n&gt;&gt; Playing, yeah.\n\n278\n00:16:07.748 --> 00:16:11.560\n&gt;&gt; We review our different things\nto make sure that we wanna-\n\n279\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.625\n&gt;&gt; Show what we wanna show.\n\n280\n00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:15.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then sometimes it backfires,\nI'm like, oops,\n\n281\n00:16:15.162 --> 00:16:16.950\nthat's not what I wanted it to do.\n\n282\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.197\n[LAUGH] Hey, we're not scripted.\n\n283\n00:16:18.197 --> 00:16:21.437\nSo we come and click OK, and\nthen notice that I have,\n\n284\n00:16:21.437 --> 00:16:26.366\nthere we go, Cherokee's at the top,\nthat's because you're the.\n\n285\n00:16:26.366 --> 00:16:26.885\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n\n286\n00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:31.063\n[LAUGH] I don't know about that,\nbut I'll take it for now.\n\n287\n00:16:31.063 --> 00:16:33.205\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, good job.\n\n288\n00:16:33.205 --> 00:16:36.852\nyeah, so if I wanted to sort by the show?\n\n289\n00:16:36.852 --> 00:16:40.486\nIf I wanted to have, okay this would be,\nit looks like, l,m,n,o,p.\n\n290\n00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:41.602\nSo Outlook would be first.\n\n291\n00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:43.122\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:16:43.122 --> 00:16:45.092\n&gt;&gt; I actually had to think about that\n\n293\n00:16:45.092 --> 00:16:46.212\nfor a second.\n\n294\n00:16:46.212 --> 00:16:50.362\nSo, I wanna sort by the show and\nthen by the host.\n\n295\n00:16:51.562 --> 00:16:56.572\nKind of saw that I already had that\naround there by sort by my show.\n\n296\n00:16:56.572 --> 00:16:57.999\nThen by my host.\n\n297\n00:16:57.999 --> 00:16:59.082\nNot the show again.\n\n298\n00:16:59.082 --> 00:17:02.074\nLet's go with host, and then click OK.\n\n299\n00:17:02.074 --> 00:17:06.870\nNow I've got Outlook, and then in\nOutlook we have Daniel, Justin, Ronnie,\n\n300\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:11.685\nPowerPoint, Mike, Ronnie, Zac, so\nwe've got it in those sorting orders.\n\n301\n00:17:11.685 --> 00:17:13.675\nSo, nice that you can go ahead-\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n302\n00:17:13.675 --> 00:17:16.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and use those same\nthings that you could do in Excel\n\n303\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.390\nright here in a table in Word.\n\n304\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.195\nAlong those same lines,\n\n305\n00:17:21.195 --> 00:17:25.850\nyou do have the option of inserting\nformulas into your tables.\n\n306\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:34.870\nSo I have something like this and I would\nlike to add up the quarter one totals.\n\n307\n00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.915\nSo I've got a cell ready to go,\nput my cursor in there, and then over on\n\n308\n00:17:38.915 --> 00:17:43.523\nthe right-hand side of your layouts tab,\nyou can click on the, that is not it.\n\n309\n00:17:43.523 --> 00:17:45.130\nIt's that one.\n\n310\n00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.700\n[LAUGH] It's the f of x is the insert\nformula or function button.\n\n311\n00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.957\nYou click it, and then the cool thing is,\nif you have everything set up right,\n\n312\n00:17:53.957 --> 00:17:56.553\nnormally it goes ahead and\nfinds what you want.\n\n313\n00:17:56.553 --> 00:18:01.360\nYou probably wouldn't wanna do\nmuch more than like some, or\n\n314\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.826\nmaybe even just like the average,\nbut notice it is using the same type\n\n315\n00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:12.220\nof typing or just how they use\nthe equations and functions in Excel.\n\n316\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.290\nIt starts with an equal,\nsum is the function name,\n\n317\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.520\nwhich is going to total up, but\nit's not using cell references,\n\n318\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.450\nbecause we don't really have\nthose here in a table in Word.\n\n319\n00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.232\nIt just says above.\n\n320\n00:18:24.232 --> 00:18:28.985\nNotice that there are numbers above\nwhere you had clicked, and so\n\n321\n00:18:28.985 --> 00:18:32.711\nyou said,\nyep that's exactly what I want it to do.\n\n322\n00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:37.435\nYou do have some number of font formats\nto see if you wanted commas, and\n\n323\n00:18:37.435 --> 00:18:39.240\nso on, and so forth.\n\n324\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.935\nAgain, you wanna go a little crazier,\nyou're gonna need to use Excel, but\n\n325\n00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:43.700\nthis is great.\n\n326\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.486\nI just want that.\n\n327\n00:18:44.486 --> 00:18:46.433\nI click OK, and there you go.\n\n328\n00:18:46.433 --> 00:18:48.025\nIt's added that up.\n\n329\n00:18:48.025 --> 00:18:52.341\nNow, if I wanna do this again you could\ngo ahead and click your cursor, and\n\n330\n00:18:52.341 --> 00:18:56.591\ndo the same thing, but just like you\nhave in Excel you have the copy of your\n\n331\n00:18:56.591 --> 00:19:00.929\nfunctions and it's using relative\nreference to change the cells [LAUGH].\n\n332\n00:19:00.929 --> 00:19:01.507\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n333\n00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:02.499\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee's like?\n\n334\n00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:05.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] When I have Excel problems,\nI ask you, Vonne.\n\n335\n00:19:05.721 --> 00:19:07.062\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n336\n00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:08.938\nYes, you do have that.\n\n337\n00:19:08.938 --> 00:19:14.343\nSo, I don't wanna have to redo this, you\ncan do a pretty cool function called a,\n\n338\n00:19:14.343 --> 00:19:17.602\nif you just,\nI dont have this on my keyboard, but\n\n339\n00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:22.478\nif you have an F4 key on your keyboard,\nthat just repeats the last step.\n\n340\n00:19:22.478 --> 00:19:26.080\nSo I could, let's just come over here and\njust kind of think about that idea.\n\n341\n00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:32.781\nI click here, I can't do an F4 here,\nbecause this is doing sum above.\n\n342\n00:19:32.781 --> 00:19:33.600\nThis needs to do what?\n\n343\n00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.034\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n344\n00:19:35.034 --> 00:19:38.073\n&gt;&gt; To the other right.\n\n345\n00:19:38.073 --> 00:19:40.969\nIt needs to add up all\nthe numbers to the left of it.\n\n346\n00:19:40.969 --> 00:19:41.814\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha.\n\n347\n00:19:41.814 --> 00:19:43.311\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so cursor here.\n\n348\n00:19:43.311 --> 00:19:47.404\nLet's do that one more time, and I want\nyes, the sum to the left, I click OK.\n\n349\n00:19:47.404 --> 00:19:48.745\nI've done it once.\n\n350\n00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:50.683\nI would immediately click here,\nI hit the F4 key,-\n\n351\n00:19:50.683 --> 00:19:52.109\n&gt;&gt; F4, okay.\n\n352\n00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:54.560\n&gt;&gt; And it would do the same thing.\n\n353\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.380\nBecause I don't have that,\nanother way you can do this,\n\n354\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.620\nis you could select this, and also\nnotice here, do you see how it's grey?\n\n355\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.741\nAnytime you see things highlighted\nin grey when you click on them,\n\n356\n00:20:05.741 --> 00:20:07.501\nit means that this is a field.\n\n357\n00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:09.260\nThis is a calculated field.\n\n358\n00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.292\nThis is not six eight typed in.\n\n359\n00:20:12.292 --> 00:20:13.434\n&gt;&gt; So what is it normally?\n\n360\n00:20:13.434 --> 00:20:15.718\nNow I just realized, I've been oblivious.\n\n361\n00:20:15.718 --> 00:20:17.122\nIs it light blue normally?\n\n362\n00:20:17.122 --> 00:20:20.558\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I click my cursor here,\nand notice that it didn't\n\n363\n00:20:20.558 --> 00:20:24.430\nmake any highlighting,\nif you wanna say, or selecting.\n\n364\n00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.900\nNow if I select the text,\nit does turn blue.\n\n365\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n366\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:33.679\n&gt;&gt; Watch if I single-click in the 68,\nit's automatically grey.\n\n367\n00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:35.789\nIt's because I've clicked into the field.\n\n368\n00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:37.339\nIt's a calculated field.\n\n369\n00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:40.996\nSo again, those little things,\nI'm like, why is that gray?\n\n370\n00:20:40.996 --> 00:20:43.540\nIt's a calculated field, and\nit's not just for formulas.\n\n371\n00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:49.948\nIt's for any, you can just actually insert\nfields, where it's pulling metadata of\n\n372\n00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:53.986\nmaybe when it was created or any type of-\n&gt;&gt; GPS coordinates or something?\n\n373\n00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:54.816\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n374\n00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:58.981\nIf you had any type of document\nproperties, you can pull that out, and\n\n375\n00:20:58.981 --> 00:21:01.035\nput it in your document as a field.\n\n376\n00:21:01.035 --> 00:21:01.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n377\n00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:08.491\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna select this whole field,\nwhich is the formula, copy it, Cmd+C.\n\n378\n00:21:08.491 --> 00:21:11.267\nCome here, Cmd+V.\n\n379\n00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:12.934\nThat did not copy 68, did it?\n\n380\n00:21:12.934 --> 00:21:13.864\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n381\n00:21:13.864 --> 00:21:16.613\n&gt;&gt; No, cuz-\n&gt;&gt; It copied the actual formula.\n\n382\n00:21:16.613 --> 00:21:21.494\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, cuz 12 plus 60 is 72,\nand 55 plus 13 is 68.\n\n383\n00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:25.887\nSo that's what it's doing,\nI'm copying the formula, and\n\n384\n00:21:25.887 --> 00:21:30.800\nit's going to do the sum up to the left,\nand that's what goes on.\n\n385\n00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.770\nSo that's pretty neat.\n\n386\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.190\nI can't do a copy and paste here,\nbecause I'd have to go ahead and\n\n387\n00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.570\ncopy this one first.\n\n388\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:42.280\nI couldn't paste in, because we got\nthe two different directions, and then one\n\n389\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.330\nhere, this last one, I'll just paste one\nmore time, and you can see I have 165.\n\n390\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.090\nWonderful, but again,\nF4 is the repeat the last one.\n\n391\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.690\nI can't do this one, well I can do this\none, I just can't do the keyboard.\n\n392\n00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:59.088\nWhat if I change this from 55 to 155.\n\n393\n00:21:59.088 --> 00:22:03.293\nEverything should increase by 100,\nbut they didn't,\n\n394\n00:22:03.293 --> 00:22:05.990\nbecause you have to update the field.\n\n395\n00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.350\nYou have to say, hey, hey, guess what?\n\n396\n00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.952\nYou calculated it when it was just 55,\nnow it's 100.\n\n397\n00:22:11.952 --> 00:22:16.029\nSo here, instead of redoing it,\nnotice if I right-click on this,\n\n398\n00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:18.469\ndo you see where it says, update field?\n\n399\n00:22:18.469 --> 00:22:23.613\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so me not being 100% familiar\nwith Excel, I feel like it automatically\n\n400\n00:22:23.613 --> 00:22:28.250\npropagates in Excel, so that's\nsomething you should look out for here.\n\n401\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes, perfect, I'm so\nglad you pointed that out,\n\n402\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.470\nbecause I would have just kept on going.\n\n403\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.000\n[LAUGH] But yeah, in Excel, it does\nit automatically, and Word doesn't,\n\n404\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.190\nso you do have to force the update.\n\n405\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.799\nF9 is your keyboard shortcut on that,\nbut you can also right-click, and\n\n406\n00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:46.820\nnotice it did this one, but\nit didn't do all of them.\n\n407\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.140\nSo what I would suggest is go ahead and\nselect all of their cells,\n\n408\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.820\nsome have fields,\nsome have just hard coded numbers, and\n\n409\n00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:59.160\nthen if you update the field,\nthis is where I don't have the F9 key.\n\n410\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.087\nIf I had the F9 key-\n&gt;&gt; Do you wanna borrow mine?\n\n411\n00:23:01.087 --> 00:23:02.532\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Borrow mine.\n\n412\n00:23:02.532 --> 00:23:04.739\nLet me just-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:23:04.739 --> 00:23:06.084\n&gt;&gt; You do some editing in post, right?\n\n414\n00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:07.805\nMegan can do some magic for us.\n\n415\n00:23:07.805 --> 00:23:10.627\nI'm like, poof, see,\nI used her keyboard from my computer!\n\n416\n00:23:10.627 --> 00:23:13.117\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you go ahead and\n\n417\n00:23:13.117 --> 00:23:15.691\nF9 with all of this, it would update.\n\n418\n00:23:15.691 --> 00:23:19.636\nSince I don't, I would have to update\neach individual field to go ahead and\n\n419\n00:23:19.636 --> 00:23:21.450\nget to where it needs to go.\n\n420\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.312\nThat one doesn't need to\nupdate itself does it,\n\n421\n00:23:23.312 --> 00:23:24.930\nbecause [LAUGH] it's\nnot using the formula.\n\n422\n00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.160\nHow about we go ahead update that\nfield and then let's update this one,\n\n423\n00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.850\nbecause that's the only numbers\nthat are going to match.\n\n424\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:36.597\nBut anyways use that F9 shortcut,\nand that would be pretty cool.\n\n425\n00:23:36.597 --> 00:23:39.000\nSo the different ways of inserting charts.\n\n426\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.342\nNot charts, sorry, tables.\n\n427\n00:23:41.342 --> 00:23:46.050\n[LAUGH] And you also have the sorts and\nthe formulas.\n\n428\n00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:51.090\nOne quick note that I left this in\nthis show note, is that in Word for\n\n429\n00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:55.955\nPC, when you go into your insert,\nthere are two other options.\n\n430\n00:23:55.955 --> 00:23:58.141\nThere is an insert quick tables, and\n\n431\n00:23:58.141 --> 00:24:02.594\nthere's also an insert Excel spreadsheet\nthat makes an embedded object.\n\n432\n00:24:02.594 --> 00:24:06.814\nYou don't have that in the options here,\n\n433\n00:24:06.814 --> 00:24:10.920\nwhen Word for Mac, it just is what it is.\n\n434\n00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.060\nSo just in case you're like,\nhey I noticed it was in the other one and\n\n435\n00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.630\nnot here, yeah so\nI'm just pointing that out.\n\n436\n00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:22.920\nSo now, other ways of putting things\nin and how you can go ahead and\n\n437\n00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.518\nuse your sorts and functions,\nand yeah, that's it.\n\n438\n00:24:26.518 --> 00:24:27.557\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool beans.\n\n439\n00:24:27.557 --> 00:24:31.353\nSo we've learned a lot about tables, how\nto insert them, create them, format them,\n\n440\n00:24:31.353 --> 00:24:33.330\nconvert from text, and\nall sorts of things.\n\n441\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.180\nSo thank you Vonne, and thank you so\nmuch for joining us as well.\n\n442\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.765\nBut we are out of time, so\nwe'll go ahead and sign.\n\n443\n00:24:39.765 --> 00:24:40.947\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n444\n00:24:40.947 --> 00:24:41.894\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n445\n00:24:41.894 --> 00:24:43.805\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at Office ProTV.\n\n446\n00:24:43.805 -->

Bold choice, Vonne.\n\n34\n00:01:58.056 --> 00:02:00.548\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nwe will make it a little bit bigger.\n\n35\n00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:03.817\nAnd I'll change the text to green.\n\n36\n00:02:03.817 --> 00:02:06.041\nAnd just go ahead and changing that.\n\n37\n00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:09.743\nAnd I can't let this live,\nI gotta go ahead and make the, okay,\n\n38\n00:02:09.743 --> 00:02:10.851\nI feel better now.\n\n39\n00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:14.517\n[LAUGH] I had to get that\nvertically centered in there.\n\n40\n00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:17.186\nSo changing the font is one thing.\n\n41\n00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:22.147\nSo now if we wanted to center the text\nin the cells, we could go ahead and\n\n42\n00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:23.510\ndo the same thing.\n\n43\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.430\nWe could use our center lines,\nwhich is somewhat the same\n\n44\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.468\nas like coming over here and\nclicking like the top center.\n\n45\n00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:38.138\nBut this does do the vertical alignment,\nas well.\n\n46\n00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:42.023\nSo notice that these two,\nI'm clicking these two buttons up here and\n\n47\n00:02:42.023 --> 00:02:43.167\nthey look the same.\n\n48\n00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:46.380\nThat's because you don't have any-\n&gt;&gt; Vertical spacing.\n\n49\n00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.243\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for\nit to really do the changing of it.\n\n50\n00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:53.869\nBut you could go ahead and\njust do the vertical sorry,\n\n51\n00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:58.238\nthe horizontal alignment by coming\ninto the home tab and formatting.\n\n52\n00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:01.865\nSo, text formatting pretty normal.\n\n53\n00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:05.434\nBut if I wanted to change\nstuff about the cells,\n\n54\n00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:09.628\nthe things that you can change\nabout the cells in terms of\n\n55\n00:03:09.628 --> 00:03:14.463\nformatting is going to change\nthe shading and/or the borders.\n\n56\n00:03:14.463 --> 00:03:19.746\nSo if I wanted to make the background\ncolor of this particular cell a different\n\n57\n00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:24.968\ncolor, you need to, well, first of all,\nclick your cursor into the cell.\n\n58\n00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:32.162\nNow, I don't have it all selected, which\nis fine as long as the cursor is in there.\n\n59\n00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:36.423\nWhen I come over here to my table\ndesign tab and come into shading, and\n\n60\n00:03:36.423 --> 00:03:40.687\nif I choose like a really light green,\nnotice it's gonna go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.725\ndo the entire cell because\nthat is the one I am in.\n\n62\n00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:48.414\nAnd it's not going to just do the words or\nanything like that, it's the whole cell.\n\n63\n00:03:48.414 --> 00:03:52.420\nIf I wanted to change the multiple cells,\nyou just gotta go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.827\nmake sure you do your right selections.\n\n65\n00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:56.980\nLet's select this row.\n\n66\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.200\nAnd maybe we'll change the cell\nshading to like a dark green.\n\n67\n00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.593\nMaybe come on over here and\nchange the text to white.\n\n68\n00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:07.143\nI'm not really sure.\n\n69\n00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:11.414\nThis is getting a little to gaudy\nalready but that's all right.\n\n70\n00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:14.331\nBut notice you can go ahead and\n\n71\n00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:19.833\nformat each individual cell\nwith different shadings.\n\n72\n00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:22.878\nNow with borders.\n\n73\n00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:27.647\nI'm sorry before I move off to the\nborders, I do wanna make a small note that\n\n74\n00:04:27.647 --> 00:04:32.591\nyou can only format cells like the shading\nof your cells, with solid colors.\n\n75\n00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:35.513\nYou don't have the gradients, I know\nwe mentioned that in the introduction,\n\n76\n00:04:35.513 --> 00:04:37.247\nif you're watching this\nlike in succession.\n\n77\n00:04:37.247 --> 00:04:42.166\nBut notice,\nI don't have gradients for pictures.\n\n78\n00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:47.095\nI wanna say you can do gradients in\n\n79\n00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:51.505\nWord for PC, in Word tables.\n\n80\n00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:54.143\nI can't remember honestly now,\nI've been in like-\n\n81\n00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:54.781\n&gt;&gt; Mac for so long?\n\n82\n00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:55.455\n&gt;&gt; Mac, right?\n\n83\n00:04:55.455 --> 00:05:00.665\nFor a couple weeks now, so I was like and\nI haven't jumped over my virtual machine.\n\n84\n00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:03.596\nBut notice like I can\ncome into more colors and\n\n85\n00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:08.390\nthis is just gonna get like the regular\ncolor picker that you have for Mac.\n\n86\n00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.234\nI did wanna mention that you can\nright-click on this, and you can get into\n\n87\n00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:16.267\nyour borders and shadings, and this is\nsomething we talked about with like,\n\n88\n00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:19.014\nparagraph formatting back\nin our Word essentials.\n\n89\n00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:23.111\nSo if I come into this dialogue box,\nnotice I do have the shading.\n\n90\n00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:27.077\nI can apply a pattern, all right?\n\n91\n00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:31.733\nSo notice that I can come in to make this\nlike, maybe like this color green here.\n\n92\n00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:37.201\nAnd then I can make kinda like\na dotted pattern in there.\n\n93\n00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:41.044\nAnd you can even get into\nmaybe some vertical lines and\n\n94\n00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:43.274\nthen change the color of that.\n\n95\n00:05:43.274 --> 00:05:47.639\nNow, I don't know about you, but\nthat's no, that's hurting my eyes.\n\n96\n00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.872\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's too much.\n\n97\n00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:53.572\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so some of the patterns\nthat you can apply with the fill or\n\n98\n00:05:53.572 --> 00:05:58.109\nthe shading of your cells,\nI think it gets a little too much.\n\n99\n00:05:58.109 --> 00:06:02.056\n&gt;&gt; The ones I really appreciate are going\nto be the light hue difference, so\n\n100\n00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:06.475\nthat you can, or maybe if it's just two\ndifferent colors, and just like a wash.\n\n101\n00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:12.016\nSo that you can keep your place,\nif you have a really wide row,\n\n102\n00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:18.635\nlike following along, so you don't skew or\nread the wrong information.\n\n103\n00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:22.349\n&gt;&gt; And you're playing right\ninto why we should do styles.\n\n104\n00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:23.159\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n105\n00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.978\n&gt;&gt; So hold that thoughts,\nbecause that's the way I go, too.\n\n106\n00:06:25.978 --> 00:06:32.837\nI usually, and I can, depending on the job\nand like what look I want to go to or for.\n\n107\n00:06:32.837 --> 00:06:35.967\nBut a lot of times I just pick one of\nthese table cells and just call it a day.\n\n108\n00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:39.481\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy, I used to have to,\nI worked in advertising and\n\n109\n00:06:39.481 --> 00:06:43.806\nI'd have to check a manifest to make\nsure the ad was in the, for a newspaper,\n\n110\n00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:46.375\non the proper page,\nin the proper section and\n\n111\n00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:50.803\non the proper orientation on the page and\nblah,blah blah, the dimensions.\n\n112\n00:06:50.803 --> 00:06:55.243\nAnd I had to use a ruler because there\nwas so much you had to check for, for\n\n113\n00:06:55.243 --> 00:06:57.848\none particular ad and there were so many.\n\n114\n00:06:57.848 --> 00:07:01.099\nIt's like well, it would have been so much\neasier if it was just separated like that.\n\n115\n00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:02.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean, and\n\n116\n00:07:02.124 --> 00:07:05.379\nthat's where you're having to make\nsure you get all these specifics.\n\n117\n00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:10.122\nThat's why I'm going over how you can\ngo into the individual formattings\n\n118\n00:07:10.122 --> 00:07:13.811\nof each cell, row, column,\nbecause it's available.\n\n119\n00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:17.772\nAnd depending on when and\nwhy you need to do that.\n\n120\n00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:22.369\nSometimes the styles don't\ndo exactly what you do.\n\n121\n00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:24.523\nSo that is why we\nare going over all of it.\n\n122\n00:07:24.523 --> 00:07:27.800\nAnd yes, very good point because\nyou can always go ahead and tweak.\n\n123\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.937\nLet's keep on tweaking.\n\n124\n00:07:28.937 --> 00:07:31.653\nLet's go into borders, all right?\n\n125\n00:07:31.653 --> 00:07:36.940\nWith our borders,\nI still struggle with this.\n\n126\n00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.051\nI wanna be completely honest with you.\n\n127\n00:07:40.051 --> 00:07:44.035\nIt's like,\nlet me just start demonstrating,\n\n128\n00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:49.025\nyou have a style,\nyou have another style here, all right?\n\n129\n00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:54.563\nBut this one goes into styles as in\nit's gonna do all of it at once,\n\n130\n00:07:54.563 --> 00:07:58.204\nthe thickness, the type, and the color.\n\n131\n00:07:58.204 --> 00:08:01.113\nSo that's why there is\na border style here, but\n\n132\n00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:03.311\nthen there is- Border style here.\n\n133\n00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:04.439\nWait, what's the difference?\n\n134\n00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:05.315\n&gt;&gt; What is the difference?\n\n135\n00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:09.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this button right her is\na combination of all three of these.\n\n136\n00:08:09.932 --> 00:08:14.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The type, let's just do this double.\n\n137\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.640\nThe size, notice three points versus\nhalf a point versus six points.\n\n138\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.437\n&gt;&gt; So because you've already\nselected the double,\n\n139\n00:08:22.437 --> 00:08:26.375\nit shows you what that point size\nlooks like in that double selection.\n\n140\n00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.597\n&gt;&gt;

Cool.\n\n290\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.650\n&gt;&gt; And so you can change, you could\nselect one of these like maybe I like,\n\n291\n00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.620\nmaybe like this, let's just use that one.\n\n292\n00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.340\nLook at that,\neverything's purpley now like that.\n\n293\n00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.030\nAnd then, maybe I'll make it pink.\n\n294\n00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.775\nIt changes everything.\n\n295\n00:15:56.775 --> 00:16:00.204\nNow, any time that you\napply a style to it,\n\n296\n00:16:00.204 --> 00:16:04.600\nyou have these check boxes\noff to the left-hand side.\n\n297\n00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.738\nHeader row, and remember when we\ntalked about this in the introduction,\n\n298\n00:16:08.738 --> 00:16:09.947\nyou have a total row.\n\n299\n00:16:09.947 --> 00:16:12.083\nIt doesn't mean it's adding anything.\n\n300\n00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:17.320\nAll it does is do you see how turning\nit on and off it changes the border?\n\n301\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.470\nIt changed the top\nborder to a double line.\n\n302\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.040\nIt changes the fonts to bold.\n\n303\n00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.560\nAnd it doesn't band your rows.\n\n304\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.370\nIf I did a first column,\nin this particular style,\n\n305\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.340\nnotice it's bolding that first column.\n\n306\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.600\nIf I had turned it on the last column,\nit's bolding.\n\n307\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.810\nBut now look at the table styles.\n\n308\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:42.600\nYou see how with these particular\noptions on it it's showing me\n\n309\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:48.370\nthe icons of how they're different.\n\n310\n00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.780\nWhat if I turn on the header row?\n\n311\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.750\nNow look at all these table styles.\n\n312\n00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.402\nNeat.\n\n313\n00:16:53.402 --> 00:16:56.170\nOkay let's go ahead and\ndo all of the different.\n\n314\n00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.800\nFormatting of that particular\nstyle based on whether or\n\n315\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.870\nnot you've turned on the first column or\n\n316\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:07.760\nturned on the last column, the last row,\nthe total row, and so on and so forth.\n\n317\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.060\nSo you can kind of play\naround with this one.\n\n318\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.320\nI do like this, but I don't really\nwanna format the last column.\n\n319\n00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.610\nI don't really wanna maybe\nformat the first column.\n\n320\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.360\nI don't need a total row.\n\n321\n00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.110\nI like the total row.\n\n322\n00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.090\nAnd then I have rows.\n\n323\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.640\nYou don't really want to band rows and\nband columns.\n\n324\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.488\nBecause that just starts\nto look kind of weird.\n\n325\n00:17:28.488 --> 00:17:33.150\nI would probably say either band\nthe columns or band the rows.\n\n326\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.510\nIf you have a lot of information this way,\nI would probably go with columns.\n\n327\n00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.750\nA lot of information this way,\nI would probably go ahead and the rows.\n\n328\n00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.330\nIt's neat you can go ahead and\nthrow on like right there I mean,\n\n329\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.340\nif I'm feeling really purply today.\n\n330\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.800\nI mean, with just a few clicks.\n\n331\n00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.890\nSorry, I've got to change this again.\n\n332\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:55.060\nWith just a few clicks, I can go ahead and\nhave a pretty cool looking table with\n\n333\n00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.720\nall the formattings just from using the\nstyles in those check boxes over there.\n\n334\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.680\n&gt;&gt; The way that you want it to work for\nyou, like you side.\n\n335\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.390\nEither like in my situation,\nI was looking at it horizontally so\n\n336\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.330\nthis is perfect, but Yeah.\n\n337\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.400\nIf you had to look and\ncheck things in a vertical aspect,\n\n338\n00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.262\nyou have that at the click of a button.\n\n339\n00:18:10.262 --> 00:18:11.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] And I even have this one,\n\n340\n00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.400\nbecause maybe I don't want\nthe borders on the outside.\n\n341\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.872\nSo I tend to stick within these,\nthis is usually the option I go for,\n\n342\n00:18:20.872 --> 00:18:24.051\nwhere you have like the darker header.\n\n343\n00:18:24.051 --> 00:18:27.135\nAnd then the lighter and white banded, and\n\n344\n00:18:27.135 --> 00:18:31.170\nthen the total row on that I\nfind that to be kind of funny.\n\n345\n00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.250\nAnd notice every time I put on a different\nstyle it throws off my layout.\n\n346\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.235\nIt throws off that vertical alignment so\nI have to keep going back to it.\n\n347\n00:18:39.235 --> 00:18:41.270\n&gt;&gt; {LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's ok, we know where it's at.\n\n348\n00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.861\nAnd right there I've got a pretty cool\nformated table that I didn't really have\n\n349\n00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:50.382\nto think about it and go into all the\ndifferent pieces I prefer tables, sorry,\n\n350\n00:18:50.382 --> 00:18:51.152\nthe styles.\n\n351\n00:18:51.152 --> 00:18:55.682\nBut you know that we can go ahead and use\nindividual shadings and the borders and\n\n352\n00:18:55.682 --> 00:18:56.720\nthe paintbrush.\n\n353\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.280\nI'm trying to paintbrush on and on so\n\n354\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.320\nyou could go ahead and format to your\nhearts desire, with solid colors, pink and\n\n355\n00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.250\nall the grey and all that fun stuff but\nat least know the options.\n\n356\n00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.050\n&gt;&gt; It definitely steps up your,\nI don't wanna say\n\n357\n00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.910\npresentation game cuz you're not\nalways gonna be, Presenting that time.\n\n358\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.920\nBut your, I guess, business appearance or\n\n359\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.920\nany kind of just making you a little\nmore professional or polished.\n\n360\n00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.890\n&gt;&gt; And\ntables are presenting your information.\n\n361\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.600\nSo it is upping your presentation\nof your information.\n\n362\n00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.060\nSo I'm right there with you.\n\n363\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.110\nI think it's a great way to describe it.\n\n364\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.910\n&gt;&gt; So, Vonne, we've looked at\nquite a bit here with our tables.\n\n365\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.190\nIs there anything else\nyou'd like to show us?\n\n366\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.580\n&gt;&gt; No, people are like, what,\nyou did four episodes on tables?\n\n367\n00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.640\nI'm like yeah, we did.\n\n368\n00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.130\nBecause there is a lot to talk about.\n\n369\n00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.290\nBecause it's like just\nthrow it on a table.\n\n370\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.350\nBut we like to slow it down here.\n\n371\n00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.640\nWe like to go ahead and\nexplain everything, really get into it.\n\n372\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.520\nAnd hopefully you won't fight with tables,\ncuz.\n\n373\n00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.560\n&gt;&gt; Also,\nyou can't teach an old dog new tricks.\n\n374\n00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.850\nThat's not true, but\nit's just really hard.\n\n375\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.765\nI'm the old dog.\n\n376\n00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:06.480\n[LAUGH] And if you learn the right\nway from the beginning sometimes,\n\n377\n00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.480\nit's almost better So\nyou don't have to break any bad habits.\n\n378\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.100\nYou just create good\nhabits from the onset.\n\n379\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:16.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and hopefully this will\neliminate the frustration that you\n\n380\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.210\nmaybe been experiencing, same way I have.\n\n381\n00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.290\nAnd that's where we all come from.\n\n382\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.430\nAnd it's just understanding all,\nit's really the mouse cursor icon.\n\n383\n00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.460\nIt's so big.\n\n384\n00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.450\nThat's what trips people\nup every single time.\n\n385\n00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:35.580\nIt's taken four episodes to go through\nour different things in the tables,\n\n386\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.000\nit's like a mini series [LAUGH].\n\n387\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.770\nIt's like a tables mini series, and\nnow we have come to the conclusion and\n\n388\n00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.740\nnow everybody is like.\n\n389\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.730\nAnd that is a nice little and\nall done music is going to play us off\n\n390\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.090\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.304\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:18.304 --> 00:00:22.820\nwe're getting back into\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Advanced for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.331\nWhoo!\n\n6\n00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:26.419\nI was a little scared I wasn't\ngonna make through that but I did.\n\n7\n00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.480\nAnd particularly in this episode\nwe're gonna start with charts.\n\n8\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.210\nI also didn't mean to rhyme in that so\nthis is gonna be an interesting show.\n\n9\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.620\nLuckily we have someone just\nas interesting, if not more,\n\n10\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.239\nMiss Vaughn Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.820\nHow you doing today, Vaughn?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.866\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing also\n\n13\n00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.885\nwell.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:44.694\n&gt;&gt; I was scared there at the beginning.\n\n15\n00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:45.758\n&gt;&gt; I was rooting for you.\n\n16\n00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:48.108\n&gt;&gt; That's a long title and I rhymed,\n\n17\n00:00:48.108 --> 00:00:49.166\nI don't know.\n\n18\n00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.002\nIt's crazy.\n\n19\n00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:54.430\nBut charts, in my previous experiences,\nI'm like, ooh, charts are good.\n\n20\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.310\nBut visualization of data is, a lot of\ntimes, more important than the actual\n\n21\n00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.410\ndata itself.\n&gt;&gt; Excatly, and\n\n22\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.730\nI loved how you introduced it.\n\n23\n00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.030\nWe are doing a graphical\nrepresentation of our information.\n\n24\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.170\nAnd I just rhymed there too didn't I?\n\n25\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.580\nLook at that.\n\n26\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.880\nWe are starting from the very\nbeginning and this is an introduction\n\n27\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.490\nepisode to where we're just gonna\nget familiar with the terminology.\n\n28\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.982\nIt's all about these big words.\n\n29\n00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:19.631\nWhat's a data series?\n\n30\n00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:22.390\nWhat's a category axis?\n\n31\n00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.395\nSo I just wanna kind of introduce\nyou to the topics, the words,\n\n32\n00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:32.025\nshow you some examples and\njust get us familiar with everything so\n\n33\n00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:36.785\nthen we move on into actually inserting\na chart and then going into formatting it.\n\n34\n00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.792\nI do like to kinda break these up\njust like we did with the tables.\n\n35\n00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:43.078\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\ntake it chunks like that and\n\n36\n00:01:43.078 --> 00:01:45.642\nmake it a little bit more digestible for\nus.\n\n37\n00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:49.492\nSo we're gonna start off with a handy,\ndandy PowerPoint presentation.\n\n38\n00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:52.762\nSo there's nothing like presenting\ninformation with PowerPoint.\n\n39\n00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:55.674\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njump on down into here.\n\n40\n00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:58.342\nI'm not running the show in full screen or\nanything like that.\n\n41\n00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:02.393\nI just wanted to kinda, Get this here so\n\n42\n00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:07.498\nI can have a little road map\nas to where we're going.\n\n43\n00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:10.950\nSo we did talk about tables\nin the previous episodes.\n\n44\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.612\nAnd this is just an example of tables.\n\n45\n00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:14.600\nAnd it's giving us the information.\n\n46\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.570\nOkay, this is the activities of\nmy two cats Fuego and Bishop.\n\n47\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.010\nYou can see how much they sleep and\neat and play and meow.\n\n48\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.393\nAnd it's just the raw data, the numbers.\n\n49\n00:02:25.393 --> 00:02:32.860\nBut does this table communicate\nthe information as well as, maybe, this?\n\n50\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.830\nOkay, wow, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.400\nThis gives it a little bit more color.\n\n52\n00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.670\nWe can see, wow, who's the orange one?\n\n53\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.678\nThat's Bishop.\n\n54\n00:02:39.678 --> 00:02:42.960\nI come over here, orange is Bishop.\n\n55\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.699\nAnd sleep, I can see it down here\nat the bottom that is the activity.\n\n56\n00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.732\nI have some nice labels.\n\n57\n00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:50.520\nI say, okay, this is the hours in the day.\n\n58\n00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.750\nAnd yeap,\nthat column right there is the highest.\n\n59\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.060\nSo we can see, that yeah, sleeping takes\nthe cake with the activities of a cat,\n\n60\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.020\nwhich is usually true, at least for mine.\n\n61\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.856\nSo this is going to be that graphical\nrepresentation of our data and we're gonna\n\n62\n00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:14.181\nlearn how to be able to actually create\nthis type of clustered column chart.\n\n63\n00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:17.620\nRight there, getting in that\nterminology of what is this?\n\n64\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.730\nI'm sure we've all probably seen\nthese before in presentations.\n\n65\n00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.030\nBut did you know it was\na clustered column?\n\n66\n00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.638\nDid you know that across the bottom\nthis is known as the category axis?\n\n67\n00:03:29.638 --> 00:03:32.163\nIf you really think about it, it's like,\n\n68\n00:03:32.163 --> 00:03:35.320\nalright if we're looking\nat the activities of a cat,\n\n69\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.758\nwell what categories of activities do\nwe have and what are we comparing?\n\n70\n00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:43.986\nWe're comparing Fuego and\nBishop to each other but\n\n71\n00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:48.418\nwe're also comparing across\nall of our categories.\n\n72\n00:03:48.418 --> 00:03:51.254\nSo again those words that Microsoft, and\n\n73\n00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:57.005\nreally just charts in general I would say,\nuse to say, hey, those orange columns,\n\n74\n00:03:57.005 --> 00:04:01.642\nthat's known as a data series and\nthe bottoms are your activities.\n\n75\n00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:05.602\nAnd the value axis, that's the one\nthat's going up the vertical and so\n\n76\n00:04:05.602 --> 00:04:07.230\nthese are your hours.\n\n77\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.392\nAnd then what is orange and what is blue?\n\n78\n00:04:10.392 --> 00:04:12.270\nWell then that's the legend.\n\n79\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.537\nThat's going to give you the labels that\nare associated with those data series.\n\n80\n00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:22.643\nThe other thing to notice in this\nparticular slide is notice that right here\n\n81\n00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:26.680\nthere's this little, well,\nit's really just the table.\n\n82\n00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.350\nComing back over to here,\nthis is the data for this chart.\n\n83\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.570\nSo where this is coming from is going\nto be in something known as the chart\n\n84\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.020\nin Microsoft, well this says PowerPoint\nbut it's gonna be Word when we use Word.\n\n85\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.278\nSo it's using Excel but not really Excel.\n\n86\n00:04:47.278 --> 00:04:51.301\nIt's this weird, Mid level.\n\n87\n00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:54.680\nWhat do they call that when, Purgatory?\n\n88\n00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.434\n[LAUGH] I think it's the wrong word.\n&gt;&gt; I did not known that Microsoft also had\n\n89\n00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:00.710\na Purgatory setting.\n\n90\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.110\n[LAUGH] I don't know if it's\na good document or bad document.\n\n91\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.125\nThey just kind of hang out there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know why but\n\n92\n00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:14.433\nthat was the only thing that came to my\nmind, that middle ground of where it's\n\n93\n00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:17.390\nnot really all the way Excel but it's not-\n\n94\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.240\n&gt;&gt; Lite?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n95\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's Excel Lite?\n\n96\n00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.187\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, yeah.\n\n97\n00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:23.337\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is very similar.\n\n98\n00:05:23.337 --> 00:05:25.427\nYou see this setup not only in Excel but\n\n99\n00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:28.758\nalso whenever I'm representing\nsome kind of tabular data,\n\n100\n00:05:28.758 --> 00:05:33.480\nwhether I have categories, I have rows and\ncolumns, and there's something there.\n\n101\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.512\nSo a lot of the utilities, very basic\nutilities, if you can represent it as\n\n102\n00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:40.648\na table, then you have some of\nthe utilities that allow for\n\n103\n00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:41.822\ncharting as well.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n104\n00:05:41.822 --> 00:05:44.190\nI like that you said tabular\ndata because that's what it is.\n\n105\n00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.450\nRight here our series,\nthey're going to be in columns and\n\n106\n00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.150\nthe categories are going to be in a row.\n\n107\n00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.440\nSo you have to have that matrix,\nif you wanna say.\n\n108\n00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.030\nAnd how they get that chart information,\nthey are using Excel.\n\n109\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.165\nBut again, not the full version of Excel.\n\n110\n00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:06.735\nAnd we're just gonna skip over\nthat whole Purgatory thing.\n\n111\n00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:09.688\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna skip it, I'm gonna relish\n\n112\n00:06:09.688 --> 00:06:13.084\nit for the rest of the day.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're just in this in between\n\n113\n00:06:13.084 --> 00:06:14.505\nworld, yeah, exactly.\n\n114\n00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:16.053\nOkay, moving on.\n\n115\n00:06:16.053 --> 00:06:21.761\nSo we're gonna move on to some elements\nthat you can within your chart.\n\n116\n00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:25.875\nAnd we recognize the data series and\nthe category axis but\n\n117\n00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:30.671\nthese little lines in here,\nthese are grid lines, the plot area,\n\n118\n00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:34.900\nwhere it's actually plotting\nout this information.\n\n119\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.600\nWhere's the chart area?\n\n120\n00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.040\nThese are the titles of each one of\nthe axes, this is the chart title.\n\n121\n00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.050\nAll of these different things\nare parts that you can\n\n122\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.430\nadd as elements into your chart.\n\n123\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.308\nYour data labels, these little numbers\nthat are on top of your columns or\n\n124\n00:06:51.308 --> 00:06:53.801\nyour series,\nyou could go ahead and add that.\n\n125\n00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:59.889\nThese are all, again, Chart elements\nthat you can control whether or\n\n126\n00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:02.080\nnot you see them or not see them.\n\n127\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.436\nThis is another one that I like.\n\n128\n00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:06.690\nI just put it on a separate slide\njust because it's kinda bigger,\n\n129\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.500\nsomething known as a data table.\n\n130\n00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.390\nThis could be good for things like,\nall right, we're comparing.\n\n131\n00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.140\nI can see definite Bishop likes to sleep\nmore than Fuego, but these numbers down\n\n132\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.670\nhere, you see how it's like 12.4526,\nor 62, sorry I flipped those.\n\n133\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.570\nYou might not want that as data\nlabels on top of the columns but\n\n134\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.160\nyou really want it to show the real value.\n\n135\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.776\nSo maybe having that data table can help\n\n136\n00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:38.170\nshow the numbers again\nin that tabular format.\n\n137\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.570\nNow what am I comparing on my category?\n\n138\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.420\nThis is where it's really\nthe same information,\n\n139\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.550\nit's just flipped into\na different way of comparing it.\n\n140\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.020\nNow you can see all\nthe activities of Fargo and\n\n141\n00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.960\nall the activities of Bishop and\nthen the legend change.\n\n142\n00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.000\nBasically we took the rows and\ncolumns and turned them upside down.\n\n143\n00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.375\nSo this is how we want to compare and\nshow the information,\n\n144\n00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:07.123\nmm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vaughn, how you represent\n\n145\n00:08:07.123 --> 00:08:11.478\nthese whether it be with Fuego and\nBishop as the categorical axis or\n\n146\n00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:16.380\nthe respective activities as the\ncategorical axis instead of the legend,\n\n147\n00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.827\nthat's ultimately context based.\n\n148\n00:08:18.827 --> 00:08:20.300\nWhat do I wanna compare?\n\n149\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.660\nDo I wanna look at the relative\nfrequency of activities for Fuego so\n\n150\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.701\nI can make a determination about Fuego?\n\n151\n00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:27.187\nI'm gonna be honest with you but\n\n152\n00:08:27.187 --> 00:08:30.900\nI'm having a hard time not laughing\nwhen I say Fuego out loud.\n\n153\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.133\nLet's switch to Bishop, or\nI wanted to see Bishop as a whole but\n\n154\n00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:37.193\nthen I also have the ability\nto compare the respective two.\n\n155\n00:08:37.193 --> 00:08:42.837\nIf I were to compare Bishop to Fuego,\nBishop sleeps a lot more than Fuego but\n\n156\n00:08:42.837 --> 00:08:48.110\nin general he still does a lot of\nplaying as just considering Bishop.\n\n157\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.370\nSo, this is where charting gets fun for\nme because how you make these decisions\n\n158\n00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.520\nis very much contextual on what\nyou're trying to present or\n\n159\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.054\nwhat determinations you're trying to make.\n&gt;&gt; You made that sound so smart.\n\n160\n00:09:00.054 --> 00:09:01.343\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n161\n00:09:01.343 --> 00:09:03.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n162\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.990\nWhat is your audience?\n\n163\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.140\nWhat are you trying to communicate?\n\n164\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.692\nThat's huge.\n\n165\n00:09:07.692 --> 00:09:09.680\nAnd a lot of times I have people say,\n\n166\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.920\nI know what I want the chart to say\nI just don't know how to get it.\n\n167\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.010\nAnd that's where learning, one, just the\nterminology and what it actually means and\n\n168\n00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.880\nthen how to get the numbers in the right\nplace and how to format it, and\n\n169\n00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.100\nthis, between this type of chart and\nthis, it's just one little button.\n\n170\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.422\nYou just click and say, flip.\n\n171\n00:09:30.422 --> 00:09:33.890\nBut if know what that really meant,\nthen it wouldn't be that easy.\n\n172\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.231\nSo that's why you're here.\n\n173\n00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:37.030\nAll right, let's keep on moving down here.\n\n174\n00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.190\nSo there's different types of charts.\n\n175\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.741\nNow, this is a line graph.\n\n176\n00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:44.620\nGraph, charts, I feel like\nthey're kind of interchangeable.\n\n177\n00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.060\nI would call this a line graph.\n\n178\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.738\nI wouldn't call it a line chart.\n\n179\n00:09:47.738 --> 00:09:48.620\nI don't know why.\n\n180\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.532\nMaybe it's just my own word but-\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna be honest,\n\n181\n00:09:52.532 --> 00:09:57.990\nI don't call any of the ones in the chart\nselection, charts, except for pie chart.\n\n182\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.800\nMost of the rest of them to me,\njust because of my background, are graphs.\n\n183\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.732\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n184\n00:10:03.732 --> 00:10:04.351\n&gt;&gt; Is a bar graph.\n\n185\n00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:06.040\nThis is a line graph.\n\n186\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.083\nThat's a pie chart.\n\n187\n00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:09.554\nYeah, it's really a pie graph.\n\n188\n00:10:09.554 --> 00:10:13.107\nSo to some extent there\nare interchangeable, and that based on\n\n189\n00:10:13.107 --> 00:10:16.370\nbackground and what you know them as.\n&gt;&gt; And I think that's why I'm like,\n\n190\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.310\nthis is a line graph.\n\n191\n00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:20.550\nI'm in the same boat with you.\n\n192\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.350\nAnd talking about that pie chart,\nthere's one right there, so yep.\n\n193\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.927\nAnd this is, like you were saying,\ntaking Fuego as a whole,\n\n194\n00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:30.746\nand he's a big whole,\nhe's a big massive cat.\n\n195\n00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:34.820\nBut you could see that's probably why\nhe likes to sleep a lot right there.\n\n196\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.670\nSo this is just saying this is one part.\n\n197\n00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:43.600\nAnd this might be the percentage of\nyour 2018 budget, that type of stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.914\nSo one category and multiple series.\n\n199\n00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:50.745\nNo, one series, one category.\n\n200\n00:10:50.745 --> 00:10:52.000\nIt's one and one, isn't it?\n\n201\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.670\nNo.\n\n202\n00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.820\nI'm confusing myself.\n&gt;&gt; It is one, one, ahh!\n\n203\n00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.630\nSee, terminology's hard.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n204\n00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.196\n&gt;&gt; Not gonna lie to you.\n\n205\n00:11:00.196 --> 00:11:03.775\nI would have to go back and referen-,\nbut I would try to be consistent\n\n206\n00:11:03.775 --> 00:11:05.876\non the terminology that I use.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n207\n00:11:05.876 --> 00:11:08.200\n&gt;&gt; I'd be like, okay, this is the series.\n\n208\n00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.917\nIt has multiple categories because\nyou're splitting up a pie chart\n\n209\n00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:13.680\ninto multiple categories.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n210\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.891\n&gt;&gt; And it should be one series,\n\n211\n00:11:14.891 --> 00:11:16.559\nwhich is Fuego, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n212\n00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.770\nI think that's right,\nI can always go back up and look.\n\n213\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n214\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.830\nIt's when we go ahead and pull\nthe numbers, which one's in the column,\n\n215\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.420\nwhich one the rows.\n\n216\n00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.050\nIt's nice that it goes ahead and\ndoes it for us.\n\n217\n00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.510\nSo it's easy.\n\n218\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.300\nSo again, see,\n\n219\n00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.980\nwe're even getting ourselves a little\nconfused as which one it is.\n\n220\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.470\nBut again, this is comparing all\nthe activities of Fuego as a whole.\n\n221\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.485\nThey call this an exploding pie chart.\n\n222\n00:11:38.485 --> 00:11:40.519\nYeap, exactly,\ncuz it's just taking one piece out.\n\n223\n00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:42.651\nWe really wanna emphasize this one.\n\n224\n00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:48.131\nAnd these numbers that are around it,\nthese are your different data labels and\n\n225\n00:11:48.131 --> 00:11:50.799\nhow those data labels are formatted.\n\n226\n00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:52.735\nSo those are all different options.\n\n227\n00:11:52.735 --> 00:11:56.979\nAnd then trying to find how do I format\nthat to show in percentages, those\n\n228\n00:11:56.979 --> 00:12:02.001\nare things we're going to be able to show\nyou throughout these particular episodes.\n\n229\n00:12:02.001 --> 00:12:05.292\nAnd then there's some\nother types of charts.\n\n230\n00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:08.676\nAnd this is where,\nto me [LAUGH] some of these start,\n\n231\n00:12:08.676 --> 00:12:11.604\n[LAUGH] I'm looking over at Justin's face.\n\n232\n00:12:11.604 --> 00:12:13.322\nI feel like it's some piece of origami,\nlike it's a bird.\n\n233\n00:12:13.322 --> 00:12:18.026\nI know there are specific reasons\nwhy you use a surface chart and\n\n234\n00:12:18.026 --> 00:12:22.850\nthere are specific reasons why\nyou would use an area chart.\n\n235\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:28.350\nThis is not necessarily the correct\ndata to be able to show in this manner,\n\n236\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.640\nbut they do serve a purpose.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, areas and surfaces,\n\n237\n00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.990\nthose are very much specific to certain\ntypes of data, as you just said.\n\n238\n00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.650\nYou're gonna know if you need\na surface chart for the most part.\n\n239\n00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.300\nI need to represent these three things and\n\n240\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.928\nlook at how this third thing varies\nas I move along two independent axes.\n\n241\n00:12:48.928 --> 00:12:51.748\nAnd if you have no idea what I'm\ntalking about you probably don't\n\n242\n00:12:51.748 --> 00:12:52.730\nneed a surface chart.\n\n243\n00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.260\nSo from a science background, I know\nwhat I would use a surface chart for.\n\n244\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.370\nBut that doesn't mean that by and\nlarge I used it a great deal.\n\n245\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.680\nArea chart is the same way.\n\n246\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.650\nSo, you'll know if you need these two\nrespective charts, for the most part,\n\n247\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.406\nunless you're just getting started.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I like you said, the science.\n\n248\n00:13:11.406 --> 00:13:16.600\nIn the sciences and the different areas,\nthere was some other once we get into it.\n\n249\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.788\nI can't remember the type of chart but\nthere was this,\n\n250\n00:13:19.788 --> 00:13:24.244\nthey're little blobs basically,\nlike little bubbles, a scatter chart.\n\n251\n00:13:24.244 --> 00:13:29.752\nI was teaching a class for a,\nMining company that did a lot of stuff.\n\n252\n00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:33.172\nHe explained the whole chart to me and\nI was like,\n\n253\n00:13:33.172 --> 00:13:38.177\nthat's fascinating, about the load and\nthe weight and how far away and\n\n254\n00:13:38.177 --> 00:13:42.444\nhow much the tare and\nhow far off from the center it was it was.\n\n255\n00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:45.430\nIt was like, wow,\nthat's really interesting.\n\n256\n00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.400\nI would never use it cuz I don't\nwork in the mining and sciences and\n\n257\n00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.830\nengineering area.\n\n258\n00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.586\nSo, like you said, knowing the information\nas to when you need these,\n\n259\n00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:59.474\nI've never encountered it\nbesides making cool looking,\n\n260\n00:13:59.474 --> 00:14:03.221\ncolorful art pieces that\nreally don't mean anything.\n\n261\n00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:03.995\n[LAUGH] So they're out there.\n\n262\n00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:06.965\nNow once you start\ngetting into your charts,\n\n263\n00:14:06.965 --> 00:14:09.655\nhow do you want to format them, styles?\n\n264\n00:14:09.655 --> 00:14:13.721\nIf you've been watching these episodes,\nyou know I love some styles.\n\n265\n00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:17.110\nThey're just easier to use, honestly.\n\n266\n00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.530\nIt's just like here,\nclick, everything formats.\n\n267\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.780\nThis looks good.\n\n268\n00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.598\nI'm not saying this particular\none is my favorite but\n\n269\n00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:27.430\nit's nice that it goes ahead and\njust has a nice grouping of formatting.\n\n270\n00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.278\nIt does the background colors,\nthe font colors,\n\n271\n00:14:32.278 --> 00:14:35.895\nhow the series are either more together or\nmore apart.\n\n272\n00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:37.857\nYou could see right here\nare some different options.\n\n273\n00:14:37.857 --> 00:14:42.903\nThis is where we actually switch\nthe column and row information,\n\n274\n00:14:42.903 --> 00:14:49.270\nnice monochromatic colors, nice gradient\ngoing on there in the background.\n\n275\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.900\nThis is just another variation, green.\n\n276\n00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.122\nI tend to like the darker backgrounds,\npersonally.\n\n277\n00:14:54.122 --> 00:15:00.420\n[INAUDIBLE] for some reason they\njust look more professional to me.\n\n278\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.630\nSo, personal choice.\nBut it leaves all the styles there.\n\n279\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.248\nOr, you know what?\n\n280\n00:15:02.248 --> 00:15:03.471\nYou could do something like this.\n\n281\n00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:05.787\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Vaughn,\n\n282\n00:15:05.787 --> 00:15:08.579\nI'm feeling compelled to say just\nbecause you can doesn't mean you should.\n\n283\n00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:11.580\nI've said that a bunch in\nsome other episodes but\n\n284\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.288\nI'm gonna have to break that one out.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.115\n&gt;&gt; That's a whole bunch of I don't know\n\n286\n00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:20.350\nwhat's going on.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and its lost its context.\n\n287\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.580\nIt doesn't convey the information that\nyou really actually wanted it to do from\n\n288\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.400\nthe beginning, was to go ahead and\nshow the cat activities.\n\n289\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.380\nIts lost purpose.\n\n290\n00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.331\nYeah.\nJust cuz you can, less is more.\n\n291\n00:15:34.331 --> 00:15:35.183\nDon't do it.\n\n292\n00:15:35.183 --> 00:15:39.435\nYes, I could go ahead and\nput a picture and the bubbles and\n\n293\n00:15:39.435 --> 00:15:44.345\nmy favorite pattern, which is\nthe dead fish in all of that stuff.\n\n294\n00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:46.557\nYou might wanna stay away from it.\n\n295\n00:15:46.557 --> 00:15:51.026\nI would actually have\na competition in my classes of who\n\n296\n00:15:51.026 --> 00:15:53.559\ncould make the ugliest chart.\n\n297\n00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:55.560\nBut it was a good learning experience.\n\n298\n00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.564\nGo ahead and dive deep into all\nof those formatting options and\n\n299\n00:15:59.564 --> 00:16:02.647\nsee how messed up you can\nmake your charts look.\n\n300\n00:16:02.647 --> 00:16:05.010\nSo, this one might take\nfirst place I think.\n\n301\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.046\n&gt;&gt; This might be a pretty good party\n\n302\n00:16:08.046 --> 00:16:08.612\ngame too.\n\n303\n00:16:08.612 --> 00:16:11.032\nIf you get a bunch of techy\nindividuals together,\n\n304\n00:16:11.032 --> 00:16:12.501\nwho can make the worst chart?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n305\n00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:15.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna vote on it.\n\n306\n00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:16.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.370\n&gt;&gt; There's ten bucks in the pot.\n\n308\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that should be an\n\n309\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.580\nactivity at our next edutainers meeting.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, I agree.\n\n310\n00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.637\n&gt;&gt; I think so too.\n\n311\n00:16:24.637 --> 00:16:25.985\n&gt;&gt; That's the last slide I\n\n312\n00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.618\nhave in this presentation.\n\n313\n00:16:27.618 --> 00:16:32.332\nAgain, just showing you examples,\ngiving you the opportunity,\n\n314\n00:16:32.332 --> 00:16:35.710\njust listen to how we\nare talking about things.\n\n315\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.566\nAnd in the next episodes\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n316\n00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:42.620\nget into actually inserting the chart and\nmaking it look all pretty.\n\n317\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.540\nSo just remember,\ndata series, chart elements.\n\n318\n00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.008\nThe nice thing is all of this is pretty\nmuch labeled within our program.\n\n319\n00:16:51.008 --> 00:16:55.170\nAnd if you've done charts in PowerPoint,\nyou've done them in Word too.\n\n320\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.959\nIt's just now within the context\nof it is a graphical element.\n\n321\n00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:04.399\nAnd that's something we will talk\nabout in the design episode where\n\n322\n00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:09.560\nit is a picture so you treat it as\na picture in your Word document.\n\n323\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.120\nYou're doing a huge report for\nyour company and\n\n324\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.730\nyou want to be put off to\nthe side to show something and\n\n325\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.480\nall the text wrap around it,\nwhat are you gonna need to apply?\n\n326\n00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.020\nThe word wrap and understand about\npositioning and those different things\n\n327\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:26.100\nthat we've covered in some of our\nother episodes with images and tables.\n\n328\n00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.390\nSo that's why this is in the graphical\nelements topic within Words, and\n\n329\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.638\nyou have to treat it that way.\n\n330\n00:17:31.638 --> 00:17:36.490\nSo we will review some of those different\nsettings and buttons to push to\n\n331\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.056\nmake sure that you can get it in the place\nthat you want to within your Word document\n\n332\n00:17:41.056 --> 00:17:43.650\nto communicate your information.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vaughn,\n\n333\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:44.850\nI'm pretty excited about this.\n\n334\n00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.460\nThis is bringing back a little bit of\nnostalgia from my previous experiences.\n\n335\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.240\nSo I'm ready for these upcoming episodes.\n\n336\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.700\nAnd hopefully, you are as well.\n\n337\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.120\nSo definitely join us on back as we\ncontinue learning about charts in Word.\n\n338\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.140\nAnd well, for now,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n339\n00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.010\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n340\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.726\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n341\n00:18:01.726 --> 00:18:02.649\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n342\n00:18:02.649 -->

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:17.818\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:21.897\nwe're continuing our Microsoft Word\n2016 Advanced for Mac series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:24.686\nAnd well we're gonna learn\nhow to actually create and\n\n6\n00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:26.862\nstart laying out charts in this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:26.862 --> 00:00:32.127\nAnd luckily we have the chart queen\nin the studio today, Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:32.873\nHow are you doing today Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:34.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling queeny.\n\n10\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:37.034\n&gt;&gt; I don't, I think that's a good\n\n12\n00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:37.715\nadjective [CROSSTALK].\n\n13\n00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:38.704\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n[LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:39.504\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, I don't know.\n\n15\n00:00:39.504 --> 00:00:43.107\nBut yeah, you probably know\na little bit more about charts than\n\n16\n00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:47.672\nI do in the context of Word so I'm glad\nyou're here and it's not me on that side.\n\n17\n00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:51.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny cuz when we were\ntalking in between our shows you\n\n18\n00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.592\nwere telling me all about your\nSurface charts and doing like time and\n\n19\n00:00:54.592 --> 00:00:55.780\nfrequency and drums.\n\n20\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.780\nWe were talking about drums and the sound\nand how it does the Surface stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.880\nIt was It was really entertaining,\nand quite enjoyable to listen to.\n\n22\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.871\nSo it made me feel like, I have no clue\nwhat you're talking about [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:10.795\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I feel like a walking\nepisode of Reading Rainbow or something.\n\n24\n00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:12.459\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Seriously.\n\n25\n00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:16.391\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I know a lot about a lot,\n&gt;&gt; But I'm not, that's all I know.\n\n26\n00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:17.009\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n\n27\n00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.979\nI'm just like wow that's cool.\n\n28\n00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.602\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like knowing enough of another\n\n29\n00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:22.138\nlanguage to tell you I\ndon't know that language.\n\n30\n00:01:22.138 --> 00:01:23.784\nSo that's effectively what I feel like.\n\n31\n00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nwell those I thought it was great.\n\n32\n00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:29.759\nSo it made me give a little bit\nmore insight into charts, but\n\n33\n00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.011\nyes how to insert charts into Word.\n\n34\n00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:35.595\nYeah, I might have that\none down pretty good so.\n\n35\n00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.200\nWell I hope so because that's\nwhat we're [LAUGH] going to.\n\n36\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.891\nWe're going to insert into our Word\ndocument, and then go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:43.853\njust kinda get the numbers into it.\n\n38\n00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:47.911\nThen how to make it look pretty,\nthat's going to be the next episode, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:52.520\nBut, you gotta get the material in\nthere to be able to start working.\n\n40\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.494\nSo we're gonna start with a brand new\nfile, and just to get the chart into it.\n\n41\n00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:03.458\nAnd then how we treat it within the rest\nof the context of your Word document\n\n42\n00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:06.034\nwith words and everything like that.\n\n43\n00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:08.431\nAgain, that's in the other episode too.\n\n44\n00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:10.730\nSo why don't we go ahead and get started?\n\n45\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.319\nYou know what?\n\n46\n00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.322\nI didn't open up a new Word document,\nthat's fine,\n\n47\n00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:16.005\nI do have it pinned down here.\n\n48\n00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:20.547\nIn my doc cuz I just wanted to make the\ndock a little bit smaller to keep it out\n\n49\n00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:21.296\nof the way.\n\n50\n00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:24.415\nSo I'll go ahead and\nstart a blank new document here.\n\n51\n00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.289\nI will double click it because\nI was single clicking it.\n\n52\n00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:28.561\n[LAUGH] And there we go.\n\n53\n00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:30.082\nWe've got everything.\n\n54\n00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:33.996\nI'm zoomed in a little bit,\nwe'll play with that as we go along.\n\n55\n00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:37.874\nSo got my cursor in the place\nwhere I want to insert the chart,\n\n56\n00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:41.050\nwhich is in a blank file so it's fine.\n\n57\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.630\nWe're gonna go over to\nthe Insert Tab on ribbon.\n\n58\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.290\nAnd from here we will come to our\ndifferent illustrations and go to Chart.\n\n59\n00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.780\nNotice there's a drop down right here\nbecause then it's gonna tell you,\n\n60\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.290\nwell hey, what type of chart do you want?\n\n61\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.120\nAnd that's where, there's those surface\ncharts that we were talking about in\n\n62\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.970\nthat introduction and\nin between the episodes.\n\n63\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.450\nWe were also talking about like\nthese radar and scatter charts.\n\n64\n00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.478\nAgain, charts that, probably,\nI think we said what?\n\n65\n00:03:08.478 --> 00:03:12.770\n95%, maybe 90% of the people out\nthere probably wont be using,\n\n66\n00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.390\nbecause they are very specific to whatever\nindustry or the data that you're using, so\n\n67\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.710\nwe're gonna stick with the very easy one.\n\n68\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.090\nWe're gonna go with the cluster,\nclustered column charts.\n\n69\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.470\nWe're not gonna get into the 3Dness and\neverything,\n\n70\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.870\nlet's just kinda keep it basic,\ncuz we can always come back and\n\n71\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.590\nchange the type of chart that\nwe're using bar information later.\n\n72\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.016\nSo let's get that in there, and notice\nwhat's gonna happen as soon as I click it,\n\n73\n00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:40.790\nyou see how it's like,\nwait, so we're in Excel?\n\n74\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.332\n[LAUGH] This is a place where I was\nsaying purgatory in last our episode.\n\n75\n00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:52.054\nWhich is like, that's the wrong\nconnotation for this particular episode.\n\n76\n00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:55.098\nAnd really, I hope you don't feel\nthat way about our Excel products or\n\n77\n00:03:55.098 --> 00:03:57.820\nour Word products or\nany Microsoft products.\n\n78\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.678\nSometimes feel like that, but\nthis is where we are using and\n\n79\n00:04:02.678 --> 00:04:06.379\nopening up Excel to be\nable to chart our data.\n\n80\n00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.053\nNow notice it says chart\nin Microsoft Office Word.\n\n81\n00:04:11.053 --> 00:04:15.880\nSo you're not creating an Excel file and\nsaving it somewhere,\n\n82\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.339\nit's just the mechanism, if you wanna say,\n\n83\n00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:24.367\nthat they're using for\nyou to be able to get that information in.\n\n84\n00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:27.945\nBut what I would suggest is just\nstart rearranging your Windows.\n\n85\n00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:32.235\nIf I just take this, and\nI'm just gonna come up to the top corner,\n\n86\n00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:36.525\nmaybe move this down, get my two\npointed arrow on the corner, and\n\n87\n00:04:36.525 --> 00:04:41.520\nI'm just resizing Excel,\nto show you that, look, this is charting.\n\n88\n00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.160\nThese are the numbers that is\nappearing in this particular chart.\n\n89\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.790\nThen I come over here in Word,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n90\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.980\nsize this guy down to a little bit, so\njust so we can kinda see it side by side,\n\n91\n00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.490\nand maybe zoom in these numbers so\nyou can see them a little bit bigger.\n\n92\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.200\nAnd I will take this document up here,\nmaybe zoom out just a little bit so\n\n93\n00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.270\nwe can kind of see everything\nworking in tandem together.\n\n94\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.840\nAnd this is always gonna happen when you\ngo to insert a chart in Word, it's gonna\n\n95\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.150\nautomatically pull up Excel, which really\nthrows people off and then they close it.\n\n96\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.930\nAnd they're like wait,\n\n97\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.430\nwhy do I have all of these bars in\nmy chart that I never put in there?\n\n98\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.970\nIt's just the placeholder information.\n\n99\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.890\nThat it is showing you over here in Excel,\nand this is where it's nice that it does\n\n100\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.040\nlabel those things like this is category\none, and then category one where is that?\n\n101\n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.275\nThat's along the bottom\nin our category access.\n\n102\n00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:40.385\nWhere's our series?\n\n103\n00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:44.485\nSeries 1, that's the blue columns, and\n\n104\n00:05:44.485 --> 00:05:47.095\nthat shows you down that legend,\nit's trying to show you.\n\n105\n00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:48.775\nSo it's nice that it's going to,\n\n106\n00:05:48.775 --> 00:05:54.075\nin real time, change as you\nstart changing things around.\n\n107\n00:05:54.075 --> 00:05:59.600\nSo you can see right now, it starts off\nwith four categories and three series.\n\n108\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.670\nOkay, well, that's nice,\nbut I don't need that.\n\n109\n00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.650\nWhat if I'm only,\nmaybe I only have three categories.\n\n110\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.490\nI need to compare, and two series?\n\n111\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.305\nI need to compare Bishop and Fuego.\n\n112\n00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:13.540\nSo those are going to be my two series.\n\n113\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.323\nAnd I need to do just eating,\nsleeping, and meowing.\n\n114\n00:06:17.323 --> 00:06:19.835\nI only need three not four.\n\n115\n00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:21.458\nHow do I do that?\n\n116\n00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:26.184\nCouple different ways that you can do\nsome data manipulation within your\n\n117\n00:06:26.184 --> 00:06:27.584\nchart information.\n\n118\n00:06:27.584 --> 00:06:30.907\nSo fixing the notice right here,\nit's really small but\n\n119\n00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:35.362\nyou see there's this little kinda\ntriangle right there at the bottom, and\n\n120\n00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.370\nif I hover over it It's this weird icon.\n\n121\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.850\nBecause that's where that\nbottom triangular thing,\n\n122\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.520\nthat's the boundary of what's\ngoing to show on the chart.\n\n123\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.920\nLet me zoom back out here.\n\n124\n00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.720\nIf I took this, and\nI just move In one and up one.\n\n125\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.740\nNotice how it's kind of showing like\nthe green, kind of shading it in green.\n\n126\n00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.410\nSo it's really light on the screen and\n\n127\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.490\nkeeping where as white, that's where\nit's going to keep the information.\n\n128\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.920\nSo I'm clicking and holding and\nas soon as I let go, you see how that\n\n129\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.140\ndetermines the boundary what is\ngoing to show up in the chart.\n\n130\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.660\nI didn't delete anything.\n\n131\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.510\nI'm just changing where this\nlittle trianglely thing goes.\n\n132\n00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.500\nAnd I can even move it out further down.\n\n133\n00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.902\nAnd so while there's no labels for it,\n\n134\n00:07:20.902 --> 00:07:26.583\nit is giving me three places, or\nI guess, sorry two more places.\n\n135\n00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:29.219\nThis, yes, that would be six.\n\n136\n00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:30.043\nWow, okay.\n\n137\n00:07:30.043 --> 00:07:30.711\nMath.\n\n138\n00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.634\n[LAUGH] And we, [LAUGH] I go, math.\n\n139\n00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:35.249\nThat's not six, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:38.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So notice that that can,\n\n141\n00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.248\nthat throws people off too.\n\n142\n00:07:40.248 --> 00:07:43.525\nWhy is this changing?\n\n143\n00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:44.676\nBut there's no information.\n\n144\n00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:46.037\nBut it's showing spaces.\n\n145\n00:07:46.037 --> 00:07:50.409\nBut there's numbers in the chart data\nthat's not showing in the chart.\n\n146\n00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:55.167\nAll right, so just be aware of that\nparticular little button down there\n\n147\n00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:58.670\nit's really small too and\nthat will change things.\n\n148\n00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.310\nSo I could go ahead and\nmove this to here And\n\n149\n00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.690\nthat would be my two series and\nthree categories.\n\n150\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.475\nBut I'm gonna move that back\nout cuz I don't want this.\n\n151\n00:08:10.475 --> 00:08:13.989\nSo if I select these cells and\nif you have used this Excel,\n\n152\n00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:18.532\nyou wanna get like the little white\nplus sign and it's dragging across and\n\n153\n00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:21.558\nthen I just delete it,\nI just hit the Delete key.\n\n154\n00:08:21.558 --> 00:08:27.288\nSee again, just because it's not there,\nyou got to be really careful about it.\n\n155\n00:08:27.288 --> 00:08:29.274\nBut let me undo that,\nI just did a command Z there.\n\n156\n00:08:29.274 --> 00:08:35.882\nIf I took the whole row,\nif I want the row, the number five.\n\n157\n00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.382\n[LAUGH] Wow, that was right there.\n\n158\n00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:40.901\nAnd I go ahead and\ndelete the row, right there.\n\n159\n00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:44.570\nNotice how that did move\nthat little button up.\n\n160\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:50.510\nSo selecting the cell and deleting them is\nnot the same as the deleting the row or\n\n161\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:56.453\nthe column headers, that's what it is,\nthe row headers and column headers.\n\n162\n00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:57.675\nThat's right, come on,\nfind that label there.\n\n163\n00:08:57.675 --> 00:09:00.675\n[LAUGH] So if I delete that from here,\n\n164\n00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:04.485\nthat moves the little\ngreen triangly thing.\n\n165\n00:09:04.485 --> 00:09:09.678\nAnd will actually change\nthe charted information or\n\n166\n00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:13.460\nthe charted data in the actual chart.\n\n167\n00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.470\nAgain, it's small things.\n\n168\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.540\nAnd that's why people get so, like, upset.\n\n169\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.463\nThey feel like they are in purgatory.\n\n170\n00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:22.277\nI just deleted.\n\n171\n00:09:22.277 --> 00:09:23.216\nIt won't change it.\n\n172\n00:09:23.216 --> 00:09:28.383\nYou gotta kinda just watch where\nthe boundaries of the chartable data is,\n\n173\n00:09:28.383 --> 00:09:29.979\nso, just be careful.\n\n174\n00:09:29.979 --> 00:09:36.611\nIf I came back into here and typed in\nCat 4, talk about hurricanes, I don't.\n\n175\n00:09:36.611 --> 00:09:41.898\nWell, I guess for people in Florida\nthat's a trigger word right there.\n\n176\n00:09:41.898 --> 00:09:43.116\nLike, definitely hurricanes.\n\n177\n00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:44.200\nIf you're out in Kansas you're like, what?\n\n178\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.582\nI guess then we'd be more in\ntornado areas, wouldn't we?\n\n179\n00:09:46.582 --> 00:09:48.115\nCat 4 tornadoes?\n\n180\n00:09:48.115 --> 00:09:50.954\n&gt;&gt; There's still lots of wind and\n\n181\n00:09:50.954 --> 00:09:55.873\nrain associated with both\nof those horrible storms.\n\n182\n00:09:55.873 --> 00:10:00.195\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well I am, pergatory, tornadoes,\nand hurricanes, what is going on?\n\n183\n00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:02.012\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know whether I should be\n\n184\n00:10:02.012 --> 00:10:02.825\nexcited about charts or\n\n185\n00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:05.035\njust kind of downtrodden because\nof the topics we keep bring up.\n\n186\n00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:07.102\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\nhow do I get on these tangents?\n\n187\n00:10:07.102 --> 00:10:11.432\nOkay, let's stop talking about squirrels\n[LAUGH] and come back down into here.\n\n188\n00:10:11.432 --> 00:10:13.720\nSo notice that if I add this in,\n\n189\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.737\nonce I start adding data it will\nstart going ahead and modifying it.\n\n190\n00:10:18.737 --> 00:10:20.288\nAnd I just use my Tab key, and\n\n191\n00:10:20.288 --> 00:10:24.438\nnotice it's kind of getting to the end\nof that line and going back down here.\n\n192\n00:10:24.438 --> 00:10:26.030\nSo I was like, nope,\nI didn't really need that.\n\n193\n00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.850\nSo I'll just move that back up.\n\n194\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.150\nAnd if I did want to go ahead and\ncompare another cat.\n\n195\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.650\nYou're like wait, we have series,\nwe have cats, what are we doing here?\n\n196\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.780\nSo if I did that,\nnotice how that little button.\n\n197\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.059\nSo if you start adding information.\n\n198\n00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:42.776\nYou usually will go ahead and\nmove that thing around to include it but\n\n199\n00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:46.270\nthe deleting can be a little\nmisleading there so.\n\n200\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:51.152\n&gt;&gt; So I guess everything that we want\nto compare, both and categories,\n\n201\n00:10:51.152 --> 00:10:56.125\nI need to have a contiguously bounded\narea in order for this to work, correct?\n\n202\n00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.340\n&gt;&gt; Another good point, yes.\n\n203\n00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.629\nIt does need to be contiguous.\n\n204\n00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:59.791\nIt has to be touching each other.\n\n205\n00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:03.789\nYes, it does have to be within\none series of information or\n\n206\n00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:06.002\none contiguous range of cells.\n\n207\n00:11:06.002 --> 00:11:13.074\n&gt;&gt; So I can't so something like,\ncommand or shift, or like select cat 1 and\n\n208\n00:11:13.074 --> 00:11:18.104\ncat 3 and\neasily get that to display just those two?\n\n209\n00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:18.924\nI would just more or\n\n210\n00:11:18.924 --> 00:11:22.371\nless try to rearrange that where I can\nblock out with the little green triangle.\n\n211\n00:11:22.371 --> 00:11:23.068\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n212\n00:11:23.068 --> 00:11:24.358\n&gt;&gt; Those two respective categories.\n\n213\n00:11:24.358 --> 00:11:27.041\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou can delete this whole row.\n\n214\n00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:30.851\nLike where category two is, you could\ndelete the row and then category one and\n\n215\n00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:32.733\nthree will then be next to each other.\n\n216\n00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:37.250\nSo how you organize it, what comes first?\n\n217\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.150\nLike, one two three four, or\nif I wanted it to be three two four one.\n\n218\n00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.580\nYou do have to make sure that you\nhave it in that particular order.\n\n219\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.260\nBut I do like that it starts with that\nplace hold data, so that you could see it.\n\n220\n00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.030\nAnd then really, just fill it in.\n\n221\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.420\nAnd that's where, category one,\nwell that's what we're gonna go ahead and\n\n222\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.660\ntype in sleep.\n\n223\n00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.780\nOkay, so\nyou just select the cell and type.\n\n224\n00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.580\nCategory two, that's where we're\ngoing to talk about eating, right?\n\n225\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.210\nWe're going to sleep, eat,\nand then we're going to meow.\n\n226\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:07.620\nAnd this is going to be Fungo,\nand this is going to be Bishop.\n\n227\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.480\nAnd then I'm going to delete the whole\nrow, no this is a column, sorry but\n\n228\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.490\nwe're doing the whole column.\n\n229\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.630\nGo ahead and delete the whole row.\n\n230\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.580\nMove that around.\n\n231\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.350\nYeah, so it's nice.\n\n232\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.850\nYou just kinda start\nmaking sure you add or\n\n233\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.070\nremove until you get what\nyou want down in there.\n\n234\n00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.139\n&gt;&gt; And it does seem like\nthere's an auto update, but\n\n235\n00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:30.170\nwhen you were typing the labels,\nthere's just a wee touch of lag.\n\n236\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.830\nSo make sure you're giving\nan appropriate amount\n\n237\n00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.820\nof time before you're\nlike this isn't working.\n\n238\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.850\nWhen you're typing labels cuz it's\ndoing some syncing processes that hey,\n\n239\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:39.844\njust give it time.\n\n240\n00:12:39.844 --> 00:12:42.774\nAs someone who's drawn\ncharts like this by hand,\n\n241\n00:12:42.774 --> 00:12:45.163\nthis is way easier than the hand method.\n\n242\n00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:46.957\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely yeah and\n\n243\n00:12:46.957 --> 00:12:50.468\nit does kind of walk you\nthrough what you need to do.\n\n244\n00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:54.108\nSo perfect, I've got enough\ninformation here to have my Tthree,\n\n245\n00:12:54.108 --> 00:12:57.560\nI just went ahead and\nmade it three categories instead of four.\n\n246\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.478\nAnd our two series Fuego and\nBishop and now I'm done.\n\n247\n00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:04.547\nI just need to close out of something,\n\n248\n00:13:04.547 --> 00:13:07.910\nthis is where the other things\nlike I'm supposed to save it and\n\n249\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.306\nmake sure that I don't no, it's okay,\nremember, it's not a full Excel file so\n\n250\n00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:15.887\nif I just I'm gonna do Command Q,\nbecause I am used to doing that.\n\n251\n00:13:15.887 --> 00:13:19.649\nBut if I quit out of Excel,\nI don't need this.\n\n252\n00:13:19.649 --> 00:13:24.255\nOop, no, it's fine, yeah.\n\n253\n00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:27.210\nBecause it's really just the vehicle for\ngetting in that chart information.\n\n254\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.873\nSo now I've got a chart in Word.\n\n255\n00:13:30.873 --> 00:13:32.672\nYay, we're good.\n\n256\n00:13:32.672 --> 00:13:36.969\nNow things to look for when you\nstart working in charts in Word or\n\n257\n00:13:36.969 --> 00:13:41.186\nreally any program for\nthat matter is all about what your mouse\n\n258\n00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:45.508\ncursor looks like and\nwhat it looks like within Word right now.\n\n259\n00:13:45.508 --> 00:13:49.406\nNotice that we've got this big\nkinda box around this whole chart,\n\n260\n00:13:49.406 --> 00:13:51.296\nbecause the chart is selected.\n\n261\n00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:54.713\nI know it's selected cuz\nof the bounding box and\n\n262\n00:13:54.713 --> 00:13:59.340\nI've got two contextual tabs that\nhave come up on my ribbon now.\n\n263\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:04.460\nI have a chart design tab and\nI have a format tab.\n\n264\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.380\nYou can see that these are only going to\ncome up when we have the chart selected.\n\n265\n00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.640\nJust like all of our different objects.\n\n266\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.670\nImages and\ntables always get those contests for tabs.\n\n267\n00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.460\nIf I click off into some blank area\noff to the right now is that the table\n\n268\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.320\nthis is not a table this is a chart\nchart not selected don't see those tabs.\n\n269\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.790\nJust like with all our graphical elements\nmaking sure you look at your mouse cursor\n\n270\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.500\nicon is important.\n\n271\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.530\nNow notice if I hover just kind of right\nin this area, I get a four pointed arrow\n\n272\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.660\nright there, if I single click on it,\nthen that's going to select it.\n\n273\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.410\nJust like with tables, there's so many\ndifferent mouse cursor icons in a table.\n\n274\n00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.560\nWith charts, there's a lot of different\nplaces or elements of a chart But\n\n275\n00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:54.500\nyou can be hovering over and then when you\nclick it, you're going to be selecting it.\n\n276\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.630\nThe thing to watch for, and I'll just\nclick it off to deselect it, notice how\n\n277\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:06.070\nthe tooltips that come up with my mouse is\nnot really the mouse cursor icon changing.\n\n278\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.676\nThat was more in tables.\n\n279\n00:15:07.676 --> 00:15:12.112\nWith charts, it's going to tell you,\nfrom that tool tip,\n\n280\n00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:15.236\nthat right here, this is the chart area.\n\n281\n00:15:15.236 --> 00:15:18.705\nThat wonderful introduction,\nwhy I tell you all this stuff.\n\n282\n00:15:18.705 --> 00:15:19.871\nThis is the plot area.\n\n283\n00:15:19.871 --> 00:15:23.112\nHovering right there, that's my grid line.\n\n284\n00:15:23.112 --> 00:15:25.517\nThis is a data series.\n\n285\n00:15:25.517 --> 00:15:27.369\nThis is another data series.\n\n286\n00:15:27.369 --> 00:15:28.670\nThis is my chart title.\n\n287\n00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.202\nThis is my chart area.\n\n288\n00:15:30.202 --> 00:15:34.693\nSo all of these different little,\nthat's the legend down there.\n\n289\n00:15:34.693 --> 00:15:39.540\nSo watch that cuz that's going\nto be your biggest indication as\n\n290\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.198\nto what am I going to be selecting.\n\n291\n00:15:42.198 --> 00:15:47.689\nIf I click that right now, see how\nthe bounding box is around the legend.\n\n292\n00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:50.305\nClick here, now we're on the title,\nnow we're on the series,\n\n293\n00:15:50.305 --> 00:15:52.305\nnow we're on the grid lines,\nNow we're on the.\n\n294\n00:15:52.305 --> 00:15:54.301\nWell, there's the grid lines,\nthere's the plot area.\n\n295\n00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:56.592\nSo be very careful about that part.\n\n296\n00:15:56.592 --> 00:15:59.076\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I missed this,\nbecause I was like you know,\n\n297\n00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:00.973\nactually I never paid attention to that.\n\n298\n00:16:00.973 --> 00:16:04.849\nInteresting, I'm like, okay, so\nyou poked a peek at what it is.\n\n299\n00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:05.804\nGot it.\n\n300\n00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:07.503\nBut then that cursor's\nactually changing the loop.\n\n301\n00:16:07.503 --> 00:16:12.062\nI mean it's still doing the same thing\nas selecting areas and grid lines.\n\n302\n00:16:12.062 --> 00:16:16.388\nWhat's the difference between\njust the regular mouse cursor and\n\n303\n00:16:16.388 --> 00:16:20.410\nthe triple or\nthe little round about, square?\n\n304\n00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.340\nI can still select, select the grid\nlines verses the chart area.\n\n305\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.410\nBut why is the cursor different?\n\n306\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.118\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's really more of when\nyou have the four pointed arrow,\n\n307\n00:16:29.118 --> 00:16:32.479\nthat's what I call that, that indicatates\nthat you can move something, okay.\n\n308\n00:16:32.479 --> 00:16:36.678\nSo for example if I'm on the chart title,\nso I clicked it,\n\n309\n00:16:36.678 --> 00:16:42.447\nif I hover on the edge, you see how that\nlittle kind of top of the arrow goes away.\n\n310\n00:16:42.447 --> 00:16:45.516\nBecause now I'm over\nthe said selected item and\n\n311\n00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:50.818\nnow just the four pointed arrows come up,\nwhich means I couldn't move it, okay.\n\n312\n00:16:50.818 --> 00:16:51.967\nI'm just gonna undo that for right now.\n\n313\n00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:55.186\nBut if I hover in there,\nyou see how now it's now I-beam,\n\n314\n00:16:55.186 --> 00:16:59.279\ncuz now I'm inside of the selected\nelement that is indicating with text.\n\n315\n00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:02.159\nSo there is where you have those slight\n\n316\n00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:05.493\nchanges as to what\nthe mouse cursor does do.\n\n317\n00:17:05.493 --> 00:17:09.135\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the four pointed arrow is\nindicative of an element that I can move\n\n318\n00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:11.864\nwith an actual mouse move,\nlike [SOUND] click and drag.\n\n319\n00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:12.590\n&gt;&gt; Click and drag.\n\n320\n00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.585\n&gt;&gt; But then like the gridlines,\nthat four pointed arrow goes away,\n\n321\n00:17:15.585 --> 00:17:18.208\nlike the individual gridline,\nnotice how it goes away?\n\n322\n00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:19.763\n&gt;&gt; It does, mm-hm.\n\n323\n00:17:19.763 --> 00:17:23.238\n&gt;&gt; I can't move the whole grid line,\nit shows me little pop ups at the end.\n\n324\n00:17:23.238 --> 00:17:25.158\nI can change those though, right?\n\n325\n00:17:25.158 --> 00:17:27.487\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You could format them.\n\n326\n00:17:27.487 --> 00:17:28.240\n&gt;&gt; You could change the thickness.\n\n327\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.638\nAnd that is, I mean, you don't really\nmove the gridlines on a chart.\n\n328\n00:17:31.638 --> 00:17:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's why I was like,\nI'm trying to figure this out.\n\n329\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.893\n&gt;&gt; But man, I'm loving how detailed you're\ngetting on that because like you said,\n\n330\n00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:40.450\nI never pay attention to them.\n\n331\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.246\nA lot of people don't.\n\n332\n00:17:41.246 --> 00:17:43.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] And then they start click,\n\n333\n00:17:43.776 --> 00:17:44.616\nclick, click.\n\n334\n00:17:44.616 --> 00:17:45.759\nThey get all click happy.\n\n335\n00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:47.279\nAnd then they're like, it's not working.\n\n336\n00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:49.443\nIt's like, slow down and\nlook at what you're clicking on.\n\n337\n00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.985\nYeah, you can't move these.\n\n338\n00:17:50.985 --> 00:17:55.203\nBut the chart title I can move\nif I'm in the right place as to\n\n339\n00:17:55.203 --> 00:17:57.022\nwhat's going on there.\n\n340\n00:17:57.022 --> 00:17:58.798\nSo, slow down.\n\n341\n00:17:58.798 --> 00:18:00.109\nTake a breath.\n\n342\n00:18:00.109 --> 00:18:01.624\nWhat am I doing?\n\n343\n00:18:01.624 --> 00:18:02.524\nWhat do I wanna do?\n\n344\n00:18:02.524 --> 00:18:03.625\nWhere am I?\n\n345\n00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.029\nAll of those wonderful things.\n\n346\n00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:08.068\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm glad you told me that because\nI want to move these grid lines, and\n\n347\n00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:10.469\nVonne told me if I click on it,\nI should be able to move it but\n\n348\n00:18:10.469 --> 00:18:12.018\nthat's not actually what she said.\n\n349\n00:18:12.018 --> 00:18:16.600\nThe four-pointed arrow indicates that\nthis probably a movable component\n\n350\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.740\nof said chart.\n\n351\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.634\nIf you don't have that, then I can't\nmove it, those grid lines are,\n\n352\n00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:22.967\nthey are what they are.\n\n353\n00:18:22.967 --> 00:18:25.788\nAnd that makes sense from\nthe capacity of charts,\n\n354\n00:18:25.788 --> 00:18:29.887\nif you could move them then I could\nthen manipulate how the information is\n\n355\n00:18:29.887 --> 00:18:32.998\npresented without being\nclear that I manipulated it.\n\n356\n00:18:32.998 --> 00:18:35.884\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it all becomes individual graphic\n\n357\n00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:38.357\nelements, those are lines\nthe are rectangles.\n\n358\n00:18:38.357 --> 00:18:41.677\nThese are text boxes.\n\n359\n00:18:41.677 --> 00:18:46.241\nNo, they do mean something all together,\nso great points.\n\n360\n00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:48.971\nAnd some of those things like,\nfor example, the whole chart,\n\n361\n00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:50.474\nyou might get a two pointed arrow.\n\n362\n00:18:50.474 --> 00:18:54.509\nTwo pointed arrow is going to be where\nyou can resize these things, okay?\n\n363\n00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.472\nSo great observations.\n\n364\n00:18:57.472 --> 00:18:58.725\nI like it.\n\n365\n00:18:58.725 --> 00:19:00.481\nWhen I'm back here on my chart and\n\n366\n00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:03.250\nI've now I know that I can\nselect different pieces.\n\n367\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.454\nAnd why would you want to\nselect them like we said or\n\n368\n00:19:05.454 --> 00:19:07.407\nlike what I said you're gonna format them.\n\n369\n00:19:07.407 --> 00:19:11.316\nBut the other episode we'll get\ninto the prettiness later or\n\n370\n00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:14.925\nthe ugliness really for\nmaking it as crazy as we want to.\n\n371\n00:19:14.925 --> 00:19:19.929\nBut let's come back over here to this\nchart design tab and the contextual tab.\n\n372\n00:19:19.929 --> 00:19:24.538\nIt doesn't really matter what\nI'm clicked on necessarily, but\n\n373\n00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:27.719\nif I'm gonna talk about\nthe chart as a whole,\n\n374\n00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:32.610\ntry to let the chart areas,\nthe whole thing just to be safe.\n\n375\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.770\nNow on this particular tab though,\nlet's look at what's in here.\n\n376\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.740\nThis is where it's like hey,\n\n377\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.540\nI need to change the layout\neven though it says design.\n\n378\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.700\nIt is the layout of the chart for\nthe most part, because in the big part,\n\n379\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.410\nin the middle, this is where\nwe're gonna talk about styles.\n\n380\n00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.250\nThat's more formatting\nin the next episode.\n\n381\n00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.220\nI realized I didn't put the right numbers\nin for the meows and the sleeps and\n\n382\n00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.120\neverything of my data.\n\n383\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.030\nSo how can I get back to it?\n\n384\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.740\nThese buttons over here there is Edit data\nin Excel and then there's select data.\n\n385\n00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.055\nThose are almost the same thing.\n\n386\n00:20:11.055 --> 00:20:15.482\nThe only difference is if you click the\nselect data, it's gonna bring up one more\n\n387\n00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:18.493\ndialog box that does not come\nup when you edit the data.\n\n388\n00:20:18.493 --> 00:20:21.768\nI'll come around to it,\njust keep that in mind for right now.\n\n389\n00:20:21.768 --> 00:20:25.320\nThe other thing really quickly, do you\nsee where it says switch row and column?\n\n390\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.215\nIt's grayed out, but you're like, but\n\n391\n00:20:27.215 --> 00:20:30.426\nyou said there was one quick little\nbutton that I could flip it around.\n\n392\n00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:35.960\nAnd do all those cool things Justin\nsaid very intelligently about comparing.\n\n393\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.580\nAnd this and that.\n\n394\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.130\nIt was a fantastic explanation.\n\n395\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.160\nIf you haven't seen it,\ngo watch that introduction.\n\n396\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.379\nSo why can't I click that?\n\n397\n00:20:42.379 --> 00:20:46.941\nWell that's where this select data button\nwill actually get you to the same thing\n\n398\n00:20:46.941 --> 00:20:51.049\nthat this button will do, just in\nanother place, just like Microsoft.\n\n399\n00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:55.146\nSo let's go ahead and edit the data in\nExcel, cuz that's the only place I can.\n\n400\n00:20:55.146 --> 00:20:57.949\nI click on this, give it a second.\n\n401\n00:20:57.949 --> 00:21:01.179\nThere it goes, it's gonna bring this back\nup, it's brought me back into Excel.\n\n402\n00:21:01.179 --> 00:21:05.243\nI don't need this introduction or\nstart window in Excel, so\n\n403\n00:21:05.243 --> 00:21:08.122\nI'm just gonna close\nit to make it go away.\n\n404\n00:21:08.122 --> 00:21:11.618\nSo if I needed to change, cuz I actually\ndidn't change any of the numbers,\n\n405\n00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:12.239\ndid I [LAUGH]?\n\n406\n00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:17.393\nOkay, so if I wanted this to be 8,\nand 5, and 3.\n\n407\n00:21:17.393 --> 00:21:21.926\nAnd I know that doesn't add up to 24,\nbut we're rolling with it, right?\n\n408\n00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:22.780\nRolling.\n\n409\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\nthat's easy to explain away.\n\n410\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.210\nThese are the three categories that we\nare currently concerned with quantifying.\n\n411\n00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.706\nThey do not necessarily encompass\nall the of possible categories for\n\n412\n00:21:32.706 --> 00:21:33.955\nrespective cats.\n\n413\n00:21:33.955 --> 00:21:35.750\n&gt;&gt; Wow, there you go, sound smart again.\n\n414\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.656\n[LAUGH] And exactly what you said.\n\n415\n00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:43.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so now I've got some numbers\n\n416\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.284\nin here but really, just examplifying\nthe fact that I need to change my data.\n\n417\n00:21:47.284 --> 00:21:51.232\nClick on that button, close out of\nExcel and I'm gonna do command Q, but\n\n418\n00:21:51.232 --> 00:21:55.750\nthat is really quick, so\nnotice right there, there's my shortcut.\n\n419\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.020\nI'm just a keyboard-happy person, so\nI go ahead and close Excel, back in Word,\n\n420\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.590\nand there we go.\n\n421\n00:22:01.744 --> 00:22:04.537\nLook at that button\nautomatically showed up.\n\n422\n00:22:04.537 --> 00:22:05.146\nNice.\n\n423\n00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:08.847\nOkay, sometimes it comes up, sometimes it\ndoesn't, I will tell you that right now,\n\n424\n00:22:08.847 --> 00:22:12.463\nI've had many occurrences where it's like\nI don't have that button That's okay.\n\n425\n00:22:12.463 --> 00:22:18.434\nI can click it really quickly and\nit's gonna do it, maybe not?\n\n426\n00:22:18.434 --> 00:22:20.094\nThat's okay, I got a backup.\n\n427\n00:22:20.094 --> 00:22:24.518\n[LAUGH] This right here, the Select Data,\nlet's see what that does.\n\n428\n00:22:24.518 --> 00:22:26.991\nI'm gonna click it.\n\n429\n00:22:26.991 --> 00:22:28.161\nBack in Excel.\n\n430\n00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:32.886\nWait for it, this is the dialog box and\nif you are back from\n\n431\n00:22:32.886 --> 00:22:37.721\nExcel base this is kind of like\nthe old school like making.\n\n432\n00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:41.737\nIt's funny because Justin goes,\nI see his head nod over there.\n\n433\n00:22:41.737 --> 00:22:44.669\nCuz back in the day this is where\nit's like, what is it pulling from?\n\n434\n00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:48.238\nAnd you'd have to change all these\nthings from this dialog box.\n\n435\n00:22:48.238 --> 00:22:52.014\nBut right here, do you see where\nit says switch row and column?\n\n436\n00:22:52.014 --> 00:22:54.621\nWhen I click it there,\nI'm gonna click okay and\n\n437\n00:22:54.621 --> 00:22:58.805\nI'm going to close out of this little,\nright there, see, there you go.\n\n438\n00:22:58.805 --> 00:22:59.668\nIt switched it.\n\n439\n00:22:59.668 --> 00:23:05.850\nSo if that button doesn't work, come into\nthis select data, click the button there.\n\n440\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.158\nThere's a lot of other\nmanual things you can do,\n\n441\n00:23:08.158 --> 00:23:11.385\ndon't worry about all the rest of it,\nhonestly just use this part.\n\n442\n00:23:11.385 --> 00:23:15.415\nAnd then I will close out of Excel,\nand that's how we can go ahead and\n\n443\n00:23:15.415 --> 00:23:18.835\nchange the information within\nthe chart that I am using.\n\n444\n00:23:18.835 --> 00:23:22.561\nSo let's go over a few other\nthings before we go ahead and\n\n445\n00:23:22.561 --> 00:23:24.558\nkind of wrap up this episode.\n\n446\n00:23:24.558 --> 00:23:27.942\nWhat if I wanted to\nchange the type of chart?\n\n447\n00:23:27.942 --> 00:23:31.754\nAnyway we should go to\nthe change chart type button.\n\n448\n00:23:31.754 --> 00:23:32.894\nYeah that makes sense.\n\n449\n00:23:32.894 --> 00:23:36.054\nSo this is where if I wanted\nto make it a line graph.\n\n450\n00:23:36.054 --> 00:23:38.377\nI want to stack the line with markers.\n\n451\n00:23:38.377 --> 00:23:43.284\nMaybe not the data, but really is the\nright stuff you know to be represented in\n\n452\n00:23:43.284 --> 00:23:46.997\nthis type of chart but\nit's there I could make a pie chart.\n\n453\n00:23:46.997 --> 00:23:48.418\nA pie of a pie.\n\n454\n00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:50.461\nAgain, doesn't really make sense.\n\n455\n00:23:50.461 --> 00:23:53.240\nThis is that whole it's gotta make sense,\n\n456\n00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.649\nmaybe a bar is really just\na column chart on its side.\n\n457\n00:23:56.649 --> 00:23:59.483\nAt least that's what I think it is.\n\n458\n00:23:59.483 --> 00:24:00.319\nYeah, goes across.\n\n459\n00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:04.261\nAnd we could get into our areas and\nour surface charts,\n\n460\n00:24:04.261 --> 00:24:09.844\nlike the one that I did of, okay,\nthat's pretty, doesn't make any sense.\n\n461\n00:24:09.844 --> 00:24:14.283\nOkay, so this is where having the right\nchart for the right information,\n\n462\n00:24:14.283 --> 00:24:17.443\nI'd probably just stick with either Bar or\nColumn.\n\n463\n00:24:17.443 --> 00:24:20.441\nI can see where lines,\nI could be doing sales, or\n\n464\n00:24:20.441 --> 00:24:23.303\nI know we did enrollments\nwithin the program.\n\n465\n00:24:23.303 --> 00:24:27.011\nSo you can see the kind of trends,\nif you want to say, there.\n\n466\n00:24:27.011 --> 00:24:29.813\nAnd you could go with\na 3D clustered column,\n\n467\n00:24:29.813 --> 00:24:32.480\nthat's a lot to say in\none mouthful [LAUGH].\n\n468\n00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.342\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it just kinda gives it a little bit\n\n469\n00:24:35.342 --> 00:24:40.285\nof depth perception and everything,\nso pretty easy I think, honestly.\n\n470\n00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:45.940\nI always start with this one, and then\ngo from there, and kind of move along,\n\n471\n00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.119\nand just to kinda keep on going\nwith this particular tab.\n\n472\n00:24:50.119 --> 00:24:53.819\nAs to what I want to add on to my chart,\nover here to the left,\n\n473\n00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:58.830\nnotice we have Add Chart Element,\nand then we have Quick Layout.\n\n474\n00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.762\nWe'll keep all of this\nin the next episode,\n\n475\n00:25:01.762 --> 00:25:06.768\nthese are those different vocabulary\nlessons of, what is my Chart Title?\n\n476\n00:25:06.768 --> 00:25:10.120\nCross it out, it doesn't have one,\nwhat about my Data Labels?\n\n477\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.332\nI don't have any of those, so\nif I wanted to start adding these\n\n478\n00:25:14.332 --> 00:25:18.058\ndifferent elements in,\nlike I want some data labels.\n\n479\n00:25:18.058 --> 00:25:20.610\nNow, where do I want them,\nin the middle, outside?\n\n480\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.371\nMaybe I'll go outside in.\n\n481\n00:25:23.371 --> 00:25:26.900\nThose are the numbers that I was\nseeing on top of those columns.\n\n482\n00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.468\nI do want a Chart Title, so\nlet's go ahead and do Above the Chart.\n\n483\n00:25:31.468 --> 00:25:34.623\nCool, and you notice how when\nI go back into Chart Title.\n\n484\n00:25:34.623 --> 00:25:37.679\nNow you can see, well,\ngosh, a check by the one,\n\n485\n00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:40.752\nI thought it would actually\nshow me a check over there.\n\n486\n00:25:40.752 --> 00:25:44.980\nSometimes I have noticed that it gets\na little weird as to where it doesn't\n\n487\n00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.490\nshow the check next to it.\n\n488\n00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:50.118\nI know I have the outside ends\non these data labels, normally,\n\n489\n00:25:50.118 --> 00:25:54.586\nit puts a check on it but it doesn't-\n&gt;&gt; I wonder if we click outside of\n\n490\n00:25:54.586 --> 00:26:00.680\nthe chart area, and then reselect\nthe chart, if those update at that point.\n\n491\n00:26:02.021 --> 00:26:02.999\n&gt;&gt; Not really [LAUGH].\n\n492\n00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:04.675\n&gt;&gt; I think we need to file above.\n\n493\n00:26:04.675 --> 00:26:05.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] right?\n\n494\n00:26:05.465 --> 00:26:08.420\n&gt;&gt; Because that's kinda confusing, right?\n\n495\n00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:13.089\nMaybe it's because it's not an on and\noff thing, if I click, let's say,\n\n496\n00:26:13.089 --> 00:26:17.630\nChart Title, if I click Chart Title twice,\ndo I get two chart titles?\n\n497\n00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.350\n&gt;&gt; Here's an Above the Chart.\n\n498\n00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.578\n&gt;&gt; So maybe it just takes\na synchronization portion, but\n\n499\n00:26:21.578 --> 00:26:23.232\nif I click it twice, do I get two of them?\n\n500\n00:26:23.232 --> 00:26:27.395\n&gt;&gt; No, and that's where, if I take this\nand move it cuz I selected it twice,\n\n501\n00:26:27.395 --> 00:26:30.900\nthere's not two of them, so\nthat's a good point to notice.\n\n502\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.898\nAnd the nice thing is, if I know what it\nis, if I come to here and choose None,\n\n503\n00:26:34.898 --> 00:26:36.035\nit does take it away.\n\n504\n00:26:36.035 --> 00:26:40.665\nIf I come back over to here, even though\nit doesn't have a check on the outside\n\n505\n00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:43.900\nend, if I go to None,\nthey're gonna go away.\n\n506\n00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:48.867\nSo it's a nice indication, and\nI think more on the PC version,\n\n507\n00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:54.607\nI feel like I always see those, so\nyeah, maybe a small little bug there.\n\n508\n00:26:54.607 --> 00:26:57.100\nAnd now it's saying that it's Above the\nChart, and it's not above the chart, so.\n\n509\n00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.387\n&gt;&gt; It looks like there's some data\nsynchronization issues between those menu\n\n510\n00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:02.042\noptions and the actual chart layout.\n\n511\n00:27:02.042 --> 00:27:02.597\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n512\n00:27:02.597 --> 00:27:06.468\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it would be nice, but as\nsomeone who did all of this manually using\n\n513\n00:27:06.468 --> 00:27:10.170\nthose old style dialogue boxes before,\nI think I'll be all right.\n\n514\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're good.\n\n515\n00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.079\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really just knowing, well,\n\n516\n00:27:13.079 --> 00:27:15.812\nwhat is that thing on the bottom\nof my chart right there?\n\n517\n00:27:15.812 --> 00:27:20.382\nThat's a data table, okay, make sure that\nyou know that that's what it is because\n\n518\n00:27:20.382 --> 00:27:22.830\nthat's how this drop\ndown is going to work.\n\n519\n00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.230\nAnd notice I could go ahead and\nput in my Title Axis.\n\n520\n00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:30.050\nI could put in, now arrow bars aren't\ngonna really matter in this particular\n\n521\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.760\none, where does my legend go?\n\n522\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.432\nDo I want the legend to be on the top,\ndo I want it to be on the bottom?\n\n523\n00:27:35.432 --> 00:27:37.387\nI'm not gonna go through\nevery single option here, but\n\n524\n00:27:37.387 --> 00:27:39.016\nI think you're getting\nthe gist right there.\n\n525\n00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:43.856\nOf, hey, I want to add some elements in,\nI could go one by one and\n\n526\n00:27:43.856 --> 00:27:47.466\nadd them,\nthe nice thing is they quick layout.\n\n527\n00:27:47.466 --> 00:27:52.262\nSo the layout will just go ahead and\ntake those different options, or elements,\n\n528\n00:27:52.262 --> 00:27:54.108\nthat we were adding one by one.\n\n529\n00:27:54.108 --> 00:27:58.220\nAnd put them all into different named,\nlike this one is gonna show the following,\n\n530\n00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.430\nshow the following.\n\n531\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.997\nAnd it kinda just gives you\nthe icon graphic and the list,\n\n532\n00:28:03.997 --> 00:28:08.484\nif you hover over it,\nthis top one is always my default.\n\n533\n00:28:08.484 --> 00:28:12.651\nAnd notice how no matter what I had\nadded individually from my elements,\n\n534\n00:28:12.651 --> 00:28:15.960\nthis just kind of, to me,\nit's like a reset.\n\n535\n00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.951\nI can put this here and\nthen it goes right back,\n\n536\n00:28:18.951 --> 00:28:21.727\nno matter how much I\nkinda mess up the data.\n\n537\n00:28:21.727 --> 00:28:24.593\nAnd even if I take this, and we'll\nprobably do this in the next episode just\n\n538\n00:28:24.593 --> 00:28:26.930\nto kind of show you that the moving\naround that we were doing.\n\n539\n00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:31.065\nLike, oops, oops, what is the step\nto get back to where I started?\n\n540\n00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:34.805\nCome up to the layout, click that, and\nthen everything is back into its place.\n\n541\n00:28:34.805 --> 00:28:39.761\nSo it's nice that there's a little\nbit of a reset, if you want to say,\n\n542\n00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:45.650\nin the layout of the chart elements,\nthat quick layout, and that's pretty nice.\n\n543\n00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:48.271\nSo, that's a nice reset,\nadd your elements,\n\n544\n00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:53.300\ncome over here to edit your chart data,\ncome over here to change your chart type.\n\n545\n00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.721\nAnd understanding how to get that\nin in the kind of mini Excel,\n\n546\n00:28:57.721 --> 00:29:03.089\nthat's the most important part of getting\nit to look the way you want it to.\n\n547\n00:29:03.089 --> 00:29:07.240\nAnd hopefully, those steps along the way\nof kind of telling you of what to do.\n\n548\n00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.272\nI'm telling you,\n\n549\n00:29:08.272 --> 00:29:12.605\nthat little triangle thing, that's\nthe thing that throws people off so much.\n\n550\n00:29:12.605 --> 00:29:16.082\nSo just really watch it and\nthe mouse cursor icons, which you so\n\n551\n00:29:16.082 --> 00:29:19.525\nwonderfully got,\nyou got way down in there, and I'm happy.\n\n552\n00:29:19.525 --> 00:29:21.881\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is my nature sometimes,\n\n553\n00:29:21.881 --> 00:29:22.690\nooh, ooh.\n\n554\n00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.713\nBut what it means is I end up with\ntunnel vision, I get blinders on and\n\n555\n00:29:26.713 --> 00:29:28.062\nsometimes I get lost.\n\n556\n00:29:28.062 --> 00:29:30.720\nBut that's okay,\nhopefully you didn't get lost as well.\n\n557\n00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.721\nQuick aside, that full reset,\nit is a full reset, so be careful there.\n\n558\n00:29:34.721 --> 00:29:36.448\nSo if you're like,\nI only want to undo this one thing,\n\n559\n00:29:36.448 --> 00:29:37.550\ndon't accidentally click that.\n\n560\n00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.484\nOnly reason I say that, again, is because\nI'm like, no, that's not what I wanted,\n\n561\n00:29:43.484 --> 00:29:44.668\nI've done that before.\n\n562\n00:29:44.668 --> 00:29:48.359\nAnd also, remember, some of these\nthings are very much contextual based,\n\n563\n00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:50.760\nbased on the data that\nyou want to represent.\n\n564\n00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.566\nSo you'll notice not everything\nis available all the time or\n\n565\n00:29:53.566 --> 00:29:54.452\neven makes sense.\n\n566\n00:29:54.452 --> 00:29:57.693\nBut you'll have to stay tuned to\nfigure out how that all comes to\n\n567\n00:29:57.693 --> 00:29:59.480\nfruition in these next episodes.\n\n568\n00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.944\nSo definitely come back for more,\nMicrosoft Word Advanced 2016 for Mac.\n\n569\n00:30:02.944 --> 00:30:05.090\nBut for now, we're going to go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n570\n00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:07.914\nSo signing off for OFFICEPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n571\n00:30:07.914 --> 00:30:08.738\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n572\n00:30:08.738 --> 00:30:10.980\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n573\n00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.343\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:17.410\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.550\nAnd we're continuing on our\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Advanced for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.070\nWell, extravaganza.\n\n6\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.860\nAnd in particular, we're gonna be looking\nat designing and formatting charts,\n\n7\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.420\nthere's no better way to present data\nunless you can make it beautiful.\n\n8\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.570\nAnd here to help us do that very thing,\nMs.\n\n9\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.830\nVonne Smith,\nhow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.260\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.350\nI feel like I might have been a little\nover the top in that introduction,\n\n13\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.625\nbut you probably have way more design\nprowess and then this old guy.\n\n14\n00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.802\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm glad you're here.\n\n15\n00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:49.523\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.\n\n16\n00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:52.800\nThe way we're gonna go with it,\nit might not end up looking too pretty.\n\n17\n00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.384\nBut luckily, we have styles.\n\n18\n00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:55.292\nSo that's the nice thing.\n\n19\n00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:56.180\nSo we'll be like, poof.\n\n20\n00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.980\nOkay, I don't know what I'm doing, so\n\n21\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.710\nlet me just throw a style on it, and\nnow that would look pretty enough.\n\n22\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.240\nSo, and this is almost like a Part\n3 in our chart mini series.\n\n23\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.306\nI know Ron and I like to do mini\nseries when we do our episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:13.000\nI just didn't want to call it a Part 3.\n\n25\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.430\nThis is where we're going to say, like,\ngussy it up, as my dad might actually say,\n\n26\n00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.470\nand make things look different colors and\nsome other things.\n\n27\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.020\nSo we're gonna start off by doing\njust a small review of what\n\n28\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.160\nwe talked about in our previous episode\nwhen we were doing the creating a layout.\n\n29\n00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.212\nIt's really just reviewing\nthe selection process,\n\n30\n00:01:34.212 --> 00:01:38.161\ncuz that's gonna be the biggest part\nright here is select to effect.\n\n31\n00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:41.860\nIf I want to change color of that\ndata series, how do I do that?\n\n32\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.400\nIf I want to change\nthe color of my plot area,\n\n33\n00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.480\ngotta make sure you the plot\narea selected first.\n\n34\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.970\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njump down into our computer.\n\n35\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.950\nAnd this is actually the last place\nthat we were at in the previous episode.\n\n36\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.790\nOkay, so if you're like where did you\nget that information, go ahead and\n\n37\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.030\nwatch that other one and then we're going\nto go ahead and pick it up from here.\n\n38\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.800\nAnd we had actually\nflipped the data series.\n\n39\n00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.900\nWe flipped the column and\nthe row information.\n\n40\n00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.470\nSo I'm going to select the chart area.\n\n41\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.180\nI could really click anywhere\nin the chart to do this, but\n\n42\n00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.000\nI like to just kind of say, hey,\nI'm manipulating the chart.\n\n43\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.262\nLet's make sure we have\nthat one part selected.\n\n44\n00:02:24.262 --> 00:02:26.000\nThen we'll come up to our contextual tabs.\n\n45\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.392\nWe'll come over to our chart design tab,\nand I'm going to flip the row and column.\n\n46\n00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:34.643\nBut since I can't do that\nhere on this ticker button,\n\n47\n00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:37.960\nwe learn that we just go\nto that select data button.\n\n48\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.980\nIt will switch us over into Excel.\n\n49\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.119\nAnd then wait, there's my box that I want\nto get on to and then we go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:53.363\nclick it flip it, so now we have our own\ncolumn click OK, close out of Excel.\n\n51\n00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:56.100\nWell there are all actually\nthe quick command.\n\n52\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.630\nThat you can like to just keep\nwith a very basic chart layout,\n\n53\n00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.482\nwhen we start doing our formatting.\n\n54\n00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:09.383\nAll right, so selecting the information\nthat we want to format.\n\n55\n00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:13.223\nRemember we talked about\nthose hover to discover and\n\n56\n00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:17.846\nusing those tooltips to understand,\nthose are my grid lines,\n\n57\n00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:22.460\nthis is my series,\nthis is my plot area, this is my legend.\n\n58\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.280\nAll of those different things that you\nneed to make sure that you select.\n\n59\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.950\nAnd we did talk about, hey,\nlet's start with a chart title.\n\n60\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.490\nIf I have my four point arrows, and\n\n61\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.300\nit does have the arrow head in it,\nwhen I single-click on it, now\n\n62\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.850\nthe mouse cursor's changed a little bit\nto where I can move this particular item.\n\n63\n00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.440\nIf I wanted to move the chart title over,\nyou can.\n\n64\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.790\nBut if I want to change the information\nthat's in it, let's go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.590\njust click my ID minute.\n\n66\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.948\nThen, once I get that flashing cursor,\nI can click hold and drag,\n\n67\n00:03:54.948 --> 00:04:00.608\nselect this, and I can say activity,\nwe'll just say a cat activity.\n\n68\n00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:02.160\nSounds good, did I spell that?\n\n69\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.140\nOkay, yeah, perfect.\n\n70\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.405\nPerfect, so that's good and\nthat's where I can add the information.\n\n71\n00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:08.850\nBecause sometimes when you go ahead and\n\n72\n00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.250\nadd a chart element like your\ncategory axis or your vertical axis,\n\n73\n00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.880\nyou're gonna have to add the information\ninto that particular element.\n\n74\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.019\nBut if I go back and\nselect the whole element,\n\n75\n00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.978\nmeaning get to the outside get\nthe four-pointed arrows to say, this is\n\n76\n00:04:25.978 --> 00:04:31.366\nthe piece that I want to have selected,\nnow where am I going to go to format it?\n\n77\n00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:35.984\nWell, since this particular\nelement is text-based,\n\n78\n00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:39.336\nI wanna just start off with text format.\n\n79\n00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:40.590\nWell, that's on the home tab.\n\n80\n00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.770\nThat's not on the format tab.\n\n81\n00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.120\nNotice the format tab it does\nhave things like your text color,\n\n82\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.370\nbut it doesn't have font and size.\n\n83\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.300\nThat's back into just regular old home.\n\n84\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.983\nCome on over into formatting my font\nmaybe I'll make it Ariel Rounded.\n\n85\n00:04:56.983 --> 00:05:00.019\nI will bump the font size up.\n\n86\n00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:01.830\nI can make it bold, italic,\nall those fun stuff.\n\n87\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.601\nAnd I can change the font color from here.\n\n88\n00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.260\nMaybe we'll make it green, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.650\nSo that's kinda format number one of, I\nwanna change the font size and the color.\n\n90\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.744\nGo to the home tab.\n\n91\n00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:18.677\nFor example, maybe these numbers\nover here, on my vertical axes,\n\n92\n00:05:18.677 --> 00:05:20.200\nI want to make those bold.\n\n93\n00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.830\nGet to where you can hover,\nget the little tooltip.\n\n94\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.555\nSingle click, notice it selects\nall all of them as one element,\n\n95\n00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:32.665\nI'll make it bold, I can maybe even\nchange the font size up a little bit.\n\n96\n00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:33.755\nSounds good.\n\n97\n00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:38.765\nSame with my legend, I can select it,\nincrease the font size, it does kind of\n\n98\n00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:43.925\nmove everything else over if needed,\nand I can make that why not?\n\n99\n00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:48.310\nLet's go bold for some reason and\nI can move this around.\n\n100\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.312\nOkay, now and I, I'm kind of starting to\nget to where I don't really like this.\n\n101\n00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.600\nLet me reset this.\n\n102\n00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.500\nSo if I go back over to chart design,\nwe talked about this in the last episode,\n\n103\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.660\nI said,\ncome over here to this quick layout and\n\n104\n00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.170\nit's a nice reset of all of the movement\nof the elements that you have made and\n\n105\n00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.010\nyou would think when you click on it,\nhh, well wait a second.\n\n106\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.641\nIt didn't change all the formatting.\n\n107\n00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:18.020\nOkay, so just a little caveat there.\n\n108\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.024\nThe quick way out button?\n\n109\n00:06:20.024 --> 00:06:24.869\nWhen you come to here,\nit's only going to reset the elements and\n\n110\n00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:27.010\nthe layout of the chart.\n\n111\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.550\nThe formatting of said chart.\n\n112\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.034\nThat's where you gotta go over to your\nFormat tab, and there is a button\n\n113\n00:06:35.034 --> 00:06:39.091\nover here on the left-hand side\nthat says Reset to Match Style.\n\n114\n00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:43.787\nThat's the one that will\nreset all the formatting that\n\n115\n00:06:43.787 --> 00:06:46.451\nyou're doing of the element.\n\n116\n00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:49.340\nWhen I click here, okay, well,\nit almost got all of them.\n\n117\n00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.930\nLet me go back over here to the chart, and\nthat should go ahead, and there we go.\n\n118\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.000\nThere is another thing that I did.\n\n119\n00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.780\nDid you notice that first time I did it,\nit only reset the legend,\n\n120\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.790\nbecause I had the legend selected.\n\n121\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.870\nIf I came back out over to the whole\nchart, I went out to the four point arrows\n\n122\n00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.870\nout to the chart area and then click\nthe reset, then everything went back.\n\n123\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.400\nSo I was, I drilled down too far.\n\n124\n00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.750\nI had one element selected and\nthat was doing the reset.\n\n125\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.046\nBut I wanted everything.\n\n126\n00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:26.900\nBut also notice that it\nsays Reset to Match Style.\n\n127\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.394\nLet's jump over to that chart design tab.\n\n128\n00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:34.746\nThis is where all of\nthese guys right in here,\n\n129\n00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:40.350\nthis is going to format all of\nyour elements in one style.\n\n130\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.650\nNotice it just kinda has,\nif you hover over them,\n\n131\n00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.860\nI'm clicking this little dropdown\nright here, you get more of a hover.\n\n132\n00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.177\nThis is, actually,\nI think you gotta hover up here.\n\n133\n00:07:50.177 --> 00:07:51.175\nThere it is.\n\n134\n00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:55.279\nI was trying to get Style 3, 4, 5.\n\n135\n00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:57.854\nYeah, they really name them very well.\n\n136\n00:07:57.854 --> 00:08:01.571\nBut you can go ahead and pick,\nhey, I want this one, and\n\n137\n00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:05.149\nnotice how it will go ahead and\nformat the chart area.\n\n138\n00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:06.146\nChange the series.\n\n139\n00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:08.600\nIt kind of spreads the series out.\n\n140\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.347\nThat another thing to notice.\n\n141\n00:08:09.347 --> 00:08:13.590\nFor example here,\nversus say, one like this.\n\n142\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.850\nYou see how the data series,\nthey're spread out a little bit more?\n\n143\n00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.280\nThat's one thing that's kind of like\na big like, where do I change that thing?\n\n144\n00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:25.880\nKinda hidden, I'll show you later.\n\n145\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.870\nBut it's kind of,\none of those pet peeves of mine.\n\n146\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.665\nIt's like,\nwhere do I find where I can control that?\n\n147\n00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:35.130\nCuz maybe I like the style but I don't\nlike those columns being so far apart.\n\n148\n00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:40.590\nYou can start with a style and then\nindividually format your different pieces.\n\n149\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.685\nSo, this kinda looks, this almost\nlooks like a tron or something.\n\n150\n00:08:44.685 --> 00:08:45.658\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n151\n00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:49.983\nSo, I'm gonna go back to my\ndefault style to this one.\n\n152\n00:08:49.983 --> 00:08:54.533\nNow it has like kind of moved the columns\napart a little bit more, but that's okay,\n\n153\n00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:56.230\nI can format that anyways.\n\n154\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.600\nNow, you can start with the style.\n\n155\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.130\nYou could come in and change the colors.\n\n156\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.210\nMaybe I like this but\nI wanna go more blue and gray,\n\n157\n00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.090\nor I want to go more into like\ngreen being the primary color.\n\n158\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.970\nSo notice these change colors and\nthen some of your monochromatic options.\n\n159\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.840\nFollowing based off of whatever\nstyle that you choose.\n\n160\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.900\nAnd you know what?\n\n161\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.890\nYou could just stop\nthere if you wanted to.\n\n162\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.926\nThrow in a style, call it a day,\nmake it look good and\n\n163\n00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:26.699\nprofessional, cuz I like the way that\nthese styles do make it look professional.\n\n164\n00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.796\nBut you know what?\n\n165\n00:09:28.796 --> 00:09:32.636\nI can't go on with the lesson more in\nthis particular episode they're just.\n\n166\n00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:35.080\nAnd I know you're like, here she goes.\n\n167\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.358\nWe're going to get some rainbows, and\nsome cats, and all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n168\n00:09:39.358 --> 00:09:41.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Rainbows and cats?\n\n169\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.580\nIs that like nine cat?\n\n170\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.020\nRight?\nIs that the little thing that\n\n171\n00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.950\nlooks like a toaster but\nis made out of a rainbow and a cat?\n\n172\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.250\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n173\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.680\nWe could get that if we.\n\n174\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.830\nI'm sure there's some copyrights\non that one, so yeah.\n\n175\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nlet's just stay away from that one.\n\n176\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.310\nLet's go with a safe, yet,\nwith a touch of gaudy.\n\n177\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.609\n&gt;&gt; I got just the cats.\n\n178\n00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:01.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I have plenty of pictures of\n\n179\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.082\ncats in here.\n\n180\n00:10:02.082 --> 00:10:05.950\n[LAUGH] So yeah, I have to say\nwhat element do I wanna format.\n\n181\n00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.630\nI'm gonna go with the plot area.\n\n182\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.540\nSo I'm gonna select my cursor\nwhere it has the plot area.\n\n183\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.460\nI'm gonna come over to Format, okay.\n\n184\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.590\nOops, sorry, I clicked too many times.\n\n185\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.090\nHere we go.\n\n186\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.960\nIn this area, this is where you're\ngoing to get into some shape styles.\n\n187\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.700\nNow notice these are styles for\nwhatever element.\n\n188\n00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.860\nThis is gonna be like the fill, the\noutline, the text color and the effect.\n\n189\n00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.570\nBut I want to do them individually.\n\n190\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.810\nSo we come over here to shape fill.\n\n191\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.880\nGot some solid colors.\n\n192\n00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.920\nThere's my dead fish.\n\n193\n00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.630\nRight?\n\n194\n00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.900\nOkay.\n\n195\n00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.760\nYep, dead fish.\n\n196\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.480\nAnd then we can come\nin to some other ones.\n\n197\n00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.270\nWe can go into our pictures.\n\n198\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.370\nYep, let's go to our pictures.\n\n199\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.700\nSo this is where I can go ahead and\nselect fish up.\n\n200\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.220\nThere you go.\n\n201\n00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:52.990\nSo there's our cat.\n\n202\n00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.870\n[LAUGH] But\nI was talking about rainbows, right?\n\n203\n00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.697\nI can come into my gradient,\nand you're like,\n\n204\n00:10:59.697 --> 00:11:02.037\nwell this does not look like rainbows.\n\n205\n00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.390\nI'll bring you around.\n\n206\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.390\nWe'll come full circle as to\nwhere I could really make\n\n207\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.740\na rainbow gradient if I wanted to.\n\n208\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.080\nBut right now, I'm just kinda\npicking what's in the main menus or\n\n209\n00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.810\nthe main drop downs, or\nchanging my shape fill.\n\n210\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.040\nNow, if I click on the chart area.\n\n211\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.840\nNotice the chart area,\nI can fill that in differently, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.500\nSo plot area, chart area, and\nthen all the other areas.\n\n213\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.520\nIf I select this cat activity\nI could go ahead and\n\n214\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.020\nchange the fill color of\njust that chart title.\n\n215\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.060\nAnything that I can select,\nI can format with these guys.\n\n216\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.360\nIf I wanted them,\nI'm clicking back on the plot area.\n\n217\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.590\nI could change the outline.\n\n218\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.430\nI'm not gonna go through every single\noption in here cuz I think you're gonna\n\n219\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.630\nstart getting the idea.\n\n220\n00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.240\nYou click it, you format it.\n\n221\n00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.590\nWe'll change the outline color.\n\n222\n00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.500\nI can change the outline weight.\n\n223\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.580\nAnd then I can come into the effects\ncuz if you've watched some of\n\n224\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.500\nthe other episodes within this series,\nif we looked at the insert shapes,\n\n225\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.350\nthis is all the same thing cuz,\nthey're all graphical elements.\n\n226\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.050\nThis is really just a rectangle,\nif you think about it.\n\n227\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:14.140\nSo I could add different levels of glows,\nor I could add some bevels and some edges.\n\n228\n00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.580\nAll of these different things can\nbe added to every single element.\n\n229\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.950\nAnd then, if I wanted,\nlet's slash back on the chart title.\n\n230\n00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.360\nYou can come into how does\nthe words look in there?\n\n231\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.170\nYou have word art styles, you have text\nfills, you have text outlines, and\n\n232\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.210\nyou have text effects.\n\n233\n00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:38.160\nI'll just select this one for\npurposes for right now.\n\n234\n00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.135\nYou can't really read that too well.\n\n235\n00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:45.040\n[LAUGH] So, every part,\nyou can go ahead and format.\n\n236\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.000\nThose grid lines.\n\n237\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.560\nMaybe I want those grid lines to be black.\n\n238\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.790\nSelect them, kinda hard to see\nthe little dots over there, but\n\n239\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.360\nthat would be changing the Outline color,\n\n240\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.710\ncuz those are going to be lines and\nnot fills.\n\n241\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.340\nSo I can change all of\nthese different parts.\n\n242\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:11.330\nOkay, I think you get the idea,\nclick it, format it, go.\n\n243\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.230\nI can't go any further, I gotta reset.\n\n244\n00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.970\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\nreset this back to.\n\n245\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.260\nOops, there's my thing.\n\n246\n00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.840\nI gotta make sure I select\nthe whole chart, there we go.\n\n247\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.030\nI was too far down.\n\n248\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.900\nI was only on the grid\nlines to reset that.\n\n249\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:33.070\nAll right, because I want to show you\nsome things that can trip people up.\n\n250\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.410\nCuz, so far it's like, yeah,\n\n251\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.460\nI can format the plot area,\nI can format the chart area.\n\n252\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.550\nWhat about these data series, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:47.370\nIt's all about watching what bubbles\ncome up for lack of a better term.\n\n254\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.480\nIf I single click right here on\nthis blue column, notice how\n\n255\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.330\nall three of these get selected because,\nthey are a series, okay?\n\n256\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:05.770\nYou would normally want to format\nthe whole series together.\n\n257\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.680\nBecause, what if I did this?\n\n258\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.500\nIf I single-click on this series once,\nor one clicked, selected them all.\n\n259\n00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.040\nBut then I single-click one\nmore time on just this column,\n\n260\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.506\nlook at how I have isolated just\nthat one data point on the series.\n\n261\n00:14:23.506 --> 00:14:28.620\nAnd so if I format this separately,\nwell then this starts to,\n\n262\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.620\nlike, it loses the whole, contiguousness?\n\n263\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.710\nContiguousness, I don't\nthink that's a word.\n\n264\n00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:36.360\nIs that Justin?\n\n265\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.350\n&gt;&gt; I would say maybe uniformity or,\nit breaks the context to me cuz,\n\n266\n00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.460\nif I do a quick glance at that I'm like,\nokay, so there's a red and a red legend.\n\n267\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.180\nBut those other things are fuego\nwith respect to those, so.\n\n268\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:51.870\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n269\n00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.250\n&gt;&gt; I'll probably not do this.\n\n270\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.310\n&gt;&gt; And that's where, but maybe if I wanted\nto emphasize this, maybe put like a glow\n\n271\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.150\naround it, or something like, hey this\nwas our earnings from quarter one.\n\n272\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.780\nI just went from cats to sales, somehow.\n\n273\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.400\nBut, you might not wanna go this extreme.\n\n274\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.170\nBut, again that single click, all of them.\n\n275\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.940\nSingle click again, isolate.\n\n276\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.200\nI have people do this and they can't\nunderstand why I can't format all of them,\n\n277\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.730\nit's only formatting one.\n\n278\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.570\nBecause you probably slow double\nclick cuz you're kinda used to\n\n279\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.220\ndouble clicking on things,\nand that's the result.\n\n280\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.470\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo a command Z to undo that.\n\n281\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.620\nSo, be careful about it.\n\n282\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.510\nI can understand why you\nmight want to isolate but,\n\n283\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.540\nyou probably wanna format\neverything as series.\n\n284\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.640\nNow using all of these buttons across the\ntop to do the fill and the effects, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.982\nBut, I really need a rainbow gradient.\n\n286\n00:15:42.982 --> 00:15:43.900\nI need a rainbow gradient.\n\n287\n00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.110\nWe need to get into the format pane.\n\n288\n00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.170\nNow the format pane,\njust like our other graphical elements,\n\n289\n00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.925\nit's the thing on the side that comes\nup that gives you a lot more options.\n\n290\n00:15:55.925 --> 00:15:58.347\nThere's usually, well, not usually.\n\n291\n00:15:58.347 --> 00:16:03.070\nThere's two ways to get\nto that format pane.\n\n292\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.165\nThat always has way more options than\njust the Here, let's pick a fill, or\n\n293\n00:16:07.165 --> 00:16:09.113\nhere, let's pick a stroke.\n\n294\n00:16:09.113 --> 00:16:12.186\nSorry, outline, thinking vectors again.\n\n295\n00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:16.960\nYou can right click on the element, and\nright now I have the chart area selected,\n\n296\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.920\nif I right click on it,\nthere's that Format Chart Area.\n\n297\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.450\nJust the same as if I had\nsingle clicked on the series,\n\n298\n00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.780\nright click, Format Data Series.\n\n299\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.370\nIf I go to the grid lines,\nright click, I think you get the idea.\n\n300\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.750\nThere it is, Format Grid Lines, anything\nthat you have selected and right click on,\n\n301\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.130\nsay, Format,\nit's gonna bring up that format pane.\n\n302\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:43.730\nI'm gonna click on the chart area,\nthe other way you can get to it,\n\n303\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:49.136\nis get into the More Options of\nany of your formatting elements.\n\n304\n00:16:49.136 --> 00:16:54.031\nSo if I'm here on Gradient,\nand I go to More Gradients,\n\n305\n00:16:54.031 --> 00:17:00.191\nit's gonna bring me into that specific\narea on the format chart area.\n\n306\n00:17:00.191 --> 00:17:02.996\nFormat pane, to go ahead and\ndo it, so why don't I show you,\n\n307\n00:17:02.996 --> 00:17:05.370\nsome of this is gonna be\nbehind my head a little bit.\n\n308\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:10.230\nBecause if I go over to here,\nnotice how it's got it on automatic, but\n\n309\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.055\nif I go to Gradient Fill,\nit will choose that.\n\n310\n00:17:14.055 --> 00:17:20.461\nAnd down here, this is where I can\nstart formatting my gradients.\n\n311\n00:17:20.461 --> 00:17:23.454\nAnd if there's other episodes where we\ntalked about how to edit gradients,\n\n312\n00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:25.712\nif you haven't seen those,\ndefinitely check them out.\n\n313\n00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:28.771\nBut I'll quickly show you that\na gradient has a ramp, and\n\n314\n00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:32.485\nthen it has what I call houses,\nor color stops, along the way.\n\n315\n00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:36.292\nYou select the house, come down here\nto color, and then you can go ahead and\n\n316\n00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:37.753\nstart changing your color.\n\n317\n00:17:37.753 --> 00:17:40.968\nSo If you wanted to remove this one,\nnotice you have the pluses and\n\n318\n00:17:40.968 --> 00:17:41.930\nthe minuses.\n\n319\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.879\nSo if I wanted a rainbow gradient,\nI could go ahead and pick,\n\n320\n00:17:45.879 --> 00:17:50.538\ngotta go to pink, sorry, gotta pick\nthe pink, there we go, click OK.\n\n321\n00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:55.359\nAnd then we go here, moving to how,\nlet's make this yellow, and\n\n322\n00:17:55.359 --> 00:17:57.810\nthen let's make this A, blue.\n\n323\n00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.721\nSo that's the quickest way that I\ncan make a rainbow, so there you go,\n\n324\n00:18:01.721 --> 00:18:02.797\nrainbows, yeah!\n\n325\n00:18:02.797 --> 00:18:07.292\n[LAUGH] So the format pane is here, but\nnotice there's a lot of different options\n\n326\n00:18:07.292 --> 00:18:10.800\nthat I will not go over every\nsingle one of them with you.\n\n327\n00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.450\nBut you get into this fill and\nline, this would be the effects.\n\n328\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.410\nSo all of those different things\nthat we were adding up here,\n\n329\n00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.683\nyou can get into really\nfine tuning every effect.\n\n330\n00:18:23.683 --> 00:18:25.842\nAnd then notice there's\nanother tab over here, and\n\n331\n00:18:25.842 --> 00:18:28.260\nthis is where it's going into\nthe layout and properties.\n\n332\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.525\nThis is where we get into the all text,\nagain, very similar,\n\n333\n00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:34.999\nwell actually, exactly similar.\n\n334\n00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:38.665\nTo just,\nif you were formatting a rectangle,\n\n335\n00:18:38.665 --> 00:18:41.868\nso the format pane is pretty important.\n\n336\n00:18:41.868 --> 00:18:45.594\nAnd this is where I wanna show\nyou some kind of specific areas,\n\n337\n00:18:45.594 --> 00:18:49.260\nof the format pane associated\nwith certain chart elements.\n\n338\n00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.430\nThat, over the years, has thrown me,\nI want it to look like,\n\n339\n00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.490\nwhatever, couldn't find the buttons\nin there to make it work.\n\n340\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.310\nUntil I really, I was hunting and\npecking like nobody's business.\n\n341\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:09.280\nSo I've documented a few of my favorites,\nand I want to show you those right now,\n\n342\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.397\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\njust reset that one.\n\n343\n00:19:13.397 --> 00:19:18.827\nAll right, first one, I would say,\nis the series, right here, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:18.827 --> 00:19:22.510\nIt's driving me crazy, I don't like them\nthat far apart from each other, okay?\n\n345\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.713\nLet me show you, they are where\nyou format the data series, so\n\n346\n00:19:26.713 --> 00:19:29.205\nit doesn't matter which\none you have selected.\n\n347\n00:19:29.205 --> 00:19:33.270\nBut if you right click on\na selected data series,\n\n348\n00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.700\ngo to Format Data Series,\nit's right there.\n\n349\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.351\nOkay, if I go to overlap, yes!\n\n350\n00:19:41.351 --> 00:19:43.788\n[LAUGH] So I can kinda squeeze them,\n\n351\n00:19:43.788 --> 00:19:48.167\nI can even like overlap them too much,\nthat's [SOUND], okay.\n\n352\n00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:51.500\nSo I will make sure that this is on zero,\ncuz there's a lot of times I\n\n353\n00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.420\nlike the style, but I don't like that\nthey're taking the series overlap.\n\n354\n00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:01.635\nAnd doing a negative overlap,\nI wanna make sure they're together.\n\n355\n00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:05.458\nNow the Gap Width, this is a little\ndifferent, here let me move that up and\n\n356\n00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:06.639\nthen move this apart.\n\n357\n00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:11.570\nSo what it's doing, is like the gap\nthat's between each series, okay, or\n\n358\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.160\neach categories, I should say.\n\n359\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.814\nSo that's the one where you\nwanna it to maybe kind of,\n\n360\n00:20:17.814 --> 00:20:21.728\nmake the gap between each one\na little bigger or smaller.\n\n361\n00:20:21.728 --> 00:20:26.889\nThat's what these are going to do,\nso changing this, is kind of,\n\n362\n00:20:26.889 --> 00:20:30.230\nthat took me awhile to find, so-\n&gt;&gt; I will tell you,\n\n363\n00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.480\nthat I think that's probably\njust because of naming.\n\n364\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:38.600\nI thought Gap Width would've been the gap\nbetween the respectively clustered series,\n\n365\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.159\nnot the gaps between\nrespective categories.\n\n366\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.446\nThat collects your,\nwhy would you use negative?\n\n367\n00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:49.709\nThinking about negative margins,\nand overlaps and things,\n\n368\n00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:52.355\nin general, there's a time and\na place for them.\n\n369\n00:20:52.355 --> 00:20:56.648\nI just advise against them,\ncuz they're hard to reason about, right?\n\n370\n00:20:56.648 --> 00:20:59.525\nWhich one overlaps which, and how,\nand then your other things change.\n\n371\n00:20:59.525 --> 00:21:02.631\nBecause now you have negative\nnumbers coming into play,\n\n372\n00:21:02.631 --> 00:21:05.780\nI would probably set that to zero,\nand just let it go.\n\n373\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, and this is the one\nwhere it threw me off, too, I was like,\n\n374\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.160\nwhy would you, I thought the same thing.\n\n375\n00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.040\nAnd it's really just like, I always say,\npull it one way, and pull it the other,\n\n376\n00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.065\nand see what it does.\n\n377\n00:21:16.065 --> 00:21:19.075\nAnd they'd just be like, know in your\nhead, that's what it's going to do.\n\n378\n00:21:19.075 --> 00:21:22.532\nTalking about negative margins,\nand talking about that coding, and\n\n379\n00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:24.651\neverything like that, yeah, and I know.\n\n380\n00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:30.036\n[LAUGH] Justin's over here making\nreally bad faces, so [LAUGH].\n\n381\n00:21:30.036 --> 00:21:33.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz he, he knows.\n\n382\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I know you know very well, so\n\n383\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:41.210\nthat was one that always drove me kind\nof batty, is trying to find that one.\n\n384\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.452\nSo now the other one,\ndid you have a question?\n\n385\n00:21:43.452 --> 00:21:46.427\n&gt;&gt; Actually, and a real quick question, we\ntalked about there's a little radio button\n\n386\n00:21:46.427 --> 00:21:49.050\nthere that says primary access,\nand that makes sense.\n\n387\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.196\nBut I can change these on the secondary\naccess, which I'm guess in this,\n\n388\n00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:53.834\nis a whole bunch of weird, one thing.\n\n389\n00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:58.713\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nwell if you think about like, okay, so\n\n390\n00:21:58.713 --> 00:22:01.974\nnow here, and then how they overlap.\n\n391\n00:22:01.974 --> 00:22:07.859\nThis gets into all right,\nnow we're trying to compare another,\n\n392\n00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:10.970\nit gets a little wonky on that one.\n\n393\n00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.520\nSo you know what, I'm just going\nto go back to the primary access.\n\n394\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.700\nBut you can see how changing that\nit goes into a different way\n\n395\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.506\nthat is showing the information so\nI usually just stick with this.\n\n396\n00:22:23.506 --> 00:22:26.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would probably also stick with that,\n\n397\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.380\nbecause that primary,\nlooks like you had a direct overlay.\n\n398\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.667\nAnd it was making sure that the vertical\naxis overlapped, then you had no big deal.\n\n399\n00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:38.546\nI mean, I guess if you want to draw\npretty pictures in class, then you could.\n\n400\n00:22:38.546 --> 00:22:40.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it doesn't make a lot of sense, and\n\n401\n00:22:40.702 --> 00:22:43.220\nin the end with these respective settings,\nanyway.\n\n402\n00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, so\nlet me show you my other two favorite,\n\n403\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.420\nspecific, very minute\ndetails of formatting charts.\n\n404\n00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.600\nThe vertical axis right here,\nand this is kind of,\n\n405\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.990\nthis is probably something,\nI don't know, maybe not we, directly.\n\n406\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.030\nBut we get the song,\nlittle bit of the side of, okay, so\n\n407\n00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.070\nwe want our sales goals to be up here.\n\n408\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.415\nOr we want to have these particular\nnumbers to be here, or right here,\n\n409\n00:23:10.415 --> 00:23:11.528\nand we're good.\n\n410\n00:23:11.528 --> 00:23:15.637\nBut really wanna be, up here, so let's\njust say, hey, with our cat activity.\n\n411\n00:23:15.637 --> 00:23:18.482\nAgain, I'm mixing cats with sales, but\n\n412\n00:23:18.482 --> 00:23:22.232\nnotice how the data that we have,\nit only goes to 12.\n\n413\n00:23:22.232 --> 00:23:26.923\nSo look at where the top number goes to,\nit's only like 14,\n\n414\n00:23:26.923 --> 00:23:31.090\nwe really want to get our\nsleep hours up into the 20s.\n\n415\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:37.644\nWell, I don't even see that on\nthe scale of the vertical axis.\n\n416\n00:23:37.644 --> 00:23:41.515\nSo if you wanna kinda convey,\nagain, conveying that information,\n\n417\n00:23:41.515 --> 00:23:43.060\nwe really wanna be up here.\n\n418\n00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:48.028\nHow can I change the maximum on my\nvertical axis, hm, where do we go?\n\n419\n00:23:48.028 --> 00:23:50.593\nWell first of all,\nyou gotta have the element selected, so\n\n420\n00:23:50.593 --> 00:23:52.350\nlets click on the vertical axis.\n\n421\n00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:56.499\nSince I have the Format task pane up,\nit's already over here,\n\n422\n00:23:56.499 --> 00:24:00.667\nbut I had to write this down, so\nto remind myself of where it is.\n\n423\n00:24:00.667 --> 00:24:05.474\nSo notice here that we\nhave our Axis Options,\n\n424\n00:24:05.474 --> 00:24:13.832\nthat this is not kinda showing me You got\nto get on the right tab within the pane.\n\n425\n00:24:13.832 --> 00:24:17.386\nSo you have to go to the access options,\n\n426\n00:24:17.386 --> 00:24:22.410\nwithin the access options and\nthen get to your bounds.\n\n427\n00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.117\nYour minimum and maximum.\n\n428\n00:24:25.117 --> 00:24:33.200\nIf I change this to say 20, hit the tab\nkey, you see how now all of that changes.\n\n429\n00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.268\nIt was like there's so much more room for\n\n430\n00:24:36.268 --> 00:24:41.784\ngrowth in here if we just changed\nthe maximum within this vertical axis.\n\n431\n00:24:41.784 --> 00:24:45.178\nA couple more things behind my\nhead that I wanted to show you\n\n432\n00:24:45.178 --> 00:24:50.590\nis just like the the major and minor, like\nwhat's the increments that it goes up by.\n\n433\n00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.260\nSo that's something to kinda look for.\n\n434\n00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.660\nYou can also get into like,\nhow do you want your tick marks?\n\n435\n00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.616\nDo you want to have them outside?\n\n436\n00:25:00.616 --> 00:25:02.030\nDo you want them inside?\n\n437\n00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.789\nSo you can see that right there.\n\n438\n00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:07.460\nThe little ticks [LAUGH] found out.\n\n439\n00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.300\nSo there's a lot of different things.\n\n440\n00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.190\nHow do you want them to be labeled?\n\n441\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.090\nWhat about the number format?\n\n442\n00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.300\nThat's another one right here.\n\n443\n00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.475\nWhat if this was supposed\nto be in currency?\n\n444\n00:25:19.475 --> 00:25:22.082\nNow, it doesn't make sense right now\nsince we're doing cat activity, but\n\n445\n00:25:22.082 --> 00:25:23.140\nthat's another big thing.\n\n446\n00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.260\nHow do you want that to display?\n\n447\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.510\nSo, that is kind of buried in here.\n\n448\n00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:32.560\nLots of questions I always get asked, it's\nlike, I want this to show in dollars or\n\n449\n00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.250\nwhat have you.\n\n450\n00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:40.315\nYou gotta change the number formatting\nof the vertical axis options.\n\n451\n00:25:40.315 --> 00:25:40.845\n&gt;&gt; Whew.\n\n452\n00:25:40.845 --> 00:25:41.625\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n453\n00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:45.325\n&gt;&gt; So I gotta go double level\naccess options in order to find\n\n454\n00:25:45.325 --> 00:25:46.335\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n455\n00:25:46.335 --> 00:25:47.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I got that right, right?\n\n456\n00:25:47.775 --> 00:25:48.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah pretty much.\n\n457\n00:25:48.355 --> 00:25:49.935\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, I was just making sure.\n\n458\n00:25:49.935 --> 00:25:52.528\nI was like, access options,\naccess this way.\n\n459\n00:25:52.528 --> 00:25:56.930\nSo naming, again, this is just a naming\nthing that, it's nuanced behavior that if\n\n460\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.420\nyou don't know-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n461\n00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Then it's gonna drive you crazy.\n\n462\n00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:04.000\n&gt;&gt; And is really knowing that the options\nare there, you just gotta dig.\n\n463\n00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.255\nYou gotta really get into\nthat format task bin and\n\n464\n00:26:06.255 --> 00:26:10.107\nclick through all these little things,\nand that's how I found all of this, okay?\n\n465\n00:26:10.107 --> 00:26:14.430\nLast one that I will show you that\nis kind of like a big one on me,\n\n466\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.760\nis down here, the horizontal axis.\n\n467\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.500\nThey're going across, right?\n\n468\n00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.200\nSometimes you have really long lines,\nor like you have dates.\n\n469\n00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.908\nAnd if they're this way, you really\nwanna just turn them on their side.\n\n470\n00:26:26.908 --> 00:26:30.120\nYeah, okay, well, I'm already on it.\n\n471\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.060\nBut you can see it, when I selected it,\nI had to get into the format task pane,\n\n472\n00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.656\nI had to come into here and\n\n473\n00:26:36.656 --> 00:26:41.180\nthe access options and then right\nhere on this layout and properties.\n\n474\n00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.630\nThere's the text direction, and\nthat's where I can rotate this\n\n475\n00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.560\nto go up instead of going horizontal.\n\n476\n00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.680\nSo that was kind of a weird one for me.\n\n477\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.950\nYou can also find it the text options.\n\n478\n00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:59.280\nAnd the text options then you come over\nhere to the layout and properties and\n\n479\n00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.670\nthere's that text direction again.\n\n480\n00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:06.380\nYou can find it in multiple places, but\njust know that I always want that or\n\n481\n00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.750\nthere's quite a few times where I do want\nthat, but I didn't know where to find it.\n\n482\n00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.030\nSo now you know of those.\n\n483\n00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:15.157\nThose are my favorite options\nthat I wanted to point out.\n\n484\n00:27:15.157 --> 00:27:19.738\nThe last thing we wanna cover with chart\nis, this is an element within my Word\n\n485\n00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:23.120\ndocument, so\nhow does it work with all the other texts?\n\n486\n00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:30.977\nFor time purposes, I'm just gonna\ntake this one, I'm gonna copy it and\n\n487\n00:27:30.977 --> 00:27:36.954\nthen I am going to open up another file,\nand we're gonna go into my files.\n\n488\n00:27:36.954 --> 00:27:40.316\nWe'll go to our,\nthat's the Essentials show,\n\n489\n00:27:40.316 --> 00:27:45.820\nwe're gonna go into the Advanced show,\n[LAUGH] and go into my Add Graphics file.\n\n490\n00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.290\nCopy and paste, I'm gonna hit\nEnter after this paragraph just,\n\n491\n00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.594\nmaybe we'll zoom in just a little bit.\n\n492\n00:27:53.594 --> 00:27:56.538\nI wanna put that in there and\nthen I'm just gonna paste it.\n\n493\n00:27:56.538 --> 00:28:01.480\nSo how does this behave in\nthe rest of my document?\n\n494\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:07.550\nWell, it behaves like a photograph does,\nor an image, to where if I grab this.\n\n495\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.279\nYeah, I could go ahead and make it\nsmaller if I wanted to, there we go.\n\n496\n00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:18.819\nBut if I start moving it, notice that\nit's in line with graphics, okay?\n\n497\n00:28:18.819 --> 00:28:22.326\nSo I wanted this to be kind\nof be like over here and\n\n498\n00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:26.560\nall the text wrapped around\nit with these item selected.\n\n499\n00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.240\nWe're gonna go over to the format tab and\nthen since my resolution is higher or\n\n500\n00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.480\nactually, wait sorry,\nlower so it appears bigger,\n\n501\n00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.010\nyou're gonna have to bring it into here.\n\n502\n00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.728\nYou probably have these\nbuttons across your ribbon.\n\n503\n00:28:39.728 --> 00:28:41.260\nThere's that wrap text.\n\n504\n00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.140\nOkay, if you're not familiar with\nany of these items right here,\n\n505\n00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.000\nI would definitely suggest going back and\ngoing into our images episode and\n\n506\n00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.220\nshowing you some of those.\n\n507\n00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.590\nWhere if I did square,\nthen I can move this around,\n\n508\n00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.740\nall the text will wrap around itself.\n\n509\n00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.516\nAnd then that might go ahead and\n\n510\n00:28:57.516 --> 00:29:01.695\nlook more like the graphical element\nthat you want this chart to be with.\n\n511\n00:29:01.695 --> 00:29:05.893\nThere is always that part of in these\nformat options with the positioning and\n\n512\n00:29:05.893 --> 00:29:10.300\nhow does it actually do like the more\nlayer options, does it move with the text?\n\n513\n00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.110\nIs it fixed within its position?\n\n514\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:16.720\nSo all of those same items that you\nhave for all graphical elements,\n\n515\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.770\ncharts are gonna go ahead and\nadhere to those practices, because well,\n\n516\n00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.720\nit is a graphical\nrepresentation of your data.\n\n517\n00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:30.620\nSo hopefully we've covered everything\nthat you could ever think about\n\n518\n00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:35.110\nwith the charts, and you won't be\nstuck in purgatory [LAUGH], and\n\n519\n00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.392\nyou'll go right to,\nyay, this is wonderful.\n\n520\n00:29:38.392 --> 00:29:39.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n521\n00:29:39.097 --> 00:29:42.420\nyou've shown us some tools where we\ncan poke around without the fear of\n\n522\n00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.080\nreally messing stuff up,\nso that's important.\n\n523\n00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.390\nAnd remember, if you forget where\nsome of those options are, well,\n\n524\n00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.210\nthere's a couple of options,\nwell, that was kinda redundant.\n\n525\n00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:51.080\nBut that's all right.\n\n526\n00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.450\nYou can go back and watch this episode,\nand the ones before it, or\n\n527\n00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:59.160\nyou can just kinda poke around, without\na lot of fear of messing things up.\n\n528\n00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.438\nRemember we, I think it was Format\noptions, format options or text doc,\n\n529\n00:30:03.438 --> 00:30:07.998\nthere is like double, I get to click it\ntwice, I don't get levels and levels.\n\n530\n00:30:07.998 --> 00:30:11.454\nSo crazy, so definitely take a look\nat some of the things that Vonne\n\n531\n00:30:11.454 --> 00:30:16.160\nhas showed us, right, see how you can make\nit, I would be interested to see that.\n\n532\n00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.939\nYou delivered on that promise\nin this episode, Vonne, and\n\n533\n00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:22.175\nthen you took it away right out from\nunder us, but that's all right.\n\n534\n00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:26.450\nBut we do have more Microsoft Word\n2016 Advanced for Mac coming at you.\n\n535\n00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.930\nBut for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n536\n00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.910\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n537\n00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:32.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n538\n00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.532\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n539\n00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:37.035\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.030\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.385\nwe are continuing on with more of our\nMicrosoft Word Advanced 2016 for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:27.070\nHopefully I got all that right and\nin the correct order,\n\n6\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.738\ncuz that's a mouthful and a half.\n\n7\n00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:31.606\nJoining us in the studio,\nto help lend her expertise on that,\n\n8\n00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:34.033\nour good friend Miss Vonne Smith,\nVonne, we're so\n\n9\n00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.791\nglad to have you today, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\n\n10\n00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:40.409\nthanks for having me back as always,\n[LAUGH] and it's Word for Mac.\n\n11\n00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:40.978\n&gt;&gt; Word for Mac.\n\n12\n00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:43.251\n&gt;&gt; Of some numbers and variety.\n\n13\n00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.493\n&gt;&gt; What about Mac for Word, [LAUGH]?\n\n14\n00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:47.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:48.900\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't work that way.\n\n16\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.048\n&gt;&gt; Maybe just the one way.\n\n17\n00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:51.934\n&gt;&gt; Make Mac run on Word,\n\n18\n00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:56.640\nthat doesn't happen, does it?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But yes, we are continuing on\n\n19\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.083\nin our graphical objects series or\ntopic area.\n\n20\n00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:05.912\nAnd this last one, we've named it\ngraphical text, I have to look this at my\n\n21\n00:01:05.912 --> 00:01:09.924\npaper too, which one are we doing?\n&gt;&gt; Some crazy naming conventions going on\n\n22\n00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:11.832\nhere, ladies and gents [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n23\n00:01:11.832 --> 00:01:14.626\nI kinda threw kind of a bunch\nof stuff together in this one.\n\n24\n00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.627\nAnd they are all text based, and\n\n25\n00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:21.461\nmost of the things we're going to be\ncovering today are graphical in nature.\n\n26\n00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:24.210\nJust like we've were doing our images,\nand our tables, and our charts, and\n\n27\n00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.660\nthe things like that.\n\n28\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.660\nSo it does fit within this particular\narea, but the hyperlinks, it's not really\n\n29\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.095\ngraphical text objects, but I just\nthrew it in there anyway, so [LAUGH].\n\n30\n00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.102\nSo that's where we're going to start,\n\n31\n00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:40.610\nis just kind of getting ourselves\nfamiliar with putting in a text box.\n\n32\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.705\nCuz everything in Word,\ndo we just go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.437\nmake sure we're at a paragraph mark?\n\n34\n00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:50.920\nAnd we type, and we enter, and\ndo all that stuff, we insert a text box,\n\n35\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.540\nwe're gonna do just that [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; It's very self explanatory,\n\n36\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.408\nisn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:58.754\n&gt;&gt; Like, how do I explain something\n\n38\n00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:01.130\nthat is intrinsically giving\nyou its own definition?\n\n39\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.142\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I tend to do that\n\n40\n00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:02.832\nall the time, and\n\n41\n00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:05.697\nevery time it comes out of my mouth,\nI'm like, there you go again [LAUGH].\n\n42\n00:02:05.697 --> 00:02:10.164\nBut yes, it's an actual object\nthat you can insert text in, and\n\n43\n00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:11.670\nit is free floating.\n\n44\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.770\nYou can put it anywhere on your page,\nas opposed to, I have to make sure I'm on\n\n45\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.880\nthe paragraph, I've gotta tab, or\ndo all different things like that.\n\n46\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.947\nThis is just a thing you move around,\nand you can do some cool stuff with it.\n\n47\n00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:25.378\nAnd we're gonna do some linked text boxes,\n\n48\n00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:30.305\nwhich when we get there you might be like,\nthis has inspired me to make a newsletter,\n\n49\n00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:33.017\nthings with different columns and\neverything.\n\n50\n00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:36.745\nAnd we could go ahead and use columns,\nbut this is just, well, you know what,\n\n51\n00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:39.078\nI'll just show y'all [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's easier,\n\n52\n00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:39.720\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n53\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.738\nit's easier to show you\nthan to explain it.\n\n54\n00:02:41.738 --> 00:02:45.446\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nget started down here in our computer.\n\n55\n00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:49.488\nI've got the start screen already up for\nour Word program, and\n\n56\n00:02:49.488 --> 00:02:52.395\nI'm just gonna start\nwith a blank document.\n\n57\n00:02:52.395 --> 00:02:55.330\nAnd there we go, I've got my blank\ndocument, oops, you know what?\n\n58\n00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.867\nI double clicked a little too many\ntimes because I actually went into\n\n59\n00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.026\nthe format document task pane.\n\n60\n00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:05.105\nI think it's like,\nyou double-click over on the side.\n\n61\n00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:08.187\nI double, you know what,\nI double-clicked somewhere, [LAUGH] and\n\n62\n00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.932\nI got myself, you know what?\n&gt;&gt; A little Jiminy clicking going on\n\n63\n00:03:10.932 --> 00:03:13.480\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; I was, and I think I double-clicked,\n\n64\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.550\nthere it is, I'm like, I know I will find\nit if I just [LAUGH] keep clicking around.\n\n65\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.518\nWhat I did is, I double clicked up into\nthe grey area, up in the ruler area.\n\n66\n00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:29.198\nAnd that's actually a shortcut to\nbring up the document properties and\n\n67\n00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:30.185\nformat document.\n\n68\n00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:34.269\nSo just in case you're like,\nwhat did you do, I had to remind myself,\n\n69\n00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.320\nbut there we are.\n\n70\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.150\nSo I'm just gonna zoom in just\na little bit, just for fun right now.\n\n71\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.640\nOkay, so like I said, we can type,\nthere's a regular text within a paragraph,\n\n72\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.700\ncuz we have our show and hide,\nI wanna make my own text box.\n\n73\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.010\nSo just like all of the other things we've\nbeen doing in our graphical objects,\n\n74\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.890\nwe're going to go into Insert, and\nwe're gonna come on over here to text box.\n\n75\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.927\nNow, the thing with insert text box in\nMac, if you are used to using Word for\n\n76\n00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:08.537\na PC, you're like,\nwhere's all the options?\n\n77\n00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:10.647\nYeah, you don't have that many in Word,\nokay.\n\n78\n00:04:10.647 --> 00:04:14.399\nThis is one of the areas to where\nthey're just gonna give you,\n\n79\n00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:17.574\nyou either go with a regular\nhorizontal text box, or\n\n80\n00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:21.274\nyou go with a vertical text box,\nthat's all you got, okay.\n\n81\n00:04:21.274 --> 00:04:24.984\nAll the fancy stuff that come\nwhat are known as quick parts and\n\n82\n00:04:24.984 --> 00:04:29.510\nhow's it all formatted there,\nthat's a PC only type of functionality.\n\n83\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.509\nLike it's not going to show up in Mac,\njust in case you're like,\n\n84\n00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.947\nI have no idea what you're talking\nabout and you've only ever used Mac,\n\n85\n00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:39.900\nI went fancy-\n&gt;&gt; Just pretend you said nothing.\n\n86\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.453\n&gt;&gt; I know, right,\n\n87\n00:04:40.453 --> 00:04:42.955\nit's like, I have no idea.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't apply to you anyway.\n\n88\n00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:45.451\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna jump over to my other user\n\n89\n00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.255\naccount for just a second.\n\n90\n00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:53.440\nAnd I actually pulled up my\nvirtual machine that does run PC.\n\n91\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.430\nAnd you can see right here,\nif I go to text box,\n\n92\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.552\nlook at all the options right there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:57.552 --> 00:04:59.149\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that they're all\n\n94\n00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:02.467\nformatted with these side quotes,\nand they're all fancy, and\n\n95\n00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:03.705\neverything like that.\n\n96\n00:05:03.705 --> 00:05:08.759\nSo none of these options are in\nthe Mac version, so just in case,\n\n97\n00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.016\ncuz I did the same thing, I'm like,\nhey, where's all my stuff?\n\n98\n00:05:14.016 --> 00:05:19.132\nYeah, doesn't exist, so let's just jump\nback over to where we're supposed to go.\n\n99\n00:05:19.132 --> 00:05:22.514\nI touched, the touch thing doesn't\nwork on that particular log in,\n\n100\n00:05:22.514 --> 00:05:25.203\nI have to type in the passwords.\n&gt;&gt; Lame.\n\n101\n00:05:25.203 --> 00:05:26.751\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious [LAUGH].\n\n102\n00:05:26.751 --> 00:05:29.296\nAll right so if I go into here and\ngo to draw text box,\n\n103\n00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:32.698\nit's just like we had when we were\ndrawing shapes or anything else.\n\n104\n00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:36.400\nIt's like I've got the crayon in my hand,\nand I'm ready to draw a text box.\n\n105\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.027\nSo I can put it anywhere on the page,\nand I click, hold, and drag.\n\n106\n00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:43.862\nNotice as I'm dragging, it will give\nme the width and height dimensions, so\n\n107\n00:05:43.862 --> 00:05:46.580\nif I had a specific width and\nheight that I need it to be.\n\n108\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.352\nYou can always change it afterwards cuz\nthen you'll click, hold, drag, and let go.\n\n109\n00:05:51.352 --> 00:05:56.076\nAnd then it goes ahead and puts\nthe flashing cursor into that text box.\n\n110\n00:05:56.076 --> 00:06:00.293\nBrings up architectural tab, like any\nother of our objects that require those.\n\n111\n00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:05.285\nAnd it will allow me to type,\nand I'll say, this is a text box,\n\n112\n00:06:05.285 --> 00:06:08.410\nooh, getting really creative today.\n\n113\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.181\nJust to make it a little easier on us, I'm\ngonna turn off that show hide character\n\n114\n00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:17.033\nbutton, just cuz we don't\nreally need to see it.\n\n115\n00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:21.654\nNotice there was an anchor, I will\njust explain that it is anchored into\n\n116\n00:06:21.654 --> 00:06:25.044\nthe particular paragraph\nthat you insert it to, but\n\n117\n00:06:25.044 --> 00:06:28.270\nit doesn't have any\ndirect correlation to it.\n\n118\n00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:35.530\nBecause when you insert a text box,\nby default, it has that word wrap that\n\n119\n00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.870\nyou are usually familiar with,\nlike with pictures and images.\n\n120\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.430\nBut it's even more than that,\nit's the square text wrap.\n\n121\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.060\nIf you're not familiar with what I'm\ntalking about, just wait a little bit,\n\n122\n00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.180\nI have another example.\n\n123\n00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.080\nBut it will allow you to grab\nit by the four pointed arrows on\n\n124\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.186\nthe edge of the text box.\n\n125\n00:06:55.186 --> 00:07:00.251\nThat's where you can take it and\nmove it anywhere you want,\n\n126\n00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:04.639\nokay, it's a free floating object okay.\n&gt;&gt; I like that,\n\n127\n00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.695\nfree object, yeah it's not anchored\nto any specific place on the page.\n\n128\n00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:11.458\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why I resisted saying\n\n129\n00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:15.470\nfloating is cuz that means\nit's above the text.\n\n130\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.629\nAnd that would imply the word wrap that\nit has, well, the text wrap that it has,\n\n131\n00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:25.572\nI'm sorry, so that's why we're like,\nthat makes sense, kind of [LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:07:25.572 --> 00:07:28.390\nSo always grab the four point arrow and\nmove this around.\n\n133\n00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.220\nAnd just like all the other objects,\nyou can rotate it, so on and so forth.\n\n134\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.060\nYou can do the fill and\nthe outline or stroke, so\n\n135\n00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.532\nI can change the fill color,\nmaybe I want to make this orange-ish,\n\n136\n00:07:41.532 --> 00:07:42.578\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Vonne,\n\n137\n00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:47.271\nthe other text on the page, obviously,\nwe have very little text that's page text.\n\n138\n00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:50.072\nHow does that work in\nassociation with an actual box,\n\n139\n00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:54.124\ndoes it kind of move around it, or-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and that's what I was\n\n140\n00:07:54.124 --> 00:07:56.366\nAnd I'm glad you asked that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.247\n&gt;&gt; Because I kept saying, yeah,\n\n142\n00:07:58.247 --> 00:07:59.950\nyou have this square text wrap.\n\n143\n00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.910\nAnd if you haven't seen\nsome of the other episodes,\n\n144\n00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.490\nyou might be like,\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n145\n00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.490\nSo why don't I take this?\n\n146\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:11.060\nI'm gonna open up this Word file.\n&gt;&gt; Just words on a page, right?\n\n147\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.220\nIf I go back into Insert and\ngo into Text Box and draw it,\n\n148\n00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.860\nwatch what's gonna happen.\n\n149\n00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.499\nEverything moves around it.\n\n150\n00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.110\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n151\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.180\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n152\n00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.708\nSo it has that text,\nsorry, square word wrap,\n\n153\n00:08:26.708 --> 00:08:31.023\nhere let me go over here,\narrange wrap text.\n\n154\n00:08:31.023 --> 00:08:33.326\nI've said it 15 different ways but\nwhat it's actually named on the button.\n\n155\n00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:35.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here's the real way to call it.\n\n156\n00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.255\nIt's called a wrap text.\n\n157\n00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:38.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there's that square.\n\n158\n00:08:38.235 --> 00:08:39.765\nSee, it's checked on with it and\n\n159\n00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:45.005\nit's moving with text as opposed\nto if it was in front of the text.\n\n160\n00:08:45.005 --> 00:08:50.950\nAnd that's what I was saying\nthe whole floating demonstrations,\n\n161\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.590\nright.\n&gt;&gt; It does kind of illustrate\n\n162\n00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.630\nthe point a little better.\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n163\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.130\ndoes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.652\n&gt;&gt; And that's why you're here to keep me\n\n165\n00:08:56.652 --> 00:09:00.424\nin check, cuz I'm just talking like, you\ndon't know what I'm talking about, right.\n\n166\n00:09:00.424 --> 00:09:02.525\n&gt;&gt; Do the thing that you know to do.\n\n167\n00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:03.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n168\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.320\n&gt;&gt; So that's what's on by default with any\n\n169\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.660\ninserting of a text box, it will wrap\nanything else around it from the borders.\n\n170\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.360\nPerfect, good.\n\n171\n00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.032\nBy the way,\nI just did a quick command tilde.\n\n172\n00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:19.350\nCommand tilde is a quick little shortcut\nto switch between open documents\n\n173\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.050\nwithin an application, and so\nthat's how I'm flipping back and\n\n174\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.240\nforth from those particular documents.\n\n175\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.820\nAll right, so\nnow we've got our text box and yes,\n\n176\n00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.530\nformatting it, fills,\nstrokes or the outlines.\n\n177\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.710\nWe could go ahead and make this green and\nwe can make it a little thicker.\n\n178\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.425\nAgain, I'm not gonna concentrate too\nheavily on all of these different\n\n179\n00:09:39.425 --> 00:09:42.630\nformatting options because we've\ncovered it in so many other episodes.\n\n180\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.590\nBut you can apply the drop shadows.\n\n181\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.670\nYou can apply the edges.\n\n182\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.360\nYou can apply the glows.\n\n183\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.670\nAnd then you can go ahead and format\nthe text that's inside of the text box.\n\n184\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.530\nNow in this particular contextual tab,\nthe shape format,\n\n185\n00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:01.610\nyou're gonna get things like the text\nfill, text outlines, and text effects,\n\n186\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.640\nwhich really all encompasses word\nart styles within any type of shape.\n\n187\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.300\nCuz this really is, if you think about it,\nthis is just a rectangle that you drew and\n\n188\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.430\nyou put text in, okay.\n\n189\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.610\nThat's like,\nhow is that different than the shape?\n\n190\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.923\nIt's not too much different.\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n191\n00:10:16.923 --> 00:10:17.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n192\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.060\n&gt;&gt; But if you wanted to change\n\n193\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.600\nthe font and the size, that's still\nback over on the home tab, okay.\n\n194\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:29.034\nWith this item select, this object\nselected, I could change this to the apple\n\n195\n00:10:29.034 --> 00:10:34.310\nchancery, and I could make this bigger,\nand I can center align it.\n\n196\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.280\nAll of those regular text formattings,\nyou still do that on the home tab.\n\n197\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.320\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like having a mini\n\n198\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.160\npage on top of a page.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n199\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.440\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're doing all\n\n200\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.200\nthe stuff that you would do normally,\n\n201\n00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.470\njust within that context.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n202\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.770\nSo yeah, it's just that,\nexactly what you said.\n\n203\n00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.151\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was getting ready to repeat you, so.\n\n204\n00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:55.595\n[LAUGH] It's almost like\nwhat you said is right.\n\n205\n00:10:55.595 --> 00:10:57.782\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What he said.\n\n206\n00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:58.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.720\n&gt;&gt; So back over to one formatting that I\n\n208\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.340\ncan't have on the home tab.\n\n209\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.140\nAnd it is on the shape format, but\nsometimes, it's a little hidden.\n\n210\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.700\nIt's how I want to align\nthe text vertically.\n\n211\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.790\nI'm kind of obsessed with vertical\njustification or vertical alignment.\n\n212\n00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.160\nIt's to the top of the textbox.\n\n213\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.640\nIf I wanted to,\nthe align text box is middle.\n\n214\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.650\nWe've been talking about aligning,\nand text wrap, and word wrap.\n\n215\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.530\nI mean, these kinda all\nseem to blend together, but\n\n216\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.270\nthis is the vertical alignment\nof the text in the box.\n\n217\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.660\nNot necessarily if I command tilde\nthe box and how it's aligned or\n\n218\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.990\nwrapping around the text\nthat's outside of it.\n\n219\n00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.580\nSo just to kinda keep it all in check.\n\n220\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.100\nAnd that's how we could go ahead and\ndo our text box.\n\n221\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.400\nNow, if you wanted to get\ninto more options than\n\n222\n00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.310\nany of these up here on the ribbon,\nyou always have your format pane button.\n\n223\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.691\nYou could also get to it by right clicking\non this and going to Format Shapes,\n\n224\n00:11:59.691 --> 00:12:02.040\nif they even call it a shape here.\n\n225\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.930\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n226\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.327\ndo that format pane because there's\nyour fill and then the effects,\n\n227\n00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:11.410\nif you wanted to really tweak any of\nthose glows or shadows that you added.\n\n228\n00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:17.270\nAnd in the text box itself you have\nthat vertical alignment right there.\n\n229\n00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.170\nThey call it Align Text on the ribbon,\n\n230\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.350\nthey call it Vertical Alignment\nwithin the pane.\n\n231\n00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.450\nAnd a few other things behind my head,\n\n232\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.970\nyou can see that they have\nsome margins in here.\n\n233\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.490\nSo if you wanted the text to kind\nof come off the edges of that box,\n\n234\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.500\nyou could go ahead and\ncommand it through this Format pane.\n\n235\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.690\nAnd then of course your alternate text.\n\n236\n00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.630\nWe talk a lot about alternate\ntext in the images episode, so\n\n237\n00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.270\ndefinitely check that out, because\nthis again, It is a graphical element.\n\n238\n00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:48.280\nYes, it has text in it but you might\nwanna add a little bit more to this.\n\n239\n00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.772\nIt's not as, I would say,\nimportant as an actual picture,\n\n240\n00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.770\nbecause then with a picture,\nyou have to give that kind\n\n241\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.710\nof text associated with that\nparticular description.\n\n242\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.620\nAll right.\nSo, graphical element, that looks good.\n\n243\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:08.080\nNow, the one thing that I wanted to show\nyou that's kinda fancy is how you can\n\n244\n00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.880\nlink text box or,\nto me they're called threaded text boxes.\n\n245\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.430\nI don't think they actually name them\nthreaded text boxes within Word.\n\n246\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.640\nIt's more of a term that you find\nin InDesign and Illustrator,\n\n247\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.290\nbut it's how you can connect text to\nflow through the different boxes.\n\n248\n00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.310\nLet me show you.\n\n249\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.690\nLet's go back and insert a text box again.\n\n250\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.000\nWe'll draw a box here.\n\n251\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.410\nWe'll click, hold and drag.\n\n252\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.450\nJust keep it blank for now.\n\n253\n00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:40.400\nI'm going to do that command tilde to\nswitch back over to this particular file\n\n254\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.540\nbecause I wanted to get more text and\nI didn't wanna type.\n\n255\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.220\nSo I'm just gonna select all this.\n\n256\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.450\nI could do a Cmd+A if I wanted to,\nI can Cmd+C to copy, but\n\n257\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.260\nI'll go ahead and right-click so\nyou guys can see me do this.\n\n258\n00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.920\nI will then command tilde\nto flip back over here.\n\n259\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.270\nFlashing cursor inside the text box,\nI'm going to go ahead and paste.\n\n260\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.810\nNow, you saw that there\nwas a lot more text\n\n261\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.120\nin this particular document\nthan is showing in that, right.\n\n262\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.650\nSo it's kind of, well it's hanging out.\n\n263\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.750\nIt's not-\n&gt;&gt; It's in there.\n\n264\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.690\nWe're just not seeing it.\n\n265\n00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.250\nCause it's saying, well the box is only so\nbig and you've got all this text,\n\n266\n00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:17.190\nso It's there but you're gonna have to do\nsome resizing if you wanna see it all.\n\n267\n00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Wow, again, perfect lead in.\n\n268\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.470\nCuz you could resize it, right?\n\n269\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.360\nThe two pointed arrows, cuz we did\nthe four pointed arrows to move the thing\n\n270\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.770\naround, two pointed arrows to resize this.\n&gt;&gt; Like a window, right?\n\n271\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.710\nIf you ever stepped away from a window and\nyou can only see a bit of the picture of\n\n272\n00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.300\nthe outside but the closer you come,\nbasically resizing the window\n\n273\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.580\nin your perspective, you get to see more.\n&gt;&gt; And I know you do some photo editings\n\n274\n00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.610\nthings like matting or masks basically.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's the same thing.\n\n275\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.170\nSo I just gotta go ahead and\nkind of show a little bit more.\n\n276\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.970\nBut maybe the space that I want this\nto occupy for this area is right\n\n277\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:59.040\nhere but I'm gonna need to flow\nthis into another text box.\n\n278\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.280\nAnd this is where I start\nthinking about newsletters.\n\n279\n00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.825\nRight, because maybe I've\ngot this story over here,\n\n280\n00:15:05.825 --> 00:15:09.325\nand I got some other stuff ,and maybe\nI wanna have continued on page two.\n\n281\n00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.855\nRight?\nAnd so I wanna put this somewhere else.\n\n282\n00:15:11.855 --> 00:15:15.265\nI'm gonna keep it on the same page\njust for these demonstrations.\n\n283\n00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:19.205\nSo, the steps are, and\nyou do have to follow this process.\n\n284\n00:15:19.205 --> 00:15:20.595\nThis is the first text box.\n\n285\n00:15:20.595 --> 00:15:23.690\nPut the text with the overflow\ntext as we call it.\n\n286\n00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.990\nCome back and insert another text box.\n\n287\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.990\nOkay, I'm gonna just click and\ndraw here, that's fine right there.\n\n288\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.400\nYou have to draw the text box first,\nthat's kinda the key.\n\n289\n00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.260\nCome back up and select the other\ntext box that you had the text in.\n\n290\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.230\nIt's still there, by the way.\n\n291\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.311\nI just don't have an outline on it, but\n\n292\n00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:43.003\nnotice when I hover, it kinda gives that.\n&gt;&gt; It shows\n\n293\n00:15:43.003 --> 00:15:44.540\nup.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n294\n00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.583\nHave this selected up here\non the Shape Format tab.\n\n295\n00:15:47.583 --> 00:15:50.797\nIt says, Create Link.\n\n296\n00:15:50.797 --> 00:15:56.551\nTake this and create a link from this and\nput it into another box.\n\n297\n00:15:56.551 --> 00:16:00.805\nSo you click it, notice that it turns\ninto this little chain looking icon.\n\n298\n00:16:00.805 --> 00:16:04.644\nIt looks like a little pitcher\nin the Word for PC, and\n\n299\n00:16:04.644 --> 00:16:07.186\nyou pour the letters into the box.\n\n300\n00:16:07.186 --> 00:16:08.320\nIt's really cute.\nThey don't have that in Mac.\n\n301\n00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:14.150\nAnd now you're gonna find the other\ntext box that you want to then\n\n302\n00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.670\npour the rest of the text into and\nthen there it goes.\n\n303\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.120\nSo this, and\nif you move the text boxes around,\n\n304\n00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.280\nyou can really see.\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n305\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.220\nis cool.\n\n306\n00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.050\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that neat?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n307\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they've labeled them, see?\n\n308\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.090\nThis says, number 1 up there\nin the top left if I hover.\n\n309\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.570\nAnd you can see it says number two.\n\n310\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.450\nIt's really light.\n\n311\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.300\nSo in case you can't see that,\nit's like a very faint orange.\n\n312\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.540\nSo there's number two.\n\n313\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.920\nAnd then I can go ahead and\nchange the size of this.\n\n314\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.670\nNow this one, obviously,\nit's not gonna change how it flows.\n\n315\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.240\nBut I could even make another one.\n\n316\n00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.171\nThis is the biggest problem that people\nhave is they'll say, okay, I want a link.\n\n317\n00:16:49.171 --> 00:16:51.350\nSo, they have this text box.\n\n318\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.334\nThey click Create Link,\nand then they click.\n\n319\n00:16:53.334 --> 00:16:59.595\nAnd it's like no, no, no, you gotta draw\nthe text box that's gotta go into first.\n\n320\n00:16:59.595 --> 00:17:05.958\nSo, if I went back over to Insert, went to\nText Box, drew another text box just for\n\n321\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:10.388\nfun, now,\nclicking back the originating Create link,\n\n322\n00:17:10.388 --> 00:17:15.520\nclick in that box, and\nnotice how now everything is flowing.\n\n323\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.300\nAnd anything that I change in these\ndifferent boxes is gonna go ahead and\n\n324\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.140\nflow through the other ones.\n\n325\n00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.210\nAnd you could put borders on this.\n\n326\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.870\nYou can change it.\n\n327\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.099\nYou can change the font size.\n\n328\n00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:29.863\nBut it's kinda neat to see how\nyou can link text boxes from one\n\n329\n00:17:29.863 --> 00:17:33.796\nstory to another if you wanted to do that.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n330\n00:17:33.796 --> 00:17:35.620\n&gt;&gt; Cool stuff, neat things.\n\n331\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.274\nAnd yeah, that's it for text boxes.\n\n332\n00:17:40.274 --> 00:17:43.081\nTrying to think am I missing anything?\n&gt;&gt; Am I missing anything?\n\n333\n00:17:43.081 --> 00:17:44.029\n&gt;&gt; No, we're good.\n\n334\n00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:45.600\n[LAUGH] I've got my notes.\n\n335\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.050\nOkay, so the next thing that we're gonna\ndo for graphical text objects is Word Art.\n\n336\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.600\nNow this is a weird one because\nit's like well, it's right there.\n\n337\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.196\nIt says Word Art, right?\n\n338\n00:17:55.196 --> 00:17:58.990\nThen why, yeah, all right.\n\n339\n00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.700\nIf you go over to Insert,\n\n340\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.690\nthere is an actual command on\nyour ribbon that says Word Art.\n\n341\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.942\nOkay, but the thing is, if you do this,\n\n342\n00:18:08.942 --> 00:18:14.588\nit's the exact same thing as if I had\ndrawn a text box, typed text in and\n\n343\n00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:19.320\nthen formatted it on the shape\nformat tab to have word art.\n\n344\n00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.919\nWhat it is, is just a collection\nof formatting of the fills,\n\n345\n00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:26.685\nstrokes, and effects on text.\n\n346\n00:18:26.685 --> 00:18:28.485\nSo all of these styles,\n\n347\n00:18:28.485 --> 00:18:32.785\nwe know what a style is from all of\nour other episodes, it's just that.\n\n348\n00:18:32.785 --> 00:18:34.991\nSo I could have it even from here.\n\n349\n00:18:34.991 --> 00:18:36.355\nLet me go ahead and zoom in a little bit.\n\n350\n00:18:37.465 --> 00:18:41.300\nSay I'm on regular text, this is\njust regular paragraph text, right?\n\n351\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.950\nI come over to the home tab, notice\nyou have right here, the word art or\n\n352\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:46.590\ntext effects.\n\n353\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.860\nThey don't call it word art but that\nlooks the exact same, doesn't it, Daniel?\n\n354\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.200\n&gt;&gt; Very, very similar.\n\n355\n00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is, it's the exact same.\n\n356\n00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.073\n&gt;&gt; Because it is the exact same\n\n357\n00:18:55.073 --> 00:18:56.807\nthing [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like,\n\n358\n00:18:56.807 --> 00:18:58.350\nall right, well, I-\n&gt;&gt; Confusing?\n\n359\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have regular text that I can\n\n360\n00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:03.378\nformat as word art styles on my home tab.\n\n361\n00:19:03.378 --> 00:19:06.934\nI have a text box that I could\ngo ahead and format as word art.\n\n362\n00:19:06.934 --> 00:19:10.300\nHere let me just go ahead and click one.\n\n363\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.210\nThere we go.\n\n364\n00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:16.240\nOr I can go to Insert,\ngo to Word Art, click one of these.\n\n365\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.451\nAnd then it pops in a text box with\nthat word art already formatted.\n\n366\n00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:25.613\nAnd then I type in Hello.\n\n367\n00:19:25.613 --> 00:19:27.898\nSo it's all the same one way or the other,\n\n368\n00:19:27.898 --> 00:19:28.976\nhonestly.\n&gt;&gt; Six of one,\n\n369\n00:19:28.976 --> 00:19:31.860\nhalf a dozen of the other kind of thing?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you know me and my sayings.\n\n370\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.170\nI always forget them so\nI'm always glad that you're here.\n\n371\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.810\nSo the only thing that's a little strange\non this, and here I'll go ahead and\n\n372\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:44.410\ndo this on the other file just for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n373\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.540\nIf I come over and do Word Art and\ndo the same thing and\n\n374\n00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.100\nthen I type in Vonne, whatever.\n\n375\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.994\nNotice that this word art,\nthe textwrap is not\n\n376\n00:19:54.994 --> 00:20:00.277\nautomatically applied\nlike the Insert Textbox.\n\n377\n00:20:00.277 --> 00:20:04.649\nThis one, see does a word wrap.\n\n378\n00:20:04.649 --> 00:20:09.440\nAnd then this one it's on this\nlike through or on top of.\n\n379\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.950\nSo you might need to change\nthat if you need to.\n\n380\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.800\nSo it's just right back over here on the\nShape Format and you can go into Arrange.\n\n381\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.520\nAnd then you do the wrap text, and\ndo the square, and have the same one.\n\n382\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.514\nSo it's a small little detail.\n\n383\n00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:27.450\nBut you know about all of these other\nways that you can format graphical\n\n384\n00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.710\nobjects anyways.\n\n385\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.798\nSo you already knew [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:20:30.798 --> 00:20:31.620\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it's\n\n387\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.320\nkind of like an independent object versus\nhow you format it in other places.\n\n388\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.660\nBut it's all the same thing.\n\n389\n00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.350\nAnd it's a button on the Insert tab, so\nI figured I would go ahead and cover it.\n\n390\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:47.820\nNow, the other thing that you have on the\nInsert tab is you have links right here.\n\n391\n00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.680\nThere's quite a few other things.\n\n392\n00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.110\nYou have links, bookmarks,\nand cross-references.\n\n393\n00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.450\nI am not going to cover the bookmarks and\nthe cross-references\n\n394\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.390\nin their detail within this particular\nepisode, or really, this whole show.\n\n395\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.512\nI save that for\nthe Word expert level show.\n\n396\n00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.630\nOoh, I know, sounds fancy, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n397\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.463\nit is all together in\nthis one little section.\n\n398\n00:21:08.463 --> 00:21:12.970\nAnd like I said, I'll just go ahead and\nthrow it in, hyperlink.\n\n399\n00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.039\nThis is the whole,\nI'm assuming you know what a hyperlink is\n\n400\n00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:18.791\nwell, cuz you had to-\n&gt;&gt; It's a link that's had too much sugar\n\n401\n00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:22.534\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that, that's funny.\n\n402\n00:21:22.534 --> 00:21:23.768\n&gt;&gt; I am good, I'm here all week,\n\n403\n00:21:23.768 --> 00:21:26.220\nladies and gentlemen.\n&gt;&gt; He's throwing me off of these.\n\n404\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.491\nI'm like ta ta ta, that's a good one.\n\n405\n00:21:29.491 --> 00:21:32.820\n[LAUGH] I cant stop laughing now.\n&gt;&gt; A chocolate bar.\n\n406\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.290\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I've had too much sugar right\n\n407\n00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.390\nnow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n408\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.180\n&gt;&gt; I say I'm assuming you know what\n\n409\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.530\na hyperlink is because you had to have\n\n410\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.820\nclicked on this to get to\nthis particular episode.\n\n411\n00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.148\nBecause you have links all over a webpage,\nright?\n\n412\n00:21:44.148 --> 00:21:46.167\nSpeaking of why don't we go ahead and\n\n413\n00:21:46.167 --> 00:21:47.795\nbring up our ITProTV web?\n&gt;&gt; A webpage.\n\n414\n00:21:47.795 --> 00:21:49.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I wanted to like\n\n415\n00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:54.700\nclick on something or go somewhere a lot\nof times if it's words do you know what\n\n416\n00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.340\nwould indicate to you if this particular\nword, let's say it was a link,\n\n417\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.140\nit would be formatted as?\n&gt;&gt; It's usually some sort of blue\n\n418\n00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.623\ncolor and maybe even underlined.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n419\n00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:07.890\nwell, depending on the theme of the,\nyes, but exactly.\n\n420\n00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.020\nIt has some type of visual indication\nthat you are able to click on it.\n\n421\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.260\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is not just standard text.\n\n422\n00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n423\n00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.880\nso that's what we're going\nto do in our Word document.\n\n424\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.800\nMaybe I want to create a link to ITProTV.\n\n425\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:27.620\nWell, if it's an actual web page, a web\naddress or a URL, all the same thing.\n\n426\n00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:32.126\nYou can just come out, navigate out in\nyour browser to the particular webpage\n\n427\n00:22:32.126 --> 00:22:34.638\nthat you want to go ahead and\nmake a link in.\n\n428\n00:22:34.638 --> 00:22:37.430\nYou copy the link up in the address bar.\n\n429\n00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.490\nI'm going to do a Cmd+Tab this time.\n\n430\n00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:44.012\nCmd+Tab is gonna switch\nbetween my open applications.\n\n431\n00:22:44.012 --> 00:22:47.100\nCmd+tilde is documents\nwithin the application.\n\n432\n00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.625\nAnd then I'm going to do Cmd+tilde,\ncome over here.\n\n433\n00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:53.008\nAnd then you know what?\n\n434\n00:22:53.008 --> 00:22:56.917\nLet's just go ahead and do Cmd+N, sorry,\nI'm just throwing them all in there,\n\n435\n00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:58.119\njust for a new document.\n\n436\n00:22:58.119 --> 00:23:02.010\nAnd then I will do a Cmd paste.\n\n437\n00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:02.510\nI did a lot of\n\n438\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.260\nshortcuts in that little guy.\n&gt;&gt; Lot of commanding.\n\n439\n00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.612\n&gt;&gt; Right, now you're like okay,\n\n440\n00:23:05.612 --> 00:23:07.020\nthat's just text.\n\n441\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.020\nBut as soon as you hit\nthe Space bar after that URL,\n\n442\n00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.934\nthe HTTP, S or not S,\nthis one has an S, ://,\n\n443\n00:23:16.934 --> 00:23:21.320\nit indicates that I see\nthis as an actual URL.\n\n444\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:27.880\nSo I am going to automatically make\na link for you to have, is our site.\n\n445\n00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:34.150\nSo notice, there's that blue in underline,\nthat is the default formatting for links.\n\n446\n00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:39.379\nAnd now I know, this would give me\nan indication right here, that if I was on\n\n447\n00:23:39.379 --> 00:23:44.704\nthis Word document, and I clicked on this-\n&gt;&gt; What was interesting, Vonne,\n\n448\n00:23:44.704 --> 00:23:49.864\nis that when you dumped the URL on to\nthe page, Word went hey, it's a URL,\n\n449\n00:23:49.864 --> 00:23:54.794\nit's a web link, and boom,\ndid blue highlighting and underlining.\n\n450\n00:23:54.794 --> 00:23:58.800\nAnd you have the little clicky thing\ngo over it when the hand shows up.\n\n451\n00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:05.474\nWhen you hover over it, but\nI know you can even go beyond that, right?\n\n452\n00:24:05.474 --> 00:24:10.765\n[CROSSTALK] Cuz I've done this before,\nyou can actually take some text,\n\n453\n00:24:10.765 --> 00:24:16.156\nhighlight it, and say, make this a link,\nand it asks you what is the URL?\n\n454\n00:24:16.156 --> 00:24:20.021\nYou don't see the URL, the text is there,\nbut it highlights it just like this.\n\n455\n00:24:20.021 --> 00:24:23.419\nAnd if you click on it, it takes you to\nthe URL that you've kind of embedded into\n\n456\n00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:24.712\nit, right?\n&gt;&gt; Have you been reading our show notes?\n\n457\n00:24:24.712 --> 00:24:25.441\n&gt;&gt; I have not at all.\n\n458\n00:24:25.441 --> 00:24:27.115\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, actually.\n\n459\n00:24:27.115 --> 00:24:28.483\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how to read.\n\n460\n00:24:28.483 --> 00:24:30.216\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't read the [LAUGH].\n\n461\n00:24:30.216 --> 00:24:31.051\nThat's why I have you to tell me.\n\n462\n00:24:31.051 --> 00:24:36.200\nBut yes, that's exactly right,\nand that is in the notes,\n\n463\n00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.211\nyes, good job, Daniel [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I'm smart [LAUGH].\n\n464\n00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:41.887\n&gt;&gt; And you're correct because this was why\n\n465\n00:24:41.887 --> 00:24:45.505\nI was copying the link as it\nappears in the web browser,\n\n466\n00:24:45.505 --> 00:24:47.640\nthe URL with the whole address.\n\n467\n00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.800\nAnd I just popped it in there,\nand it did go in there and\n\n468\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.623\nmake a hyperlink out of it.\n&gt;&gt; That's smart.\n\n469\n00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:53.339\n&gt;&gt; It is, and the little finger,\n\n470\n00:24:53.339 --> 00:24:55.710\nfinger's gonna take you somewhere.\n\n471\n00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:56.740\nSo you click it, and\n\n472\n00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:01.450\nnow since Safari's my default browser,\nthat's why it opened up Safari.\n\n473\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.140\nI use Chrome, so\nI copied it from Chrome, and\n\n474\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.320\nthen it opened up in whatever your\ndefault browser is for your OS.\n\n475\n00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.190\nSo that's pretty cool, and like you were\njust saying, you've seen it other ways,\n\n476\n00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.980\nsorry I'm like, where am I?\n\n477\n00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.571\nOkay, let's go back where we were.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n478\n00:25:15.571 --> 00:25:18.616\n&gt;&gt; So if I said, okay, well, here,\n\n479\n00:25:18.616 --> 00:25:24.200\nhow about we say, visit,\nwe'll see if we I can visit our site.\n\n480\n00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.353\nAnd I want those words to be a clickable\nlink that takes you out to ITProTV.\n\n481\n00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:34.030\nI just don't want it to show up as a URL,\nright?\n\n482\n00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.800\nYes, you are correct, and\nthat's where you got me a little scared,\n\n483\n00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.500\nI'm like, beyond what?\n\n484\n00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.880\nI don't have anything else beyond that.\n\n485\n00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.070\nI do,\nI just understand what you're saying now.\n\n486\n00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:47.200\nSo I typed in my text, I select my text,\nand if you go into that insert tab,\n\n487\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.320\ncoming around full circle,\nI can insert a hyperlink here.\n\n488\n00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.280\nOr you can right-click,\nand go to hyperlink,\n\n489\n00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.600\nor Cmd+K is your keyboard shortcut,\nwhichever way you want to go.\n\n490\n00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.540\nAnd here is the box,\nthis is what you were seeing before.\n\n491\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.186\n&gt;&gt; I've seen it,\n\n492\n00:26:01.186 --> 00:26:02.245\nI knew I've seen it.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n493\n00:26:02.245 --> 00:26:05.790\nnow the text to display\nis what we had selected.\n\n494\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.620\nSo that's why you don't necessarily\nhave to type this in if you already\n\n495\n00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.140\nhave it there and select it.\n\n496\n00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.410\nI do wanna go to a web page, so\nI've already got this up there.\n\n497\n00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.420\nI've already got it copied\nfrom once before so\n\n498\n00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.660\nI'm gonna paste that URL right into here,\nand then I click OK.\n\n499\n00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.420\nAnd now the visit our site\nbecomes blue and underlined.\n\n500\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.600\nAnd then I go ahead and click it, and\nit's gonna come back up to the same site\n\n501\n00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.990\nthat I'm already on,\nand that's pretty cool.\n\n502\n00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:36.350\nBut one thing that is neat about Mac Word,\nbesides the PC Word, is a lot of times,\n\n503\n00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:41.705\nyou have to hold your Ctrl key to\nfollow the hyperlink, in Word for PC.\n\n504\n00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:43.110\nIn Word for Mac,\n\n505\n00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.780\nit just goes, you don't have to worry\nabout that, which I think is kinda cool.\n\n506\n00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:51.711\nIt's more intuitive, which I always\nthink a Mac is automatically,\n\n507\n00:26:51.711 --> 00:26:54.949\nbut that's me being very\nbiased on that one.\n\n508\n00:26:54.949 --> 00:26:59.121\nOne last thing, and\njust to kinda quickly cover it.\n\n509\n00:26:59.121 --> 00:27:05.820\nI'm gonna open up a file that you guys\nhave, you have the file of the text.\n\n510\n00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.130\nBut the text for link boxes,\nthe one I copied and pasted it for\n\n511\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.310\nour link text boxes,\nyou have access to that, and\n\n512\n00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.700\nof course this other file that\nI'm going to access for you.\n\n513\n00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:21.337\nAnd I have to remember that it is,\nwhich, nope, this, there it is, okay.\n\n514\n00:27:21.337 --> 00:27:25.032\n[LAUGH] We're gonna go to\nthe hyperlinks and text boxes,\n\n515\n00:27:25.032 --> 00:27:27.240\nit's just text that I have here.\n\n516\n00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.970\nBecause yes, hyperlinking out to\na web page, we just covered that, but\n\n517\n00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.665\nwhat if I needed it to\nbe within my document?\n\n518\n00:27:36.665 --> 00:27:39.750\nAgain, this gets a little bit more\ninto stuff that we're going to cover\n\n519\n00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.870\nin the Word expert show.\n\n520\n00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:48.290\nBut if I wanted to, for some reason, have\nquick way to get down to the white knight.\n\n521\n00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:52.370\nNow, notice all of this text, and it's\nokay to not be necessarily reading it,\n\n522\n00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:57.080\njust look at it from a zoomed out\npurposes, it is formatted with headings.\n\n523\n00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:02.580\nHeadings, you all know how much I love\nsome styles, use them to your advantage.\n\n524\n00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:07.203\nBecause you can place\nlinks within the document,\n\n525\n00:28:07.203 --> 00:28:11.836\nlike we'll say,\ngo to the white knight section.\n\n526\n00:28:11.836 --> 00:28:13.850\nOkay, so I'll zoom in here so\nyou can see that a little bit more.\n\n527\n00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.578\nType in my text, select the text\nI want to make a hyperlink.\n\n528\n00:28:18.578 --> 00:28:23.530\nRight click, Hyperlink,\nI'm not going out to a web page.\n\n529\n00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.040\nI could link it to a file,\n\n530\n00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.210\nif I wanted that text to open up a whole\nother Excel file, maybe as a reference.\n\n531\n00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.815\nMaybe you're doing a report, and you're\nalways referencing a file that has codes\n\n532\n00:28:34.815 --> 00:28:38.781\nfor departments or whatever,\nput a hyperlink right to open that file.\n\n533\n00:28:38.781 --> 00:28:41.044\nRemember, if you send that to\nsomebody else, though, and\n\n534\n00:28:41.044 --> 00:28:43.750\nthey don't have the file in the same\nlocation, it ain't gonna work.\n\n535\n00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.770\nBut we're going to do a link for\nthis document, and\n\n536\n00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.120\nnotice it has, right there, headings.\n\n537\n00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.840\nYou use your headings,\nyou can use them as navigation.\n\n538\n00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.770\nSo I could just say,\n\n539\n00:28:54.770 --> 00:29:00.110\nlet's just jump down into The White\nKnight, you click OK, makes a hyperlink.\n\n540\n00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.980\nYou get the little finger\nwhen you hover over it.\n\n541\n00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.710\nWhen you click it, it's just gonna\ntake you right down into that\n\n542\n00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.260\nparticular area of the document,\nso that's pretty cool.\n\n543\n00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.950\nUsing headings is a really easy\nway that you can use those\n\n544\n00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:18.160\nhyperlinks in conjunction with\nmaybe going around your document.\n\n545\n00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.330\nNow if you're like that could be a table\nof contents, don't do it this way.\n\n546\n00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.860\nThere's a much easier way to create\na table of contents in the next show or\n\n547\n00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.000\nin the next level of shows,\nso definitely check that out.\n\n548\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.134\nAnd really, really quickly just to\nshow you, if you do a hyperlink,\n\n549\n00:29:33.134 --> 00:29:35.863\nnotice there wasn't an area for bookmarks.\n\n550\n00:29:35.863 --> 00:29:40.506\nIf you make a bookmark first,\nyou can make a specific spot\n\n551\n00:29:40.506 --> 00:29:45.320\nin your document that\ndoesn't exist like a heading.\n\n552\n00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.570\nIt could be a random word, like I want,\nDinah was a cat, to be like a marked area.\n\n553\n00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:56.400\nThat once I mark this area as a bookmark,\nyou can hyperlink to that bookmark.\n\n554\n00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.890\nSo, just kind of giving you a gloss\nover on that one if you're like,\n\n555\n00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.750\nI wanna know more about this.\n\n556\n00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.848\nGuess what I'm gonna say,\n\n557\n00:30:03.848 --> 00:30:07.012\ncheck out the expert level show [LAUGH]\nbecause I have more information on that.\n\n558\n00:30:07.012 --> 00:30:13.370\nBut that I believe is the end of my\ngraphical text objects episode here.\n\n559\n00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.970\nAnd I hope you all have some a little\nbit of fun with those link textboxes.\n\n560\n00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.919\nIt is always one that everyone's like,\nthat's neat.\n\n561\n00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:23.905\nLike, I don't think I'll ever use it,\nbut I think it's really neat, [LAUGH] so\n\n562\n00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:27.024\nI've used it a few times.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, it was a fun and\n\n563\n00:30:27.024 --> 00:30:31.320\ninteresting look at graphical text\nobjects inside of Word for a Mac.\n\n564\n00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.758\nIt's a lot of fun, we played around\nwith it, now you get to go out there and\n\n565\n00:30:34.758 --> 00:30:37.109\nactually kind of use this\nstuff as hacking stuff.\n\n566\n00:30:37.109 --> 00:30:39.728\nBecause you can put those links in there,\nand just because it says it's\n\n567\n00:30:39.728 --> 00:30:41.823\na link to something doesn't\nmean it's a link to that, so\n\n568\n00:30:41.823 --> 00:30:43.859\njust keep that in mind.\n&gt;&gt; For security purposes.\n\n569\n00:30:43.859 --> 00:30:45.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for security purposes,\n\n570\n00:30:45.535 --> 00:30:46.410\nthat's right.\n\n571\n00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.990\nSo you can have fun with these things in\nways they probably weren't intended to\n\n572\n00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.704\nhave fun with.\n\n573\n00:30:50.704 --> 00:30:53.975\nThat being said, we do appreciate\nVonne for you dropping by, so\n\n574\n00:30:53.975 --> 00:30:57.800\nyou could show us how to hack our\nfriends using Word inside our Macs.\n\n575\n00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.610\nAnd we do thank you good folks\nout there for watching, but\n\n576\n00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.900\nit looks like we are out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n577\n00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.400\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n578\n00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:04.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne

That's the thing you're talking about,\ntemplates.\n\n22\n00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, it is in\nthe automation part of the show, and\n\n23\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.381\nI realize that I actually have\nthe wrong topic in my notes.\n\n24\n00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:06.481\nI'm like,\nI know it's named something around that-\n\n25\n00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:07.866\n&gt;&gt; Really messing yourself up today.\n\n26\n00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.130\n&gt;&gt; I really am.\n\n27\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.370\nI've got myself all backwards,\n\n28\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.030\na little bit, but templates is one of\nmy favourite topics to talk about,\n\n29\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.710\nbecause it's one of those\npeople use incorrectly.\n\n30\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.280\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, so we look at it, average\neveryday Joe, looks at this thing and\n\n31\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.690\ngoes, this is what that's used for,\nthis is how it's supposed to be done.\n\n32\n00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.870\nAnd you're like yeah no.\n\n33\n00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and this is more into the like\n\n34\n00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.194\nokay if I really wanted to like\nthat's not really a template.\n\n35\n00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:40.220\n&gt;&gt; Be a Word snob?\n\n36\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.905\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I don't, I don't.\n\n37\n00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:46.346\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But I know what they're talking about,\n\n38\n00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:47.520\nbecause templates.\n\n39\n00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.600\nOkay so if I said, hey I'm going\nto send you this template of our\n\n40\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.590\nshow notes format that you're supposed to\nput the topic of the show in properly.\n\n41\n00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.130\nI send you just a regular Word file,\nwhat do you do?\n\n42\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.360\nYou open it, you change up some things,\nand then you save it as a different name.\n\n43\n00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.190\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Under like Daniel Show Notes.\n\n44\n00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.280\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\nthat's exactly what I do and\n\n45\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.840\nthat's what I would call a template.\n\n46\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.793\n&gt;&gt; That's not the true\nmeaning of a template.\n\n47\n00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:17.820\n&gt;&gt; Actually a template is,\nthat's right, pinkies up, everyone.\n\n48\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.848\n&gt;&gt; Pinkies up.\n&gt;&gt; Pinkies up,\n\n49\n00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:21.525\nwe're about to get schooled up\non what an actual template is.\n\n50\n00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:23.710\nVonne, hit us with some\ntemplate knowledge.\n\n51\n00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.120\nWhy are we wrong on this?\n\n52\n00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.230\n&gt;&gt; Because, I mean,\nthat's just how we talk about things.\n\n53\n00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.670\nYeah, it's a starting point cuz that\nreally is what we think of a template,\n\n54\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.670\nin general talking.\n\n55\n00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.730\nI was like hey this is how I do\nmy show notes and so you just\n\n56\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.970\ntake my regular Word file and do a save\nas and change up the information, great.\n\n57\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.890\nIn the true sense of using\na template properly in Word\n\n58\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.750\nyou're actually never starting\nfrom an existing Word document.\n\n59\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.930\nYou're always creating a new file from\na template, I always call it like a stamp.\n\n60\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.292\nIf you take a rubber stamp, and\nit's like made, and then you take it and\n\n61\n00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:09.630\nyou stamp it on the piece of paper and\nthen you write on top of it.\n\n62\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.690\nI always remember when I was-\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if it said to and from and\n\n63\n00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.660\nyou stamp, bam, there's the template,\nthe to and from I fill out myself.\n\n64\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.880\n&gt;&gt; Correct and you're never actually\nopening up the actual stamp.\n\n65\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's always the same.\n\n66\n00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes and then the memory I have\nis when I was about really small.\n\n67\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.636\nMy mom would have all the checks.\n\n68\n00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:30.600\nWe had a farm and my mom ran all\nthe books and everything like that.\n\n69\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.058\nAnd so she would take the checks and\nstamp it and\n\n70\n00:03:33.058 --> 00:03:35.719\nwrite in little boxes then\nwe would go to the bank.\n\n71\n00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.656\nAnd then I would always get to pick out\nthe Dum Dum lollipops, and you know those,\n\n72\n00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:41.180\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.097\n&gt;&gt; My mom worked at a bank.\n\n74\n00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:42.890\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n75\n00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.600\n&gt;&gt; She did.\n\n76\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.540\n&gt;&gt; Gosh,\nyou got all sorts of Dum Dums the.\n\n77\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.640\n&gt;&gt; I remember getting to watch\nthem open that vault and\n\n78\n00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.350\ncount the money every morning.\n\n79\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.060\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; There was this table of money,\n\n80\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.070\nit was amazing.\n\n81\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.870\nTo a child, you're like, this is insane.\n\n82\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.077\n&gt;&gt; And I'm like, lollipops.\n\n83\n00:03:56.077 --> 00:03:58.899\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, come on, forget the lollipops.\n\n84\n00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.070\n&gt;&gt; So that's what I always remember.\n\n85\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.888\nAnd that's like how my memory of how\nI equate back to using a template.\n\n86\n00:04:04.888 --> 00:04:08.429\nThat stamp that she had on a little\ncarousel, spin the little thing and\n\n87\n00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.192\npick up the stamp and then, boop.\n\n88\n00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:14.318\nAnd then there you go, then she put the\nstamp back, and every check, boom, boom.\n\n89\n00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:19.600\nSo, every time you're making\na new document off of that stamp,\n\n90\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.800\nand that's what you do.\n\n91\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.710\nThe template that you're\nmaking the new file off of\n\n92\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.642\nIt's actually a whole different\nfile format than a docx,\n\n93\n00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:32.720\nthat we're used to using,\na regular Word file, docx.\n\n94\n00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.680\nA template is a dotx,\nit doesn't live anywhere.\n\n95\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.200\nYou don't open the template file\nto make a new one off of it.\n\n96\n00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.064\nThat's the right way of\nusing a template in Word.\n\n97\n00:04:47.064 --> 00:04:49.164\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nlet's stop talking about this then,\n\n98\n00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:52.106\nshow us how we should be working\nwith templates inside of Word.\n\n99\n00:04:52.106 --> 00:04:53.254\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we do that?\n\n100\n00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:54.424\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\n\n101\n00:04:54.424 --> 00:04:57.794\njump on down in here and\nI've got Word- do I have Word up?\n\n102\n00:04:57.794 --> 00:04:59.280\nOkay, yes I do.\n\n103\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.830\n&gt;&gt; Word up!\n\n104\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.290\n&gt;&gt; So we have our starting file.\n\n105\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.010\nActually every time you make a blank new\ndocument, when I say blank document,\n\n106\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.490\nyou think just File &gt;

Right, you can do that.\n\n259\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.332\nYou'd just be wrong if you did.\n\n260\n00:12:19.332 --> 00:12:19.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n261\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.380\nkeep on using the terminology, because we\nall use it as a general way of talking.\n\n262\n00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.730\nThe way you really should do this,\nis every time that I want to make a new\n\n263\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:33.080\nletter to one of my customers,\nI want to just come in here and\n\n264\n00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.120\nput in their name there and\nput in the cost there.\n\n265\n00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.200\nAnd then I'd be ready to go.\n\n266\n00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.981\nSo if you have a document that\nyou want to create a template, so\n\n267\n00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:43.526\nthat way you can do this.\n\n268\n00:12:43.526 --> 00:12:47.060\nHere, let me go ahead and close this,\ncuz I already make an example.\n\n269\n00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:52.870\nNew from template, and then I click on,\nlook at that, Christmas Cats, Example.\n\n270\n00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.525\nI click on this as a new file,\nit says Document 5 and\n\n271\n00:12:56.525 --> 00:13:01.310\nthen all I’ve gotta do is type in,\nokay, let's go with Daniel.\n\n272\n00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.339\nI guess I should have not put\nthe parenthesis around it.\n\n273\n00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:08.240\nAnd then I could go ahead and\nsay we need to make our tree costume.\n\n274\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.987\nI can't think of anything else in there.\n\n275\n00:13:10.987 --> 00:13:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Tree. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; $35 [LAUGH] snow.\n\n276\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.376\nDon't know where you're buying your trees.\n\n277\n00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:14.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know where-\n\n278\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.100\n&gt;&gt; You must have meant a little\n\n279\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.553\nCharlie Brown is that what that is?\n\n280\n00:13:17.553 --> 00:13:19.197\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know about making\n\n281\n00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:22.490\na snow costume, I'm like, you get what-\n&gt;&gt; Flake.\n\n282\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.771\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, snowflake, there we go, perfect.\n\n283\n00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:26.775\nBut you get the idea is that\nI started from a new file,\n\n284\n00:13:26.775 --> 00:13:29.240\ntyped in the information I needed to do.\n\n285\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.655\nAnd then I would do like\na File &gt; Save as or\n\n286\n00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:34.480\nCmd+Shift+S is the shortcut I just used.\n\n287\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.870\nAnd then I would say like you know for\nDaniel or whatever.\n\n288\n00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:43.535\nAnd that's how I can start\na document from a template.\n\n289\n00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:46.230\nBut how did I create this template?\n\n290\n00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.469\nIt's super simple.\n\n291\n00:13:47.469 --> 00:13:48.770\nIt really is!\n\n292\n00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.770\nIt's very simple okay?\n\n293\n00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.690\nIf I open up the regular Word document, so\n\n294\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.790\nwe're starting with the docx\nfile to begin with.\n\n295\n00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.650\nYou want to clear out the parts that\nyou're going to use over and over again.\n\n296\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.598\n&gt;&gt; So the variable areas,\nstuff that's going to change,\n\n297\n00:14:04.598 --> 00:14:06.615\nbased off of whatever you're doing.\n\n298\n00:14:06.615 --> 00:14:07.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, definitely.\n\n299\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.073\nAnd you might wanna put\nin some place holders.\n\n300\n00:14:09.073 --> 00:14:11.904\nYou might want to put in like,\nname in there,\n\n301\n00:14:11.904 --> 00:14:14.980\nso I've got to remember\nto put in somebody.\n\n302\n00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.320\nBecause then somebody's going\nto get like Dear Name, like hm.\n\n303\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.837\nMissed something.\n\n304\n00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:20.775\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well this is personal.\n\n305\n00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:22.332\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n306\n00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:24.916\nits like I know what you're doing.\n\n307\n00:14:24.916 --> 00:14:29.616\nAnd then maybe you wanna\ndelete out your costumes here,\n\n308\n00:14:29.616 --> 00:14:32.530\nmaybe\n&gt;&gt; Prices as well, would probably vary.\n\n309\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.756\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, and\nmaybe even keep the dollar sign,\n\n310\n00:14:34.756 --> 00:14:37.210\nthat way you don't have\nto type that in again.\n\n311\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.570\nSo all of my variable information,\nI go ahead and clear out, okay?\n\n312\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.990\nNow how do I make this a template?\n\n313\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.560\nThis is super complicated.\n\n314\n00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Right-click, make template.\n\n315\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.950\n&gt;&gt; Close.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I knew it was\n\n316\n00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.950\nsomething like that.\n\n317\n00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.025\n&gt;&gt; File &gt; Save as Template.\n\n318\n00:14:54.025 --> 00:14:56.840\n&gt;&gt; Save as template [LAUGH] yeah,\nthere you go.\n\n319\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.210\n&gt;&gt; It's not a Save as,\njust Save as Template.\n\n320\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:04.730\nAnd what this does is, it is going to take\nit and put it into the templates folder.\n\n321\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.334\nMake note, though,\nlook at all of these down here.\n\n322\n00:15:07.334 --> 00:15:12.556\nLook at how far, I'm in the Users\nfolder in the Office Pro User in\n\n323\n00:15:12.556 --> 00:15:18.670\nthe Library in the Group containers\nin the something, something office.\n\n324\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.555\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] In the user in\nthe templates whoo, man.\n\n328\n00:15:28.882 --> 00:15:30.424\nThat is, that is crazy.\n\n329\n00:15:30.424 --> 00:15:32.665\n&gt;&gt; It's buried in there.\n\n330\n00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:36.524\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but its going into, you need to\nalways make sure you put it into this\n\n331\n00:15:36.524 --> 00:15:38.882\nparticular folder where it is designated.\n\n332\n00:15:38.882 --> 00:15:41.570\nWhen you say Save as Template,\nthat is where you put it.\n\n333\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.630\nYou don't put it anywhere else,\nokay because if I say Christmas Cats,\n\n334\n00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.871\nI'm gonna say for show that way I know.\n\n335\n00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:48.879\nCuz I already did it for\n\n336\n00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:51.810\nexample just to make sure that you\nguys could see it to begin with.\n\n337\n00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.140\nThat's why I had it as example.\n\n338\n00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.470\nLabeling your templates is very important.\n\n339\n00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.497\nSo I click Save.\n\n340\n00:15:56.497 --> 00:15:57.612\nNotice it says dotx.\n\n341\n00:15:57.612 --> 00:15:59.438\nSave, that's it.\n\n342\n00:15:59.438 --> 00:16:02.120\nI close this file, okay?\n\n343\n00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.876\nStart back Word, and right there.\n\n344\n00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:08.240\nIt's gonna show up right\nin my Start document.\n\n345\n00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.250\nThat's what all of these\ntemplates are for.\n\n346\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.760\nI click it, double click it, and\nthen we go ahead and type in your stuff.\n\n347\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.680\nDo a Save As,\nname it whatever file you want to.\n\n348\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.730\nAnd now it is a DOCX.\n\n349\n00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.940\nPretty cool, very simple.\n\n350\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.193\nAnd that's how you make a template, or\n\n351\n00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:30.244\na file from a template in Word,\nthe correct way.\n\n352\n00:16:30.244 --> 00:16:32.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All that kinda fun stuff.\n\n353\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.760\nSo pretty neat, and you can make\nas many templates as you want.\n\n354\n00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.400\nIt's funny because when I show this\nto people, they're like, my gosh,\n\n355\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.600\nthis is actually so much easier.\n\n356\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.920\nBecause I'm always gonna have\nto go out and open the file,\n\n357\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.740\nclear out the information that was\nalready there that I need to change out.\n\n358\n00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.160\nSo I'm doing more steps by doing it\nthe way I think I'm doing a template.\n\n359\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.870\nShow them this and\nthey're like, this is great.\n\n360\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, world opens up for\nyou, it's a whole new idea.\n\n361\n00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.290\nAnd figuring out, well,\nyou're saving that time and effort.\n\n362\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.370\nYeah, it's a little bit of\nfront-loading as far as work goes.\n\n363\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:05.820\nBut once that work is done,\nit's smooth sailing from there on out.\n\n364\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.920\nCuz now you just open it up, put in\nyour variables, save, and you're done.\n\n365\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that's why we put in\nthis whole section of automation,\n\n366\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.410\nmaking it easier for you to do things.\n\n367\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.573\nSo I just wanna follow up with a few\nthings with a template, cuz that's easy.\n\n368\n00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:20.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was easy.\n\n369\n00:17:20.365 --> 00:17:21.604\n&gt;&gt; It is easy, right?\n\n370\n00:17:21.604 --> 00:17:23.117\n&gt;&gt; Let's throw some icing on that cake.\n\n371\n00:17:23.117 --> 00:17:26.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What about the whole where's\n\n372\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.820\nthe default file location?\n\n373\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.865\nAnd what about the normal template?\n\n374\n00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:32.520\nCuz I mentioned it before.\n\n375\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.120\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n&gt;&gt; It's what all new documents start\n\n376\n00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.200\noff with.\n\n377\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.890\nSo if went in and\nmade a new document, okay everything,\n\n378\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:45.400\nthis is the font,\nthe spacing, all of it, okay?\n\n379\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.050\nIf you wanted to modify what\nthe normal template does,\n\n380\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.400\nmaybe you don't like the font.\n\n381\n00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.610\nMaybe you don't like that\nthe normal style has this spacing.\n\n382\n00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.260\nWe talk a lot about styles\nin the essentials episodes.\n\n383\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.885\nYou can modify the template not by opening\nup the template way down into those\n\n384\n00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:05.828\nprogram files and everything.\n\n385\n00:18:05.828 --> 00:18:07.280\nLet's do it from here, okay.\n\n386\n00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.650\nAnd I actually have this in the show note,\n\n387\n00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.920\njust I have some link down here that are\njust links to some of this information.\n\n388\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.309\nSo if I wanna change the default setting,\n\n389\n00:18:17.309 --> 00:18:20.120\nyou really should just do\nit within Word itself.\n\n390\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.584\nAnd I know that this is Mac 2011,\nit's not 2016.\n\n391\n00:18:24.584 --> 00:18:28.624\nBut changing the font, go in and\ngo to the Format menu, and\n\n392\n00:18:28.624 --> 00:18:30.970\nthen click the Default button.\n\n393\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.156\nIf you want, here, let me switch back\nover to, whoops, too many clicks.\n\n394\n00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:38.252\nIf you want the normal template to\nbe different, or the title template,\n\n395\n00:18:38.252 --> 00:18:43.033\nnot template, I'm sorry, style within\nthe template, you can go into the Modify.\n\n396\n00:18:43.033 --> 00:18:46.502\nAnd notice right here there\nis an Add to Template,\n\n397\n00:18:46.502 --> 00:18:49.570\nthe template meaning the normal template.\n\n398\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:55.070\nCome into, Cancel,\ngo into the Format &gt; Font.\n\n399\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.760\nI want it to be a different\nfont by default.\n\n400\n00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.450\nPick one, and then go down to default.\n\n401\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.015\nAnd I'm not gonna say OK here.\n\n402\n00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:03.771\nThey'll say,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n403\n00:19:03.771 --> 00:19:05.370\nIt's based on the normal template.\n\n404\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.470\nPeople read that and be like,\nI don't know what that is.\n\n405\n00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.520\nWell, now you do, okay.\n\n406\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.600\nYou know that you are changing\nthat default document that\n\n407\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.360\nanything starts from in Word,\nso that type of thing.\n\n408\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.625\n&gt;&gt; And this seems trivial.\n\n409\n00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:18.190\nAnd the more you start working with\nsomething, if you're like, man,\n\n410\n00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.040\nI really wish it did that,\nand you go I can.\n\n411\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.180\nIt would be really nice if every time\nI open the document it had this.\n\n412\n00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.460\nI can make that change, sweet.\n\n413\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.510\nNow I can make it persistent throughout\nevery time I open a document,\n\n414\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.180\nall those things the way I like it.\n\n415\n00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.820\nAnd I'm a huge proponent of customization,\none-off, making it one size fits one.\n\n416\n00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.870\nIt's always the way I like it,\nwhich is why I'm a Linux user, right?\n\n417\n00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.610\nAnd having that fine tuned control,\nthis is my bread and butter.\n\n418\n00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.930\nThis is where you're gonna sell\nme on templates right here.\n\n419\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI love how you just formatted that.\n\n420\n00:19:48.892 --> 00:19:50.069\nFormatted that?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:19:50.069 --> 00:19:51.207\n&gt;&gt; How you said that,\n\n422\n00:19:51.207 --> 00:19:55.549\nis I actually will make templates for\nhey, there's a specific way that I\n\n423\n00:19:55.549 --> 00:20:00.900\nlike my Word documents to look for like,\nsay working at ITProTV and my show notes.\n\n424\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.110\nEven though we use Haroopad or\nwhatever, or another markdown file.\n\n425\n00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:09.080\nOr there's a specific way that I need\nmy fonts, spacing, alignment for\n\n426\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.030\nworking on my freelance stuff.\n\n427\n00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So what I do is I'll come into here,\n\n428\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.350\ntype in some basic text.\n\n429\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.960\nDo all my formatting of my styles,\nthe spacing,\n\n430\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.722\nthe margins, the everythings, right?\n\n431\n00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.210\nAnd hen I'll clear it all out,\nand you know what I'll do?\n\n432\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.960\nI'll save it as my own template.\n\n433\n00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.050\nAnd I'll have ITProTV show notes,\nsaved as a template.\n\n434\n00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.734\nFreelance notes, that's my template.\n\n435\n00:20:33.734 --> 00:20:38.200\nSo every time I will just go ahead and\nmake my own templates.\n\n436\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.419\nI'm not really messing with the normals.\n\n437\n00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:43.050\nBecause I don't really wanna ever\ntotally mess up what it comes with.\n\n438\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:48.100\nI'm gonna take it, modify it, because I\ncan make all my own templates myself.\n\n439\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.737\nSo I would take that, do a Save As\nTemplate, and mark this whatever,\n\n440\n00:20:50.737 --> 00:20:51.291\nda da da da da.\n\n441\n00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:55.293\nAnd then when I'm ready to do\nmy show notes for ITProTV,\n\n442\n00:20:55.293 --> 00:20:57.600\ngo in File &gt; New From Template.\n\n443\n00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.802\nIt's gonna be right here in my Start menu,\nstart it, here we go.\n\n444\n00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nice.\n\n445\n00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I like to go ahead and\ndo all those formattings and\n\n446\n00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.090\nthings that I want as a separate template,\nnot the normal.\n\n447\n00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.410\nYou can modify the normal, totally fine.\n\n448\n00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.790\nBut it's kinda nice to have a backup.\n\n449\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.470\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n450\n00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.440\nbecause what ends up inevitably happening\nis I go crazy with the customizations.\n\n451\n00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.684\nAnd then its unusable,\n[LAUGH] for a while.\n\n452\n00:21:21.684 --> 00:21:25.149\nAnd then now I've gotta, hopefully I\ncan hit a reset button of some sort.\n\n453\n00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:27.578\n&gt;&gt; That's why I have\nreset normal document.\n\n454\n00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:28.453\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n455\n00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:31.422\nbecause I have people do this all\nthe time, and they're like ooh.\n\n456\n00:21:31.422 --> 00:21:33.759\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got a little crazy.\n\n457\n00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I went a little nuts,\n\n458\n00:21:35.148 --> 00:21:37.020\ncuz it was new and it was exciting.\n\n459\n00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.814\nAnd it was making me sweat a little bit,\nbut I loved it.\n\n460\n00:21:38.814 --> 00:21:40.631\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now,\n\n461\n00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:42.500\nI can't make it not have blink\ntags on it or something.\n\n462\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.517\nIt's going nuts [LAUGH].\n\n463\n00:21:44.517 --> 00:21:47.647\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, and\nthat's why I put this in here, so.\n\n464\n00:21:47.647 --> 00:21:51.300\nAnd I did put in here, just in the notes,\nand you have access to this.\n\n465\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.890\nThese are my PC show links,\nthat I kept in there.\n\n466\n00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:01.580\nBut the thing is from what I can see it\nsays, it looks like it's the same in Mac.\n\n467\n00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.697\n&gt;&gt; Basically, it says right here is\nthat if you, here, I'll go on this one.\n\n468\n00:22:06.697 --> 00:22:08.657\nIt's saying, hey, I really messed it up.\n\n469\n00:22:08.657 --> 00:22:12.937\nIt's like,\nif you go down into that templates folder,\n\n470\n00:22:12.937 --> 00:22:16.672\nthe location of where it lives and\nyou delete it,\n\n471\n00:22:16.672 --> 00:22:22.040\nit says quit Word, move the Normal\nout of the Templates folder.\n\n472\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.220\nRestart Word,\nbecause it has to have that to start.\n\n473\n00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.980\nIt's just gonna recreate it by itself.\n\n474\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.020\nI did try this on PC.\n\n475\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.533\nI did try this, totally works.\n\n476\n00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:33.188\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n477\n00:22:33.188 --> 00:22:35.857\n&gt;&gt; Didn't wanna go too far with my Mac,\nespecially right before the show.\n\n478\n00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:36.890\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you have a show to do, yeah?\n\n479\n00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.579\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like [SOUND].\n\n480\n00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:39.969\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to get too crazy,\nyou know what I mean.\n\n481\n00:22:39.969 --> 00:22:43.120\nYeah, we'll test that when\nthe camera is not on.\n\n482\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I did go through and\n\n483\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.920\nlook at some of them in this forum,\nsaid the same thing.\n\n484\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.300\nAnd it does say, for Mac, okay?\n\n485\n00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.314\nSo I'm gonna throw it out there.\n\n486\n00:22:54.314 --> 00:22:56.545\nI'm gonna give it an 85% chance\nthat it will work for you.\n\n487\n00:22:56.545 --> 00:22:58.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But double-check, but\n\n488\n00:22:58.823 --> 00:23:01.422\na nice-\n&gt;&gt; I'll give you a 30% chance that Vonne's\n\n489\n00:23:01.422 --> 00:23:02.695\n85% chance is right.\n\n490\n00:23:02.695 --> 00:23:03.346\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n491\n00:23:03.346 --> 00:23:05.850\nthe nice thing is make those backups.\n\n492\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.550\nSo maybe, I almost,\nI started going backwards a little bit.\n\n493\n00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.240\nGetting too excited\nabout resetting [LAUGH].\n\n494\n00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.967\n&gt;&gt; You're backing up [LAUGH].\n\n495\n00:23:10.967 --> 00:23:14.023\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm, literally!\n\n496\n00:23:14.023 --> 00:23:14.838\n&gt;&gt; See what I did?\n\n497\n00:23:14.838 --> 00:23:16.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I did.\n\n498\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.620\n&gt;&gt; We have too much fun.\n\n499\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.388\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n500\n00:23:18.388 --> 00:23:20.430\n&gt;&gt; Backup, backup, backup, yes.\n\n501\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.630\nMaybe leave the normal template alone,\nmake your own templates.\n\n502\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.590\nYou see how easy it is to\ndo a File Save As Template.\n\n503\n00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.380\nAnd then go ahead and do that.\n\n504\n00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.440\nBut just in case you have\na little bit of a hey,\n\n505\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.770\nremove it, the thing is finding where.\n\n506\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.260\nThat's the wrong one,\nfinding the file path.\n\n507\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's the biggest one.\n\n508\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.216\n&gt;&gt; Knowing where it it's supposed\nto reside, so that you can-\n\n509\n00:23:44.216 --> 00:23:45.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n510\n00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.846\nAnd so I have one of these links,\n[LAUGH] of where it lives.\n\n511\n00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:50.157\nThere it is, I should read my own notes.\n\n512\n00:23:50.157 --> 00:23:51.508\n&gt;&gt; Reading in the wrong spot.\n\n513\n00:23:51.508 --> 00:23:54.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Default location, so\n\n514\n00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.240\nit tells you exactly where that is.\n\n515\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.250\nAnd so you do have to kind of,\nyou kinda gotta get in there.\n\n516\n00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.100\nAnd just really quickly in here,\n\n517\n00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.785\nif I type in library in the search,\nit kind of goes to this Mac.\n\n518\n00:24:06.785 --> 00:24:08.370\nThen it will take me to the library.\n\n519\n00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.670\nNo, it's not in here, sorry.\n\n520\n00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.503\nWrong one, it's this one,\nGo &gt; Go to Folder.\n\n521\n00:24:12.503 --> 00:24:13.214\n&gt;&gt; Go to Folder.\n\n522\n00:24:13.214 --> 00:24:14.951\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's a library folder,\nit's not a file.\n\n523\n00:24:14.951 --> 00:24:15.942\n&gt;&gt; Not a file.\n\n524\n00:24:15.942 --> 00:24:19.441\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if I go into my finder,\ngo to go, and then see, look it,\n\n525\n00:24:19.441 --> 00:24:20.671\nI already typed it in.\n\n526\n00:24:20.671 --> 00:24:21.930\n&gt;&gt; Great going.\n\n527\n00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.240\n&gt;&gt; And now you can,\nnow it tells me it can't be found.\n\n528\n00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.985\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You undeleted it.\n\n529\n00:24:26.985 --> 00:24:29.425\n&gt;&gt; This is why I shouldn't\ntry to do things live.\n\n530\n00:24:29.425 --> 00:24:32.845\nBut if you get into your\nfinder you can find.\n\n531\n00:24:32.845 --> 00:24:36.657\nLook it, there's the users, the library\ngroup, the container da, da, da, da.\n\n532\n00:24:38.037 --> 00:24:40.901\nHonestly, the other way, the best\nway to do it is to just go ahead and\n\n533\n00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:43.787\ndo that File &gt; Save As Template,\nand find where that path is there.\n\n534\n00:24:43.787 --> 00:24:47.087\nOnce you get to that folder,\nyou can find the normal, delete it.\n\n535\n00:24:47.087 --> 00:24:48.827\nRestart Word, and\neverything should be fine.\n\n536\n00:24:48.827 --> 00:24:51.536\nSo, a little bit of\na backfiring going on my part,\n\n537\n00:24:51.536 --> 00:24:54.109\nI'm just-\n&gt;&gt; Whatever you use to find folders in\n\n538\n00:24:54.109 --> 00:24:55.240\nyour Mac, do that.\n\n539\n00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.759\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n540\n00:24:56.759 --> 00:25:00.584\nI'm just doing a bunch of Command Ws in my\nbrowser just to close out all those tabs.\n\n541\n00:25:00.584 --> 00:25:02.558\nJust in case you're like,\nwhat is she doing?\n\n542\n00:25:03.608 --> 00:25:05.438\nWhen I watch tutorials and\npeople are doing, I'm like,\n\n543\n00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:06.898\nwait, tell me what you're doing!\n\n544\n00:25:06.898 --> 00:25:08.508\nWhat keys are you clicking?\n\n545\n00:25:08.508 --> 00:25:10.858\nSo I just wanna let you all know that,\nand there you go.\n\n546\n00:25:10.858 --> 00:25:14.910\nSo now make templates to your heart's\ncontent, for every which way you want to.\n\n547\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.645\nAnd hopefully, it will make it\na lot smoother and easier for you,\n\n548\n00:25:17.645 --> 00:25:19.609\nand you can automate\nsome of these processes.\n\n549\n00:25:19.609 --> 00:25:22.320\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\nI feel almost more enlightened.\n\n550\n00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.900\nI feel like we're all smarter\nbecause of what we've learned today.\n\n551\n00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.204\nI'm gonna go make a template that tells me\nexactly where that library folder is, so\n\n552\n00:25:29.204 --> 00:25:29.905\nI never forget.\n\n553\n00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:32.002\nThat will be good for me, and you as well.\n\n554\n00:25:32.002 --> 00:25:33.310\nVonne, thanks for joining us today.\n\n555\n00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.390\nSo much fun to always have you on a show.\n\n556\n00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.350\nAnd fun to have you guys\nout there watching.\n\n557\n00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.480\nBut it looks like we're out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n558\n00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.312\nJoin us more later.\n\n559\n00:25:40.312 --> 00:25:43.990\nBut as for this one, signing off for\nOfficeProTV, I've been your host,\n\n560\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.530\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n561\n00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n562\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.876\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n563\n00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:52.056\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I was trying\n\n16\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.010\nto think of something like\nclever to go with macros.\n\n17\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.020\n&gt;&gt; Magnaminous?\n\n18\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Mag, mac-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, Macnin?\n\n19\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.597\nAwesome.\n\n20\n00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:48.127\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A little play on words.\n\n21\n00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:49.891\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was trying to get clever,\n\n22\n00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:53.028\nbecause we're gonna be\nto talk about macros.\n\n23\n00:00:53.028 --> 00:00:55.760\nAnd we were talking a little\nbit before the show, and\n\n24\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.890\nit was like,\nI don't want you to scare people too much.\n\n25\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.945\nWarning, warning, macros are dangerous.\n\n26\n00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:04.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And they are.\n\n27\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.800\n&gt;&gt; And they are.\n\n28\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.160\n&gt;&gt; And then you're like, so\nwhy are we doing a show about it?\n\n29\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.130\n&gt;&gt; Because they can also be very helpful,\nright?\n\n30\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.633\n&gt;&gt; They can, yes.\n\n31\n00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.538\n&gt;&gt; And if done the right way,\nand with a jaundiced eye,\n\n32\n00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:16.830\nwhen it comes to macros, they can be\nvery helpful for you to automate things,\n\n33\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.220\nto make things run a little\nbit more smoothly, correct?\n\n34\n00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.360\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, but I think you have a very\ngood point of putting a little fear.\n\n35\n00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.670\nInto people about-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit of fear.\n\n36\n00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, about macros.\n\n37\n00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.640\n&gt;&gt; A healthy fear.\n\n38\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.615\n&gt;&gt; Because well let's start at,\nwell, what is a macro?\n\n39\n00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:33.292\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n40\n00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:35.151\nOkay, before we actually get to-\n&gt;&gt; Hey Vonne, what's a macro?\n\n41\n00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:36.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Before I actually get\n\n42\n00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:37.650\ninto demonstrating it, what is a macro?\n\n43\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.745\nWow, we're just gonna keep going back and\nforth aren't we.\n\n44\n00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:46.710\nIt It is a recorded steps within\nan Office product that you can use\n\n45\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.910\nto automate some of your tasks, some of\nthe things that you maybe do all the time.\n\n46\n00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.480\nMaybe like, I'm always having to set\nmy margins, put in my headers, and\n\n47\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.040\nput in my page notes, and add a border.\n\n48\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.534\nWell, you could record like you're just\nhitting the record button and record\n\n49\n00:02:02.534 --> 00:02:06.973\nall those steps and then play it back and\nit just, bloop, and it just does it.\n\n50\n00:02:06.973 --> 00:02:09.116\nAnd you're like, wow,\nthat's sounds amazing.\n\n51\n00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:12.140\nSo why would I ever think that macros bad?\n\n52\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.692\nWell, because macros you're\nactually programming,\n\n53\n00:02:17.692 --> 00:02:24.786\nyou're writing programming code\ninto your application and the file.\n\n54\n00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:28.492\nAnd any time you get into being\nable to do programming stuff,\n\n55\n00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:33.594\nyou're opening yourself up to potential\nsecurity issues, aren't we, Daniel?\n\n56\n00:02:33.594 --> 00:02:37.754\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because it does execute\ncommands that you give it.\n\n57\n00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:41.786\nAnd it trusts you because it says,\nit's you, you want me to run this,\n\n58\n00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:44.990\nI'll do that because it's you and\nI trust you implicitly.\n\n59\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.620\nYou're so amazing.\n\n60\n00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.705\nWell, what happens is,\n\n61\n00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:51.880\nas you get used to running macros you get\nall, I love my macros, gotta have them.\n\n62\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.920\nYou got it turned on, it's enabled now.\n\n63\n00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.640\nAnd then somebody sends you a file and\nyou're like, great, let's go to macro.\n\n64\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.370\nYeah, run that macro, and it's malware,\nright, it reaches out and grabs malware.\n\n65\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.130\nYou don't even see that happening, right.\n\n66\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.522\nYeah, it gives you that spreadsheet\nthat you wanted, it gives you that Word\n\n67\n00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:09.260\ndocument that you wanted, and\nit did the thing it said it would do.\n\n68\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.399\nBut it also gave you, you know, cancer.\n\n69\n00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Basically cancer for\n\n70\n00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.070\nyour computer, kind of thing.\n\n71\n00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.380\nYou didn't see it happen, but it did,\nand now your computer's infected.\n\n72\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.032\nSo you gotta be really careful\nwhen you're running macros.\n\n73\n00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:24.638\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is like a hot button,\nif you wanna say, in the security world.\n\n74\n00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:29.086\nAnd keeping end users secure and safe,\nand I think you said in one book or\n\n75\n00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:33.186\nsomething you reading,\nlike the very first chapter was macros.\n\n76\n00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:34.033\n&gt;&gt; Macros.\n\n77\n00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:37.752\n&gt;&gt; Macros, don't do them, don't ever\nlet your users do them, any of that.\n\n78\n00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:42.656\nBecause of the potential of opening\nup Pandora's Box when it's just like,\n\n79\n00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:46.484\nthey just kind of stuff a little,\nlittle line of bad code and\n\n80\n00:03:46.484 --> 00:03:49.690\nthen your whole networks infected.\n\n81\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.510\nAnd now you're talking about\nnetwork infecting, and\n\n82\n00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.310\nyour malware, and security issues.\n\n83\n00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.110\nAnd you're just like,\nI'm never gonna run a macro ever.\n\n84\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.960\nSo we have to kind of give it\na healthy amount of fear or really\n\n85\n00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.380\njust awareness of, like you said, you're\ngetting used to this as a great thing.\n\n86\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.270\nIt's really when you get it from somebody\nelse that you do not know the source and\n\n87\n00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.540\nyou don't know what that macro does.\n\n88\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.280\nThat, don't ever run macros\nfrom somebody else or\n\n89\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.100\nfrom somewhere not from you that you did.\n\n90\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.070\nDon't ever do them.\n\n91\n00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.980\nI am comfortable saying\nthat like don't do that.\n\n92\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't do that.\n\n93\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.570\nAnd here's the cool thing is today's show,\n\n94\n00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.000\nall about how to write your own macros,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.310\nHow to work with macros.\n\n96\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.319\nSo if you do get some, I trust Vonne.\n\n97\n00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:38.160\nShe'd send me a file with a macro\nin it I would trust her, but\n\n98\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.130\nI'm still gonna look at that macro and\nsee what it does before I fire it off.\n\n99\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.720\nSo after today's show,\n\n100\n00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.750\nyou should be able to be a little more\nhandy when it comes to doing that.\n\n101\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.680\nSo that if you do get something from\nsomeone you do trust, it doesn't mean that\n\n102\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.400\nthey didn't get something from someone\nthey didn't trust, you know what I mean?\n\n103\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.790\nSo it can be their intermediary\nthrough someone you do trust.\n\n104\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.090\nYou've gotta be careful with it.\n\n105\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.940\n&gt;&gt; I could be the third innocent party.\n\n106\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.600\nOr innocent third party if like,\nbut I got that from Mike.\n\n107\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.520\n&gt;&gt; And you gotta be careful what you-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n108\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.110\nMike got it from some Internet repository.\n\n109\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.296\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou've gotta be careful with Mike.\n\n110\n00:05:10.296 --> 00:05:12.355\n&gt;&gt; Which is malware heaven. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt;\nMike's a little, he knows some stuff, so.\n\n111\n00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:15.690\nI mean, but that's the whole idea,\nyou don't know where you got this from.\n\n112\n00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.630\nIf I'm writing a macro to do what I just\nsaid, the margins and the headers and\n\n113\n00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.990\neverything like that, okay, that's benign.\n\n114\n00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.110\nI'm not gonna write that.\n\n115\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.320\nAnd Daniel can trust me,\nif I wrote this it's okay.\n\n116\n00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:32.430\nAll right, then there's like the whole,\nthere's the asterisk of like,\n\n117\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.830\nas long as you trust the person\nyou can open up a computer, or\n\n118\n00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.940\nopen up a file with a macro attached\nto it and then it should be okay.\n\n119\n00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.240\nSo, take everything with a grain of salt,\nbut\n\n120\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.030\ndo be very aware that it\nhas a potential to be bad.\n\n121\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n122\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.305\n&gt;&gt; We're going to be showing you for good.\n\n123\n00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:54.030\n[LAUGH] And then, along that same token\nis like, wow, this sounds amazing,\n\n124\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.610\nbut there's some caveats to even\nrecording macros within Word,\n\n125\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.810\nwhere it doesn't do everything.\n\n126\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.540\nAnd it can be a little weird.\n\n127\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.028\nAnd I'm not comfortable with\nwriting VBA by myself so\n\n128\n00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:07.830\nI'm not gonna be able to do major editing.\n\n129\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.330\nI can find a few things, but\n\n130\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.665\nif it doesn't work I'm gonna be like,\nguess what, it's not gonna work.\n\n131\n00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:16.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is very basic macros 101,\n\n132\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.600\nlet's just get some really simple things\nthat we can do, that we can automate,\n\n133\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.830\nmake our lives a little easier, right?\n\n134\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I did throw out\nsomething that maybe I'm not sure\n\n135\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.010\nif we have addressed yet, the VBA.\n\n136\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.200\n&gt;&gt; What is a VBA?\n\n137\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.250\n&gt;&gt; You know what it is, isn't it?\n\n138\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Visual Basic,\n\n139\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.040\nit's a programming language that's\nbuilt into the Office suite.\n\n140\n00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.610\nSo It's part of Microsoft's DNA,\nto be honest with you.\n\n141\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.750\nIt's how Microsoft products work,\nit's what it uses in a lot of ways.\n\n142\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.490\nSo, it's very, very powerful.\n\n143\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.560\nIt's kinda the bed rock on\nwhich macros kinda stand.\n\n144\n00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.828\nSo just be aware that that there\nis a deeper language to it,\n\n145\n00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.109\nwhich is why macros can be so dangerous.\n\n146\n00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:57.630\nThat's you can program as\nany programmer would do.\n\n147\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.240\n&gt;&gt; You could program Word.\n\n148\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.630\nAnd like you said, Word is based off\nof Visual Basic because it is so\n\n149\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.940\ningrained into everything\nthat Microsoft does.\n\n150\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.180\nIt's Microsoft's programming language and\nVB,\n\n151\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.120\nVisual Basic, VBA Visual Basic\nApplication, or for applications.\n\n152\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.750\nI know it's an application and\nthat's where Word is an application so\n\n153\n00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.770\nit's kind of, that's that flavor.\n\n154\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.920\nI think there's VBE, which is-\n&gt;&gt; S, VBS, isn't it?\n\n155\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.299\n&gt;&gt; VBS.\n&gt;&gt; That's Vacation Bible school.\n\n156\n00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:26.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Visual Basic Scripting.\n\n157\n00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:27.560\n&gt;&gt; That's what I see on\nthe streets all the time.\n\n158\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.850\nScripting, yeah.\n\n159\n00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.540\n&gt;&gt; And then E, I think is editor.\n\n160\n00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.910\n&gt;&gt; So anyways, Visual Basic is\nthe language that Microsoft uses for\n\n161\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.990\nprogramming.\n\n162\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.640\nOther software, they can run macros, but\n\n163\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.910\nthey're writing it in whatever\nprogramming language they do.\n\n164\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.928\nSo that macros is more\nof a universal term for\n\n165\n00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:49.508\nany application to just record its\nsteps that you can play it back.\n\n166\n00:07:49.508 --> 00:07:55.509\nMicrosoft uses Visual Basic to write their\nmacros, and then that's how it works.\n\n167\n00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.254\nSo just kinda keeping it\nall in context there.\n\n168\n00:07:58.254 --> 00:08:02.118\nAnd yeah, like I said,\nit's not gonna record everything.\n\n169\n00:08:02.118 --> 00:08:04.573\nSo if it starts to frustrate\nyou a little too much,\n\n170\n00:08:04.573 --> 00:08:08.139\nI'm gonna give you a couple little like,\nhey, this isn't gonna work,\n\n171\n00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:10.720\nthis isn't gonna work, so\nmaybe use this instead.\n\n172\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.880\nSo try to go ahead and inject it,\n[LAUGH], integrate it into your workflow.\n\n173\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.920\nAll right, so\nwhy don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n174\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.190\nI'm gonna show you some examples\nof already created macros that,\n\n175\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.720\nthat's kind of fun.\n\n176\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.590\nAnd then try to introduce some of\nthose things that we've already\n\n177\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.450\ntalked about like looking at the VBA.\n\n178\n00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.220\nBecause, you can get into\nediting the actual script and\n\n179\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.030\nsee if you can find the mistake,\nand do some basic, basic editing.\n\n180\n00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:45.850\nAnd then we'll go ahead and record some\nsteps, you can see how you do that,\n\n181\n00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.792\nand where it's all located and\nthat kind of fun stuff.\n\n182\n00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:50.290\nAll right, so\nlet's go ahead and get started.\n\n183\n00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.475\nI have the files that\nare associated with this show.\n\n184\n00:08:55.475 --> 00:08:58.439\nAnd, normally when you\nhave a Word document,\n\n185\n00:08:58.439 --> 00:09:03.700\nwe've talked about this all day long,\nit's a docx, right, that' a Word file.\n\n186\n00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:11.900\nWhen you have a macro enabled Word file,\nit's a docm, m for macro.\n\n187\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.210\nSo you can see, like right here,\nadd graphics is a docx.\n\n188\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.550\nThe borders macro, this one is a .docm.\n\n189\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.250\nSo this is one that was written,\n\n190\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.290\nI will also let you know that\nthis was written on a PC, okay?\n\n191\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.060\nAnd this was in my Word Advance for\nPC show, so\n\n192\n00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:34.033\nI just brought it over here\ninto my Microsoft, operating.\n\n193\n00:09:34.033 --> 00:09:35.730\nNo, no, this is what?\n\n194\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.400\nThis is Mac.\n\n195\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.114\nThis is my,\n[LAUGH] I'm getting myself all confused.\n\n196\n00:09:39.114 --> 00:09:40.194\n&gt;&gt; Vonne doesn't even\nknow where she's at now.\n\n197\n00:09:40.194 --> 00:09:42.122\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that happens a lot.\n\n198\n00:09:42.122 --> 00:09:45.000\nSo [LAUGH] I'm on my Mac and so\nI brought it over onto my Mac.\n\n199\n00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.070\nSo it should work, keyword is should.\n\n200\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.180\nIt does, cuz I had to make it.\n\n201\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I had to tweak it a little bit.\n\n202\n00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.090\nOkay, so\n\n203\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.872\ngoing from PC to Mac with macro neighbors\nfiles is not going to always be fantastic.\n\n204\n00:09:59.872 --> 00:10:04.548\nBecause anything for\nMac really in the Office world\n\n205\n00:10:04.548 --> 00:10:08.920\nit's just like a flavor\nbelow if you wanna say.\n\n206\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.414\nTheir main focus is gonna be Office for\nPC.\n\n207\n00:10:11.414 --> 00:10:16.550\nAnd they, yes, they've made it for Mac,\nbut they It might not be the top priority\n\n208\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.860\nof Microsoft's, making sure everything\nworks properly type thing, okay?\n\n209\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.540\nSo I'm gonna open this, and\nthat thing that Daniel's talking about,\n\n210\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.053\nthe enabling macros and disabling macros.\n\n211\n00:10:31.053 --> 00:10:33.700\nAll your macros should be disabled.\n\n212\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.550\nYou can also change that in your\npreferences and everything.\n\n213\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.460\nBut you should always make it to\nwhere if you have a macro file.\n\n214\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.310\nIt should always give you\na warning right here.\n\n215\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.360\nBecause this is the part where it's\nlike I know Dan, you got this from Mike.\n\n216\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.800\nI don't trust that Mike guy, I'm disabling\nthis and I'm not going to open this.\n\n217\n00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.609\n[LAUGH] You know that's what he\nwas talking about you get those,\n\n218\n00:10:52.609 --> 00:10:54.207\nyeah it's great, great, great.\n\n219\n00:10:54.207 --> 00:10:55.050\nBe a little careful.\n\n220\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.390\nSo this one I do know I wrote it, so I'm\ngoing to enable the macros and it opens.\n\n221\n00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.950\nAnd you're just like, okay,\nwell it's just a regular Word file.\n\n222\n00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.120\nYou're right, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.790\nBut it has code built into this that\nI can run to make it do cool things.\n\n224\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:15.230\nNow, where you can get to run your macros\nis on the ribbon on the developer tab.\n\n225\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.200\nIf you're like, hey,\nI don't see a developer tab.\n\n226\n00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.890\nAnd you might be saying, hey,\nin your other episodes that you have,\n\n227\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.640\nyou didn't have this on here,\nso, why is it there?\n\n228\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.020\nBecause I turned it on for\nthis particular episode.\n\n229\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.600\nSo, where do you find that, and\n\n230\n00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.940\nhow can you turn the developer\ntab on in your program?\n\n231\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.010\nIt's in your preferences.\n\n232\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.780\nSo if I go to my Word menu and I go to\npreferences, and I go into the ribbon and\n\n233\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.370\ntoolbar, this is normally\nturned off by default.\n\n234\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.710\nThis little checkbox right here,\nyour's going to be blank.\n\n235\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.570\nSo, you just put a checkbox,\nright there in developer and\n\n236\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.620\nthis tab will show up in your ribbon.\n\n237\n00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.720\nThat's all you've got to do to\nmake sure that you can get into\n\n238\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.440\nthese buttons to even begin with.\n\n239\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.377\nNow you know where that's at,\nright here I have these buttons over here.\n\n240\n00:12:05.377 --> 00:12:09.067\nDon't worry about these right now,\nthose are totally different for\n\n241\n00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:12.020\nanother episode later down the road.\n\n242\n00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.570\nSo we have Visual Basic, VBA,\nMacros, and then Record a Macro.\n\n243\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.880\nLet's look at the macros button.\n\n244\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.360\nWhen I click on this,\nit's going to give me the dialogue box.\n\n245\n00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.270\nSo it's like okay, well let me tell\nyou what and where the macros are.\n\n246\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.510\nSo if you see macros in,\nand if I drop this down,\n\n247\n00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.650\nthere's many different places\nwhere you can store macros.\n\n248\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.860\nIn this particular file,\n\n249\n00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.880\nI really only want to look at the ones\nthat are in this document, okay?\n\n250\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.160\nWhen we get in to do like new files, and\nI want this to be available to all files\n\n251\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.780\nthat I ever start from new, then you'd\nwant to put that into the global template.\n\n252\n00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.650\nWe talked about the global\ntemplates in the templates folder.\n\n253\n00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.928\nFolder?\nThe episode.\n\n254\n00:12:52.928 --> 00:12:58.070\n[LAUGH] And then you can see all templates\nin all active templates and documents.\n\n255\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.370\nBut you basically want to say\nthe document that I'm working in or\n\n256\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.590\nthe global template that all\nnew documents are started with.\n\n257\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:05.930\nSo let's go ahead and choose this.\n\n258\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.790\nIt knows that my options for\nhere are a little bit less.\n\n259\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.370\nI have apples, cakes, and clear,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n260\n00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.250\nOkay, let me show you.\n\n261\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:20.275\nSo I'm gonna choose the macro that\nI want to work, want to run, and\n\n262\n00:13:20.275 --> 00:13:22.745\nthen down here I have a button called Run.\n\n263\n00:13:22.745 --> 00:13:26.385\nAnd I click it, and it does look at that.\n\n264\n00:13:26.385 --> 00:13:27.905\nYeah, I know, it's ridiculous.\n\n265\n00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:33.315\nSo [LAUGH] I made it landscape,\nit put the cake page borders on it.\n\n266\n00:13:33.315 --> 00:13:35.885\nIt made the page color pink,\nand then there you go.\n\n267\n00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:38.605\n&gt;&gt; And it moved your Vonne Smith down,\nas well.\n\n268\n00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:40.865\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, vertical justification,\nwhich I'm obsessed with.\n\n269\n00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:41.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very nice.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n270\n00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:44.510\nthat was all written in\nthat particular macro.\n\n271\n00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:48.450\nLet's go back up to this macro,\nI have another one that will clear.\n\n272\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.090\nAnd if I click run,\nit takes it back to where,\n\n273\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.770\nthis is how I want everything to be.\n\n274\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.180\nCool, so you're like this looks like fun,\nlet me show you the apples.\n\n275\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.460\nAnd you click the run, and\nwhoa, what just happened here?\n\n276\n00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.409\n&gt;&gt; It went crazy on us Vonne.\n\n277\n00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:02.056\n&gt;&gt; It did, didn't it?\n\n278\n00:14:02.056 --> 00:14:02.970\n&gt;&gt; A little berserk.\n\n279\n00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:08.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes and what it's saying here is that\nthere is a compile error, a runtime error.\n\n280\n00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.190\nThese are all different\nthings in scripting world of,\n\n281\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.480\nhey, it went down the code and went, nope.\n\n282\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.670\nI don't know what just happened,\nI'm breaking.\n\n283\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.300\nSo I'm going to bring up\nthe visual basic editor for\n\n284\n00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.560\nyou to be able to look and\nsee what's going on.\n\n285\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.170\nIt's like, okay, you click OK and\nit's bringing up this other window.\n\n286\n00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:31.930\nIt's still within Word but\nit is the Microsoft Visual Basic editor.\n\n287\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.620\nAnd I'm just gonna maybe make\nthis a little bit smaller, so\n\n288\n00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.380\nyou can see this whole thing.\n\n289\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.200\nOkay, so this is the code.\n\n290\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.650\nAnd if you're like, all right, peace out,\nI'm done I'm not looking at this anymore,\n\n291\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.642\nbecause this is like,\nwhat is this crazy stuff?\n\n292\n00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:48.354\n&gt;&gt; That's called scripting language.\n\n293\n00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.250\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n294\n00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.460\nSo let's look at some of this.\n\n295\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.550\nThis is where I told you,\nI'm not a Visual Basic scripter, but\n\n296\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.980\nI can say like, okay,\nlook at the apples, right.\n\n297\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.380\nBecause that was the one that,\nactive document background fill,\n\n298\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.716\nforeground color, that's changing\nthe fill color of the page.\n\n299\n00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:12.640\nOr borders,, look apples are, you can kind\nof start picking out some of these things.\n\n300\n00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.090\nLike, what is the width?\n\n301\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.311\nNow these whole like subs and if else,\nif then, all those kinds of things,\n\n302\n00:15:18.311 --> 00:15:20.197\nit's really just the commands.\n\n303\n00:15:20.197 --> 00:15:24.460\nSo it's getting down into here,\nwe have our borders.\n\n304\n00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.020\nAnd then it just kinda\nbreaks somewhere along here.\n\n305\n00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.500\nI know where it breaks, cuz I had to\ndebug this before, it's right here.\n\n306\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.850\nSee, and it actually highlights it.\n\n307\n00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it knows because with scripting\nlanguages they start at the top.\n\n308\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.170\nAnd they just kinda work their way\nthrough a set of instructions.\n\n309\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.980\nStep 1, do this, dtep 2,\ndo this and so on and so forth.\n\n310\n00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.560\nWhen it comes to a step it doesn't know\nwhat the heck it is it goes, whoa,\n\n311\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.870\nthere's a problem here.\n\n312\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.186\nI don't know what this is, or\nthis isn't formatted correctly.\n\n313\n00:15:51.186 --> 00:15:54.624\nSomething's wrong here, or\nthat's where I think something's wrong.\n\n314\n00:15:54.624 --> 00:15:56.479\nSometimes it doesn't get it right.\n\n315\n00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:58.281\nSometimes it's around that area.\n\n316\n00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:00.071\nYou've kind of got to well no,\nthat's right.\n\n317\n00:16:00.071 --> 00:16:04.243\nBut up here, a couple lines above, it's\nbreaking because I set the wrong parameter\n\n318\n00:16:04.243 --> 00:16:06.380\nthere, or there's something like that.\n\n319\n00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.160\nSo therefore, this isn't going to work,\nthat's why it's breaking.\n\n320\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.500\nSo you've just got to look around it and\n\n321\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.530\nsometimes you'll find it won't\nbe the exact same thing.\n\n322\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and sometimes it'll have\na yellow arrow pointing to it.\n\n323\n00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:17.827\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This one is just blue highlighting.\n\n324\n00:16:17.827 --> 00:16:18.823\n&gt;&gt; A neon sign.\n\n325\n00:16:18.823 --> 00:16:20.218\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] wrong, danger.\n\n326\n00:16:20.218 --> 00:16:21.654\n&gt;&gt; Lights [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n327\n00:16:21.654 --> 00:16:22.750\n&gt;&gt; Not working.\n\n328\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.080\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we've got here and\n\n329\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.630\nI know that these\nare the lines that are broken.\n\n330\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.911\nBut if you look at here there's another,\n\n331\n00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:31.266\nit has all the macros\nthat are in this file.\n\n332\n00:16:31.266 --> 00:16:33.450\nHere's the clear macro,\nand it's just change,\n\n333\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.831\nit's putting everything back to the way\nit started with, and if I scroll down\n\n334\n00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:40.819\na little bit more here's the cake macro\n&gt;&gt; So you can see again the same border,\n\n335\n00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:44.372\nthere's the cake slice, but I'm going\nto show you where the problem is.\n\n336\n00:16:44.372 --> 00:16:48.918\nYou see here,\nin this particular chunk about the page\n\n337\n00:16:48.918 --> 00:16:53.350\nsetup right there,\nI deleted the three lines.\n\n338\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.110\nLet's go back up here just so\nyou can see it, okay let me find it,\n\n339\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.050\nall right, right there.\n\n340\n00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.411\nSee where it say book fold printing?\n\n341\n00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:05.265\nFor some reason, on the PC it's fine,\n\n342\n00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:09.660\nMac doesn't understand these\nthree lines right here.\n\n343\n00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.030\nBook fold printing.\n\n344\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.930\nSo if I took this and I deleted this,\n\n345\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.690\ngot to make sure I get\nrid of that other period.\n\n346\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.860\nIf I delete those lines,\nI'm gonna save this.\n\n347\n00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.850\nSo now I'm actually editing the code,\nthe VBA in here.\n\n348\n00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.460\nI'm gonna save this,\nI'm gonna close this window.\n\n349\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.860\nIt's just telling me that this\nis gonna stop the debugging.\n\n350\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.770\nThat's fine, I'm gonna click OK.\n\n351\n00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.490\nFingers crossed, it should work.\n\n352\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.200\nLet's see.\n\n353\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.694\nIf I come over here to the apples and\nI run it.\n\n354\n00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:41.648\nAnd [SOUND], I was hoping this would\nwork Daniel, because I'm like,\n\n355\n00:17:41.648 --> 00:17:42.792\nI know this worked before.\n\n356\n00:17:42.792 --> 00:17:43.428\n&gt;&gt; And it worked.\n\n357\n00:17:43.428 --> 00:17:44.288\n&gt;&gt; And it did.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n358\n00:17:44.288 --> 00:17:45.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n359\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.890\nUsually the red light scares computers\nfrom working for some reason.\n\n360\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.441\n&gt;&gt; So I went in and\nedited my Visual Basic code and did that.\n\n361\n00:17:54.441 --> 00:17:57.658\nNow again, if you don't like it,\nwhat I would always suggest is,\n\n362\n00:17:57.658 --> 00:18:00.900\nis like if yours breaks,\njust delete the macro and start over.\n\n363\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.180\nNow that's the biggest thing to just be\nlike, I'm not messing with code, but I'm\n\n364\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:10.800\ngonna try it enough times to where it'll\nrecord it and do what I want it to do.\n\n365\n00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.700\nIt's this weird, play around game.\n\n366\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.130\n&gt;&gt; So,\nis that what the record macro button does,\n\n367\n00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.150\nis basically you're telling it,\nhere's what I wanna do and\n\n368\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:22.060\nit writes all that code de code\nstuff in the background for you?\n\n369\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what's happening?\n\n370\n00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n371\n00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.340\nI know.\n\n372\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.271\nWhy don't we do that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.\n\n373\n00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:27.405\n&gt;&gt; Perfect segway.\n\n374\n00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:29.275\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like we planned this.\n\n375\n00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we literally are not.\n\n376\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.122\nI had no idea that was the next\nthing she was gonna do.\n\n377\n00:18:33.122 --> 00:18:34.259\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, he doesn't read the notes.\n\n378\n00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:35.004\n&gt;&gt; It's just a lot, I know.\n\n379\n00:18:35.004 --> 00:18:37.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just go with whatever.\n\n380\n00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.150\n&gt;&gt; But that's exactly right.\n\n381\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.030\nSo it's going to record all your steps.\n\n382\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:41.700\nSo why don't we do this.\n\n383\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.500\nI'm gonna close this.\n\n384\n00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.740\nI'm just doing a Cmd+W to not close.\n\n385\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.168\nI'm not gonna save the changes,\nthat way, hopefully,\n\n386\n00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:49.797\neverything will be okay for you guys.\n\n387\n00:18:49.797 --> 00:18:53.017\nAnd I'm also gonna do another\nshortcut that I had to remind myself,\n\n388\n00:18:53.017 --> 00:18:55.175\nit's like I don't want to click the don't.\n\n389\n00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:58.736\nBut just do the Cmd+Del, and\nthen it doesn't save your changes,\n\n390\n00:18:58.736 --> 00:19:00.060\nwhich is kind of fun.\n\n391\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.500\nSo little shortcuts.\n\n392\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.390\nSo let's start from the beginning.\n\n393\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.420\nLet's go back into Word,\nwhich is already open.\n\n394\n00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.150\nI'm gonna start a blank new document.\n\n395\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.650\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm going to do exactly what Daniel said.\n\n396\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.040\nI'm going to record a macro.\n\n397\n00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.940\nAnd this is where those weird things of,\n\n398\n00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.282\nlike I said,\nit's not gonna record everything.\n\n399\n00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:21.922\nI just, this is just the kind\nof nature of the beast.\n\n400\n00:19:21.922 --> 00:19:25.810\nYou've gotta kind of pick your battles\nof which ones to try to win and\n\n401\n00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:30.110\nwhich ones to not win, and\nmacros can be one of those.\n\n402\n00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.930\nAll right, here we go.\n\n403\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.800\nLet's go with.\n\n404\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.974\nI'm gonna go with\nthe developer tab right here.\n\n405\n00:19:34.974 --> 00:19:37.780\nAnd I'm going to record a macro.\n\n406\n00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.660\nSo I'm going to write a few steps.\n\n407\n00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.050\nI'm gonna go to record macro.\n\n408\n00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:47.750\nAnd I'm going to say,\nlet's go ahead and say, office.\n\n409\n00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.300\nLet me give you some little tips right\nhere, cuz I started to do something and\n\n410\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.140\nI tell you don't do this.\n\n411\n00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.890\nHow you name your macros is important.\n\n412\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.910\nNo capital letters.\n\n413\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.910\nI think you can do capital letters, but\n\n414\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.260\nI'm gonna just tell you don't do capital\nletters, but definitely no spaces.\n\n415\n00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.320\nYou don't want any special characters.\n\n416\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.210\nLike, exclamation points or back slashes,\ncuz those indicate something.\n\n417\n00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.170\nSo, all lowercase.\n\n418\n00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.398\nIf you want spaces,\ndo like an underscore or a dash.\n\n419\n00:20:13.398 --> 00:20:15.480\nThose aren't special characters.\n\n420\n00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.490\nSo keep that in mind when\nyou're naming your macros.\n\n421\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.650\nI'm pretty sure if you name it wrong,\n\n422\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.160\nit's gonna give you a warning\nof like I can't do that anyways.\n\n423\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.880\nOkay, so I'm gonna go with Office Pro,\nand we're gonna do _setup.\n\n424\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.610\nJust for that.\n\n425\n00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.018\nYou can assign it to a keyboard\nshortcut if you wanted to.\n\n426\n00:20:32.018 --> 00:20:33.630\nWe don't need to worry about that.\n\n427\n00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.110\nNow, this is where,\nwhere do you want to store the macro?\n\n428\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.270\nDo you want it in the document only?\n\n429\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.740\nThis file will be the only place it\nputs it, or do you want to put it into,\n\n430\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.650\nI want every document\nto be able to do this.\n\n431\n00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.890\nKeep it in that normal template.\n\n432\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.650\nSo that's the one I'm going to choose,\n\n433\n00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:55.140\ncuz I want to be able to run\nthis macro on other files.\n\n434\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.860\nAnd then you should always\nwrite a description, cuz you'll\n\n435\n00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.357\nsee in mine I have an example one, two,\nthree, and, like, not very descriptive.\n\n436\n00:21:01.357 --> 00:21:01.960\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n437\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.039\n&gt;&gt; So write out what you plan to do in\n\n438\n00:21:04.039 --> 00:21:05.265\nyour macros.\n\n439\n00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:08.775\nSo if I click record,\nnow look at my little icon on my computer.\n\n440\n00:21:08.775 --> 00:21:15.152\nIt looks like a little scriptie button,\nbecause, well you're writing a script.\n\n441\n00:21:15.152 --> 00:21:18.242\nSo if I scroll back out, or\nsorry that was just me zooming in.\n\n442\n00:21:18.242 --> 00:21:20.322\nIt's recording everything you do,\n\n443\n00:21:20.322 --> 00:21:25.112\nso you should definitely plan out\nwhat you want to do beforehand, and\n\n444\n00:21:25.112 --> 00:21:29.912\ntry not to write any extra steps in there.\n\n445\n00:21:29.912 --> 00:21:32.202\nBecause remember it's\nrecording everything you do.\n\n446\n00:21:32.202 --> 00:21:34.750\nSo if you're like let me go back,\nlet me go back.\n\n447\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.510\nIt's gonna record all that and you wanna\ntry to keep it as clean as possible.\n\n448\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.670\nSo plan it out, do what you wanna do.\n\n449\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.980\nIt's not recording the time, like\nthe duration, it's recording your steps.\n\n450\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.764\n&gt;&gt; So anything you click on it's going,\n\n451\n00:21:47.764 --> 00:21:49.536\nthat's what you want in here\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n452\n00:21:49.536 --> 00:21:52.208\nif you accidentally click the wrong thing,\nit's now a part of the steps.\n\n453\n00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:53.867\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It may still work, but\n\n454\n00:21:53.867 --> 00:21:56.232\nit might not be as\nefficient as it could be.\n\n455\n00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:57.319\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n456\n00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:59.640\nSo now we're gonna do a few things.\n\n457\n00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.650\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go over to,\nlet's go into the insert, and\n\n458\n00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:07.300\nwe're gonna insert a header, cuz there's\nalways something putting all the time.\n\n459\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.520\n&gt;&gt; Note right here,\ndon't use these predetermined ones.\n\n460\n00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.900\nIt might work just fine, I have found that\nif you try to use these like pre-built\n\n461\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.460\nones, it's gonna throw you an error\ncuz it doesn't understand that.\n\n462\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.730\nYou wanna go to the edit header\ndown at the bottom, okay?\n\n463\n00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.790\nSo that's kinda tip number one,\nif you're doing headers.\n\n464\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:29.852\nGo to the edit header and let's go\nahead and let me zoom in a little bit.\n\n465\n00:22:29.852 --> 00:22:33.282\nWell actually I'm not gonna zoom in\ncuz it'll go ahead and record that.\n\n466\n00:22:33.282 --> 00:22:37.140\nWe're just going to go ahead and\nput in Office Pro T.V.,\n\n467\n00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:42.280\nI'm going to tab over and I'm going\nto type in my name, just for fun.\n\n468\n00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.836\nAnd I guess want some J.T.\nright now, but I'm going to go with Vonne.\n\n469\n00:22:45.836 --> 00:22:49.762\nI'm gonna go with my name, I'm gonna\nclick on the go to footer button.\n\n470\n00:22:49.762 --> 00:22:54.610\nI'm gonna hit the Tab key, I'm gonna\ninsert the page number right here.\n\n471\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.840\nWe'll do that, I want the alignment\nto be center, we'll click OK.\n\n472\n00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.370\nThere's my page number, I'm gonna close\nthe header and footer right here.\n\n473\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.140\nAnd that's going to be my header.\n\n474\n00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.460\nI wanna change the page boarders.\n\n475\n00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.180\nLet's have some fun.\n\n476\n00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.940\nThat way we have some like\nvisual things to look for.\n\n477\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.920\nSo we'll go to our layout.\n\n478\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.870\nNo we'll go to design,\nwe'll go to page borders.\n\n479\n00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.660\nAnd you're like, wait but\nyou did click the wrong thing.\n\n480\n00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.690\nIt's not gonna remember like\nwhat tab you're clicking.\n\n481\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.170\nIt's the button and\nthe actual performing of the thing.\n\n482\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:29.180\nSo I'm gonna go with a dotted line.\n\n483\n00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.470\nWe'll make it thicker, and\nwe'll make it a different color.\n\n484\n00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.740\nTry not to do theme colors either.\n\n485\n00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:41.450\nGo to the more colors button and\nchoose a specific color here.\n\n486\n00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.640\nDon't use the themes.\n\n487\n00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.980\nIt doesn't like that,\ncuz remember your themes can change.\n\n488\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.980\nSo you wanna to have a solid\ncolor picked on that.\n\n489\n00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.985\nWe clicked OK.\n\n490\n00:23:50.985 --> 00:23:52.445\nSo now I did some headers.\n\n491\n00:23:52.445 --> 00:23:55.970\nI did a page border, and just for\nfun to show you that it's\n\n492\n00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.956\nprobably not going to work I am\ngoing to switch this to portrait.\n\n493\n00:23:59.956 --> 00:24:04.727\nAll those things that I did and\nmaybe just for fun, let's go ahead and\n\n494\n00:24:04.727 --> 00:24:11.050\ncenter the text, let's make it 36 points,\nand we'll make it bold, great.\n\n495\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.938\nNow you gotta remember,\nif you start recording, you gotta stop,\n\n496\n00:24:14.938 --> 00:24:16.958\nyou have to click the Stop button.\n\n497\n00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.606\nSo you gotta go back over developer,\n\n498\n00:24:18.606 --> 00:24:21.650\nthat's just gonna keep on\nremembering everything you're doing.\n\n499\n00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.730\nYou come over here, and\nyou click Stop recording.\n\n500\n00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.660\nAs soon as you click Stop recording,\n\n501\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.850\nall those steps are now locked\ninto the normal template.\n\n502\n00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:32.914\nSo if I close this,\n\n503\n00:24:32.914 --> 00:24:37.400\nI'm not saving the changes cuz all\nof those things I did are recorded.\n\n504\n00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.900\nLet's go back into Word,\nlet's do a new document.\n\n505\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:45.050\nWe'll go ahead and start this, I want\nto now run those steps that I just did.\n\n506\n00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.770\nYou go to the developer, you go to Macros,\nyou saw me doing this in the other files.\n\n507\n00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.898\nYou're like, no, they're not here,\nI'm not in the right place.\n\n508\n00:24:52.898 --> 00:24:58.073\nWhat do I want the Macros to be showing is\nfrom the template, the normal template.\n\n509\n00:24:58.073 --> 00:25:02.343\nAnd here all the other ones that I\ndid before the show, and you're like,\n\n510\n00:25:02.343 --> 00:25:06.411\nexample 1 2, 3 [LAUGH] oops,\nthose don't really mean much at all.\n\n511\n00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:12.380\nBut I'm gonna pick the one that we have,\nwhich is the Office Pro setup.\n\n512\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.126\nWe click run, and\nlook at that, it did everything\n\n513\n00:25:17.126 --> 00:25:21.764\nthat I told it to do,\nyou're like, yay, look.\n\n514\n00:25:21.764 --> 00:25:25.227\nIt didn't change to landscape,\nremember we changed the orientation?\n\n515\n00:25:25.227 --> 00:25:26.324\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n516\n00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:28.532\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, now this is one\nof those things I told you,\n\n517\n00:25:28.532 --> 00:25:30.460\nyou gotta pick your battles.\n\n518\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.043\nI cannot for the life of me, I'll be\ncompletely honest, I cannot for the life\n\n519\n00:25:34.043 --> 00:25:37.589\nof me figure out why it's not recording\nany page setups, just won't do it.\n\n520\n00:25:37.589 --> 00:25:38.281\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n521\n00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:41.206\n&gt;&gt; It won't record margins,\nit won't record orientation,\n\n522\n00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:45.190\nportrait versus landscape, and it won't\nrecord the vertical justification.\n\n523\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.340\nI'm so glad you pointed that out and then\nwent, I saw your cursor go to the middle.\n\n524\n00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.625\nIt won't do it on the Mac.\n\n525\n00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:51.316\n&gt;&gt; It's strange.\n\n526\n00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:54.242\n&gt;&gt; Don't know why, I have-\n&gt;&gt; On a PC, though, it goes great-\n\n527\n00:25:54.242 --> 00:25:56.910\n&gt;&gt; All page setup has been recorded in\n\n528\n00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.382\nmacros just fine.\n\n529\n00:25:58.382 --> 00:26:01.579\nI don't know if it's the time\nof day that I was doing this, or\n\n530\n00:26:01.579 --> 00:26:05.401\nit was the shoes that I'm wearing-\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing a programmer for\n\n531\n00:26:05.401 --> 00:26:09.840\nthese things for Mac is in the basement\nsomewhere next to the radiator.\n\n532\n00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny you say that, Daniel.\n\n533\n00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.639\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nit actually is [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK].\n\n534\n00:26:15.639 --> 00:26:20.788\n&gt;&gt; Right here, I have some references in\nthe episode notes that you can go to,\n\n535\n00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:22.765\nand I will show you this one.\n\n536\n00:26:22.765 --> 00:26:29.943\nThat just says that it's like kind of down\nin here, where it's just like, it's weak,\n\n537\n00:26:29.943 --> 00:26:34.898\nweak in the sense that it's just-\n&gt;&gt; It's not as fully featured as the PC\n\n538\n00:26:34.898 --> 00:26:35.542\nversion.\n\n539\n00:26:35.542 --> 00:26:41.023\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is just not going to\nbe Microsoft's top priority.\n\n540\n00:26:41.023 --> 00:26:44.713\nIn making sure that all macros,\n\n541\n00:26:44.713 --> 00:26:50.049\nrecorded macros,\nin Mac Word work properly.\n\n542\n00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:50.983\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n543\n00:26:50.983 --> 00:26:52.729\n&gt;&gt; It's just is what it is,\nyou can't really do anything.\n\n544\n00:26:52.729 --> 00:26:54.960\nSo right here it says,\nmacro recorder is very weak.\n\n545\n00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.187\nMany, if not most,\n\n546\n00:26:56.187 --> 00:27:00.318\nactions you take while the recorder\nis running are simply ignored.\n\n547\n00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:04.639\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So that's funny, so it's\nactually in there like you can do it, but\n\n548\n00:27:04.639 --> 00:27:08.982\nit's not, it just says, that's nice,\nthanks for playing [LAUGH].\n\n549\n00:27:08.982 --> 00:27:14.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly, and\njust to kind of throw this back in here.\n\n550\n00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:21.270\nIf I go into the macros and I go into page\nsetup, right, and I go into the step.\n\n551\n00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:26.939\nStep means I want to get right into\nthe VBA, look at what's in the, look here.\n\n552\n00:27:26.939 --> 00:27:29.880\nIt says I recorded all of this page setup.\n\n553\n00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.067\nI changed the vertical landscape, or\nthe vertical, I changed it to landscape.\n\n554\n00:27:33.067 --> 00:27:36.325\nAnd look what was written in the code,\nnothing.\n\n555\n00:27:36.325 --> 00:27:41.589\nIt has sub, end sub,\nno commands were actually recorded,\n\n556\n00:27:41.589 --> 00:27:46.024\nand I was doing a bunch of stuff,\njust ignored it.\n\n557\n00:27:46.024 --> 00:27:49.605\nI'm like, okay, so guess what,\nI'm just going to go ahead and say,\n\n558\n00:27:49.605 --> 00:27:51.325\nI won't do page setup in a macro.\n\n559\n00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:55.776\nYou know what I'll do, I'll just set\nup a template, start the template, and\n\n560\n00:27:55.776 --> 00:27:56.934\nthen go from there.\n\n561\n00:27:56.934 --> 00:28:01.889\n&gt;&gt; More than one way to remove\nthe hide from a feline [LAUGH].\n\n562\n00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:06.858\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly right, and this is where\nsome things will work, some things won't,\n\n563\n00:28:06.858 --> 00:28:08.570\nyou just have to roll with it.\n\n564\n00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.537\nThe other thing that I have\nnoticed is a little thing for\n\n565\n00:28:12.537 --> 00:28:15.307\nme, break it up into smaller chunks.\n\n566\n00:28:15.307 --> 00:28:19.565\nIf I can, I'm gonna close this and\nnot save the changes,\n\n567\n00:28:19.565 --> 00:28:23.138\nI can write one macro that\nwill change the font.\n\n568\n00:28:23.138 --> 00:28:28.191\nSo if I said, test, and then let me\nzoom in so you can see this a little bit\n\n569\n00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:33.436\nbetter, I select this, I have a macro\nthat formats text really quickly.\n\n570\n00:28:33.436 --> 00:28:35.967\nAnd I actually added it up on\nto the quick access toolbar,\n\n571\n00:28:35.967 --> 00:28:38.070\nwhich I'll show you how to do.\n\n572\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:43.550\nBut if I go over to developer,\nand then go to font size align.\n\n573\n00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:47.875\nClick Run, look, it did a whole bunch\nof font formatting, so it's like, okay,\n\n574\n00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:49.141\nthat becomes one macro.\n\n575\n00:28:49.141 --> 00:28:53.120\nAnd then adding headers\nbecomes a separate macro.\n\n576\n00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.940\nAnd then doing page setups doesn't work,\nso I know that I can't do that.\n\n577\n00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.695\nSo I'll do that with a template,\nthose types of things, so\n\n578\n00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:02.028\njust have to think about it.\n\n579\n00:29:02.028 --> 00:29:05.901\nBut the difference between a macro and\na template,\n\n580\n00:29:05.901 --> 00:29:10.674\na template, I have to have\nthe wherewithal to know that I need to\n\n581\n00:29:10.674 --> 00:29:14.925\nstart a new file from that layout,\nif you wanted to say.\n\n582\n00:29:14.925 --> 00:29:18.302\nSometimes you don't think that far ahead,\nthe cool thing about macros is,\n\n583\n00:29:18.302 --> 00:29:19.476\nyou can run it many times.\n\n584\n00:29:19.476 --> 00:29:22.649\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you basically take the\nelements that are within your template,\n\n585\n00:29:22.649 --> 00:29:23.730\nmake macros out of them.\n\n586\n00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.668\nNow if I don't know to\nstart with that template,\n\n587\n00:29:26.668 --> 00:29:29.542\nI could just jump into\na new standard document.\n\n588\n00:29:29.542 --> 00:29:33.756\nAnd start going, I see, click click click\nclick click, and just run your macros and\n\n589\n00:29:33.756 --> 00:29:36.100\nbasically create what you need on the fly.\n\n590\n00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.225\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, I mean templates,\nyou have to start that way.\n\n591\n00:29:40.225 --> 00:29:42.746\nIn macros you can do it anytime,\nyeah, you're exactly right.\n\n592\n00:29:42.746 --> 00:29:45.352\nI like the way you just said that,\nand now I'm trying to repeat you, and\n\n593\n00:29:45.352 --> 00:29:46.104\nit's not working.\n\n594\n00:29:46.104 --> 00:29:49.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, but yeah,\n\n595\n00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:53.274\nthat's what you gotta kind\nof really tackle, and\n\n596\n00:29:53.274 --> 00:29:59.919\nthat's where I really needed to have\na landscape, vertical alignment, margins.\n\n597\n00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:02.950\nSo you know what I did,\nI made a template called Certificate Pink.\n\n598\n00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:07.500\nHere's my new file, okay,\nand then I can go ahead and\n\n599\n00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:13.390\nmaybe run other macros like\nthe font formatting with that one.\n\n600\n00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.770\nSo that's where you chunk it up,\nas I call it,\n\n601\n00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:20.800\npick your battles as to which one\nyou need to do, and go from there.\n\n602\n00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.410\nAnd I do have, like I said,\n\n603\n00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:27.386\nthose references in there that will try to\nsay that there is VBA of page orientation.\n\n604\n00:30:27.386 --> 00:30:29.747\nI'm just not comfortable\nwriting it into my macro.\n\n605\n00:30:29.747 --> 00:30:33.972\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably a little more than this\ncourse is meant to offer you anyway.\n\n606\n00:30:33.972 --> 00:30:37.906\nThat'd be a course all unto itself,\nso just keep that in mind,\n\n607\n00:30:37.906 --> 00:30:39.328\nit is quite advanced.\n\n608\n00:30:39.328 --> 00:30:42.837\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the thing about the, how did\nyou get that button up there to run on\n\n609\n00:30:42.837 --> 00:30:46.090\nyour quick access toolbar,\nlet me show you where that's at.\n\n610\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.308\nIf you go into Word and you go into\nPreferences, changing your ribbon and\n\n611\n00:30:50.308 --> 00:30:55.011\ntoolbar or customizing your quick access\ntoolbar, something we talked about in\n\n612\n00:30:55.011 --> 00:30:59.043\nthe Word essentials program,\nWord essentials show, my episodes.\n\n613\n00:30:59.043 --> 00:31:02.715\nBut right here on the quick access\ntoolbar, choosing commands from,\n\n614\n00:31:02.715 --> 00:31:04.717\nthere's a whole section for macros.\n\n615\n00:31:04.717 --> 00:31:06.277\nAnd so if I go to macros,\n\n616\n00:31:06.277 --> 00:31:10.490\nthese are all the macros that\nI have in my normal template.\n\n617\n00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:14.730\nSo I just picked the one that I wanted,\nwhich was this particular one,\n\n618\n00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.740\nand I just added it.\n\n619\n00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.331\nNow the thing is, it just kinda showed\nup as this little bubble thing, so\n\n620\n00:31:21.331 --> 00:31:23.828\nI was like, okay, that sounds great.\n\n621\n00:31:23.828 --> 00:31:26.564\nSo you're gonna have to kind\nof remember what they are and\n\n622\n00:31:26.564 --> 00:31:29.180\nwhere you've put them,\nbut you can add them.\n\n623\n00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.687\nYou don't have as much customization of\nyour quick access toolbar like you do in\n\n624\n00:31:33.687 --> 00:31:36.862\nPCs where you can add icons to it and\nall this cool stuff.\n\n625\n00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:40.468\nBut you can put that into your program,\nand that way, you can\n\n626\n00:31:40.468 --> 00:31:45.460\njust line them all up, click it, and have\nyour macros that can run on any of them.\n\n627\n00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.990\nSo that was just the last\nthing that I wanted to point\n\n628\n00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.670\nout in this particular episode.\n\n629\n00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.891\nAgain, macros are cool,\nthey can really help you.\n\n630\n00:31:53.891 --> 00:31:58.308\nWrite them yourself, use them in\ncombinations with them by themselves,\n\n631\n00:31:58.308 --> 00:32:00.010\nwith your templates.\n\n632\n00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.722\nDon't open them from other people\nunless you really, really trust them.\n\n633\n00:32:03.722 --> 00:32:05.630\nAnd even at that point,\nbe careful on that too, so.\n\n634\n00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:08.120\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n[LAUGH] great words of warning.\n\n635\n00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.300\nEnd it here by, Miss Vonne Smith,\nwe do appreciate you joining us today.\n\n636\n00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:15.670\nBut there is macros for Word in Mac,\nthat goes together, right?\n\n637\n00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.744\nYou can eat mac and cheese while you're\ndoing it, and that'll be a lot of fun.\n\n638\n00:32:17.744 --> 00:32:19.685\nYou can say, mac, mac, mac, so much fun.\n\n639\n00:32:19.685 --> 00:32:21.120\nVonne, thanks for joining us today,\n\n640\n00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.220\nwe do thank you good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n641\n00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.280\nBut it looks like we're at that time where\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n642\n00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.147\nWe do thank you yet again for watching,\nBut signing off for OfficeProTV,\n\n643\n00:32:30.147 --> 00:32:31.684\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n644\n00:32:31.684 --> 00:32:32.576\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne

I think it's in South Carolina, or\n\n35\n00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:11.110\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n36\n00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.186\nThat's not bad.\nWe can go there.\n\n37\n00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:13.081\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I might need to make\n\n38\n00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:13.710\na trip.\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n39\n00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.302\n&gt;&gt; So, all\n\n40\n00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:14.899\nright.\n\n41\n00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:15.681\n&gt;&gt; Anyway-\n&gt;&gt; What are we talking about?\n\n42\n00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:16.631\n&gt;&gt; 2016 Word for Mac,\n\n43\n00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:18.790\nthat's what we're talking about today.\n&gt;&gt; How are we\n\n44\n00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.300\ngonna link Swamp Rabbit\nhockey to linked objects?\n\n45\n00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.919\nI don't know.\n\n46\n00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:24.640\nBut- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna try.\n\n47\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.624\n&gt;&gt; But that is what we're talking\n\n48\n00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:28.770\nabout here today in Word for Mac.\n\n49\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.322\nAnd what we're gonna be doing\nis placing objects into a Word\n\n50\n00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:38.329\ndocument that are linked to another\nsource, such as maybe I wanna\n\n51\n00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.656\nthrow in something that I put in\nan Excel file into my Word document.\n\n52\n00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:47.060\nYeah, not just copy and paste,\nor make the table over again.\n\n53\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.200\nBecause if you think about tables,\nall in rows and columns,\n\n54\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.180\nI already got that in Excel.\n\n55\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.906\nAnd these are numbers that I'm going\nto be using every week in my weekly\n\n56\n00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:58.467\nreport that I have to make in Word, but\n\n57\n00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:02.974\nI gotta pull the data from this\nExcel file that had all the numbers.\n\n58\n00:02:02.974 --> 00:02:07.190\nHm well why don't just go ahead and just\nput the actual content from the Excel file\n\n59\n00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.220\nright into the Word document and then just\nhave it update automatically every week?\n\n60\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.860\n&gt;&gt; So let me get this straight,\n\n61\n00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.230\nlet me see if i'm picking up what you're\nputting down here Gold Leader, and\n\n62\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.830\nthat is, I'm creating multiple different\ndocuments in multiple different\n\n63\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.170\nOffice areas to products, should I say,\nWord, Excel, so on, and so forth.\n\n64\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.650\nAnd I just say, hey,\ninstead of having to put a table,\n\n65\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.865\nand fill out the information, and go in\nevery time it changes to change it there,\n\n66\n00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:38.170\nI just continue to work normally\nthroughout my Office experience and\n\n67\n00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.330\njust go link to that,\nlink to that, link to that.\n\n68\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.910\nAnd since you share the same DNA,\nyou should be able to do that, and\n\n69\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.355\nit does.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, yeah.\n\n70\n00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:46.889\nGreat show, thanks for watching.\n\n71\n00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:47.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And scene.\n\n72\n00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:49.260\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I can't live in a world like this.\n\n73\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.745\nThis is blowing my mind.\n\n74\n00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:52.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, if you think about,\n\n75\n00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.437\nyou have to write the report in Word, but\nthere's a lot of information that you're\n\n76\n00:02:57.437 --> 00:03:00.730\ngetting from Excel, and stuff like that.\n&gt;&gt; Well, plus I would assume that\n\n77\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.920\nthere's other products that are meant to\ndo things like speadsheets, or whatever.\n\n78\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.110\nThey have a whole lot\nmore power than Word's\n\n79\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.050\nlimited capabilities in\nthat aspect would be.\n\n80\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.750\nSo being able to link them\ntogether is really advantageous.\n\n81\n00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.512\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I, yes [LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.650\nAs in listen to this man.\n\n83\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.650\nHe's really good at that.\n\n84\n00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.815\nYeah, exactly.\nSo yeah, pull the power of Excel and\n\n85\n00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:25.652\ndoing all the number crunching, get the\nresults and then just kinda just plop it\n\n86\n00:03:25.652 --> 00:03:26.630\nright into Word.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n87\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.210\nlikey.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n88\n00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.170\nthen you have that in that one file,\nyou save it, you close the Word file.\n\n89\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.400\nThen you go ahead and do all of the work\nthat you're doing in Excel, numbers\n\n90\n00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.000\nchange, open up the Word file, poof, done.\n&gt;&gt; It's like the portal gun.\n\n91\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.155\nYou shoot the gun, it opens a portal,\nyou reach in, grab your soda.\n\n92\n00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:43.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:44.618\n&gt;&gt; And close it,\n\n94\n00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:47.210\n[LAUGH] I'm going through time and\nspace for\n\n95\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.836\nanother resource.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n96\n00:03:48.836 --> 00:03:49.799\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy.\n\n97\n00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.130\nThat's a movie reference, isn't it?\n&gt;&gt; It's\n\n98\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.270\na game.\n&gt;&gt; Is it a game?\n\n99\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.184\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a game.\n\n100\n00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:53.837\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking Back to\n\n101\n00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:54.683\nthe Future.\n&gt;&gt; What was it?\n\n102\n00:03:54.683 --> 00:03:56.204\nI forget which one it was.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:57.855\n&gt;&gt; They had this gun you could shoot, and\n\n104\n00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:00.520\nit would open up portals\nto other parts of the map.\n\n105\n00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.460\nYou could walk right through it and\n\n106\n00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.460\njust, almost like teleporting.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n107\n00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.188\nI don't remember that one.\n\n108\n00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:05.688\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n109\n00:04:05.688 --> 00:04:07.090\n&gt;&gt; But it sounds awesome.\n\n110\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was really cool.\n\n111\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.664\n&gt;&gt; You keep thinking of that and\n\n112\n00:04:09.664 --> 00:04:11.350\nI'll demonstrate linked Office.\n\n113\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.052\nHow about that?\nOkay, you go.\n\n114\n00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.287\n&gt;&gt; All right, so why don't we go ahead and\n\n115\n00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:14.968\njump down into this?\n\n116\n00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:18.500\nI actually have in the show notes, there's\na lot of files that are associated with\n\n117\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.180\nthis particular episode that\nwe're going to be doing.\n\n118\n00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.700\nSo just to keep it all in there.\n\n119\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.092\nIt's in the show notes so\nyou know where we're going.\n\n120\n00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:29.536\nBut the thing to know about when\nyou're doing linked objects is one,\n\n121\n00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:32.150\nwhere to find where I can edit the links.\n\n122\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.570\nIt's in the edit menu.\n\n123\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.410\nIt's under links.\n\n124\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.740\nSo that's one thing.\n\n125\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.360\nAnd then understanding what that dialogue\nmeans and do I want to manually update it?\n\n126\n00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.260\nDo I want to automatically update it?\n\n127\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.180\nAll those types of things.\n\n128\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.140\nSo first of all, let me just show you\nthat we have a file called chart data.\n\n129\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.330\nI'm gonna show you the end result first.\n\n130\n00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.554\nSo in chart data, you can see that this is\nan Excel file, that we're talking about\n\n131\n00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:56.673\nFuego and Bishop, and you're like,\nwow, Bishop sleeps for 50 hours a day.\n\n132\n00:04:56.673 --> 00:05:00.548\nThe numbers, they're just numbers that\nI'm trying to keep updating over and\n\n133\n00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:01.980\nover again.\n\n134\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.970\nSo this is the Excel file.\n\n135\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.750\nI'm gonna close this.\n\n136\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.236\nI'm doing a Cmd+Q.\n\n137\n00:05:06.236 --> 00:05:08.590\nCmd+Q is to quit the application.\n\n138\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.250\nNow I have some examples down here.\n\n139\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.223\nWe have linked example Mac, and\nwe have linked example manual Mac.\n\n140\n00:05:15.223 --> 00:05:19.983\nI'm gonna start with manual one first and\nI'm gonna open this up,\n\n141\n00:05:19.983 --> 00:05:23.050\nbecause I have set this\nupdate to a manual.\n\n142\n00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.950\nNow a few things are happening\nthat can be a little weird.\n\n143\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.270\nIf you're like, I opened up Word,\nwhy do I have Excel?\n\n144\n00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.980\nThat is one big indication\nthat there's some type of\n\n145\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.130\nlinked information into there.\n\n146\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.063\nAnd this is where like, no, and you keep\nclosing it, and it keeps opening, and\n\n147\n00:05:39.063 --> 00:05:41.134\nit's like, it's just a thing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n148\n00:05:41.134 --> 00:05:43.475\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna close out of the start\n\n149\n00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:44.630\nmenu in Excel.\n\n150\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.260\nI can even close out of Excel altogether.\n\n151\n00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.140\nAnd nothing's happening,\nnothing's wrong, but\n\n152\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.340\nit's just one of those things\nthat's always going to pop it up.\n\n153\n00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.350\nYou look at this, and you're like,\nokay, this looks like a table.\n\n154\n00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.730\nSo you click on it, and\na few things happen.\n\n155\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.590\nYou're like, hm,\nthat looks a little different.\n\n156\n00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.466\nNo contextual tabs.\n\n157\n00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:04.876\nI do not have contextual tabs,\nlike the table tools, and the design, and\n\n158\n00:06:04.876 --> 00:06:09.310\nthe layout that come up that are normally\nassociated with an actual table in Word.\n\n159\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.310\nAnd then they're like\nthe little dots around them.\n\n160\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.958\nThey're not even the same.\n\n161\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:16.490\nThere's like this kind of dashed\naround it, looking a little weird.\n\n162\n00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.130\nOkay, that should be your first\nindication, this is a linked object and\n\n163\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.790\nthe other big thing is down\nhere on the status bar.\n\n164\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.895\nRemember the status bar,\nit's always such a good thing to look at.\n\n165\n00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:31.680\nIt says double-click to edit\nMicrosoft Excel Worksheet.\n\n166\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.250\nOkay, well I've got\nsomething going on there.\n\n167\n00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.030\nThen that makes sense to me\nthat this is a linked object.\n\n168\n00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.430\nOne, because I did this, so I know.\n\n169\n00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.650\nBut these are some visual indications\nto you that this is just not normal,\n\n170\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.460\na normal table in Word.\n\n171\n00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.470\nWhy don't we go over to that\nedit menu too while we're at it?\n\n172\n00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.462\nIf you have a file, any file,\nin any application, if you go to edit and\n\n173\n00:06:56.462 --> 00:07:01.093\nyou see links, like it's not grayed out,\nthen that means something's there.\n\n174\n00:07:01.093 --> 00:07:06.962\nSo if I click on edit links, you can see\nthat, yep, there's some type of source\n\n175\n00:07:06.962 --> 00:07:12.521\nfile from where this linked information\nlives, and it's an Excel worksheet.\n\n176\n00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:15.290\nIt's updating manually.\n\n177\n00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.270\nOkay, and we've got some chain sources and\nother things like that.\n\n178\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:25.134\nSo all right, that's why this does\nnot look like the chart data.\n\n179\n00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:26.900\nRemember the chart data,\nI think it was orange.\n\n180\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.640\nWas it?\nWas it orange?\n\n181\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.395\nI think it was orange.\n\n182\n00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:30.242\n[LAUGH] When we open up the Excel file.\n&gt;&gt;

Trivia for the day [LAUGH].\n\n226\n00:09:07.587 --> 00:09:08.850\n&gt;&gt; I like it [LAUGH].\n\n227\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.710\nSo Excel went ahead and\nopened just because it does.\n\n228\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:17.110\nI can do a Cmd+Q right now because Excel\nis the one in the front right here.\n\n229\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.030\nDocument contains one or\nmore links to other files.\n\n230\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.490\nDo you want to update this?\n\n231\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:28.130\nNotice this prompt is coming up because I\nset these linked projects as automatic.\n\n232\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.785\nSo I click Yes, and\nstill goes ahead and opens up Excel.\n\n233\n00:09:32.785 --> 00:09:35.640\n[LAUGH] You go ahead and\nclose it, and you're like, yay.\n\n234\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.748\n&gt;&gt; Used to that.\n\n235\n00:09:36.748 --> 00:09:37.444\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n236\n00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:38.440\n[LAUGH] So right here,\n\n237\n00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.610\nyou're like, okay, kind of.\n\n238\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Remember?\n\n239\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.460\nOrange, right?\n&gt;&gt; Orange.\n\n240\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.520\n&gt;&gt; This is orange.\n\n241\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.370\n&gt;&gt; We like the orange.\n\n242\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.200\n&gt;&gt; That's not orange,\n\n243\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.070\nis it?\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n244\n00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.080\nlooks more red-\n\n245\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.410\n&gt;&gt; That's pink.\n&gt;&gt; Fuschia.\n\n246\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.760\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with fuschia, okay.\n\n247\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.230\nSo it's like, okay.\n\n248\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.070\nCuz there's a couple little nuances\n\n249\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.560\nabout how you can put in\nlinked objects into Word.\n\n250\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.790\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit here so\nyou can see that there's two ways.\n\n251\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.920\nOkay, this is gonna get back to\nwhen we actually do the steps.\n\n252\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.160\nYou can copy the information\nfrom the Excel file,\n\n253\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.366\npaste it into Word by doing paste special,\nchoose the paste link, that's one way.\n\n254\n00:10:18.366 --> 00:10:23.490\nThe other way is you can insert\nthe object from the Insert Tab.\n\n255\n00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.230\nInsert object from file.\n\n256\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.740\nBut you've got to make\nsure you create a link,\n\n257\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.940\nbecause if you don't create a link,\nit's going to be like this one,\n\n258\n00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.780\nwhere this is an inserted object,\nthis is an insert object from file.\n\n259\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:40.170\nBut there's no check box to linking it to\nthe source data, it's an embedded object.\n\n260\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.940\nSo it still has the weird dots and\neverything like that, but\n\n261\n00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.760\nit's not linked to a separate file.\n\n262\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.790\nAnd this is again, the other weird thing,\nif you do the copying from Excel and\n\n263\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.890\npaste the link, the only way\nyou're gonna make it update is\n\n264\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:03.070\nif you open that up, save it in Excel,\nand then come back to Word.\n\n265\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.330\nWeird, but it works okay.\n\n266\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.480\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nzoom out a little bit and\n\n267\n00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.600\nthen show you what I mean by it.\n\n268\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.060\nIf I single click on this,\nhere's a selected object.\n\n269\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:19.550\nIf you double click, you don't have to\ngo into edit links and say open source.\n\n270\n00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.400\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n271\n00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.570\nIf you double click it,\nwatch what happens, it is opening up Excel\n\n272\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.320\nbecause it's going directly to,\nI'm gonna close the Start menu.\n\n273\n00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.000\nTo chart data, this is the linked file.\n\n274\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.220\nSo notice I opened it up\nby double clicking it.\n\n275\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.970\nJust coming in here and saving.\n\n276\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.115\nJust regular old save or Cmd+S.\n\n277\n00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.740\nCmd+Q to close out of Excel.\n\n278\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.330\nAnd boom, there it is.\n\n279\n00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.640\nIt's orange.\n\n280\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.870\nWhy this one?\n\n281\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.620\nThey're both set to automatic, Daniel.\n\n282\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:52.293\nSo why do you have to open it and save\nit in Excel to make it force the update?\n\n283\n00:11:52.293 --> 00:11:53.181\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:11:53.181 --> 00:11:54.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.280\n&gt;&gt; That's the technical answer.\n\n286\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.945\nYou're on an exam on this.\n\n287\n00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:59.209\n[LAUGH] You look for a D.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n288\n00:11:59.209 --> 00:11:59.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.020\n&gt;&gt; My face goes like this.\n\n290\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.677\n&gt;&gt; Just Vonne, doing that.\n\n291\n00:12:03.677 --> 00:12:04.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\n\n292\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.230\nthat's just kinda those weird things.\n\n293\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:11.230\nBut let's just go back one more time to\nthat edit links dialogue box to show you\n\n294\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.810\nsome of those small details.\n\n295\n00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.990\nThere are two objects in here, okay,\nand I'm gonna come out and do this.\n\n296\n00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.890\nIt's going to the file on my desktop.\n\n297\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.750\nNow notice it's in my users folders,\n\n298\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:28.980\nall the way down to chartdata.xls.\n&gt;&gt; And if you look at this one.\n\n299\n00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:34.290\nSo here, this I thought was interesting,\nis that see one of them has an item.\n\n300\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:40.180\nAnd if you scroll and like Sheet1, row\none, column one, row five, column three.\n\n301\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:47.420\nThat's the range of the Excel\ncells that was bringing into.\n\n302\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.040\nNow, I can honestly tell you I don't\nexactly know which one is which,\n\n303\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.690\nbut I think I do.\n\n304\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.550\nNotice this second one.\n\n305\n00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.370\nDo you see how it just says cell\nworksheet but there's no range.\n\n306\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.180\nIt's just like going out to the sheet.\n\n307\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.260\nI'm pretty sure this is the one that\nwas done from the copy and paste, and\n\n308\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.530\nthis is the one from the insert object.\n\n309\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.150\nI might have them flipped.\n\n310\n00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.730\nI don't know.\n\n311\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.890\nHonestly, I'll be completely honest.\n\n312\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.020\nI don't know which one is which,\n\n313\n00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.720\nbut it does show you that one\nhas the range and one doesn't.\n\n314\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.400\nSo that has some little bit to to with it.\n\n315\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.480\nAnd while we're here, since we're\ntalking about linked objects and\n\n316\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:28.590\nshowing the examples,\nthat path to this particular file, great.\n\n317\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.610\nWell the thing is, what if I sent, so\nDaniel if I sent you this Word document,\n\n318\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.970\njust the Word document by itself, do you\nthink you're gonna be able to have any\n\n319\n00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.700\nconnection back to that chart data?\n&gt;&gt; Hm, I'm gonna go with a big\n\n320\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.220\nfat no on that one.\n&gt;&gt; Correct, because I'm gonna have\n\n321\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.790\nto send you the Excel file too.\n&gt;&gt; It's like a bundle at that point.\n\n322\n00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.550\nWhat would they say?\n\n323\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.760\nLike an include file when\nit comes to programming?\n\n324\n00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.440\nYou have to have those things so\n\n325\n00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.270\nthat it can actually reference it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n326\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.370\n&gt;&gt; Or otherwise, it's gonna go,\n\n327\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.500\nI need that file.\n\n328\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.200\nIt's not here.\n&gt;&gt; And in like Excel, Illustrator, and\n\n329\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.580\nInDesign, we call it packaging.\n\n330\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.300\nYou have to package all the stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n331\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.260\n&gt;&gt; That you pulled into that one\n\n332\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.670\nInDesign document to be able to\nhand it out to somebody else.\n\n333\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.620\nCuz otherwise, they're not gonna be\n\n334\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.180\nable to see it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n335\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.610\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing is I could go ahead\n\n336\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.964\nand give you the Excel file.\n\n337\n00:14:09.964 --> 00:14:13.130\nBut it's kind of hard coded.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n338\n00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:17.150\nSo if it's not in that\nspecific directory path, then\n\n339\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.820\nit's also going to call me a liar and say.\n&gt;&gt; And it might not even update to see.\n\n340\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.370\nIt's trying to find the users of\nOffice Pro demo co on my document and\n\n341\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.840\nyou're not an Office Pro demo co user.\n\n342\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.080\nSo he might not even update that one even\nthough it's the same directory because\n\n343\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.980\nthis is when we start getting into\npaths and references and everything.\n\n344\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.050\nSo it might be like everything's broken,\nand you're like, but\n\n345\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.480\nyou sent me both files?\n\n346\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.870\nYou're going to have to go back in and\nlook in here.\n\n347\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.720\nYou can change source.\n\n348\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.780\nYou can say hey, I know you're\ntrying to look on Vonne's computer.\n\n349\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.180\nI want you to look for that same file,\nbut look on my computer and\n\n350\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.160\nit will change the source\nof that particular file.\n\n351\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.720\nSo, that's all things that I'll\nshow you as we go through this, but\n\n352\n00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.180\ntry and give me the end result.\n\n353\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.340\nI think is sometimes a little,\nI like to see the end before I begin,\n\n354\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.030\nand then now I'll show you the steps.\n\n355\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.880\nAnd we've got them right here.\n\n356\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.390\nYou've got them already written down,\nthat's so good [INAUDIBLE], so\n\n357\n00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.340\nwe're going to close this.\n\n358\n00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.200\nI'm not going to save the changes just for\nyour guys needs, so\n\n359\n00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.990\nlet's go ahead and do our process.\n\n360\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.350\nWe're gonna open up a file\nthat I have linked, Start.\n\n361\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.770\nThis is really just the same things that\ncopied over from that other file just to\n\n362\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.230\ngive myself a hey this\nis what we need to do.\n\n363\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.202\nSo copy and paste or insert from file.\n\n364\n00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:40.730\nWe're gonna do the first one, and\nI'm gonna show you that's it's very easy\n\n365\n00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.310\nto forget the little check\nbox to create the link.\n\n366\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.500\nOn the insert,\n\n367\n00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.490\nyou've got to put your cursor into the\nWord file where you want it to go into.\n\n368\n00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.290\nHere I'm at,\nI'm going to go into right over here.\n\n369\n00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.524\nI don't have my,\nresolution's a little lower.\n\n370\n00:15:55.524 --> 00:16:01.230\nI'm going to insert the object in and\nthis one, I'll tell you.\n\n371\n00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.729\nSee, notice they have a '97 and\n2004 worksheet, and\n\n372\n00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:05.150\nthen you have an Excel worksheet.\n\n373\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.129\nWell, right now you can pick\nthe most recent one, but\n\n374\n00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:14.550\nyou're gonna be putting it in from a file,\nso it kinda doesn't matter.\n\n375\n00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.390\nIt's a weird thing to go with that,\nbecause you could embed an object,\n\n376\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.130\nlike an Excel object\ninto the Word document,\n\n377\n00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.090\nit has no connection to a file\nthat's an embedded object.\n\n378\n00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.390\nWe're going linked in this\nparticular episode, so\n\n379\n00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:31.122\nwe're gonna say from File we're\ngonna come out onto our desktop.\n\n380\n00:16:31.122 --> 00:16:34.200\nWe're gonna go into our\nfiles that we have.\n\n381\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.130\nThat's the wrong folder.\n\n382\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:35.710\nIt's this one.\n\n383\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.531\nI keep selecting the wrong folder [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n632\n00:28:16.413 --> 00:28:17.979\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I realize it starts to get\n\n633\n00:28:17.979 --> 00:28:19.750\na little circular there.\n&gt;&gt; It does,\n\n634\n00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.422\nyou've gotta be on the look out for\nthat circular ability.\n\n635\n00:28:22.422 --> 00:28:23.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah\n&gt;&gt; You know what i'm\n\n50\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.220\ntalking about\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.030\n&gt;&gt; So you know you are just in this letter\n\n52\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.160\nthan somebody's just put your name in,\nright.\n\n53\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.840\nAnd you've got tons of them all over.\n\n54\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.340\nThat's what I always think\nabout as mail merge.\n\n55\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.340\nBecause it's exactly what you're doing.\n\n56\n00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.240\nYou are taking some type of document and\n\n57\n00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.140\nthen you are merging variable data or\nrecords of information and\n\n58\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.470\nputting it into that particular document\nand then spitting out all the results.\n\n59\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.350\nSo that, I'll demonstrate all of this\nwhen we actually get some files going.\n\n60\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.880\nBut that's what we're doing.\n\n61\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.430\nPlaceholders for fields within a document\nthat merge in with a data source and\n\n62\n00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.120\nthen everything comes out all beautiful.\n\n63\n00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.000\nSo that's what we're going to be doing.\n\n64\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.685\nSo what I'd like to start with\nis down in the help files.\n\n65\n00:02:56.685 --> 00:02:59.570\nCuz it does give some decent information,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n66\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.470\njump down in here.\n&gt;&gt; Got the URL already pulled up\n\n67\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.400\nthat you can find in the episode notes.\n\n68\n00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.096\nSo, we're gonna be using a mail\nmerge to create all sorts of things,\n\n69\n00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:12.327\nlike bulk mail, that junk mail we were\ntalking about, labels and envelopes.\n\n70\n00:03:12.327 --> 00:03:16.765\nSo it's a way that is saying if you can go\nahead and create a batch of personalized\n\n71\n00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:20.874\nletters or emails to send to your\nprofessional contacts And you're gonna\n\n72\n00:03:20.874 --> 00:03:25.338\nneed to make sure that you combine\nwhatever letter, or email, or labels with.\n\n",

I was lurking, I was just like.\n\n10\n00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:35.394\n&gt;&gt; She was just hanging out like,\n\n11\n00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:36.844\nsipping water.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:36.844 --> 00:00:37.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I'm like, envelopes and\n\n14\n00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:41.165\nlevels, whoa.\n&gt;&gt; Levels.\n\n15\n00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:41.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:42.814\n&gt;&gt; Envelopes and levels.\n\n17\n00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:44.177\n&gt;&gt; Labels and envelopes,\n\n18\n00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.358\nI know something about that.\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n19\n00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:47.397\n&gt;&gt; Sure, let's go ahead and do it, though.\n\n20\n00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:48.053\n&gt;&gt; She said, what the heck?\n\n21\n00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:49.253\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Why not, you know?\n\n22\n00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:49.789\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n23\n00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.309\n&gt;&gt; Let's have some fun, so, [LAUGH].\n\n24\n00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.917\n&gt;&gt; Make it so.\n\n25\n00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.453\n&gt;&gt; So this is a slight continuation of\n\n26\n00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.382\nthe episode before this.\n\n27\n00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:57.480\nIt's not a part two,\n\n28\n00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.632\nbecause I want to just specifically label\nthis particular show, ha ha, label.\n\n29\n00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:03.902\nBut we did a mail merge that episode.\n\n30\n00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:08.606\nSo I would definitely suggest checking\nthat one out, because we are going to kind\n\n31\n00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:11.734\nof gloss over, if you want to say,\nthe data sources.\n\n32\n00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:15.405\nAnd that whole thing, and\ngo right into doing a mail merge for\n\n33\n00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:16.855\nlabels and envelopes.\n\n34\n00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:19.900\nSo if you need that back information,\ngo ahead and do that.\n\n35\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.956\nAnd might as well go ahead and\ndo a little shout out for my other show.\n\n36\n00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:28.359\nWe have a whole series on mail merge\nthat we go even way more in depth into\n\n37\n00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.660\nthe labels and\nenvelopes than this particular one.\n\n38\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.267\nThis is really kind of just like, hey,\nI want to go ahead and get this started,\n\n39\n00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:37.906\nmaybe you've got, I did this for\nmy sister's wedding.\n\n40\n00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:42.525\nI did all of her envelopes and labels,\nand then I had to do place cards and\n\n41\n00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:44.191\nall sorts of fun stuff.\n\n42\n00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:46.617\nMan, I was a mail merging mama,\nlet me tell you.\n\n43\n00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:47.241\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.275\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, I mean,\n\n45\n00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:52.941\nyou can get that from these particular\nepisodes, so that's what we're going with.\n\n46\n00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:56.577\nSo labels, I brought some props, Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; You brought some props?\n\n47\n00:01:56.577 --> 00:01:57.802\n&gt;&gt; I brought props.\n\n48\n00:01:57.802 --> 00:01:58.815\n&gt;&gt; Like a funny hat and\n\n49\n00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:02.521\na moustache thing and?\n&gt;&gt; No I brought labels [LAUGH].\n\n50\n00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.177\n&gt;&gt; That's cool, too [LAUGH].\n\n51\n00:02:04.177 --> 00:02:04.745\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n52\n00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:07.958\nYeah, and so this is like, I mean,\nI brought all sorts of varieties so\n\n53\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.860\nthat way we're not doing any\nvender specific, but these are-\n\n54\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.640\n&gt;&gt; It's any labels,\n\n55\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.178\nbecause there are standardizations\nwhen it comes to labels,\n\n56\n00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:16.745\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I mean, you could have any\n\n57\n00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:20.545\nbrand of it, but the one that\na lot of people are familiar with.\n\n58\n00:02:20.545 --> 00:02:24.402\nAt least in the label world,\nif you want to say, Avery labels.\n\n59\n00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:28.864\nI mean, that's just the ones that\nI seem to gravitate towards, but\n\n60\n00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:32.247\nthe thing is,\nthey have specific numbers on them.\n\n61\n00:02:32.247 --> 00:02:36.741\nSo this one is the name badge and\nthere is a number,\n\n62\n00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.407\nthis 5392.\n&gt;&gt; I thought it traveled back\n\n63\n00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:41.394\nin time from the year 5392.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:42.354\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n65\n00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:43.709\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wouldn't that be forward?\n\n66\n00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.165\nWait.\n&gt;&gt; They traveled here, this is not 5396.\n\n67\n00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:50.139\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow, okay, so back to labels.\n\n68\n00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.209\n[LAUGH] Time, what?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n69\n00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.450\n&gt;&gt; So this one is, this is the standard,\n\n70\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.428\nif you want to say, 5160, and I have some\nof these numbers memorized in my head.\n\n71\n00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:01.380\n&gt;&gt; Because you use them so much.\n\n72\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.092\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n73\n00:03:02.092 --> 00:03:04.786\nif you want mailing labels, 5160.\n\n74\n00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:06.892\nSo, and that's kind of the,\n\n75\n00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:10.783\nI feel like maybe the most\npopular ones that people do.\n\n76\n00:03:10.783 --> 00:03:15.296\nSo I just wanted to kind of point that out\nis that you know the number of the paper\n\n77\n00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:18.847\nthat you're going to eventually\nprint these labels out to.\n\n78\n00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:22.791\nBecause it's all in Word, because if\nI'm going to make mailing labels,\n\n79\n00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:24.902\nyou're going, hey, say 5160s.\n\n80\n00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:27.328\nGo ahead and change the layout,\nwhich is different than the name batch.\n\n81\n00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:32.715\nIt's six up on a page versus 36 or\nhowever many are on a label.\n\n82\n00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:36.597\nSo definitely know what type of\nlabels you want to make first.\n\n83\n00:03:36.597 --> 00:03:40.129\nAnd then determine,\ndo I want to perform a mail merge job, or\n\n84\n00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.017\ndo I want them to be all the same?\n\n85\n00:03:42.017 --> 00:03:45.028\nHm, and the same goes for your envelopes.\n\n86\n00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:46.943\nI didn't bring my props for the envelopes,\n\n87\n00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:49.441\nbut there's all sorts of\ndifferent sizes of envelopes.\n\n88\n00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:56.159\nThere's the number 10 envelope, that's\njust your standard mailing envelope.\n\n89\n00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.062\nDid you know that they were number 10s?\n&gt;&gt; I did not know\n\n90\n00:03:58.062 --> 00:03:59.197\nthat they were number 10s.\n\n91\n00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:04.076\nI am not up to speed when it comes\nto my envelope nomenclatures,\n\n92\n00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:06.417\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's a bunch of them,\n\n93\n00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:10.486\nthere's number 9s, and I think\nthere's number 7s, there's also A5s,\n\n94\n00:04:10.486 --> 00:04:13.131\nA4s, A7s.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I've heard of A4, I\n\n95\n00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:16.084\nsee that when I'm printing, it'll say A4.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:16.846\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n97\n00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:18.418\n&gt;&gt; And those are, again,\n\n98\n00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:24.173\nthe more standard sizes that, hey, I need\nA5 envelopes, or number 10 envelopes.\n\n99\n00:04:24.173 --> 00:04:31.367\nSo it's just like those labels, of 5160s,\nor the A5s and different things like that.\n\n100\n00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:35.267\nAgain, you need to know your\nend result before you start,\n\n101\n00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:39.337\nbecause that's going to change\nthe layout of the document.\n\n102\n00:04:39.337 --> 00:04:43.661\nBecause when we were doing the letters,\nthat was just an 8.5 by 11.\n\n103\n00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:46.825\nI think we even mentioned like, well,\nthis isn't the same size as an envelope.\n\n104\n00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:50.822\nSo if you're going to do that,\nyou need to tell the mail merge, or\n\n105\n00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:54.046\neven just the mailings,\nenvelopes, and letters.\n\n106\n00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:57.918\nThis is the particular one, envelopes and\nlabels, sorry, and then go from there.\n\n107\n00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:02.088\nSo why don't I go ahead and\njump in and get started with this, so\n\n108\n00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:05.183\nyou can start seeing\nwhat I’m talking about.\n\n109\n00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:09.182\nSo I have just a blank document started,\nokay, so just File, New.\n\n110\n00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:14.642\nWe're gonna go over to our Mailings tab,\nand this is where it can be slightly,\n\n111\n00:05:14.642 --> 00:05:19.214\nslightly confusing as to, well,\nthere's labels right there.\n\n112\n00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:21.953\nWe're gonna start with labels,\nby the way, and then we'll do envelopes.\n\n113\n00:05:21.953 --> 00:05:26.887\nSo why don't I just click right\nhere versus going to this\n\n114\n00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:29.206\nstart mail merge labels?\n\n115\n00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:34.033\nIt's kind of like are you\ndoing an actual mail merge, or\n\n116\n00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:37.228\nare you starting with a single page?\n\n117\n00:05:37.228 --> 00:05:40.359\nBut you can still get to it from, let me\njust show you what I'm talking about.\n\n118\n00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:44.615\nIf I click on here, where I say Labels,\nit's going to go right into, okay, hey,\n\n119\n00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:47.112\ntell me what your label\noptions are going to be.\n\n120\n00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:50.670\nBecause I know you're going to\nbe performing a mail merge,\n\n121\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.957\nlet me cancel this and come back over.\n\n122\n00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:55.854\nIt will give you the little prompt right\nhere, like hey, you need to select your\n\n123\n00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:58.512\nrecipients, it's just a prompt,\nI'm just going to close out of that.\n\n124\n00:05:58.512 --> 00:06:02.817\nBut if I go over here to Labels, it's\na little bit different dialog box, so,\n\n125\n00:06:02.817 --> 00:06:06.744\nit's like, hm, okay, but\nit's still kind of doing the same thing.\n\n126\n00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:13.439\nThis is more for, hey, I want to make\nthe same label for either the whole page,\n\n127\n00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:18.324\nfull page of a single label,\nor full page of a same label.\n\n128\n00:06:18.324 --> 00:06:22.264\nOr maybe I just want one single one,\nbecause, or if you try to save some space.\n\n129\n00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:25.978\nI don't know if you can really see that,\nbut you see how these are already done,\n\n130\n00:06:25.978 --> 00:06:28.044\nand these are labels that aren't done yet.\n\n131\n00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:33.363\nSo I want to print just this one, well\nthen, you can go to the specific row and\n\n132\n00:06:33.363 --> 00:06:37.374\ncolumn that this lives on,\nand put this in your printer.\n\n133\n00:06:37.374 --> 00:06:39.644\nAnd then just print that one out.\n\n134\n00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:43.673\nSo, a little bit different dialog box and\nfor different purposes.\n\n135\n00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:47.587\nBut, notice down there at the bottom, you\ncan go right into Mail Merge from here,\n\n136\n00:06:47.587 --> 00:06:48.966\nand then it does something.\n\n137\n00:06:48.966 --> 00:06:50.583\nAnd now, it did something, so\n\n138\n00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:53.898\nI'm just going to to a Command W\nto close this particular file.\n\n139\n00:06:53.898 --> 00:06:57.067\nBecause I wasn't really ready\nto explain that particular step.\n\n140\n00:06:57.067 --> 00:07:01.640\nSo, anyways, same place as you\ncan get to for different reasons,\n\n141\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.858\ncircular, all things.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:04.963\n&gt;&gt; Circular, [LAUGH].\n\n143\n00:07:04.963 --> 00:07:05.902\n&gt;&gt; They go up and down, and\n\n144\n00:07:05.902 --> 00:07:06.748\naround.\n&gt;&gt; And around.\n\n145\n00:07:06.748 --> 00:07:07.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:07:07.355 --> 00:07:08.916\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n147\n00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:11.423\nOkay, so, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; We digress, [LAUGH].\n\n148\n00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:13.342\n&gt;&gt; We always do, don't we?\n\n149\n00:07:13.342 --> 00:07:18.093\nSo let's start with the labels from here,\nand notice that I do need to pick that\n\n150\n00:07:18.093 --> 00:07:21.050\nparticular number of\nthe labels that I've got.\n\n151\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.865\nAnd notice it does have an Avery standard.\n\n152\n00:07:22.865 --> 00:07:27.426\nThere are other companies and formats that\nmight have a couple different numbers, so\n\n153\n00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:29.213\nmake sure you just choose those.\n\n154\n00:07:29.213 --> 00:07:33.863\nWe're gonna go to the Avery, and\ndo the 5160, there they are.\n\n155\n00:07:33.863 --> 00:07:38.062\nAlso, always double check this,\nthe page size and the actual width and\n\n156\n00:07:38.062 --> 00:07:40.101\nheight of that particular label.\n\n157\n00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:43.999\nMake sure it matches,\nif that says something like eight by ten,\n\n158\n00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:47.186\nyou're not in the right place,\nso we'll click OK.\n\n159\n00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:53.040\nThis is what I wanted to tell you right\nhere, is that as soon as you pick this,\n\n160\n00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.888\nyou have just changed\nthe structure of your page.\n\n161\n00:07:56.888 --> 00:07:58.452\nThis is a table isn't it?\n\n162\n00:07:58.452 --> 00:07:59.883\nColumns, rows.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n163\n00:07:59.883 --> 00:08:01.370\n&gt;&gt; This is a table too.\n\n164\n00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.610\nHow do I know it's a table?\n\n165\n00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.230\nI've got my table contextual tabs.\n\n166\n00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.910\nSo that's the whole change that's going\non here, and all of these right here\n\n167\n00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:15.800\nare gonna match up to the structure\nof whatever number you pick.\n\n168\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.820\nCool.\n\n169\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.720\nSo that's the first thing.\n\n170\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.020\nI'm gonna give you a couple tips that\nI like to do when I'm doing labels.\n\n171\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.880\nI can't see where the labels are.\n\n172\n00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.180\nSo what I do is I throw\non borders into this\n\n173\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.590\ntable to be able to help me see how\nthis is actually going to look.\n\n174\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.420\nIf you don't know anything about tables,\nit's in this particular series.\n\n175\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.869\nWe have, I think, four episodes on tables.\n\n176\n00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:42.336\nSo definitely check that out.\n\n177\n00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:46.350\nGoing up to the four pointed\narrow to select the whole table.\n\n178\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.610\nComing over to the layout tab\non my table contextual tabs, and\n\n179\n00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.890\nactually it's not layout, sorry,\nit's the table design [LAUGH].\n\n180\n00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.670\nAnd I'm gonna throw on\nthese borders right here.\n\n181\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.960\nI'm gonna change this to\njust doing all borders.\n\n182\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.840\nOkay now I see the labels.\n\n183\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.140\nSo that's to me kind of a big tip.\n\n184\n00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.630\nAnd when I go to print them, I just\ncome up here and turn the borders off,\n\n185\n00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.880\nbecause I don't want to print the lines.\n&gt;&gt; So if you leave that on there it will\n\n186\n00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.923\nprint those lines?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:14.923 --> 00:09:15.886\n&gt;&gt; That's a good thing to know.\n\n188\n00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:17.658\nQuestion pops into mind,\n\n189\n00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:21.030\nwhy would they want you to do that?\n&gt;&gt; Print\n\n190\n00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.110\nthe borders?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n191\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.140\nwhy would you want to leave that on there?\n\n192\n00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.820\nLike why is that an option?\n\n193\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.526\nWhy would, if I've enabled borders it'd\ngo, we obviously need these borders even\n\n194\n00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:34.700\nthough you're printing labels.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Word just thinks it's a table.\n\n195\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.220\nIt's just like you told me to\nput the boards on the table.\n\n196\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.895\nI'm printing a table.\n&gt;&gt; So it's not necessarily thinking of\n\n197\n00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:43.590\nan idea that you're gonna to\nbe printing off the label, but\n\n198\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.760\nthat you're creating a tabular document.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n199\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.790\nIt sees this as a table, and\nit's formatting as a table.\n\n200\n00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.345\nBecause I'm kind of like,\nI get where you're going now.\n\n201\n00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:56.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm printing labels, man,\n\n202\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.630\nI don't need the stupid lines.\n\n203\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.896\nWhy are you printing them?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Circular.\n\n204\n00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:01.030\n&gt;&gt; Circular [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.126\n&gt;&gt; We will get there [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:03.677\nAll right, perfect.\n\n207\n00:10:03.677 --> 00:10:07.799\nSo this is a nice way that you can\nvisualize where these labels, in a table,\n\n208\n00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:08.723\nare going to go.\n\n209\n00:10:08.723 --> 00:10:13.660\nGo back over to the Mailings tab and\nI'm going to click right here.\n\n210\n00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.382\nThe cool thing about doing\na Mail Merge with the labels is you're\n\n211\n00:10:18.382 --> 00:10:21.016\nonly designing in the top left one.\n\n212\n00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:26.720\nAnd anything that you do in this one,\nthen populates to the rest of them.\n\n213\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.727\nAnd notice that it's already\nputting in this next record.\n\n214\n00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:33.330\nRemember, the data source that we\ntalked about that we are going to have\n\n215\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.836\nmultiple rows, or in this case, records,\nin that tabular format that's just saying,\n\n216\n00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:41.570\nokay, go to the next one,\ngo to the next one, go to the next one.\n\n217\n00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.777\nSo this is where we're\ngoing to now go ahead and\n\n218\n00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:46.834\nput in well wait first we've got\nto connect to our data source and\n\n219\n00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:49.284\nthen we're going to go ahead and\nput in our fields.\n\n220\n00:10:49.284 --> 00:10:50.934\nSo let's go ahead and\nselect those recipients.\n\n221\n00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:51.749\nSo that would be the next step.\n\n222\n00:10:51.749 --> 00:10:57.470\nAgain those steps are designated in\nthe other episode if you're looking.\n\n223\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.680\nFind the episode notes for\n\n224\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.070\nthe mail merge, and that'll help refer\nto what I'm saying as they steps.\n\n225\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.770\nWe'll go to using the existing list.\n\n226\n00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:11.350\nWe will go out on to my desktop and\ngo into this particular folder that\n\n227\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.960\nhas my, there it is, department and\naddresses Excel file.\n\n228\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.620\nWe know that wonderful,\nlittle warning that says like, hey,\n\n229\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.120\nyou got to convert it and\njust got to click OK.\n\n230\n00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.380\nMore details on that last episode\nif you wanna longer explanation,\n\n231\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.509\nor just click OK.\n\n232\n00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:30.732\nOkay?\nAnd we'll wait, and we are spinning,and\n\n233\n00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:35.140\nthis is circular right there too.\n&gt;&gt;
