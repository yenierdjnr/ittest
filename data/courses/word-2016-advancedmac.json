Mac.\n\n3\n00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.900\nIn this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.090\nwe're going to be covering exactly\nwhat is in this particular course.\n\n5\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.460\nWho is the target audience,\nwho is this made for?\n\n6\n00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.880\nWhat do we need to know about\nbefore we get started, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.380\nany tip bits of information\nthat we have extra?\n\n8\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.110\nIn this course, there are two main topics.\n\n9\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.960\nThere is the graphical elements and\nautomation.\n\n10\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.235\nSo this is where we're going to be\nfocusing on those elements that,\n\n11\n00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.860\nwell are graphics, things like images.\n\n12\n00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.980\nWe're gonna talk about how you can\nput images into your document,\n\n13\n00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.470\nall about the important textwrap, and\neven a little bit of document and\n\n14\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.190\nimage resolutions and\nhow you should kind of be aware\n\n15\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.600\nof the sizes of your images when you go\nahead and place them into your Word files.\n\n16\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.300\nWe're also going to be getting into\nshapes and how to format them,\n\n17\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.310\nhow to make them,\nhow to make them different colors,\n\n18\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.380\nand talk about all the fun stuff\nyou can do with the styles.\n\n19\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.900\nWe're going to talk\nabout SmartArt as well.\n\n20\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.765\nI love me some SmartArt.\n\n21\n00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:14.045\nIt's a nice way to be able to display\nyour information in a graphical manner.\n\n22\n00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.960\nGive a little bit more oomph to that\ninformation within your Word documents and\n\n23\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.350\nyour different reports where\nthings like org charts and\n\n24\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.620\ndifferent ways that you want to\ndemonstrate cycles or diagrams.\n\n25\n00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.210\nThat would be what we have for SmartArt.\n\n26\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.310\nWe're also going to be\ngetting into tables.\n\n27\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.140\nTables is where you go ahead and organize\ninformation into rows and columns.\n\n28\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.060\nYou might think, hm tables don't seem\nlike images and graphics, but it\n\n29\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.910\nis that graphical element of a different\nway of representing that information.\n\n30\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.920\nAnd how it works differently in a table\nformat and how that table interacts\n\n31\n00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.525\nlike a graphical element within\nthe rest of your document.\n\n32\n00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:01.555\nWe'll also be getting into charts\nwhere we will be making some\n\n33\n00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.195\nclustered column charts.\n\n34\n00:02:03.195 --> 00:02:05.195\nWe'll be making some pie charts and\n\n35\n00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:08.875\njust understanding the foundations\nof charts because there's a lot of\n\n36\n00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.385\nterminology that is associated with\ncharts that it kind of throws people off.\n\n37\n00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:15.895\nSo we really kind of start at\na foundational level and then go ahead and\n\n38\n00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:19.150\ninsert as another graphical element.\n\n39\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.900\nLet me get into automation.\n\n40\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.500\nThese are things to help make your working\nin Word faster and more efficient.\n\n41\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.918\nI'm going to start with templates.\n\n42\n00:02:28.918 --> 00:02:34.280\nEverybody loves templates but I feel\nthat people kinda use the terminology\n\n43\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.780\na little bit, well, not exactly how\nyou're suppose to use it in Word.\n\n44\n00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.430\nSo we clarify what\nexactly is a template and\n\n45\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.350\nhow to correctly use a template in Word.\n\n46\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.060\nWe also get into macros.\n\n47\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.910\nHow you can record your steps and\nbe able to play them back.\n\n48\n00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.786\nThat can really take the time that it\nwould do for multiple steps just kinda\n\n49\n00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:57.740\nput it all into one little clickable\nbutton and be able to run that anyways.\n\n50\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.736\nBut of course, there are some down sides,\n\n51\n00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:05.481\nsome security issues that we need\nto cover within those episodes and\n\n52\n00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:11.500\nwe do a good job of letting you know how\nto be safe with your macros in using Word.\n\n53\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.040\nGet into some linked objects\nabout putting in some Excel\n\n54\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.400\ndata into your Word document, how you can\nlink back to that particular file, and\n\n55\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.150\nall the nuances that are with that.\n\n56\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.300\nAnd then we get into\nthe ever popular mail merge.\n\n57\n00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.260\nWe go into making some\ndifferent letters and\n\n58\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.410\nwe do labels and\nenvelopes and lots of fun.\n\n59\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.160\nSo who is this for?\n\n60\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.190\nAll Office users with a capital O, meaning\nthat this is for the Office 365 users.\n\n61\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.382\nIt doesn't matter if you're in a physical\noffice or if you're at a home office or\n\n62\n00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:47.200\njust, you know,\nyou're in your living room.\n\n63\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.690\nSo that's why we have\nthat capital O there.\n\n64\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.676\nAnd I call this the upper\nbasics to advanced level.\n\n65\n00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:56.934\nSo this is where,\nkind of going into that prerequisites,\n\n66\n00:03:56.934 --> 00:04:01.530\nyou're gonna need to have a little bit\nof a foundational knowledge of Word.\n\n67\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.360\nWe have the Word Essentials series, so\n\n68\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.830\nthat is more like a precursor\nto this particular course.\n\n69\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.230\nSo things like you need to know\nabout like what is a style.\n\n70\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.460\nYou need to know about page layout,\nhow to select text, how to format text.\n\n71\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.690\nAll of those kind of foundations\nof Word would be very helpful for\n\n72\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.190\nthis particular series.\n\n73\n00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.150\nThen you do need to know a little bit\nabout your Macintosh operating system,\n\n74\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.900\nunderstanding what the Finder is.\n\n75\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.650\nWe do get into a little bit more\nof a keyboard shortcuts in this\n\n76\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.160\nparticular series, so\njust having familiarity with that.\n\n77\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.580\nAnd, of course,\nbeing familiar with other Office products.\n\n78\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.390\nWe will be talking\na little bit about Excel.\n\n79\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.210\nIf you've never used Excel,\n\n80\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.610\nyou might wanna watch a show that we\nhave in our course library about that.\n\n81\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.330\nBut knowing one helps with other Office\nproducts, so that's always a good thing.\n\n82\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.420\nWe do have exercise files and\nepisode notes that accompany every single\n\n83\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.190\none of these particular videos that\nyou're going to be watching, so\n\n84\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.860\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n85\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.090\nThey should all be available to you\nright here within this course overview.\n\n86\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.740\nMeaning, all of the exercise files for\n\n87\n00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.040\nevery episode within this show,\nso check that out.\n\n88\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.760\nAnd if they're ever missing or if I'm\nreferring to a file that's not in that,\n\n89\n00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.910\nlet us know.\n\n90\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.320\nWe need to know and make sure that we\nhave all of our ducks in a row for\n\n91\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.900\nyou guys to be able to follow along\nwith me and have lots of fun.\n\n92\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.210\nAnd talking about fun,\nwe have some extras.\n\n93\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.910\nThis is always something I talk\nabout in all of my course overviews,\n\n94\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.730\nis there's always other options.\n\n95\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.500\nThere's a whole bunch of\nways to do things in Word,\n\n96\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.206\nso if I haven't covered all of them,\nthere's a lot of them.\n\n97\n00:05:43.206 --> 00:05:48.210\nUpdates do happen and different versions,\nbeing that this is an Office\n\n98\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.300\n365 product and is always updating,\nyou might be on an older version or\n\n99\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.990\na younger version than\nthe one that I'm using.\n\n100\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.000\nSo definitely check that out,\n\n101\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.610\nyou can always see if you need to\nhave updates from your Help menu.\n\n102\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.398\nAnd you can always check out\nwhat version of a product\n\n103\n00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:10.219\nthat you're using through your\naccount settings in the home tab or\n\n104\n00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.833\nthe backstage view when\nyou go into the file menu,\n\n105\n00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:19.374\nyou should have some options there to\nshow exactly what version you're on.\n\n106\n00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:23.061\nBecause that may make a difference as\nto what you're seeing on your screen\n\n107\n00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:25.030\nversus what I'm showing on my screen.\n\n108\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.930\nAlways searching for answers.\n\n109\n00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.280\nThe internet is a wealth\nof information out there.\n\n110\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.360\nI do reference a lot of the Microsoft\nhelp files within the notes.\n\n111\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.670\nThat should be a good place to start.\n\n112\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.070\nBut do some searches on your own to\nget those answers that you might need.\n\n113\n00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.310\nEverybody uses these products differently.\n\n114\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.030\nSo maybe you're really interested in mail\nmerge, well we have some episodes on that.\n\n115\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.590\nMaybe you don't really use charts but\nit's always good to know\n\n116\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.820\nthat it's available and you never know\ndown the road when you might need that.\n\n117\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.020\nAnd always have fun.\n\n118\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.460\nI know it can be frustrating sometimes\nwhen you're trying to figure out like why\n\n119\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.600\ndoesn't this chart wanna move around.\n\n120\n00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.170\nWell, we got that wordwrap on it.\n\n121\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.990\nBut just remember to just kinda, while\nwe're learning, have some fun in here.\n\n122\n00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.280\nWe like to have fun and I hope you do too.\n\n123\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.039\nAnd I will see you in\nsome future episodes.\n\n124\n00:07:11.039 -->
