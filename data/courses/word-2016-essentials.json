name is Vonne Smith and\nthis is the Word 2016 Essentials show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:18.445\nI'm going to be your guide through\nthis journey In Microsoft Word.\n\n5\n00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:20.130\nIn this course overview,\n\n6\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.579\nwe're gonna be going over what\nexactly are we covering in this show?\n\n7\n00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.542\nWho is this for?\n\n8\n00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:28.302\nWhat do I need to know\nbefore I get started?\n\n9\n00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:33.012\nAnd what other extra helpful\ntips that I might have for you?\n\n10\n00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:37.311\nThis particular show is built\ninto three specific areas.\n\n11\n00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:41.750\nWe have our introduction,\nour text formatting and our page layout.\n\n12\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.430\nIn the introduction section,\nthat's where we start from the very,\n\n13\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.344\nvery beginning about what is Word.\n\n14\n00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:48.648\nWhat about the document views?\n\n15\n00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:53.091\nWhat does it mean to be in Print Layout\nversus the Reading Layout?\n\n16\n00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:54.458\nWhat about the Word interface?\n\n17\n00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:55.189\nWhat's a ribbon?\n\n18\n00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.420\nWhat's a Quick Access Toolbar?\n\n19\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.844\nWhere is it located?\n\n20\n00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:00.760\nSo getting familiar with our environment,\n\n21\n00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.270\nhow to navigate around the document and\nalso how to input text.\n\n22\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.910\nDaniel and I get to geek out really\nhard on input and output devices\n\n23\n00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.730\non that episode, so definitely check it\nout, it's definitely one of my favorites.\n\n24\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.920\nWe'll also be going over some of\nthe things that Word does by default with\n\n25\n00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380\nour autocorrect options.\n\n26\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.820\nWe'll do our find and replace, and some\nproofing and some printing, and of course,\n\n27\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.600\ndon't forget, good old copy and paste.\n\n28\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.840\nIn the text formatting section,\nthat's where we start getting into making\n\n29\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.010\nour text look nice, looks a little\nprettier, maybe we'll throw in some pink,\n\n30\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.110\nmaybe we'll make things centered or\nright-aligned.\n\n31\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.330\nLearn all about the world of tab stops.\n\n32\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.534\nWe'll be learning how to\nformat things in lists,\n\n33\n00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.826\nand the all important styles,\nI love styles.\n\n34\n00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:48.537\nThat's another one of my favorite\nepisodes within this series,\n\n35\n00:01:48.537 --> 00:01:51.101\nbecause so\nmuch in Word is based on styles, so\n\n36\n00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:56.350\nhaving a good understanding of styles will\nmake you a very effective user of Word.\n\n37\n00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.487\nThen we move in to the page\nlayout section of our show,\n\n38\n00:01:59.487 --> 00:02:02.435\nwhere we get into things like margins,\ncolumns.\n\n39\n00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:06.929\nWe get into page numbers, headers and\nfooters, what it means to have a cover\n\n40\n00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.005\npage, vertical alignment, and\nthe all important keep options, so\n\n41\n00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:14.540\ndifferent ways of putting in\nsections into our documents.\n\n42\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.310\nAnother thing that Word does so well,\nand that can open up the world of\n\n43\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.989\npossibilities to you, understanding\nwhat a section can do for you.\n\n44\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.061\nWho is this for?\n\n45\n00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.320\nThis is for all Office users.\n\n46\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.074\nNow, when I use the word office,\n\n47\n00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:33.409\nI'm not saying that you have to be in an\noffice environment, you could be at home.\n\n48\n00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.760\nIt doesn't matter where you\nphysically are located.\n\n49\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.780\nIt's really that you want to become\na better user of Office products,\n\n50\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.430\nsuch as Word.\n\n51\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.490\nThis is a very basic introduction to Word,\nso it starts at the beginning, but\n\n52\n00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.080\nit does gradually move up in\nlevel to probably, I would say,\n\n53\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.320\nan intermediate level of Word.\n\n54\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.880\nNow that doesn't mean say hey,\nI've been using Word for a while so\n\n55\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.870\nyou should skip this show.\n\n56\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.673\nNo, there's a lot of different tips and\n\n57\n00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:07.786\ntricks throughout these lessons that\nwill really help any level of user,\n\n58\n00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:12.083\nbut it does start at the very\nbeginning and we go up from there.\n\n59\n00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:13.630\nWhat do I need to know?\n\n60\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.437\nWell you don't really\nneed to know anything.\n\n61\n00:03:15.437 --> 00:03:19.725\nYou don't have to have any prior\nknowledge of this particular product, but\n\n62\n00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:25.050\nif you have some familiarity with other\nOffice products, It will help you out.\n\n63\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.030\nNotice on basic Windows operating system\nfunctionalities like where is the Start\n\n64\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.493\nbutton, what is the Windows Explorer?\n\n65\n00:03:32.493 --> 00:03:37.245\nThose are some things that can also help\nyou to be a little bit more acclimated to\n\n66\n00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:39.190\nsome of the things in the show.\n\n67\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.690\nHowever, I do have in one of our first\nlessons, in the introduction section,\n\n68\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.230\nwhere we do go over things like file open,\nfile save, how to close a file,\n\n69\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.390\nhow to close a program, and\nwhere to find Word within your Start menu.\n\n70\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.360\nSo we do start with some of\nthe Windows basics within this series,\n\n71\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.140\nbecause I feel Word is such an important\nproduct and a real starting place for\n\n72\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.170\na lot of people when working\nwithin the Office Suite.\n\n73\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.109\nSo I do like to go ahead and\ncover some of those basics.\n\n74\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.770\nWhat do you need to know about as well,\nbesides all these other things,\n\n75\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.580\nsome extra tidbits?\n\n76\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.330\nThere's always other options\nto do anything in Word or\n\n77\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.340\nany of the Office applications.\n\n78\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.360\nSo I might hit a couple of them of how to\nhit it on the ribbon, maybe go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.820\ndo a right-click, but there might be\nthree or four other ways to go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.600\nget the same result by doing\nit in a different way.\n\n81\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.230\nThere's so\n\n82\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.340\nmany different things within this product,\nyou can never know everything.\n\n83\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.120\nSo, searching for answers is always\nhelpful, I do it, I still do it.\n\n84\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.491\nI learn more about these products\nevery day and using those guides and\n\n85\n00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:51.837\nusing your Google or your Bing searches to\nfind the answers, can be really helpful,\n\n86\n00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:56.833\nand also the Microsoft help files online\nare actually really helpful for you.\n\n87\n00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.814\nAnd updates, hey they happen.\n\n88\n00:04:58.814 --> 00:05:01.364\nThere are different versions of Word and\n\n89\n00:05:01.364 --> 00:05:06.315\nbeing on an Office 365 subscription,\nyou might have a slight difference in\n\n90\n00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:11.470\nwhat your environment is looking like\nthat might be different than mine.\n\n91\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.277\nAnd you might walk in one day,\nand like, what happened, updates.\n\n92\n00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:19.216\nSo, they're on either like a single\nmonth or a four month cycle,\n\n93\n00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:22.381\ndepending on your organization and\nyour settings.\n\n94\n00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:26.451\nOr, if you have a version of Office\nthat you have purchased separately,\n\n95\n00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:31.070\nthat is not part of a subscription,\nyou might not ever have any updates.\n\n96\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.460\nSo, there might be some\nslight variations in that.\n\n97\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.850\nEvery user uses Word for a different\nreason, some might be doing book\n\n98\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.780\nprocessing, some of you might\nbe doing single page processing.\n\n99\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.950\nEverybody has different reasons for\nusing the product.\n\n100\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.270\nEverybody is unique in that sense.\n\n101\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.570\nYou start to have like a one-on-one\nrelationship with your product,\n\n102\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.550\nthat might be different than the way\nthat somebody else uses Word.\n\n103\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.190\nSo you might be talking one\nday to somebody in the office,\n\n104\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.060\nlike, you should really do this,\nbecause that's the way I do it.\n\n105\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.260\nThat's fine, to each his own,\neverybody has a reason for\n\n106\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260\ndoing what they have and the biggest\npart is really just to have fun.\n\n107\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.630\nI know that these things can\nstart getting frustrating,\n\n108\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.370\nI've had those moments where I'm\njust like why is this not working?\n\n109\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.740\nBut just remember to kind of sit back and\nespecially just watching these episodes,\n\n110\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.330\njust to have fun try it out,\nbecause that's the easiest way to start\n\n111\n00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:30.015\nbeing a master at any of these products,\nis you just gotta try it.\n\n112\n00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:32.445\nNot with a work document.\n\n113\n00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:33.645\nJust what can I do?\n\n114\n00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:35.085\nHow can I make this work?\n\n115\n00:06:35.085 --> 00:06:40.025\nAnd that's where you can really start\nto feel like you've got this program\n\n116\n00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:40.845\nunder wraps.\n\n117\n00:06:40.845 --> 00:06:42.097\nSo, definitely have some fun.\n\n118\n00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:45.048\nSo, I hope to see you soon,\nand enjoy all the episodes.\n\n119\n00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:48.504\n[SOUND]\n\n",
