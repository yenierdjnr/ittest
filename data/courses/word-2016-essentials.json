name is Vonne Smith and\nthis is the Word 2016 Essentials show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:18.445\nI'm going to be your guide through\nthis journey In Microsoft Word.\n\n5\n00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:20.130\nIn this course overview,\n\n6\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.579\nwe're gonna be going over what\nexactly are we covering in this show?\n\n7\n00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.542\nWho is this for?\n\n8\n00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:28.302\nWhat do I need to know\nbefore I get started?\n\n9\n00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:33.012\nAnd what other extra helpful\ntips that I might have for you?\n\n10\n00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:37.311\nThis particular show is built\ninto three specific areas.\n\n11\n00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:41.750\nWe have our introduction,\nour text formatting and our page layout.\n\n12\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.430\nIn the introduction section,\nthat's where we start from the very,\n\n13\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.344\nvery beginning about what is Word.\n\n14\n00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:48.648\nWhat about the document views?\n\n15\n00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:53.091\nWhat does it mean to be in Print Layout\nversus the Reading Layout?\n\n16\n00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:54.458\nWhat about the Word interface?\n\n17\n00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:55.189\nWhat's a ribbon?\n\n18\n00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.420\nWhat's a Quick Access Toolbar?\n\n19\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.844\nWhere is it located?\n\n20\n00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:00.760\nSo getting familiar with our environment,\n\n21\n00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.270\nhow to navigate around the document and\nalso how to input text.\n\n22\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.910\nDaniel and I get to geek out really\nhard on input and output devices\n\n23\n00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.730\non that episode, so definitely check it\nout, it's definitely one of my favorites.\n\n24\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.920\nWe'll also be going over some of\nthe things that Word does by default with\n\n25\n00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380\nour autocorrect options.\n\n26\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.820\nWe'll do our find and replace, and some\nproofing and some printing, and of course,\n\n27\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.600\ndon't forget, good old copy and paste.\n\n28\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.840\nIn the text formatting section,\nthat's where we start getting into making\n\n29\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.010\nour text look nice, looks a little\nprettier, maybe we'll throw in some pink,\n\n30\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.110\nmaybe we'll make things centered or\nright-aligned.\n\n31\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.330\nLearn all about the world of tab stops.\n\n32\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.534\nWe'll be learning how to\nformat things in lists,\n\n33\n00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.826\nand the all important styles,\nI love styles.\n\n34\n00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:48.537\nThat's another one of my favorite\nepisodes within this series,\n\n35\n00:01:48.537 --> 00:01:51.101\nbecause so\nmuch in Word is based on styles, so\n\n36\n00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:56.350\nhaving a good understanding of styles will\nmake you a very effective user of Word.\n\n37\n00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.487\nThen we move in to the page\nlayout section of our show,\n\n38\n00:01:59.487 --> 00:02:02.435\nwhere we get into things like margins,\ncolumns.\n\n39\n00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:06.929\nWe get into page numbers, headers and\nfooters, what it means to have a cover\n\n40\n00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.005\npage, vertical alignment, and\nthe all important keep options, so\n\n41\n00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:14.540\ndifferent ways of putting in\nsections into our documents.\n\n42\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.310\nAnother thing that Word does so well,\nand that can open up the world of\n\n43\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.989\npossibilities to you, understanding\nwhat a section can do for you.\n\n44\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.061\nWho is this for?\n\n45\n00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.320\nThis is for all Office users.\n\n46\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.074\nNow, when I use the word office,\n\n47\n00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:33.409\nI'm not saying that you have to be in an\noffice environment, you could be at home.\n\n48\n00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.760\nIt doesn't matter where you\nphysically are located.\n\n49\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.780\nIt's really that you want to become\na better user of Office products,\n\n50\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.430\nsuch as Word.\n\n51\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.490\nThis is a very basic introduction to Word,\nso it starts at the beginning, but\n\n52\n00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.080\nit does gradually move up in\nlevel to probably, I would say,\n\n53\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.320\nan intermediate level of Word.\n\n54\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.880\nNow that doesn't mean say hey,\nI've been using Word for a while so\n\n55\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.870\nyou should skip this show.\n\n56\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.673\nNo, there's a lot of different tips and\n\n57\n00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:07.786\ntricks throughout these lessons that\nwill really help any level of user,\n\n58\n00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:12.083\nbut it does start at the very\nbeginning and we go up from there.\n\n59\n00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:13.630\nWhat do I need to know?\n\n60\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.437\nWell you don't really\nneed to know anything.\n\n61\n00:03:15.437 --> 00:03:19.725\nYou don't have to have any prior\nknowledge of this particular product, but\n\n62\n00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:25.050\nif you have some familiarity with other\nOffice products, It will help you out.\n\n63\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.030\nNotice on basic Windows operating system\nfunctionalities like where is the Start\n\n64\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.493\nbutton, what is the Windows Explorer?\n\n65\n00:03:32.493 --> 00:03:37.245\nThose are some things that can also help\nyou to be a little bit more acclimated to\n\n66\n00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:39.190\nsome of the things in the show.\n\n67\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.690\nHowever, I do have in one of our first\nlessons, in the introduction section,\n\n68\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.230\nwhere we do go over things like file open,\nfile save, how to close a file,\n\n69\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.390\nhow to close a program, and\nwhere to find Word within your Start menu.\n\n70\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.360\nSo we do start with some of\nthe Windows basics within this series,\n\n71\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.140\nbecause I feel Word is such an important\nproduct and a real starting place for\n\n72\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.170\na lot of people when working\nwithin the Office Suite.\n\n73\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.109\nSo I do like to go ahead and\ncover some of those basics.\n\n74\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.770\nWhat do you need to know about as well,\nbesides all these other things,\n\n75\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.580\nsome extra tidbits?\n\n76\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.330\nThere's always other options\nto do anything in Word or\n\n77\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.340\nany of the Office applications.\n\n78\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.360\nSo I might hit a couple of them of how to\nhit it on the ribbon, maybe go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.820\ndo a right-click, but there might be\nthree or four other ways to go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.600\nget the same result by doing\nit in a different way.\n\n81\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.230\nThere's so\n\n82\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.340\nmany different things within this product,\nyou can never know everything.\n\n83\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.120\nSo, searching for answers is always\nhelpful, I do it, I still do it.\n\n84\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.491\nI learn more about these products\nevery day and using those guides and\n\n85\n00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:51.837\nusing your Google or your Bing searches to\nfind the answers, can be really helpful,\n\n86\n00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:56.833\nand also the Microsoft help files online\nare actually really helpful for you.\n\n87\n00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.814\nAnd updates, hey they happen.\n\n88\n00:04:58.814 --> 00:05:01.364\nThere are different versions of Word and\n\n89\n00:05:01.364 --> 00:05:06.315\nbeing on an Office 365 subscription,\nyou might have a slight difference in\n\n90\n00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:11.470\nwhat your environment is looking like\nthat might be different than mine.\n\n91\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.277\nAnd you might walk in one day,\nand like, what happened, updates.\n\n92\n00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:19.216\nSo, they're on either like a single\nmonth or a four month cycle,\n\n93\n00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:22.381\ndepending on your organization and\nyour settings.\n\n94\n00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:26.451\nOr, if you have a version of Office\nthat you have purchased separately,\n\n95\n00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:31.070\nthat is not part of a subscription,\nyou might not ever have any updates.\n\n96\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.460\nSo, there might be some\nslight variations in that.\n\n97\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.850\nEvery user uses Word for a different\nreason, some might be doing book\n\n98\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.780\nprocessing, some of you might\nbe doing single page processing.\n\n99\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.950\nEverybody has different reasons for\nusing the product.\n\n100\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.270\nEverybody is unique in that sense.\n\n101\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.570\nYou start to have like a one-on-one\nrelationship with your product,\n\n102\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.550\nthat might be different than the way\nthat somebody else uses Word.\n\n103\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.190\nSo you might be talking one\nday to somebody in the office,\n\n104\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.060\nlike, you should really do this,\nbecause that's the way I do it.\n\n105\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.260\nThat's fine, to each his own,\neverybody has a reason for\n\n106\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260\ndoing what they have and the biggest\npart is really just to have fun.\n\n107\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.630\nI know that these things can\nstart getting frustrating,\n\n108\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.370\nI've had those moments where I'm\njust like why is this not working?\n\n109\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.740\nBut just remember to kind of sit back and\nespecially just watching these episodes,\n\n110\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.330\njust to have fun try it out,\nbecause that's the easiest way to start\n\n111\n00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:30.015\nbeing a master at any of these products,\nis you just gotta try it.\n\n112\n00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:32.445\nNot with a work document.\n\n113\n00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:33.645\nJust what can I do?\n\n114\n00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:35.085\nHow can I make this work?\n\n115\n00:06:35.085 --> 00:06:40.025\nAnd that's where you can really start\nto feel like you've got this program\n\n116\n00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:40.845\nunder wraps.\n\n117\n00:06:40.845 --> 00:06:42.097\nSo, definitely have some fun.\n\n118\n00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:45.048\nSo, I hope to see you soon,\nand enjoy all the episodes.\n\n119\n00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:48.504\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Hello, [LAUGH] welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.500\nYes, we're here to just\nstart at the beginning,\n\n13\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.990\nbecause I don't like to assume anything.\n\n14\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.562\nLike maybe you don't\neven know what Word does.\n\n15\n00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:44.190\nWhere does it come from?\n\n16\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.210\nWhat does it do?\n\n17\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.324\nSo this is what this episode is all\nabout is just giving us our very\n\n18\n00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:50.121\nfirst introduction to the product.\n\n19\n00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:52.860\nAnd also talk a little\nbit about our set up.\n\n20\n00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.410\nNow, I have a little PowerPoint\npresentation ready to go for us.\n\n21\n00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.411\nSo why don't we just come on in and\nlet's start.\n\n22\n00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:00.880\nSo well, what is Word?\n\n23\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n24\n00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.650\n&gt;&gt; It is, and that's why we're\nstarting at our beginning.\n\n25\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.180\nWell, Word is a word\nprocessing application.\n\n26\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.100\nSo we're using the same word in\nthe definition to describe the word.\n\n27\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow,\n\n28\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.180\nhow many times can we say that?\n\n29\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.455\nWord, Word, Word.\n\n30\n00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:21.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As many times as a 1990s song said it.\n\n31\n00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:24.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So apparently it can be said a lot.\n\n32\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.941\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so\nwhen we're talking about an application.\n\n33\n00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:31.866\nAn application it really means\njust a piece of software,\n\n34\n00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:35.870\nit is a program, it is an application so\nyou see these words\n\n35\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.180\ninterchangeable when you're talking\nabout anything in a computer.\n\n36\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.100\nFor example, Word as an application,\nWord as piece of software.\n\n37\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.190\nExcel is a program.\n\n38\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.350\nOutlook is an application.\n\n39\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.750\nSo you have those different ways\nthat we can go ahead and use that.\n\n40\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.326\nAnd you are creating documents\nin the Microsoft Word 2016.\n\n41\n00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:03.720\nIf you were using PowerPoint,\nyou would be creating presentations.\n\n42\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.180\nIf you were creating, if you were using\nExcel, you would be creating spreadsheets.\n\n43\n00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.221\nAnd so that is the terminology\nthat Microsoft uses to associate\n\n44\n00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:19.180\nitself with the different\nproducts within the Office Suite.\n\n45\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.960\nNow, Word can be used for short and\nlong document processing and layout.\n\n46\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.310\nThe world layout is behind my head.\n\n47\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.510\nI forgot to move some of the words around\nwithin this introductory PowerPoint to\n\n48\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.585\naccommodate my beautiful face.\n\n49\n00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n50\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.310\n&gt;&gt; So there's lots of different\nways you can do this.\n\n51\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.420\nMaybe you want to create a cute\nlittle certificate of completion and\n\n52\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.800\ngive out little awards at the end\nof the work week or most improved.\n\n53\n00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.991\nOr if you're running a camp for children\nand you're like complete your alphabet.\n\n54\n00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:51.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:53.268\n&gt;&gt; Those types of things.\n\n56\n00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:58.280\nSo you can use it for single page\ndocument processing, or you can do long.\n\n57\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.710\nMaybe you wanna write a book and\nyou wanna write a script.\n\n58\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.230\nThis would be where you would come in and\nstart typing away.\n\n59\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.130\nJust like we had in the old days,\nwe had typewriters,\n\n60\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.860\nyou put a piece of paper in it.\n\n61\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.000\nThis is just your electronic typewriter,\nreally.\n\n62\n00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.050\nSo let's move on to the next slide.\n\n63\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.190\nThis is, as I mentioned, part of\nthe Office 365 suite of applications.\n\n64\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.860\nNow, this is where you could have multiple\n\n65\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.615\nprograms within your\nsubscription to the Office\n\n66\n00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:35.850\n365 applications,\nthat you would then pay a monthly fee or\n\n67\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.160\nmaybe like a one time annual fee to be\nable to have it as subscription based.\n\n68\n00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.920\nNow, there are many different types of\nproduct plans that are available for\n\n69\n00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.400\nthe Office 365 subscription model.\n\n70\n00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.470\nYou have the ones for home or business.\n\n71\n00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.210\nThen you have the enterprise levels,\n\n72\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.220\nwhen you get into the large volume\nlicensings for enterprise corporations.\n\n73\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.920\nSo, you might have all sorts of\ndifferent ways that you could be able to\n\n74\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.970\nacquire this in\nthe subscription-based model, but\n\n75\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.480\nI would say that Word is pretty much,\nwhoops that's the wrong way.\n\n76\n00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.100\nCuz running our back in our slides.\n\n77\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.676\nWord is like the cornerstone really\nof the Office Suite of applications.\n\n78\n00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:19.639\nAnd it's always like,\n\n79\n00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.685\nI don't know, to me it's always like\nthe first one you always talk about.\n\n80\n00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:27.555\nIt's always the first one that people\nassociate itself with the Office,\n\n81\n00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:30.705\nbecause it's actually been around for\nquite sometime.\n\n82\n00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:37.175\nAnd so the kind of big ones the Word,\nPowerPoint, I'll say Excel.\n\n83\n00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:42.065\nThose three are probably the most\nwidely used Office application.\n\n84\n00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:46.364\nBut as you can see on the slide there are\nsome other ones maybe Visio, or Project,\n\n85\n00:04:46.364 --> 00:04:47.198\nor Publisher.\n\n86\n00:04:47.198 --> 00:04:49.000\nIf you're like,\nI've never even heard of those.\n\n87\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.280\nThat's okay,\nthat's alright that you haven't.\n\n88\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.270\nBut, there are a lots of\ndifferent types of products or\n\n89\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.930\napplications in the subscription.\n\n90\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.840\nDepending on the level or the product\nplan, subscription plan that you get or\n\n91\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.210\nyou purchase for yourself.\n\n92\n00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.157\nOr maybe someone purchases it for you.\n\n93\n00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:09.502\nYou come into an organization,\nwhat level do you have?\n\n94\n00:05:09.502 --> 00:05:12.676\nAnd the other thing back on the,\nI keep going the wrong way,\n\n95\n00:05:12.676 --> 00:05:14.600\n[LAUGH] on these applications.\n\n96\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.854\nSome of them are PC only.\n\n97\n00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:21.816\nYou do not have, I believe,\naccess for Mac and I don't think\n\n98\n00:05:21.816 --> 00:05:26.895\nyou have publisher for Mac,\nif I'm remembering correctly.\n\n99\n00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:30.985\nSo there are some that are very\nspecific on that platform level.\n\n100\n00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:35.105\nThis is a little side note over here\non the right hand side the sway, teams,\n\n101\n00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:37.255\nSharePoint, Lync, Skye for Business.\n\n102\n00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:39.425\nThese would I would call them services.\n\n103\n00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:41.685\nIs that what you would be a correct\nterminology to use there Ronnie?\n\n104\n00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:45.990\n&gt;&gt; It would if you're part of Office\n365 depending upon your subscription.\n\n105\n00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.240\nYou may have additional services\nthat may come along with your\n\n106\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.980\nOffice 365 subscription.\n\n107\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.290\nSo even though you have access to these\nbasic programs, I shouldn't say basic,\n\n108\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.200\nfundamental programs like,\nof course, Word and Excel.\n\n109\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.840\nThese are other things that your\nbusiness may find very useful.\n\n110\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.450\nAnd it's just part of that program.\n\n111\n00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.872\n&gt;&gt; And it's not necessarily software\nthat you install on your computer,\n\n112\n00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:09.983\nit's a service.\n\n113\n00:06:09.983 --> 00:06:14.592\nAnd most likely it's going to be in\na cloud environment where you're\n\n114\n00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:16.660\ngoing into a browser.\n\n115\n00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.550\nAnd going into the SharePoint sites.\n\n116\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.725\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then how your,\n\n117\n00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:22.135\nnow your programs may\nconnect to a SharePoint site.\n\n118\n00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:26.596\nBut that's why we use the terminology\nof services rather than\n\n119\n00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:30.900\napplications that you would\nrun on your computer.\n\n120\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.869\nWe've seen this slide a couple times.\n\n121\n00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:36.004\nI've gone back and forth a few times, but\n\n122\n00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:43.566\nI did wanna point out that you could\nstill purchase a single license of Word,\n\n123\n00:06:43.566 --> 00:06:49.020\nbuy itself without\nthe suite if you wanted to.\n\n124\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.060\nOr you could purchase the suite without\nbeing as part of the subscription.\n\n125\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.870\nIt's one of those like I buy it for one\ntime, I install it, and then that's it.\n\n126\n00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.935\nAnd that's the way that all of the Office\nproducts have been working on for\n\n127\n00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:06.544\nmany, many years before\nOffice 365 came along.\n\n128\n00:07:06.544 --> 00:07:11.274\nI know it was 2013, but\nI think they were still starting to get\n\n129\n00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:14.900\ninto Office 365 at that point,\nright Ronnie?\n\n130\n00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.708\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nIt was around again even in 2010.\n\n131\n00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:22.477\nYou had a little bit of it, but with the\ncloud development that we had out there,\n\n132\n00:07:22.477 --> 00:07:27.993\nthis is a much easier management model for\nthose particular applications,\n\n133\n00:07:27.993 --> 00:07:32.560\nbecause it means that they\nfight piracy very easily now.\n\n134\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.240\nInstead of limiting you to one install,\nthey give you five installs,\n\n135\n00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.780\nif you purchase it though Office 365 and\ndon't care whose computer you put it on.\n\n136\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.742\nBut then you can also decide to\ntake that away if you want to,\n\n137\n00:07:43.742 --> 00:07:46.727\nall through just a web management\nplatform is what it does.\n\n138\n00:07:46.727 --> 00:07:50.859\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the nice thing,\nif you think about the different versions\n\n139\n00:07:50.859 --> 00:07:55.488\nthat we've had in Word, and I do have\na slide that will be coming up, you had,\n\n140\n00:07:55.488 --> 00:08:00.495\nwe're going way back, you had Office,\nthere was a 2002, and then 2003.\n\n141\n00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:04.403\nAnd then you had to wait all the way\nuntil 2007 to the next update of where,\n\n142\n00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:06.890\nwhat's the new things\nthat's going on in here.\n\n143\n00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.410\nWell, on a subscription-based model,\nif you want to purchase it in that way.\n\n144\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.440\nIt's going to be incrementally\ndoing updates for you.\n\n145\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.146\nAnd so that's something that you might\nwanna just pay attention to as well.\n\n146\n00:08:19.146 --> 00:08:24.290\nMaybe at the time of this recording\nI have whatever version build I had.\n\n147\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.562\nAnd there are places\nwhere you can find it and\n\n148\n00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:30.620\nthere's an information on here that'll\ntell you is that I had that version but\n\n149\n00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.392\nmaybe six months from now, they might\nhave a few extra buttons in there.\n\n150\n00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:38.594\nAnd they've added some new thing on the\ninsert tab, we're like, well that's new,\n\n151\n00:08:38.594 --> 00:08:40.260\nwhere did that come from.\n\n152\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.121\nWell, on that subscription based model\nit's gonna give you those little kind of\n\n153\n00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:45.274\nbumps if you wanna say.\n\n154\n00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:48.720\nAnd a lot of your applications\nare going to this model.\n\n155\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.970\nI know Adobe products are like that, but\n\n156\n00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:56.090\nyou can still buy it\nsingularly If you want to.\n\n157\n00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.510\nOf course,\nthey're going to promote Office 365.\n\n158\n00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.290\nThey're gonna give you\nthat as your first choice.\n\n159\n00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.686\nYou don't have to dig a little bit for\nit, but\n\n160\n00:09:03.686 --> 00:09:05.777\nwhere you actually bought the CD-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n161\n00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:08.570\n&gt;&gt; And you load it into the computer.\n\n162\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.536\nI haven't had a CD drive in-\n\n163\n00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:11.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Years.\n\n164\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.404\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But you do still have that option to\n\n165\n00:09:14.404 --> 00:09:18.810\nnot have it all part of a suite Or\nas part of a subscription model.\n\n166\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.482\nNow let's get to this slide.\n\n167\n00:09:21.482 --> 00:09:26.530\n[LAUGH] And behind my head just so you can\nsee what's on the slide here is you have\n\n168\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:32.430\ndifferent versions of Word in\na sense of where does it live.\n\n169\n00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.849\nIs it a locally installed\nversion of Office 2016, and\n\n170\n00:09:35.849 --> 00:09:39.910\nspecifically now since we're\ntalking about Word, Word 2016.\n\n171\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.333\nSo, that is, you buy a subscription,\nyou go to the website, you go ahead and,\n\n172\n00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:48.294\nlike Ronnie was saying, like a web\ninterface of where you can manage and\n\n173\n00:09:48.294 --> 00:09:52.406\ndo the administrative work of it with\nthe licensing and things like that.\n\n174\n00:09:52.406 --> 00:09:55.921\nThere's a little button that says\nInstall Office, you click it,\n\n175\n00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:57.060\nit brings it on down.\n\n176\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.880\nAnd now you're running Word\nlocally on your computer.\n\n177\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.787\nYou are not in the cloud,\nyou're not using the Online version of it.\n\n178\n00:10:06.787 --> 00:10:11.630\nAnd then the Word Online,\nthere's two different types.\n\n179\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.360\nYou can have Word for free.\n\n180\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.780\nYou don't have to purchase Word.\n\n181\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.740\nIf you sign up with a Microsoft account,\nwhich you just go to their website and\n\n182\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.600\nyou just,\nI think it's a microsoft.com account.\n\n183\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.160\nI think that's what it's called.\n\n184\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.080\nAnd then you go ahead and create that.\n\n185\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.405\nYou have access to a free version,\n\n186\n00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:37.710\nweb-based of Word for you to use,\nand a lot of the same functionality.\n\n187\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.580\nTyping in text, formatting your text will\nbe available for you in that version.\n\n188\n00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.521\nIt won't be nearly as robust as the\nlocally purchased software that you would\n\n189\n00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:53.033\nhave on your computer but at least you\ncould be able to create Word in it.\n\n190\n00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:57.020\nAnd I like that they're giving\nthese different options for\n\n191\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.420\nSoftware packages for everybody.\n\n192\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.250\nAnd of course it is online so\nthat means it's mobile.\n\n193\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.230\nBut you do have to have\na connection to the internet.\n\n194\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.510\nWhen you are locally installed,\n\n195\n00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.988\nit doesn't matter if you're\nconnected to the internet or not.\n\n196\n00:11:07.988 --> 00:11:10.030\nAnd it's kind of weird nowadays.\n\n197\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.428\nIt's even weird to think to not be\nconnected to the internet at all times.\n\n198\n00:11:13.428 --> 00:11:17.392\n[LAUGH] But\nthat's just because of where we work, too.\n\n199\n00:11:17.392 --> 00:11:19.780\n[LAUGH] So different types.\n\n200\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.440\nNow versions and file types,\n\n201\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.450\nthis is where we get our little\nhistory lesson across the slide.\n\n202\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.590\nAnd behind my head we have\na little bit more information.\n\n203\n00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.790\nAnd I promise the next time I'll fix our\nslides to move it over a little bit.\n\n204\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.138\nI always fight with I want it to be a line\nin the slide and then I get in here and\n\n205\n00:11:36.138 --> 00:11:37.500\nI'm like yeah.\n\n206\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.340\nBut we have our picture in picture and\nI keep forgetting that.\n\n207\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.480\nIt's just like the designer in me.\n\n208\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.130\nIt's really hard for\nme to have that much white space.\n\n209\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:45.708\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n210\n00:11:45.708 --> 00:11:46.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n211\n00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:52.010\nyou can see that in the older\nversions every file has an extension.\n\n212\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.066\nAnd it has a type that\nit's associated with.\n\n213\n00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:59.823\nAnd when you're talking about documents or\nWord you have the .doc ex,\n\n214\n00:11:59.823 --> 00:12:05.055\nbecause you can see it started in 2007,\nand then all the way through that,\n\n215\n00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:11.160\nand we're talking ten years at this point,\nthat we've been in the docx file format.\n\n216\n00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.100\nIt is the doc with an XML\non top that extends\n\n217\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.450\nthe functionality of the file type.\n\n218\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.440\nIf you're glossing over right now,\njust go okay that's fine.\n\n219\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.018\nIt does more things than it\nused to in the past, okay?\n\n220\n00:12:24.018 --> 00:12:30.059\nBut I did want to point this out because\nthere are still .doc files lurking\n\n221\n00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:36.520\naround out there, so it's not\nuncommon to run across one of these.\n\n222\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.660\nAnd one thing,\nlet's hide myself again really quickly,\n\n223\n00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.880\none thing I wanted to point out.\n\n224\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.462\nYou see how I have in those braces\nthere is compatibility mode,\n\n225\n00:12:46.462 --> 00:12:50.568\ncuz in the title bar of\nWord if you are opening,\n\n226\n00:12:50.568 --> 00:12:55.517\ncuz it can open up a doc,\nyou will see compatibility mode\n\n227\n00:12:55.517 --> 00:13:00.253\nup at the top Indicating to\nyou that it is not in the most\n\n228\n00:13:00.253 --> 00:13:05.250\nrecent version of the file types,\nwhich is the .docx.\n\n229\n00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:05.962\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n230\n00:13:05.962 --> 00:13:10.819\n&gt;&gt; And this is, again,\nmaybe nowadays not as prevalent, but\n\n231\n00:13:10.819 --> 00:13:15.205\nback in the day if you were\naround the 2007 years.\n\n232\n00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:18.683\nYou always sent attachments\nin the .docx and the .doc,\n\n233\n00:13:18.683 --> 00:13:23.410\nbecause at that point in time,\nthey were not backwards compatible.\n\n234\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.873\nSo you couldn't have somebody on 2003\nopen up your .docx file type and\n\n235\n00:13:28.873 --> 00:13:30.527\nit was like a big deal.\n\n236\n00:13:30.527 --> 00:13:31.282\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n237\n00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:34.538\n&gt;&gt; For a while there,\nwith the versionings and\n\n238\n00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:39.730\nmaking sure that everybody had\nthe access to opening the files.\n\n239\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.614\nNowadays, it's kind of, it's very rare\nthat I think you have a problem, and\n\n240\n00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:48.686\nI think they fixed that backwards\ncompatibility, eventually,\n\n241\n00:13:48.686 --> 00:13:53.143\naround that 2007 to where you didn't\nneed to do any major changes.\n\n242\n00:13:53.143 --> 00:13:58.376\nBut some of the functionality\nthat .docx allows is not in .doc,\n\n243\n00:13:58.376 --> 00:14:02.849\nso sometimes you will see\ncompatibility warnings if you\n\n244\n00:14:02.849 --> 00:14:07.460\nare saving down from the .docx\nfile format to the .doc.\n\n245\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.170\nYou might get a warning that says like,\nhey,\n\n246\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.720\nsmart artist is not\nsupported in this file type.\n\n247\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.384\nOr this particular element is not\ngoing to translate properly when you\n\n248\n00:14:17.384 --> 00:14:23.826\nsave it down into a later version of Word,\nwhich would be the doc file format so.\n\n249\n00:14:23.826 --> 00:14:26.849\nAnd I do have a small little note\nhere is that Microsoft Word,\n\n250\n00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:30.960\nit was developed by Microsoft and\nwas first released on October 25, 1983.\n\n251\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.050\n83, that was a long time ago.\n\n252\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.360\n&gt;&gt; It's been around for a while.\n\n253\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.760\n&gt;&gt; It has, let's keep on moving.\n\n254\n00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.026\nTalking about those file extensions, how\ndo I know if I have a DOC versus a DOCX?\n\n255\n00:14:44.026 --> 00:14:49.275\nThat's where I always say to show your\nextensions on your files is a big,\n\n256\n00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:50.490\nbig thing to do.\n\n257\n00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.430\nNow, of course if you show your\nextensions, you do have the option\n\n258\n00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.890\nsometimes when you rename it to Mess up\nthat extension, so be careful about that.\n\n259\n00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.860\nIf you have extensions being\nshown in your computer, and\n\n260\n00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.560\nyou go to rename a file,\ndo not change that dot and\n\n261\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.045\nwhatever's past it cuz it will start\nto mess up, what they call MIME types?\n\n262\n00:15:09.045 --> 00:15:11.561\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so with the association of what\n\n263\n00:15:11.561 --> 00:15:15.690\nfile goes to what program and to know\nwhat the information is being set in.\n\n264\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.348\nBut I want to throw this in here\nbecause in your Windows Explorer in\n\n265\n00:15:20.348 --> 00:15:23.059\nthe thing that you find your files in,\n\n266\n00:15:23.059 --> 00:15:27.715\nup on that ribbon up at the top there\nis a way that you can go ahead and\n\n267\n00:15:27.715 --> 00:15:33.790\nchange the details list or into a detailed\nlist rather than the icon version.\n\n268\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.490\nAnd then over towards the right\nhand side of that ribbon there's\n\n269\n00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:41.100\na check box right over there for\nFile Name Extensions.\n\n270\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.680\nAnd so that's where if you turn\nthem on you could see that.\n\n271\n00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.912\nYou do see some slight\ndifferences in the icon.\n\n272\n00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:51.596\nSo you see the alice_book_old\nlooks a little different in\n\n273\n00:15:51.596 --> 00:15:56.290\nthe icon than the alice_book,\nand so that's one way.\n\n274\n00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:02.335\nAnd in the Details view you could usually\nsee in that file type, it will list,\n\n275\n00:16:02.335 --> 00:16:08.752\nthat this is a 97-2003 version of Word\ndocument versus the newer version.\n\n276\n00:16:08.752 --> 00:16:12.823\nI say newer, it's been around for so long\nthat it's kind of the only version now,\n\n277\n00:16:12.823 --> 00:16:14.320\nbut it's not the only-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n278\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.320\n&gt;&gt; There's more.\n\n279\n00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.930\nAnd then you have those\ndifferent ways there.\n\n280\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.460\nSo turning on your file extensions\nis always a good thing to do.\n\n281\n00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.410\nNow for this particular show,\nour setup, what I'm running on,\n\n282\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.790\nI have an Office 365 ProPlus account.\n\n283\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:35.740\nI am locally installed on my Windows\n10 Pro 64 bit operating system.\n\n284\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.739\nOne small other note, I am in a virtual\nmachine that is actually running\n\n285\n00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:44.137\non a Macintosh computer, but so every once\nand a while there might be some weird\n\n286\n00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:47.560\nglitch that It's not necessarily\nthe program, its me.\n\n287\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.259\nIts me, it's not you.\n\n288\n00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:54.230\n[LAUGH] So letting you know how this\nparticular show is going to be set up.\n\n289\n00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.280\nNow your setup,\n\n290\n00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.707\nhow do you know what type of Office\nsubscription plan that you're on?\n\n291\n00:16:59.707 --> 00:17:03.377\nIn any one of your Office products,\nwhether it be Word or Excel but\n\n292\n00:17:03.377 --> 00:17:07.914\nsince we're doing Word, checking in Word\nIf you go to the File tab on the ribbon,\n\n293\n00:17:07.914 --> 00:17:11.318\nor notice the backstage view,\nyou can go into your account,\n\n294\n00:17:11.318 --> 00:17:13.620\nwhich is on the left-hand side.\n\n295\n00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:19.330\nAnd then over on the right, you will see\nwhat subscription model you have and\n\n296\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.360\nwhat version build you have.\n\n297\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.690\nSo talking about those\nupdates that happen, and\n\n298\n00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.150\nmaybe yours looks a little\nbit different than mine.\n\n299\n00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.930\nIf your update is in, I think mine's\nin like the 18s right now, or\n\n300\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.555\n78, there's something with\nan eight there right now.\n\n301\n00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:38.500\n[LAUGH] You might be above that, so that's\nwhy you might look a little bit different.\n\n302\n00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.223\nBut as you can see,\nthings might look different,\n\n303\n00:17:40.223 --> 00:17:41.751\nespecially if you're on an older version.\n\n304\n00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:43.472\nMaybe you're on 2013.\n\n305\n00:17:43.472 --> 00:17:47.410\n2013 to 16,\nthere's not a lot of differences.\n\n306\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.880\nAll the basics are gonna be the same.\n\n307\n00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.528\nWhere you format your text, that's even\nback in 2010, probably even back in 2007.\n\n308\n00:17:54.528 --> 00:17:58.842\nSo there's gonna be a lot of the basics\nthat are going to go across all of your\n\n309\n00:17:58.842 --> 00:18:01.856\nversions, but\nwith just some slight differences so\n\n310\n00:18:01.856 --> 00:18:04.890\nit might look a little bit\ndifferent here and there.\n\n311\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.510\nAnd then if you're on an enterprise\nlicense you do need to ask your IT\n\n312\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.170\ndepartment, like I don't have this\nparticular functionality that I'm\n\n313\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:20.290\nwatching in the Office ProTV episodes,\nI don't see it and I can't do it.\n\n314\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:25.520\nIn larger organizations, they can\nset limitations that group policies.\n\n315\n00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.005\nI don't know if that's how they\nuse that terminology anymore,\n\n316\n00:18:31.005 --> 00:18:37.827\nbut they can set things across the network\nto not allow you to do certain things.\n\n317\n00:18:37.827 --> 00:18:40.237\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Restrict certain accesses or\n\n318\n00:18:40.237 --> 00:18:43.070\ncertain things that programs can do.\n\n319\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:49.070\nSo if that happens, it is quite possible\nthat that could be an explanation for\n\n320\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.430\nit, so you might want to go ahead and\n\n321\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:56.640\nconsult your IT department if you're\nin that type of organization.\n\n322\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.340\nAnd I believe, yep, that's the end\nof the show, but like I said,\n\n323\n00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.620\nI just wanted to give you a basic\nintroduction to the product,\n\n324\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.340\nand really the show all together of\nhow we're going to be working with it.\n\n325\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.150\nNow you have some new terminology that\nyou can use, and you can tell some people\n\n326\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.834\nthat you're gonna be using a locally\ninstalled version of Word 2016-\n\n327\n00:19:15.834 --> 00:19:16.577\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:19:16.577 --> 00:19:17.905\n&gt;&gt; On your computer, so.\n\n329\n00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:19.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Von, well thank you again for\n\n330\n00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.860\nthat introduction.\n\n331\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.028\nVery neat things that we can actually\nknow about the product that we're\n\n332\n00:19:24.028 --> 00:19:24.770\ngonna be using.\n\n333\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.390\nIt's always helpful when you know\na little bit about the history.\n\n334\n00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.960\nCuz then it sets everything in place.\n\n335\n00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.230\nAnd understanding some of\nthese elements we looked at.\n\n336\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.100\nBut, just remember that,\nif you are ready to get started in Word.\n\n337\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.090\nWell, you've come to the right show.\n\n338\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.440\nThat's a great place for\nus to end this segment then.\n\n339\n00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.740\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n340\n00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.790\n&gt;&gt;

This is our second.\n\n8\n00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:20.061\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I didn't get to be apart\n\n9\n00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.160\nof the first episode.\n\n10\n00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.017\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But they realized that was an issue so\n\n11\n00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:23.783\nI'm here today.\n\n12\n00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:27.153\nAnd joining me again [LAUGH] in the studio\nour good friend, Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n13\n00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:28.332\nVonne, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:29.228\n&gt;&gt; Thank you I'm so\n\n15\n00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:30.900\nglad to be back with you-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n16\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.244\n&gt;&gt; Here for-\n&gt;&gt; Word 2016.\n\n17\n00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:35.714\n&gt;&gt; Yes and I mean this is our second\nepisode within this series, but\n\n18\n00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:38.992\nof course you can jump around as you know,\nand you can pick and\n\n19\n00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:41.321\nchoose what episodes you'd like to view.\n\n20\n00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:46.750\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna go\nover some basics of working with Word.\n\n21\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.302\nAnd more specifically I would say,\nis really working with Windows in general.\n\n22\n00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:56.286\nSo these are things that all\nprograms need to do or can do,\n\n23\n00:00:56.286 --> 00:01:01.100\nthings like open the program,\nclose the program, start a new file,\n\n24\n00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.091\nsaving the file, what is save and save as?\n\n25\n00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:07.192\nSo all those Windows and\nWord basics that we should cover,\n\n26\n00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.925\nbecause I always like to\nstart from the beginning.\n\n27\n00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:13.127\nYou never assume because you know\nwhat happens when you assume?\n\n28\n00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:14.247\n&gt;&gt; You're 100% correct every time right?\n\n29\n00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:16.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n30\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.823\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect so\n\n31\n00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:22.167\nwhy don't we go ahead and\njump down in and get started.\n\n32\n00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:24.000\nWe are with Justin Timberlake,\n\n33\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.630\nand this is our beautiful desktop\nin our Windows 10 Environment.\n\n34\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.830\n&gt;&gt; This is a lovely picture.\n\n35\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.440\n&gt;&gt; It is, isn't it?\n\n36\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.461\nYeah, it's very serene.\n\n37\n00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:31.026\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I feel-\n\n38\n00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:32.049\n&gt;&gt; You took the words out of my mouth.\n\n39\n00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I feel calm right now.\n\n40\n00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I should probably wake up and\n\n41\n00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.600\nlet's go and actually,\nhow do I start Word?\n\n42\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.920\nWell, for starting we can go\nto start menu, so that works.\n\n43\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.650\nAnd we can go down to\nour little Windows guy,\n\n44\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.580\nand go through our Windows\nstart menu to find Word.\n\n45\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.190\nBut I will tell you I love the search\nin Windows 10, it's fantastic.\n\n46\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.360\nAll you gotta do is really\njust type in the first letter,\n\n47\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.690\nand a lot of times it just pops right in.\n\n48\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.525\nAnd you can see that the best\nmatch is the desktop application,\n\n49\n00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:05.780\ncuz we are using Word in\nour local installation.\n\n50\n00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.017\nSo yep, that's what I want and\nI can go ahead and launch the program, and\n\n51\n00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:11.004\nget ready to go.\n\n52\n00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.988\nAnd when you start the program\nyou're at another start point,\n\n53\n00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:15.179\nyou have the start page.\n\n54\n00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.701\nAnd it's giving you like alright,\nso where are we gonna go from here,\n\n55\n00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:22.715\nbecause when you start Word you're\nprobably gonna wanna work with a document.\n\n56\n00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:25.195\nAnd we had talk to that the differences,\nwhat are we actually,\n\n57\n00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.105\nthis is a word processing program.\n\n58\n00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:30.815\nSo we will be creating\ndocument files in Word.\n\n59\n00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:34.015\nNow, we might have a file that we've\nalready been working with, and\n\n60\n00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:37.300\nneed just to go ahead and\nupdate things or add more text.\n\n61\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.380\nAnd so\nyou could see over on a left-hand side,\n\n62\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.720\nyou have your most recent items\nthat you had been working with.\n\n63\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.750\nAnd I like that is says today,\nlast week older.\n\n64\n00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.530\nSo you could tell,\nwhat was that file that I was working on?\n\n65\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.490\nWhat's the name of it?\n\n66\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.470\nI think it was last week.\n\n67\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.430\nAnd so\nhopefully that will jog your memory.\n\n68\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.370\nWell if you don't have it in the recent\ncuz maybe it's something you haven't\n\n69\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.510\ndone for awhile, you can always go down\nto the bottom and open other documents.\n\n70\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.870\nBecause that's usually what you're going\nto be doing when you start Word, is you\n\n71\n00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.170\neither gonna start a new file or you're\ngoing to be opening an existing file.\n\n72\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.437\nSo those are the main, well,\n\n73\n00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:13.732\nI think that's the only two\nthings you can do really.\n\n74\n00:03:13.732 --> 00:03:15.128\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that I say that,\n\n75\n00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.500\nit's like that's it.\n\n76\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.970\n&gt;&gt; We covered all the bases, thanks Ron.\n\n77\n00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we're done.\n\n78\n00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.300\nNo, there's more.\n\n79\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.440\nSo, you can see that I can start with\na blank document, that's our File, New.\n\n80\n00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.380\nAnd there's other things\nin here in a start screen,\n\n81\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.950\nwhere you can start with\npre-made Office templates.\n\n82\n00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.796\nIt's Word documents that are already\nhalfway created or actually most,\n\n83\n00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:39.282\nall the way created for you and\nall you have to do is type in the text.\n\n84\n00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:40.493\nSo you could have cover letters and\n\n85\n00:03:40.493 --> 00:03:42.171\nthere's some different\nthings with resumes.\n\n86\n00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:47.090\nAnd these are all the things that\nWord has for you to get you started.\n\n87\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.063\nAnd these are the different\nlibraries that they have.\n\n88\n00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:54.536\nUp at the top, they also have some\ndifferent categories that they have that\n\n89\n00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:56.668\nis connected to Microsoft Online.\n\n90\n00:03:56.668 --> 00:04:00.859\nSo if you don't see as many if you're\nnot connected to the Internet that might\n\n91\n00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.482\nbe why, but this is all part of\nusing Word and getting you started.\n\n92\n00:04:04.482 --> 00:04:07.909\nBut we're just gonna\nconcentrate on the new and\n\n93\n00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.940\nexisting files that we have\nsaved to our computer.\n\n94\n00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.080\nSo, why don't we start\nwith a new blank document.\n\n95\n00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.313\nI click it once, and\nthen it goes ahead and starts Word up.\n\n96\n00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:24.400\nSo basic window environment,\nwe have the title bar.\n\n97\n00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.630\nThe title bar always tells\nyou where you're at.\n\n98\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.110\nSo up at the top it says,\nDocument 1 and I'm working in Word.\n\n99\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.980\nSo good, at least I know where I'm at.\n\n100\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.720\nAlong this title bar,\nyou also have towards the right hand side,\n\n101\n00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.890\nyour basic window commands.\n\n102\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.616\nYou have your Minimize button.\n\n103\n00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.007\nYou also have your wonderful\nhover to discover,\n\n104\n00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:48.938\nyour little tool tips to let\nyou know what those buttons do.\n\n105\n00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:52.471\nSo Minimize then the next one\nis either your maximize and\n\n106\n00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:56.916\nsometimes in this scenario,\nit will be called a restore down button.\n\n107\n00:04:56.916 --> 00:05:01.053\nThe reason why it doesn't say maximize\nis because well, our window is already\n\n108\n00:05:01.053 --> 00:05:04.330\nmaximized to the full size of\nour computer monitor right now.\n\n109\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.540\nAnd then the good old X, the big red X\nover on the right that means close and\n\n110\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.760\nthat will close your entire\nprogram down normally, well.\n\n111\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.462\n&gt;&gt; Normally yeah.\n\n112\n00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:17.478\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's always an asterisk on all\n\n113\n00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:21.177\nof these things, it's almost like\nthe rules of computer, asterisk see more.\n\n114\n00:05:21.177 --> 00:05:23.001\n&gt;&gt; Here's what it's supposed to do.\n\n115\n00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:23.938\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:25.472\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that'll happen, maybe that won't.\n\n117\n00:05:25.472 --> 00:05:27.023\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah using words like absolute like\n\n118\n00:05:27.023 --> 00:05:28.600\nthis will happen every time.\n\n119\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.195\nDon't ever say that.\n\n120\n00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.685\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it won't.\n\n121\n00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:33.459\nCuz somebody will be lik,e no mine did\nthis in this scenario and they're like.\n\n122\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.945\n&gt;&gt; I've literally been in on\na conversation going, this is impossible.\n\n123\n00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:40.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This should be impossible and\n\n124\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.615\nyet here we are.\n\n125\n00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:42.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n126\n00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.250\nI used to have those\nconversations with my mother.\n\n127\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.422\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; On the phone I'm like, why?\n\n128\n00:05:45.422 --> 00:05:45.948\n&gt;&gt; How do you do this?\n\n129\n00:05:45.948 --> 00:05:48.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm like there's no way.\n\n130\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; She found it.\n\n131\n00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.835\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n132\n00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:51.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] She would be\na really good tester.\n\n133\n00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.550\n&gt;&gt; She would.\n\n134\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.148\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n135\n00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:56.338\nthey need to stop sending Beta\nversions to IT professionals, and\n\n136\n00:05:56.338 --> 00:06:00.425\njust send it people at home, like little\nold ladies and stuff, they will break it.\n\n137\n00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:01.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n138\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.614\nsend them to the moms,\nthey will take care of it.\n\n139\n00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:07.030\n[LAUGH] So you can see those\nare the basic Window functionalities, so\n\n140\n00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.490\nwhy don't we see what they do?\n\n141\n00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.310\nRight now that restore down\nhow I said that our screen,\n\n142\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.360\nthis particular window right now\nis maximized to our monitor.\n\n143\n00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.370\nIf I click on that, it just restores it\ndown to become its own floating window\n\n144\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.420\nif you wanna call it to where I can grab\nthe title bar, and I can move it around.\n\n145\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.030\n&gt;&gt; That's magical.\n\n146\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.175\n&gt;&gt; It is right.\n\n147\n00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:31.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As long as you get it down\n\n148\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.870\ninto a window that you can work with,\nand then you can kinda move it around.\n\n149\n00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.407\nOnce it's maximized and\nnotice the little button changes,\n\n150\n00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:40.427\nthe icon and it now says Maximize.\n\n151\n00:06:40.427 --> 00:06:43.180\nNow it goes ahead and\nit's like it docks itself,\n\n152\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.010\nI wanna say all the way to\nthe edges of the monitor.\n\n153\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.390\nNow you can still go up to the title bar,\nand if you click hold and drag down,\n\n154\n00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.230\nthat's another way of kinda like,\n\n155\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.450\nit's almost like if you lock\nit you wanna unlock it.\n\n156\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.400\nSo you wanna stop connecting it to\nthe edges and you can bring it down.\n\n157\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.700\nNow, this is Windows,\n\n158\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.770\nif you're a Macintosh user,\nyou're used to working windows like this.\n\n159\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.830\nThey're, I don't know, maybe it's just me,\nbut as a Mac user they're always floating.\n\n160\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.995\nThey don't really dock itself too much,\n\n161\n00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:14.580\nI've just have always gotten used to\nworking with the windows like this.\n\n162\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I went to Mac I was like,\n\n163\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.095\nwhy are all these things and\nthis stupid little window.\n\n164\n00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:20.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't maximize.\n\n165\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.222\n&gt;&gt; Yes, just move it.\nYeah, and\n\n166\n00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:22.920\nthen all of the buttons comes on the left.\n\n167\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.550\n&gt;&gt; And it really doesn't make\nsense because they have multiple\n\n168\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.130\nlike desktops spaces.\n\n169\n00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.720\nI can make it and just swipe through them.\n\n170\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I want all that desktop really, now\n\n171\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.580\nI understand the idea of maybe minimizing\nit down so you can have multiple things,\n\n172\n00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.810\nand I can maybe have two windows open and\nlooking at side by side.\n\n173\n00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.132\nThat can be helpful but\nusually for me like.\n\n174\n00:07:42.132 --> 00:07:46.940\n&gt;&gt; I mean, and this is where using\nyour computer to the way you like it,\n\n175\n00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.140\nit's a personal preference.\n\n176\n00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's funny you say that about the two\n\n177\n00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.470\nwindow things, there's some little tricks\nthat I'm gonna show you about work with\n\n178\n00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.140\nmultiple windows in just a little bit.\n\n179\n00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.273\nSo let's talk about this\nlast button that we have.\n\n180\n00:07:57.273 --> 00:08:00.268\nWell it's not the last,\nthe other button, the Minimize button.\n\n181\n00:08:00.268 --> 00:08:05.056\nWhen you click the Minimize button,\nwhat it does it minimizes it down into.\n\n182\n00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:06.847\nThe taskbar down here.\n\n183\n00:08:06.847 --> 00:08:09.151\nIt's kinda, I was talking about\nit's like the genie in the bottle,\n\n184\n00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:11.190\nkinda like it goes back into the bottle,\nit's still there.\n\n185\n00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.910\nAnd so when you wanna call it,\nyou just say, here, here I am.\n\n186\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.320\nSo it's down in there and\nnow on the taskbar when I hover,\n\n187\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.740\nI'm not clicking on anything,\n\n188\n00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.540\nit shows me that hey there's this\ndocument in this particular application.\n\n189\n00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.040\nYou can see that there's other\nicons on my task bar right now,\n\n190\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.780\nlike I actually have a couple websites\npulled up in my Windows Explorer.\n\n191\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.850\nSo if I hover over here,\nyou could see that I have\n\n192\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.320\nthis particular window in here,\nnow I have multiple tabs in here.\n\n193\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.870\nSo that's why it's not\nactually showing three.\n\n194\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.220\nI have three pages pulled up but\nI'm in tabs instead of within new windows.\n\n195\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.277\nBut those are always things to get\nfamiliar with, is along the task bar.\n\n196\n00:08:46.277 --> 00:08:49.912\nWhat do I have open and\nwhat's in each application?\n\n197\n00:08:49.912 --> 00:08:52.812\nBecause you could be using\nmultiple Word documents,\n\n198\n00:08:52.812 --> 00:08:55.395\nwe're not gonna have\nWord Word Word Word Word.\n\n199\n00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:59.099\nYou're just gonna have little, they're\ntiny this time, they're little bars out in\n\n200\n00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:01.750\nthe bottom that lets you know\nthat you have multiple windows.\n\n201\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.170\n&gt;&gt; Does the alt+tab function\nstill work where it shows them.\n\n202\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.330\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I love that.\n\n203\n00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.140\nI love, I'm all about a keyboard shortcut\nand we will be going over that as well.\n\n204\n00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.650\nNow if I wanted to bring this back up,\nlike I want to type back in it, if you\n\n205\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.210\njust click the button down at the task\nbar, your little icon, it shows back up.\n\n206\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.850\nAnd now it's bringing it back\nup into the restored downstate\n\n207\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.460\nthat I had been in when\nI had minimized it.\n\n208\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.598\nSo all the different ways that\nyou can kind of function within\n\n209\n00:09:30.598 --> 00:09:34.580\none window working in\nyour Windows environment.\n\n210\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:40.982\nNow closing, closing the program\nversus closing the file.\n\n211\n00:09:40.982 --> 00:09:44.640\nNow I said like this button\nwill close the program kind of.\n\n212\n00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.200\n[LAUGH] Because when you get into multiple\nfiles, any time that red x there,\n\n213\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.360\nyou are going to be closing\nthat particular file and\n\n214\n00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.580\nif you have another one opened,\nit would have the file still open,\n\n215\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.580\nso you wouldn't be closing\nall of them down at one time.\n\n216\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:04.690\nBut, there is an actual file close\nfunctionality that would close the file\n\n217\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:10.890\nand not the application or program and\nthat's over in your File menu.\n\n218\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.370\nIt's, I still call it a file menu even\nthough we've gone away from menus from\n\n219\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.840\na longtime ago, I think it's 2003 that\nthey started using like the tabs across it\n\n220\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.310\nand you didn't have the file menu,\nbut I can't stop calling it that way.\n\n221\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is the backstage view,\n\n222\n00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.090\nit's where you have all of your\nbasic commands like File, New,\n\n223\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.430\nlike we had done when we clicked the start\nscreen and we clicked on the File New.\n\n224\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.430\nFile Open, from here.\n\n225\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.050\nSo once you get into the program,\nyou have these different commands.\n\n226\n00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:44.680\nFile Save, Save As, which we'll be\nreviewing, File Printing, Export, Close.\n\n227\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.190\nThere's the one I wanted to get to, Close.\n\n228\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.985\nIf I click this Close,\nnotice Word as a program is still open.\n\n229\n00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:57.420\nSo the program application is open,\nnot the file.\n\n230\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.630\nBut if I click the X,\nthen it closes everything down.\n\n231\n00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.470\nNow, I'll tell you, I don't normally\ngo to File Close any more with\n\n232\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.249\nthe way that Word has kind\nof made them separate.\n\n233\n00:11:11.249 --> 00:11:12.880\nLet me show you.\n\n234\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.380\nLet's go back into Word and\nI will use my search and\n\n235\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.590\nI will click the mouse,\nI almost hit enter,\n\n236\n00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.750\nbecause you can use enter on your keyboard\nbut I wanted to show you on the mouse.\n\n237\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.970\nSo let's go with a blank document.\n\n238\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.900\nSo here, if I click this x over here,\nit closes everything down.\n\n239\n00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.380\nIt closes the program and the file.\n\n240\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.305\nSo that's usually how I work with it\nbecause if I have multiple files,\n\n241\n00:11:36.305 --> 00:11:39.330\nin just a second,\nit closes each one individually.\n\n242\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:45.140\nNow we could go ahead and\nopen Word, we could start Word,\n\n243\n00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.930\nand then go into the start screen and\nopen a file from there, totally fine.\n\n244\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.480\nBut I have some Word files already on my\ndesktop in a folder called Word 2016.\n\n245\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.760\nSo if I open up this folder, you can\nalways open up a document from the file,\n\n246\n00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.930\nfrom your Windows Explorer, and have it\njust open up into that particular program.\n\n247\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.870\nNow, I say that cuz sometimes\nyou click on files and\n\n248\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:10.480\nit says that it can't find the program\ncuz it doesn't understand the extensions,\n\n249\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.750\nbecause all of your files\nhave different types.\n\n250\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.578\nAnd so as long as it's associated with a\nparticular program that it can understand,\n\n251\n00:12:17.578 --> 00:12:19.893\nyou'll be able to open a file from here.\n\n252\n00:12:19.893 --> 00:12:22.322\nSo, just always watching\nthe types of files and\n\n253\n00:12:22.322 --> 00:12:24.091\nmaking sure you have the program.\n\n254\n00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:30.690\nCuz if I sent you an INDD file,\nyour computer would probably be like what?\n\n255\n00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.545\n&gt;&gt; What is that, I'd be like what is that?\n\n256\n00:12:32.545 --> 00:12:35.967\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; An INDD is an In Design file, so\n\n257\n00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:38.785\nI almost said Microsoft,\nAdobe In Design and\n\n258\n00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:42.590\nthat's actually a program\nthat I work in extensively.\n\n259\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.660\nIt's kind of like Word\nto the next level so.\n\n260\n00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.160\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n261\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.720\n&gt;&gt; So if I wanted to open up,\nlet's say Welcome to Word.\n\n262\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.050\nI just double click it, opens up into\nthe application that is associated, and\n\n263\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.190\nhere is Welcome to Word.\n\n264\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.560\nI can see my title bar across\nthe top that says Welcome to Word.\n\n265\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.850\nWell maybe I wanna take this and\n\n266\n00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:03.010\nI wanna start a new file with\nthis cuz maybe I wanna copy and\n\n267\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.630\npaste some things out of it, I only need\na couple of paragraphs or something.\n\n268\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.520\nCome over to File and\nwe can go over to New,\n\n269\n00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.850\nand we're back right with what the start\nscreen started us off with, and\n\n270\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.800\nwe go with Blank Document,\nand now I have Document1.\n\n271\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.258\nIt's like, well welcome to Word 101,\nand it's still there,\n\n272\n00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:23.179\nit's just behind because I\nhad everything maximized.\n\n273\n00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:26.444\nNow if we're down here with our task bar,\nif I hover over them,\n\n274\n00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:30.472\nI can see I have both the documents and\nif you have 3, 4 10, 20,\n\n275\n00:13:30.472 --> 00:13:33.165\nyou would see all those\nlittle icons across the top.\n\n276\n00:13:33.165 --> 00:13:36.470\nThose little visual cues to let\nyou know that you have other ones.\n\n277\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.429\nSo, If I wanted to go back over\nto Welcome to Word, I click on\n\n278\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.790\nthe icon or the visual cue,\nI click it, and\n\n279\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:52.220\nnow I have activated or have, yeah I'll\nsay activated, Welcome to Word here.\n\n280\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.290\nCome back down there, click on that, so\n\n281\n00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.760\nyou can always go to your task bar to go\nback and forth between multiple documents.\n\n282\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.100\nNow this is where it can get kind of\nfun with how you want to organize\n\n283\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.320\nyour documents.\n\n284\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.650\nI will tell you really quickly that you\ndo have your View tab on your ribbon,\n\n285\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.500\nwhich we will go over our environment\na little bit more in depth.\n\n286\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.470\nAnd you have these different Arrange\nbuttons and you split your views and\n\n287\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.970\nyou can view side by side, totally fine,\nnothing wrong with these buttons.\n\n288\n00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.940\nBut I wanted to show you just\nlike basic window functionality.\n\n289\n00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:31.540\nIf I minimize or not minimize I'm sorry,\nrestore down Document1 becomes floating.\n\n290\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.130\nI can then click to the title\nbar here to activate this,\n\n291\n00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.680\nrestore down this window and\nnow I have them both next to each other.\n\n292\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.210\nIf I want to put two documents side by\nside to compare it, sorry that's not\n\n293\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:47.142\nusually going to come up because\nthat's my virtual machine showing you.\n\n294\n00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:48.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You could take your title bars\n\n295\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.060\nand if you drag all the way over to the\nleft or right hand side of your monitor,\n\n296\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.110\ndo you see how it kind of makes it to\nwhere you have two docking stations.\n\n297\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.090\nAnd now it's saying, well here,\nwhat do you want to dock next to it?\n\n298\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.188\nWell I have a couple of\ndifferent things open.\n\n299\n00:15:03.188 --> 00:15:05.770\nI have my Windows explorer,\nI have Internet Explorer,\n\n300\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.930\nI also have my other Word document.\n\n301\n00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.330\nI click on the other thing or\ndocument or window that I want and\n\n302\n00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.500\nit just goes ahead and\njust puts them right next to each other.\n\n303\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.628\nI love that little feature in Windows 10.\n\n304\n00:15:17.628 --> 00:15:18.904\nI think it started in Windows 8, right?\n\n305\n00:15:18.904 --> 00:15:20.036\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n306\n00:15:20.036 --> 00:15:24.520\n&gt;&gt; So it's just some fun stuff\nin working with your Windows.\n\n307\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.940\nYou can then un-dock it,\n\n308\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.680\nyou can just drag it from the title bar,\ndrag it from the title bar.\n\n309\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.510\nYou can maximize your windows again.\n\n310\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.750\nBasic window functionality of\nunderstanding how to get around,\n\n311\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.510\njust your Windows environment\nbecause a lot of time\n\n312\n00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.520\nyou're not gonna be working\nwith just one file.\n\n313\n00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.410\nYou're gonna be copying from the website,\n\n314\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.990\nputting it into Word or\nworking in Excel, working with Word.\n\n315\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.020\nKnowing how to get around is,\nit just makes it a little easier.\n\n316\n00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.660\nAnd I found, just through all\nthe years of teaching these products,\n\n317\n00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.310\nthese super basics,\nwell I call it super basics.\n\n318\n00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:57.981\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n319\n00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:59.629\nThey love it.\n&gt;&gt; The foundational aspects\n\n320\n00:15:59.629 --> 00:16:00.506\nof these things.\n\n321\n00:16:00.506 --> 00:16:02.672\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz I think a lot of people overlook this.\n\n322\n00:16:02.672 --> 00:16:05.368\nThey don't take the time to really,\nand I'm just as guilty.\n\n323\n00:16:05.368 --> 00:16:05.968\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we all are.\n\n324\n00:16:05.968 --> 00:16:06.604\n&gt;&gt; It's like,\njust let me get to the stuff.\n\n325\n00:16:06.604 --> 00:16:08.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna know how to do what it is\n\n326\n00:16:08.975 --> 00:16:09.960\nI want it to do.\n\n327\n00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.570\nBut if I took the time to really\nunderstand, it's like a car, right.\n\n328\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.269\nYeah, I wanna get in,\nI wanna go somewhere and then, one day,\n\n329\n00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:16.113\nyou're driving along and you're like,\nwhat does this button do?\n\n330\n00:16:16.113 --> 00:16:19.611\nAnd you click it,\nyou're like holy crap it does this!\n\n331\n00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.590\nI didn't even know that was a feature.\n\n332\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.445\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's so\n\n333\n00:16:22.445 --> 00:16:25.100\nmany times where it's like,\ncuz I didn't read the introduction, or\n\n334\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.590\nI didn't read the preface of the book.\n\n335\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.400\nOr like how do I actually use this book or\nwhatever and I'm like,\n\n336\n00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.564\nI missed a very key component that\nwould've done it, and learned it,\n\n337\n00:16:34.564 --> 00:16:37.060\nit would've made my life a lot easier.\n\n338\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.410\nSo that's why I like to start\nwith these super, super basic so\n\n339\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.304\nyou can become a super user.\n\n340\n00:16:42.304 --> 00:16:43.495\nSee what I did there?\n\n341\n00:16:43.495 --> 00:16:44.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n342\n00:16:44.422 --> 00:16:47.511\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe've got our multiple windows.\n\n343\n00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:51.720\nI did wanna show you that,\nif I come back over here to Word 1.\n\n344\n00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.236\nIf I come up to the big red X and\nclose this.\n\n345\n00:16:54.236 --> 00:16:56.660\nSee, I didn't close all of the files.\n\n346\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.891\nI just closed that one.\n\n347\n00:16:57.891 --> 00:16:59.457\nAnd that is where I was saying,\n\n348\n00:16:59.457 --> 00:17:02.841\nit closes the program and/or\nthe file depending on where your at.\n\n349\n00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:06.666\n&gt;&gt; So, for each file you open,\nit opens a new instance of Word so\n\n350\n00:17:06.666 --> 00:17:08.471\nthey are self-contained.\n\n351\n00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:08.971\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n352\n00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:10.862\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and this was like back in the day\n\n353\n00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:13.637\nand this was a long time ago.\nIf you clicked that red x,\n\n354\n00:17:13.637 --> 00:17:16.769\nthen you closed everything, and\nso they kinda took that away.\n\n355\n00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:19.037\nSo I like that, the new instances of Word,\n\n356\n00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:21.610\nbut you don't see it across your task bar.\n\n357\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.689\nSo we've got that and\nwe've opened some files,\n\n358\n00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:29.493\nlet's go back over to this file menu\njust to go through a couple more things,\n\n359\n00:17:29.493 --> 00:17:34.245\nif I did want to open a file from here\nrather than through the File Explorer.\n\n360\n00:17:34.245 --> 00:17:36.120\nI can come over here to Open.\n\n361\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.080\nNow where are the different\nplaces that I can open files?\n\n362\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.384\nWell, if you have a OneDrive account,\nwell,\n\n363\n00:17:42.384 --> 00:17:45.890\nyou actually already\nhave a OneDrive account.\n\n364\n00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.800\nIf you have a Microsoft subscription,\nyou might go ahead and\n\n365\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.850\nstore all of your\ninformation in the cloud.\n\n366\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.650\nYou might have things stored on your PC,\nwhether on your desktop,\n\n367\n00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.720\nin your documents, so\nthat's sometimes half the battle.\n\n368\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.870\nI don't even remember where I put it.\n\n369\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where is this thing?\n\n370\n00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, where was that in my documents?\n\n371\n00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.455\nSo I do like the recent parts.\n\n372\n00:18:04.455 --> 00:18:09.029\nYou can come over here to your documents\nand you can come into these different\n\n373\n00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:12.317\nplaces where you could go up\nfrom your documents into,\n\n374\n00:18:12.317 --> 00:18:17.285\nwell I was actually in my Word 2016\nfolder, and then I can go up into this PC.\n\n375\n00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:22.795\nSo you could use this interface, or if you\nclick on Browse, it kinda takes you to\n\n376\n00:18:22.795 --> 00:18:27.873\nthe always, I call old school, but it's\njust the way that Windows looks to me.\n\n377\n00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:31.124\nSometimes there's a new interface over\nhere and I actually sometimes get lost.\n\n378\n00:18:31.124 --> 00:18:34.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't, creatures of habit.\n\n379\n00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.415\nSo I can come over into the different\nplaces that I needed to have my files.\n\n380\n00:18:38.415 --> 00:18:43.270\nThat's already going into my Word 2016\nfolder cuz it knew that I had been\n\n381\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.060\nthere before we started the show I\nhad kinda played around with this.\n\n382\n00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.661\nSo I could always come into here and,\nlet's go with the alice_book file.\n\n383\n00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:55.956\nAnd so now I have some multiple\nfiles working in here, and\n\n384\n00:18:55.956 --> 00:18:59.805\nlet's do one more, let's do file-\n&gt;&gt; Just uno mas.\n\n385\n00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, uno mas por favor.\n\n386\n00:19:01.131 --> 00:19:03.236\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'll take this Document2, so\n\n387\n00:19:03.236 --> 00:19:04.672\nI've started a new document.\n\n388\n00:19:04.672 --> 00:19:08.540\nSo I wanna talk about Save versus Save As.\n\n389\n00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.164\nSounds very simple, but\npeople get tripped up on this.\n\n390\n00:19:11.164 --> 00:19:12.044\n&gt;&gt; Yes they do.\n\n391\n00:19:12.044 --> 00:19:16.053\n&gt;&gt; So, look at that,\nI typed all this text in.\n\n392\n00:19:16.053 --> 00:19:18.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Magic!\n\n393\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.686\nThat was actually I copied something\nfrom another file before we started, and\n\n394\n00:19:21.686 --> 00:19:24.346\nI wanted to paste it, so you didn't\nhave to watch me type this text.\n\n395\n00:19:24.346 --> 00:19:27.949\nSo I've started a new document,\nI've got some information into here.\n\n396\n00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:30.753\nBut now it doesn't have a name and\nit doesn't have a home.\n\n397\n00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:32.139\nThat's what I call saving.\n\n398\n00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:36.951\nYou gotta give it a name and a home,\nand that's what you're gonna do.\n\n399\n00:19:36.951 --> 00:19:40.496\nAt this point, when you first\nstart a brand, brand new document,\n\n400\n00:19:40.496 --> 00:19:45.710\nSave and Save As is the same thing because\nit doesn't know where you're going.\n\n401\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.781\nSo you can either come over here to File,\nSave or Save As and\n\n402\n00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:50.421\nit's gonna do the same thing.\n\n403\n00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:51.925\nLet's do it just really quick for fun.\n\n404\n00:19:51.925 --> 00:19:54.360\nNotice that as soon as I clicked Save,\nlook at what it did.\n\n405\n00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.914\nIt's like no, no, no,\nno you can't do that.\n\n406\n00:19:56.914 --> 00:19:59.147\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got to go into Save As,\n\n407\n00:19:59.147 --> 00:20:00.797\nyou've gotta tell me what to do.\n\n408\n00:20:00.797 --> 00:20:05.292\nSo why don't I put this on,\nI'm still gonna go over this\n\n409\n00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:09.415\nBrowse button because I\nwanna put it on my Desktop.\n\n410\n00:20:09.415 --> 00:20:13.037\nLet's go with desktop straight up,\nand notice it is saying HelloWorld.\n\n411\n00:20:13.037 --> 00:20:18.013\nIt's already populating my file name,\nwhy is it?\n\n412\n00:20:18.013 --> 00:20:20.853\nI'm gonna cancel this just so\nyou can see this, and\n\n413\n00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:23.563\nI can click the little x or\nthe Cancel button, and\n\n414\n00:20:23.563 --> 00:20:27.681\nI'm gonna click this button at the top\nto get me out of the backstage view.\n\n415\n00:20:27.681 --> 00:20:32.027\nIt's the first line of the document,\nit will always do that for\n\n416\n00:20:32.027 --> 00:20:37.196\nyou when you first save a file, it'll\ntake it and let that be the file name.\n\n417\n00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:38.891\nSometimes I'm like, hey,\nthat's perfect for me.\n\n418\n00:20:38.891 --> 00:20:39.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n419\n00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:40.514\n&gt;&gt; That's a double edged sword,\n\n420\n00:20:40.514 --> 00:20:41.039\nthat's for sure.\n\n421\n00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:46.264\nSometimes it's great, sometimes it' like\nI didn't want it to be 175 characters.\n\n422\n00:20:46.264 --> 00:20:47.574\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n423\n00:20:47.574 --> 00:20:48.334\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n424\n00:20:48.334 --> 00:20:51.151\nSo if you need it, then that's great.\n\n425\n00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:53.340\nAnd oops, see, I tried to do Save.\n\n426\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.330\nAnd I'm going to click Save As, I'm gonna\ngo to Browse, I will say Hello World, but\n\n427\n00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.175\nif you didn't like that, you can always\nhit the Backspace key on your keyboard.\n\n428\n00:21:01.175 --> 00:21:03.873\nSince it was already highlighted,\nit deleted all.\n\n429\n00:21:03.873 --> 00:21:06.783\nOr you could click off to\nthe right hand side to\n\n430\n00:21:06.783 --> 00:21:10.550\nget your cursor cuz maybe you\nwant Hello World Version 1.\n\n431\n00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.474\n&gt;&gt; Put Hola Earth\n\n432\n00:21:11.474 --> 00:21:12.484\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n433\n00:21:12.484 --> 00:21:15.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you could type it in.\n\n434\n00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.730\nI am gonna just say\nHello World cuz I liked that.\n\n435\n00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.535\nIt is saving it as a Word Document and\nthis is the recent version,\n\n436\n00:21:22.535 --> 00:21:27.030\nnot the 2003 version or older which\nwe talked about in the introduction.\n\n437\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.677\nIt's trying to save in My Documents,\nI wanna save it in my Desktop, so\n\n438\n00:21:32.677 --> 00:21:35.394\nalways take a second to,\nwhat am I naming it?\n\n439\n00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:36.290\nWhere I'm I putting it?\n\n440\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.890\nBecause if I would've just said Save, it's\njust going into My Documents when in my\n\n441\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.981\nbrain, I wanted it on my desktop I just\ndidn't click that which I do a lot.\n\n442\n00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:45.968\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:21:45.968 --> 00:21:48.133\n&gt;&gt; So I've got my name, my home, and\n\n444\n00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:50.307\nnow I've went ahead and did this.\n\n445\n00:21:50.307 --> 00:21:53.148\nSo let's say I wanna update this file.\n\n446\n00:21:53.148 --> 00:21:56.215\nI want to add text.\n\n447\n00:21:56.215 --> 00:21:58.893\nOoh see, this is why I wanted\nyou guys to not see me type.\n\n448\n00:21:58.893 --> 00:22:00.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I've added text.\n\n449\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.021\nI have made changes to this document.\n\n450\n00:22:04.021 --> 00:22:09.281\nNow, if I just wanna update,\nI just wanna take whatever is in here and\n\n451\n00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:11.770\nadd it in, now it's just Save.\n\n452\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:16.243\nSave is Save, add whatever I've done\ninto this file under it's current name,\n\n453\n00:22:16.243 --> 00:22:18.465\nunder it's current home and I am good.\n\n454\n00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:23.502\nSo, I'll go to File, I will go to Save,\nnothing really happens in a sense.\n\n455\n00:22:23.502 --> 00:22:26.555\nThere's like a little\nflash down at the bottom,\n\n456\n00:22:26.555 --> 00:22:28.866\nbut now you have made those changes.\n\n457\n00:22:28.866 --> 00:22:32.544\nThere are times though,\nmaybe this is my copy for\n\n458\n00:22:32.544 --> 00:22:36.130\nlet's say the boss, but\nI need to make a copy and\n\n459\n00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:41.840\nthen put this out to the customers and\nchange some things about it.\n\n460\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.973\nThis is where doing a File, Save As.\n\n461\n00:22:44.973 --> 00:22:50.129\nFile, Save As means that whatever\nis in it right now, you want to not\n\n462\n00:22:50.129 --> 00:22:56.122\ncommit the changes to this particular\nnamed file and the place where it lives.\n\n463\n00:22:56.122 --> 00:23:00.480\nYou wanna either give it\na new name and/or a new home.\n\n464\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.661\nSo that's the difference between Save and\nSave As.\n\n465\n00:23:03.661 --> 00:23:10.988\nSo if I said add text for\nthe customer, do a File Save As.\n\n466\n00:23:13.033 --> 00:23:15.150\nNow, I will keep it on my desktop.\n\n467\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.676\nI'll go through this interface this time,\nand I'll say Hello World,\n\n468\n00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:20.275\nclicking my cursor after the d.\n\n469\n00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:23.076\nAnd then say Customer.\n\n470\n00:23:23.076 --> 00:23:25.813\nAnd now I click Save.\n\n471\n00:23:25.813 --> 00:23:28.670\nI have two different\nversions of this file.\n\n472\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.510\nI have the customer file name,\nand then the hello world.\n\n473\n00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.099\nAnd they have the different text.\n\n474\n00:23:34.099 --> 00:23:35.740\nLet me close this.\n\n475\n00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.758\nI'm gonna go ahead and minimize these two.\n\n476\n00:23:38.758 --> 00:23:42.923\nCome over here,\nI will close my Windows Explorer.\n\n477\n00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:48.535\nHello world, double clicking it,\nit just says Hello World with add text.\n\n478\n00:23:48.535 --> 00:23:50.161\nOops, let me minimize those again.\n\n479\n00:23:50.161 --> 00:23:55.021\n[LAUGH] Hello world Customer,\nit shows that this is the version of\n\n480\n00:23:55.021 --> 00:23:58.897\nthis document with The for\ncustomer added into it.\n\n481\n00:23:58.897 --> 00:24:00.659\nSo save and Save As,\n\n482\n00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:07.120\njust a basic understanding of\nknowing when to do which command.\n\n483\n00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.933\nAnd I will go ahead and\nclose some of these files out.\n\n484\n00:24:09.933 --> 00:24:12.600\nI still have a couple open down there,\ncuz see down there at the task bar?\n\n485\n00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.630\nWhoops, that's my virtual\nmachine coming back up.\n\n486\n00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.060\nI have Hello World and Welcome to Word,\nso these are my two files.\n\n487\n00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.610\nYou could also close these files\nout from the taskbar right here.\n\n488\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.559\nIf I didn't want this, see that red x\nright there in that little kinda mini\n\n489\n00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:29.182\nwindow, I can close that,\nand do the same here.\n\n490\n00:24:29.182 --> 00:24:33.854\nAnd now I've closed all of my files\nthat I was working with in Word,\n\n491\n00:24:33.854 --> 00:24:36.532\nso all those basic functionalities.\n\n492\n00:24:36.532 --> 00:24:42.462\nThe last thing I want to talk\nabout is the keyboard, okay?\n\n493\n00:24:42.462 --> 00:24:46.122\nAgain, you'd be surprised,\nlike what does the Enter key do?\n\n494\n00:24:46.122 --> 00:24:47.491\n&gt;&gt; Lots of stuff [LAUGH].\n\n495\n00:24:47.491 --> 00:24:50.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\nis it Enter or is it Return?\n\n496\n00:24:50.842 --> 00:24:52.418\nWell, depends on your keyboard, and\n\n497\n00:24:52.418 --> 00:24:55.360\nit depends on which\noperating system you have.\n\n498\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.345\nSo Return is, usually I've\nnoticed on the Mac keyboard, and\n\n499\n00:24:59.345 --> 00:25:01.820\nEnter is more on a Windows keyboard.\n\n500\n00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.570\nAnd there's also, what about\nthe Backspace key and the Delete key?\n\n501\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.298\nThey're two different things, well,\n\n502\n00:25:07.298 --> 00:25:08.955\nI guess it depends on\nwhat keyboard you have.\n\n503\n00:25:08.955 --> 00:25:12.328\nThere's a whole multitude of\nkeyboards that you can work with, but\n\n504\n00:25:12.328 --> 00:25:13.820\nthen what does the Tab key do?\n\n505\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.120\nWhat does the spacebar key do,\n\n506\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.540\nthese are all questions I've had from\nteaching Word for many, many years.\n\n507\n00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.790\nSome people are like,\nhow could you not know that?\n\n508\n00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:27.240\nAgain, if you don't work with\nthis day in and day out,\n\n509\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.040\nand you're now in charge of sending\nreports that you never had to do before,\n\n510\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.600\nand you've never even seen a computer.\n\n511\n00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.854\nThese are completely valid questions, so\nunderstanding your keyboard is important.\n\n512\n00:25:39.854 --> 00:25:43.767\nI have a website that, of course we're\non a Wikipedia article, because,\n\n513\n00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:45.440\ngotta love Wikipedia.\n\n514\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.575\nAnd this website, and\nthese are on the show notes,\n\n515\n00:25:47.575 --> 00:25:50.840\nthis actually goes over all sorts\nof different keyboard layouts.\n\n516\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.510\nAnd some of it gets a little techy,\nand a little kind of out there.\n\n517\n00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:58.772\nBut if you think, we're typing in\na language, there's not just English,\n\n518\n00:25:58.772 --> 00:26:01.312\nthere's all sorts of different languages.\n\n519\n00:26:01.312 --> 00:26:04.599\nBut a main keyboard, and\nthere is this particular picture here,\n\n520\n00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:08.850\nthat I like that it kinda color coded\nwhere it talks about the character keys.\n\n521\n00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.070\nAnd then maybe you have a number pad,\nor maybe you don't have a number pad.\n\n522\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.390\nSo what does that do, your arrow keys, and\n\n523\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.080\nthen usually,\nthis group of keys right here.\n\n524\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.095\nAnd just to show you, my setup is,\nI have my Macintosh computer, and\n\n525\n00:26:24.095 --> 00:26:27.010\nI have virtual machines\nthat is running Windows.\n\n526\n00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.454\nWell, a lot of the things\nthat I need to do in Word,\n\n527\n00:26:30.454 --> 00:26:33.820\nI need keys like the Page Up and\nthe Page Down key.\n\n528\n00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.770\nI need the Home and the End key,\nI need a Backspace and\n\n529\n00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.530\nI need a Delete key,\ncuz they do different things.\n\n530\n00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:43.620\nWell, my laptop, it doesn't have\nthose keys, I could make the keys,\n\n531\n00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.880\nI could do all these crazy things\nin my virtual machine to map them.\n\n532\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.650\nSo I actually, I have a full size\nkeyboard connected to my computer.\n\n533\n00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.250\nYes, this is a Macintosh keyboard,\nit's not a Windows keyboard.\n\n534\n00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:59.010\nBut I need that for these keys here,\nand the number pad keys over here,\n\n535\n00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.090\nbecause I use it.\n\n536\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.840\nAnd when I was doing a bunch of different\ntextbook layout, I needed those keys\n\n537\n00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:10.620\nbecause I didn't have enough keys to map\nshortcuts and things that I needed for it.\n\n538\n00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:16.270\nSo just understanding when I talk about,\nhey we're gonna do a Shift or\n\n539\n00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:22.240\na Ctrl+S or a Ctrl+P, what are those,\nwhat is the Control key?\n\n540\n00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.690\nIt's those little keys usually\non the bottom corners, and\n\n541\n00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:29.973\na lot of times this is probably the most\nstandard keyboard you could have.\n\n542\n00:27:29.973 --> 00:27:34.548\nThese group of keys where the Insert,\nthat Insert button, right,\n\n543\n00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:36.501\nthe wonderful Insert button.\n\n544\n00:27:36.501 --> 00:27:40.314\nI'm sure you've probably had people do\nthat when you were doing tech support.\n\n545\n00:27:40.314 --> 00:27:43.958\nWhere it started, any time I type,\nI'm typing over text.\n\n546\n00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:44.525\n&gt;&gt; That's fun, that's a fun time.\n\n547\n00:27:44.525 --> 00:27:48.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, cuz somebody probably\nclicked that Insert key, and\n\n548\n00:27:48.612 --> 00:27:51.000\nthat takes you into override mode.\n\n549\n00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.064\nAnd override mode means that when you\nstart typing, anything that was above it,\n\n550\n00:27:55.064 --> 00:27:59.152\nor below it, I would say, you're typing\nover it instead of moving the text off.\n\n551\n00:27:59.152 --> 00:28:00.608\nOoh, big one.\n\n552\n00:28:00.608 --> 00:28:01.162\n&gt;&gt; Gonna pass [LAUGH].\n\n553\n00:28:01.162 --> 00:28:04.633\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nthen why are my numbers not working?\n\n554\n00:28:04.633 --> 00:28:09.460\nYour Num Lock's on, that little button\nup at the top over on that number pad.\n\n555\n00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.590\nYour arrow keys, so just getting\nfamiliar with what these keys,\n\n556\n00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.250\nwhere they are, for one thing, and\nthen what they're going to do.\n\n557\n00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.550\nSo I am going to be referencing\nlike the Page Up and Page Down.\n\n558\n00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.569\nI'm going to be giving you keyboard\nshortcuts about Ctrl+S and Ctrl+P and\n\n559\n00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:25.770\nCtrl+O and Ctrl+N.\n\n560\n00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:30.460\nIf you think about it,\nwhat are all the things we just went over?\n\n561\n00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:35.017\nOpen, well, we didn't do print but\nprint, save, so\n\n562\n00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:39.392\nCtrl+S is save,\nCtrl+O is open, Ctrl+N is new.\n\n563\n00:28:39.392 --> 00:28:42.408\nAnd there's different things that you\ncan do when we start getting into\n\n564\n00:28:42.408 --> 00:28:43.170\nselecting text.\n\n565\n00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.724\nHolding your Control key with some\nof these keys, it can do some really\n\n566\n00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:51.700\nfascinating things for you that, hey, you\ndon't always have to always use the mouse.\n\n567\n00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.427\nNothing wrong with it, but\nknowing what the keys do.\n\n568\n00:28:54.427 --> 00:28:58.810\nYou need to make a character turn or\nan Enter mark, you hit the Enter key.\n\n569\n00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.984\nYou need to hit the Tab key,\nwell that's what the Tab key does.\n\n570\n00:29:01.984 --> 00:29:05.530\nAnd then all of the different\nother modifiers that you have.\n\n571\n00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.770\nThese are the ones right here,\nlike the super and the meta,\n\n572\n00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:11.490\nif you're on a Windows keyboard,\nyou usually have the Windows key there.\n\n573\n00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.830\nAnd then there's, isn't there like, it's\nkind of like a weird page looking thing,\n\n574\n00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.532\ndo you remember?\n\n575\n00:29:15.532 --> 00:29:16.242\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n576\n00:29:16.242 --> 00:29:20.000\n&gt;&gt; This key right over here,\nthe meta key on the keyboard.\n\n577\n00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.442\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, not familiar with it.\n\n578\n00:29:22.442 --> 00:29:25.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it was always like,\nthere was always the Windows key,\n\n579\n00:29:25.005 --> 00:29:26.860\nand it looked like\na little piece of paper.\n\n580\n00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.764\n&gt;&gt; Like a little, is that what that is?\n\n581\n00:29:28.764 --> 00:29:32.652\n&gt;&gt; I never used it, I don't even know-\n&gt;&gt; Does it allow you to add metadata into\n\n582\n00:29:32.652 --> 00:29:33.408\nthe like?\n\n583\n00:29:33.408 --> 00:29:33.935\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n584\n00:29:33.935 --> 00:29:34.463\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n585\n00:29:34.463 --> 00:29:36.811\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I never really clicked it [LAUGH].\n\n586\n00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:40.755\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it shows the metadata\nof the selected item, or,\n\n587\n00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:42.826\nhere's me guessing [LAUGH].\n\n588\n00:29:42.826 --> 00:29:45.570\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you have keys you don't\nneed to use, so that's all right.\n\n589\n00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.490\nBut just knowing where they are, and\n\n590\n00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:52.850\nI do have a list of keyboard shortcuts,\nbookmark this, start using them.\n\n591\n00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.456\nIf you can start getting your head\naround using keyboard shortcuts and\n\n592\n00:29:57.456 --> 00:30:02.920\nusing the keys while you're doing things,\nin Word or any of your Office programs,\n\n593\n00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.613\nor programs in general,\nit will make your life easier.\n\n594\n00:30:06.613 --> 00:30:09.593\nIt might take a while,\nit's like breaking in a new pair of shoes,\n\n595\n00:30:09.593 --> 00:30:12.810\nyou just gotta keep walking in them and\nthen they'll feel fantastic.\n\n596\n00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.500\nSo those are all the different things\nthat I wanna go over with our Word and\n\n597\n00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.980\nWindows basics.\n\n598\n00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.081\nSo you can be comfortable, and we can\nmove on into working in the environment.\n\n599\n00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:25.411\nAnd then by the end of this,\nyou're gonna know all the shortcuts for\n\n600\n00:30:25.411 --> 00:30:27.232\nall the things that you need to know.\n\n601\n00:30:27.232 --> 00:30:30.524\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Vonne, thank you so\nmuch for the Word basics.\n\n602\n00:30:30.524 --> 00:30:33.483\nHopefully we're now getting that\nmore foundational knowledge, so\n\n603\n00:30:33.483 --> 00:30:36.780\nthat we don't overlook anything,\nas we continue down our series.\n\n604\n00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.960\nThat being said, I'm looking at our clock,\n\n605\n00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.420\nlooks like we are [COUGH], excuse me,\nout of time for this episode.\n\n606\n00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.903\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n607\n00:30:43.903 --> 00:30:44.773\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n608\n00:30:44.773 --> 00:30:47.027\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n609\n00:30:47.027 -->

us.\n\n5\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.730\nWe are working on our Word 2016 series,\nit's been a lot of fun so far.\n\n6\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.995\nJoining us yet again in the studio,\nour good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:25.680\nVonne, so glad to have you again,\nhow's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.935\n&gt;&gt; It's going great and yes, you know,\nnot knowing your name sometimes and\n\n9\n00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:32.367\nnot know where like the, what is that\nribbon thing, what is that status bar?\n\n10\n00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:32.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n11\n00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Kind of the same thing.\n\n12\n00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:35.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean\n\n13\n00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.840\nit's kind of like the theme of the show.\n\n14\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.610\nWhere are we going?\n\n15\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.285\nWhat are we doing?\n\n16\n00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:39.802\nWhere am I?\n\n17\n00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:41.490\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who am I?\n\n18\n00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.301\nAm I me?\n\n19\n00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.593\n[LAUGH] Are you me?\n\n20\n00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:45.090\nAm I you?\n&gt;&gt; I know, and\n\n21\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.010\nif you've watched any of our other shows,\nam I Joey?\n\n22\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.759\nAm I Justin, right?\n\n23\n00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:49.415\nAm I Lance?\n\n24\n00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that gets fun.\n\n25\n00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:54.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, [LAUGH] we're\ngonna continue on with Justin.\n\n26\n00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.530\nSo, we have his computer ready to go and\n\n27\n00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.640\nwe're gonna get familiar\nwith the Word interface.\n\n28\n00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.180\nGetting familiar with the environment\nin which you are working in.\n\n29\n00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.754\nSo when I say, go over to this tab and\nclick this particular button, or\n\n30\n00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:12.711\nlook down at the status bar, or click\nthe button on the quick access toolbar,\n\n31\n00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:15.179\nyou know what those things actually are,\n\n32\n00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.370\neven if I use my terminology of\nlike that thingy thing over there.\n\n33\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.918\nYou know, and I kinda rename it.\n\n34\n00:01:20.918 --> 00:01:25.611\nYou'll at least have this episode to have\nthe correct terminology of what we're\n\n35\n00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:26.516\nworking with.\n\n36\n00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:28.865\n&gt;&gt; I would love to see the Vonne Smith\nversion of technical writing.\n\n37\n00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:30.961\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It gets fun!\n\n38\n00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:33.269\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I make up all sorts of fun,\n\n39\n00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:34.600\ninteresting words.\n\n40\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.860\nSometimes where I'm just like, I don't\nknow what just came out of my mouth.\n\n41\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So from here to here,\n\n42\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.600\n&gt;&gt; There's a disconnect.\n\n43\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:42.408\n&gt;&gt; It happens a lot, so.\n\n45\n00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:45.301\nLet's open up the Word 2016 folder because\n\n46\n00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:50.288\nI have a file, and while we're not really\nworking in the file, I wanted to go ahead\n\n47\n00:01:50.288 --> 00:01:52.515\nand just get something up for us.\nSo\n\n48\n00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:57.230\nwhy don't we do Welcome to Word,\ndouble click on that, open up.\n\n49\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.100\nIt's still in that restored down state\nfrom the other episode that I had filmed\n\n50\n00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.240\nwith the Windows and Word Basics.\n\n51\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.950\nSo definitely check that out.\n\n52\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.690\nLet's go ahead and maximize this.\n\n53\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.334\nAnd I have my file opened and ready to go.\n\n54\n00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:12.422\nLike I said,\nwe're talking about the environment.\n\n55\n00:02:12.422 --> 00:02:14.930\nWhere am I, what are we doing?\n\n56\n00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.380\nThis is the same for\nall of your Office products.\n\n57\n00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.680\nSo if you've worked in Excel, or\nif you've worked in PowerPoint, or\n\n58\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.760\neven Outlook,\nthis is going to be the same.\n\n59\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.466\nAnd it's nice that they've kind of made\nit a little bit more the same, I guess.\n\n60\n00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:33.113\nThey have continuity across all\nthe products to where one environment\n\n61\n00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:35.892\nis pretty much the same as\nthe other environment, but\n\n62\n00:02:35.892 --> 00:02:38.450\nthere might be specific\ntabs across the ribbon.\n\n63\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.450\nSee I'm already using that terminology.\n\n64\n00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.980\nThat are specific for\nWord versus PowerPoint.\n\n65\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.453\nThere's a Slide Show tab in PowerPoint.\n\n66\n00:02:46.453 --> 00:02:49.096\nYou're not gonna see that in Word.\n\n67\n00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.083\nBut you will see some of\nyour other common tabs.\n\n68\n00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:55.870\nSo the ribbon,\nthe ribbon is this area across the top.\n\n69\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.960\nAnd it has different tabs along\nthe ribbon that have different commands.\n\n70\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.930\nSo right now we are currently\non the Home tab.\n\n71\n00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.946\nThat is the active tab within this ribbon.\n\n72\n00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:12.673\nIf I wanted to go over to the Inserts tab,\nsingle click, don't double click.\n\n73\n00:03:12.673 --> 00:03:14.781\nYou single click that particular tab and\n\n74\n00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:18.470\nthen it brings up all of\nthe commands on this particular tab.\n\n75\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.570\nYou go over to Design, you go over\nto Layout, References, Mailings,\n\n76\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.000\nReview and View.\n\n77\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.870\nSo these are your common tabs that are in\nWord when you start the program up.\n\n78\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.900\nLet's go back over to Home, single\nclicking, and we'll stay on this part for\n\n79\n00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.787\na second and in each one of these tabs,\nyou have groups.\n\n80\n00:03:37.787 --> 00:03:42.689\nThe groups are the names across\nthe bottom of each one of these kind of\n\n81\n00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.420\nseparated spaces.\n\n82\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.860\nSo there's little lines in here as well.\n\n83\n00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.100\nSo you can see that this is the group for\nthe Clipboard.\n\n84\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.025\nThis is the group for Font, Paragraph,\nStyles, Editing and so on and so forth.\n\n85\n00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:57.537\nThe other thing that it might\nlook a little different on your\n\n86\n00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:00.114\ncomputer versus my computer,\nif you're following along.\n\n87\n00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:04.726\nIt all depends on your monitor\nresolution because your ribbons\n\n88\n00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:07.880\nare resolution fluid we'll call it.\n\n89\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.420\nIf I restore down,\nyou can see that my ribbon,\n\n90\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.070\nwhen I make it a little bit smaller,\nI have different buttons that come across\n\n91\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.220\nbecause there's only so much that they can\nshow with the real estate that I have.\n\n92\n00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.425\nSo you do have a dynamic ribbon for\nyour monitor resolutions\n\n93\n00:04:26.425 --> 00:04:31.118\nto see more or\nless of the commands across these tabs.\n\n94\n00:04:31.118 --> 00:04:36.067\nThe other hing is in your groups,\nnot all groups but some of your groups,\n\n95\n00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:41.033\nyou have what is technically known\nas the dialogue box launcher button.\n\n96\n00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:44.990\nYeah, I know, I can't be able to,\nit's just the More button, okay?\n\n97\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.430\nIt's more commands that are available,\nthen notice like the editing group,\n\n98\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.880\nit doesn't have a little more button,\n\n99\n00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.630\nbecause all the options that are in\nthe editing group are shown.\n\n100\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.077\nSo if I clicked on let's say the dialog\nbox launcher button see, it's so long.\n\n101\n00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:05.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It just doesn't roll\noff the tongue very well does it.\n\n102\n00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.200\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah but\nthe More button, that works.\n\n103\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.730\nSo we click on the More button and\nit brings me into the dialog box.\n\n104\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.400\nSometimes I refer to this as the old\nschool box because this is what you used\n\n105\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.240\nto see in some of your older versions of\nWord or any of your other Office products.\n\n106\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.880\nYou can see that these are all the\ndifferent things that you can do with your\n\n107\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.360\nfont that do correlate over into here.\n\n108\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.550\nBut maybe a few other things like\nthe small caps and the all caps.\n\n109\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.150\nYou don't see that in the buttons\nacross the ribbon by default.\n\n110\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.480\nSo the More dialogue box launcher button,\nwill be across there as well.\n\n111\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.031\nNow I kept saying,\ndon't double click on yourthe ribbon or\n\n112\n00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:47.119\nthe tabs along the ribbon.\n\n113\n00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:51.380\nThe only reason why I'm saying that\nis because those are shortcuts or\n\n114\n00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.390\ndifferent commands you could\nsay to minimize the ribbon.\n\n115\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.205\nSo let me show you.\n\n116\n00:05:56.205 --> 00:06:00.131\nI'm gonna double click on Insert,\nlet me double click, there.\n\n117\n00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:05.013\n[LAUGH] And it kinda like sucked itself\nback up into the tide like where did all\n\n118\n00:06:05.013 --> 00:06:06.640\nthe buttons go?\n\n119\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.790\nYou just collapsed it.\n\n120\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.841\nIf you double click it again,\nyou can see it comes back out.\n\n121\n00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:12.046\n&gt;&gt; It could also be a help desk call.\n\n122\n00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:13.618\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n123\n00:06:13.618 --> 00:06:15.704\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you know how I figured that out?\n\n124\n00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:16.818\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you had to call the help desk.\n\n125\n00:06:16.818 --> 00:06:20.879\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I became my own help desk,\n\n126\n00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.120\nbecause I'm like what did I just do?\n\n127\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.250\n&gt;&gt; What is going on?\n\n128\n00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.550\n&gt;&gt; And it took me a while.\n\n129\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like, I didn't even realized I\n\n130\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.830\ndouble clicked on this.\n\n131\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.910\n&gt;&gt; But you do accidental double\nclicks from time to time, yeah.\n\n132\n00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.790\nThey occur and\nthen weird things like this happen and\n\n133\n00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.320\nif you don't know that's what supposed\nto occur, then you're just going, okay.\n\n134\n00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I just totally broke this.\n\n135\n00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.091\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And again have the Outlook show I did\n\n136\n00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:45.710\nlast week for-\n&gt;&gt; Depending on when [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n137\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.550\n&gt;&gt; Time is relative when\nyou're watching recordings.\n\n138\n00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.440\n&gt;&gt; 17 years ago, I did that Outlook show.\n\n139\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.815\n&gt;&gt; I kept saying single, I double clicked\nthrough the entire episode like really?\n\n140\n00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.552\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Stop doing it.\n\n141\n00:06:56.552 --> 00:06:59.510\n&gt;&gt; It's just,\nyour brain gets into that habit.\n\n142\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.700\nBut it is collapsed in the ribbon, and\nthe nice thing is they didn't use to\n\n143\n00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.000\nhave this back in the day, but\nyou have this Ribbon Display Options\n\n144\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.800\nbutton at the very top of basically\nyour title bar where you click it and\n\n145\n00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.675\nnotice it has Auto Hide Ribbon,\nShow Tabs, Show Tabs in Command.\n\n146\n00:07:16.675 --> 00:07:18.797\nSo there's actually three levels.\n\n147\n00:07:18.797 --> 00:07:21.677\nAuto hiding the ribbon means that,\nit's like completely gone.\n\n148\n00:07:21.677 --> 00:07:23.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And it's auto hiding.\n\n149\n00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:27.268\nIt's kind of like, every once in\na while they might see in the show,\n\n150\n00:07:27.268 --> 00:07:31.343\nthat it pops up my Mac keyboard or my\nMac Doc because I'm in a virtual machine.\n\n151\n00:07:31.343 --> 00:07:33.898\nBut it's like if I come down far enough,\nthey're like, oops, there it is.\n\n152\n00:07:33.898 --> 00:07:38.356\nSo it's the same thing here that\nif I hover up close enough,\n\n153\n00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:42.560\nit brings up the blue bar and\nthen I can click it.\n\n154\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.240\nGives me the commands,\nwhoops too far again [LAUGH].\n\n155\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.030\n[LAUGH] there's that virtual machine.\n\n156\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.840\nAnd then it comes down.\n\n157\n00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.362\nBut if I click back in my document,\nthen it goes away.\n\n158\n00:07:49.362 --> 00:07:55.277\nSo it's kinda staying out of the way,\nif you wanted it to.\n\n159\n00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:58.840\n&gt;&gt; It works really well when you\nhave like, Not a large screen, so\n\n160\n00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.001\nall those tool bars and\nribbons, and things like that,\n\n161\n00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:06.250\nthey start taking up real estate on\nwhat you can see in your document.\n\n162\n00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.921\nIf you wanna be able to see a bit more,\nyou can start hiding things,\n\n163\n00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.600\nmakes it a little easier to view.\n\n164\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean that's a great example.\n\n165\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.582\nPersonally, I like to see the ribbon.\n\n166\n00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:16.227\nAnd I usually have monitors and\n\n167\n00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:19.206\nresolutions that are high\nenough to allow me to do that.\n\n168\n00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:22.664\nBut that's a fantastic example of\nwhy you might want to hide it.\n\n169\n00:08:22.664 --> 00:08:23.337\nTo each his own,\n\n170\n00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:26.900\nyou can do whatever makes you feel\ncomfortable with your environment.\n\n171\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.659\nNow, I have that same button,\nit's kinda small up there, but\n\n172\n00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:32.530\nI'm hovering to discover to show\nthe ribbon display options,\n\n173\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.232\nto where maybe I just wanna show the tabs.\n\n174\n00:08:34.232 --> 00:08:37.800\nNow this is like a halfway point,\nit's not showing the commands,\n\n175\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.560\nit's just gonna show you\nthe tabs along the top.\n\n176\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.220\nSo if I go over here to Layout,\nnotice that it's, and\n\n177\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.710\nalso if I scroll down a little bit,\nnotice how it kind of like hovers over\n\n178\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.857\nthe document, not a big deal,\nif that's what you want.\n\n179\n00:08:51.857 --> 00:08:54.763\nAnd if I click back,\ndo you see how it kind of like,\n\n180\n00:08:54.763 --> 00:08:58.540\nit only brings down the commands\nwithin that tab when I need them, and\n\n181\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.280\nthen it kind of sucks it back up\nto the top when I'm not using it.\n\n182\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.440\nSo you could do that, or\nyou go ahead and go to the show tabs and\n\n183\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.470\nthe commands, and then it always\nhas that space over there and\n\n184\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.830\nthat way it never kind\nof goes away in a sense.\n\n185\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.130\nAnd it's still hovering over my text,\nbut that's just how it goes.\n\n186\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.750\nSo knowing how to control the ribbon,\nand what you're\n\n187\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.989\ndoing when you're double-clicking it,\nand what that button does.\n\n188\n00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:31.756\nGood to know, so you don't get kind of\nfreaked out like I did the first time, and\n\n189\n00:09:31.756 --> 00:09:34.675\nthen had to spend quite\na while to figure that out.\n\n190\n00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:37.613\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You were really scratching\nyour head, where did these things go?\n\n191\n00:09:37.613 --> 00:09:38.262\nIt's just gone.\n\n192\n00:09:38.262 --> 00:09:39.645\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and\n\n193\n00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:43.140\nI had to scour the Internet there for\na while to figure it out.\n\n194\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.982\n&gt;&gt; Adam calls it the oracle of\nthe Internet, it knows everything, right,\n\n195\n00:09:45.982 --> 00:09:47.576\nyou just ask, Google, that is Google.\n\n196\n00:09:47.576 --> 00:09:49.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, or Bing.\n\n197\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.372\n&gt;&gt; Bing, you could go Bing,\nif you don't want the answer.\n\n198\n00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:54.807\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry, Microsoft.\n\n199\n00:09:54.807 --> 00:09:58.085\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It'll give you different answers,\n\n200\n00:09:58.085 --> 00:09:58.930\nI'll put it that way.\n\n201\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.545\n&gt;&gt; There, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It does, cuz it does.\n\n202\n00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:03.070\n&gt;&gt; There's more than one right answer.\n\n203\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.368\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes.\n\n204\n00:10:04.368 --> 00:10:06.577\n&gt;&gt; There's more answers,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n205\n00:10:06.577 --> 00:10:10.317\n[LAUGH] If it's a multiple choice,\nthere is more than one right answer.\n\n206\n00:10:10.317 --> 00:10:12.526\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n207\n00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:16.448\nSo yes, if you need to find something, cuz\nthere will always be certain situations\n\n208\n00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:19.060\nwhere you're like,\nI have no idea what's going on.\n\n209\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.980\nThat's okay,\nthat's why you go to the Oracle.\n\n210\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.645\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n211\n00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:23.923\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's keep going across this ribbon,\n\n212\n00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:26.607\nwe're in the File tab, or\nthe File Backstage view,\n\n213\n00:10:26.607 --> 00:10:28.135\nas it is technically called.\n\n214\n00:10:28.135 --> 00:10:32.080\nWe did go over this in the Windows and\nWord basics, but these are where you find\n\n215\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.087\nyour common commands like Save, Save as,\nPrint, your Share, your document\n\n216\n00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:40.535\ninformation with all the different things\nthat you can do with your security.\n\n217\n00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:45.915\nThe big one that I wanna point out is\nthis is where you go to your Options.\n\n218\n00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:49.814\nThere is something else like hit some\nweird shortcut, I don't even remember what\n\n219\n00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:53.374\nit was, but it started displaying\nthings in my Word document, I'm like,\n\n220\n00:10:53.374 --> 00:10:55.254\nI don't even know how to turn this off.\n\n221\n00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:57.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And somehow it checked off this box of\n\n222\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.730\nlike show hidden somethings.\n\n223\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.310\nWow, that was really detailed, wasn't it?\n\n224\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.657\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I see where you're\nat now, I'm totally with you.\n\n225\n00:11:03.657 --> 00:11:05.583\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Show hidden somethings.\n\n226\n00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:08.133\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah,\nyou know that thing that did that thing?\n\n227\n00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:09.626\n&gt;&gt; Man, show me more of that.\n\n228\n00:11:09.626 --> 00:11:10.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:13.050\n&gt;&gt; Well, it was something in one of these\n\n230\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.750\nadvance options of where it started\ndisplaying some weird things.\n\n231\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.030\nBut I just wanted to show you, and\n\n232\n00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.490\nlike you see, Show text boundaries,\nShow cropmarks.\n\n233\n00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.330\nIt was one of these that I did,\nor something along that line.\n\n234\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.890\nI think it was the field codes instead of\ntheir values, maybe that was what it was.\n\n235\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:31.940\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n236\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.018\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what field codes\n\n237\n00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:36.566\nare [LAUGH], and\nneither did you until that day.\n\n238\n00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:37.336\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n239\n00:11:37.336 --> 00:11:39.074\nSo it's just kind of like [NOISE].\n\n240\n00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:42.966\nSo it gets a little weird, but sometimes\nyou might throw a shortcut that does this.\n\n241\n00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:47.594\nBut always coming into your options,\nthere's tons and tons of options that you\n\n242\n00:11:47.594 --> 00:11:52.362\ncan customize your environment even more\nthat you always want it to do something,\n\n243\n00:11:52.362 --> 00:11:55.430\nor how is it going to treat copying and\npasting?\n\n244\n00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.520\nHow is it going to display the different\nformatting marks on your screens?\n\n245\n00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.146\nMaybe always show this, and\n\n246\n00:12:01.146 --> 00:12:05.138\nthat was one I did on my Mac was,\nI know I keep clicking this button, but\n\n247\n00:12:05.138 --> 00:12:09.492\nI overrode those settings here in this\noptions that the preferences in Mac.\n\n248\n00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:13.752\nSo it was throwing me all off, but\nthat was a couple hours there too.\n\n249\n00:12:13.752 --> 00:12:14.252\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n250\n00:12:14.252 --> 00:12:17.743\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So the options are always\na good thing to know where they are at.\n\n251\n00:12:17.743 --> 00:12:19.107\nI'm gonna cancel this and\n\n252\n00:12:19.107 --> 00:12:23.430\njust coming back over to that File,\nthese are, again, your Backstage view.\n\n253\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.470\nYou get into your file, oops, I gotta get\nout, you can either click the button at\n\n254\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:31.070\nthe top, you can also hit your Esc key on\nyour keyboard, that'll bring you back.\n\n255\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.310\nSometimes it throws people off, cuz\nthey're like, I've lost my file, it's, no,\n\n256\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.180\nyou're just in the Backstage view,\n\n257\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:41.230\nyou're behind the scenes to be able to\ndo all of those different commands.\n\n258\n00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.190\nThere are some other tabs that are gonna\ncome on across the ribbon from time to\n\n259\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.760\ntime, depending on where you're at,\nthey're known as Contextual Tabs.\n\n260\n00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.890\nContextual Tabs come up when you are on,\nsay, this beautiful picture of a bunny.\n\n261\n00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.464\nAnd notice that at the top,\nit's not highlighted right now, but\n\n262\n00:12:59.464 --> 00:13:01.633\nyou have a new option for a Format tab.\n\n263\n00:13:01.633 --> 00:13:06.715\nIf I click off this, notice the Format\ntab is not there, so it is bringing up\n\n264\n00:13:06.715 --> 00:13:12.366\ntabs that are only needed when you\nare selected on that particular item.\n\n265\n00:13:12.366 --> 00:13:16.266\nLike if you're on a table, you'll see\ntable options, you see picture tools, or\n\n266\n00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:20.830\nthere might be table tools, and\nthen you'll have two tabs with the tables.\n\n267\n00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.470\nMaybe you have a chart or smart art,\nall of these different things come up, and\n\n268\n00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.690\nnotice if I have the picture tools format,\nI can do things like format my picture and\n\n269\n00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.450\nput a little border around it, and\ndo some other things like that.\n\n270\n00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.570\n&gt;&gt; This is that select to affect\nthing you always talk about, right?\n\n271\n00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.728\nYou've selected, and\nnow it's showing you how you can affect.\n\n272\n00:13:38.728 --> 00:13:42.760\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, select to affects,\nhover to discover,\n\n273\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.282\nand when in doubt, right-click.\n\n274\n00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:45.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n275\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.986\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't rhyme.\n\n276\n00:13:46.986 --> 00:13:48.496\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it's like, hey,\n\n277\n00:13:48.496 --> 00:13:51.868\nI don't know what to do on this,\nlet me right-click on that picture,\n\n278\n00:13:51.868 --> 00:13:53.710\nbrings up this Contextual menu, or?\n\n279\n00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.285\n&gt;&gt; When in doubt,\ngive right-click a shout?\n\n280\n00:13:55.285 --> 00:13:56.660\nI don't know what I'm trying here.\n\n281\n00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.171\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n282\n00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.111\nWhen in doubt, give right-click a shout.\n\n283\n00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:02.397\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n284\n00:14:02.397 --> 00:14:03.742\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\nyou just rocked my world right there.\n\n285\n00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:04.997\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:14:04.997 --> 00:14:05.969\n&gt;&gt; Well, you keep the theme,\n\n287\n00:14:05.969 --> 00:14:07.020\nas they're rhyming, so.\n\n288\n00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.165\n&gt;&gt; I know, now I just have to remember it,\nso remind me.\n\n289\n00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:10.770\n[LAUGH] That's awesome.\n\n290\n00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.564\nSo you're either right-clicking on the\npicture versus right-clicking on the text,\n\n291\n00:14:14.564 --> 00:14:17.010\nbut it's not an executable click.\n\n292\n00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:22.485\nIt doesn't do anything, it just gives you\noptions, so when in doubt, check it out.\n\n293\n00:14:22.485 --> 00:14:23.156\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n294\n00:14:23.156 --> 00:14:24.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, wow.\n\n295\n00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.076\nOkay, sorry,\nI'm over here entertaining myself.\n\n296\n00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:28.971\n&gt;&gt; She's a poet and didn't know it, yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n297\n00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:31.452\n&gt;&gt; This is so great, I love rhyming.\n\n298\n00:14:31.452 --> 00:14:37.880\n[LAUGH] So the different Contextual Tabs\nacross your ribbon, when needed.\n\n299\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.370\nLet's move on to the Quick Access Toolbar,\n\n300\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.425\nthe Quick Access Toolbar is right up\nhere in the top left-hand corner.\n\n301\n00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:47.133\nIt doesn't really have\nmuch on there right now,\n\n302\n00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:51.442\nbut the Quick Access Toolbar is items\nthat you can quickly access at any time.\n\n303\n00:14:51.442 --> 00:14:52.847\nWhen you're on your tabs and\n\n304\n00:14:52.847 --> 00:14:57.023\nyour ribbon, you'll have to go to that\nspecific tab to get to that command, but\n\n305\n00:14:57.023 --> 00:15:01.410\nthe Quick Access Toolbar never leaves,\nit's always up there.\n\n306\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.340\nSo you can add commands instead of say,\nI know one that I specifically do,\n\n307\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.800\nI insert a lot of screenshots,\nand it's on the insert, and\n\n308\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.930\nthen you go into Screenshot, and\nthen there's Screen Clipping.\n\n309\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:18.524\nCuz I'm always making demonstration type\nhandouts and step-by-step tutorials,\n\n310\n00:15:18.524 --> 00:15:20.382\nso I'm always using this button.\n\n311\n00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:24.789\nBut do you see I had to go click, click,\nclick to get to the command that I wanted?\n\n312\n00:15:24.789 --> 00:15:27.588\nWell, I just add it on my Quick Access\nToolbar, and I just click it once and\n\n313\n00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:30.390\nI'm right there, so\nit doesn't even matter what tab I'm on.\n\n314\n00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.050\nSo, it's really, really handy.\n\n315\n00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.725\nHow can I get more commands\non that Quick Access Toolbar,\n\n316\n00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:37.160\nthe little droppy down button?\n\n317\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.180\nTechnical, you can customize\nthe Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n318\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.083\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say bribery.\n\n319\n00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:42.604\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:15:42.604 --> 00:15:43.414\n&gt;&gt; Man, this is way easier.\n\n321\n00:15:43.414 --> 00:15:44.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:44.228 --> 00:15:44.728\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n323\n00:15:44.728 --> 00:15:45.948\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n324\n00:15:45.948 --> 00:15:47.086\nThere's a ransom.\n\n325\n00:15:47.086 --> 00:15:49.211\nSo we have different commands\n\n326\n00:15:49.211 --> 00:15:53.229\nthat are most common, that you could add.\nI do wanna talk about\n\n327\n00:15:53.229 --> 00:15:56.996\nthis Touch/Mouse Mode, so I'm just gonna\ngo ahead and add it on for right now.\n\n328\n00:15:56.996 --> 00:15:58.963\nAnd notice that it Adds a button on\n\n329\n00:15:58.963 --> 00:16:02.762\nthe Quick Access toolbar.\nMaybe another one that I do a lot is\n\n330\n00:16:02.762 --> 00:16:07.384\na Quick Print, or Print Preview and Print.\nIt brings up my Print dialogue box, so\n\n331\n00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:08.064\nI can do that.\nSo,\n\n332\n00:16:08.064 --> 00:16:10.515\nI don't have to keep going over\nto the File and the Print,\n\n333\n00:16:10.515 --> 00:16:14.795\nor you could just use Ctrl+P, and\nyou can go ahead and print there.\n\n334\n00:16:14.795 --> 00:16:17.405\nBut you have more commands because\nmaybe they're not on that,\n\n335\n00:16:17.405 --> 00:16:21.645\nInsert Screenshot, it's not here\non this like commonly used ones.\n\n336\n00:16:21.645 --> 00:16:25.285\nIf I go over here to More Commands,\nit brings me into the options\n\n337\n00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:29.005\nof where I was just at from the other\nplace of where I can customize it.\n\n338\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.850\nOver on the left, you have to\nchoose where the command lives and\n\n339\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.740\nthen you put it over on the right to\nwhere this is your Quick Access toolbar.\n\n340\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.576\nI know that that Insert Screenshot or\nScreen Clipping is in the Insert tab.\n\n341\n00:16:42.576 --> 00:16:44.565\nSo you do have to kind of\nknow where it's at, or\n\n342\n00:16:44.565 --> 00:16:47.694\nif you don't just go to all commands and\nit lists it off alphabetically.\n\n343\n00:16:47.694 --> 00:16:51.180\nYou'll be scrolling for\na long time because they're all in there.\n\n344\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.800\nSo, I'm gonna go to the Insert tab,\nshowing me the commands on the Insert tab.\n\n345\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.398\nI can come down into, I think it's down\nhere, a little Insert Screen Clipping.\n\n346\n00:16:58.398 --> 00:17:06.820\nThere it is,\nthere's the Screen Clipping right there.\n\n347\n00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:11.210\nSo, I find the command that I want,\nI click Add, and now it's right there.\n\n348\n00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.470\nDon't have to go all the way\nthrough all those tabs, and so\n\n349\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.960\nyou can customize this\nto your heart's content.\n\n350\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.140\nYou can add them all the way across and\nhave everything you ever\n\n351\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.450\nuse only on the Quick Access toolbar and\nnever use the ribbon.\n\n352\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.981\nWell, I guess it's possible [LAUGH].\n\n353\n00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:29.462\nI see some pretty in depth\nQuick Access toolbars.\n\n354\n00:17:29.462 --> 00:17:30.937\n[LAUGH] And things to that nature.\n\n355\n00:17:30.937 --> 00:17:34.090\nYeah, so I mean,\njust what is your environment?\n\n356\n00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.130\nMake it to where you're comfortable.\n\n357\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.790\nThe other one that I wanted to point out\nis the Show Quick Access below the ribbon.\n\n358\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.830\nThat is in that little\ndrop down menu as well.\n\n359\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.930\nCuz it's kind of far away,\nif you wanna say, like real estate wise,\n\n360\n00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.020\nlike it's above the ribbon.\n\n361\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.081\nYou put it below the ribbon, and it just\nmakes it a little quicker to access.\n\n362\n00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:56.924\nIt does make a little bit more room\non that whole area up there, so\n\n363\n00:17:56.924 --> 00:18:00.615\nif you want it,\nthat's where you want to put it.\n\n364\n00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:02.241\nI think I like it there better.\n\n365\n00:18:02.241 --> 00:18:02.973\nI do too.\n\n366\n00:18:02.973 --> 00:18:04.123\nYeah.\nIt's quicker.\n\n367\n00:18:04.123 --> 00:18:06.308\nYeah, it's cleaner as well, I think.\n\n368\n00:18:06.308 --> 00:18:07.162\nMm-hm, yeah, and\n\n369\n00:18:07.162 --> 00:18:10.590\nit's closer to all the things that I'm\ngoing to be doing in my document anyways.\n\n370\n00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.670\nRight, kinda puts it more, way off in the\ndistances there's a lot outside of mind,\n\n371\n00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.970\nI think, and having it here\nbrings it more into focus for me.\n\n372\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.540\nIn my version of all my Office files,\nit's always on there.\n\n373\n00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:29.640\nThe Touch Mouse mode, pointing this out,\ndepending on your monitor, maybe\n\n374\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.060\nyou have a touch screen monitor, maybe\nyou don't have a touch screen monitor.\n\n375\n00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.630\nSo, you could optimize it for\nthe spacing between the commands.\n\n376\n00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.390\nWatch, if I click on the touch one, see\neverything gets spread out a little bit\n\n377\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.330\nmore because you've got your\nfingers clicking on things, and\n\n378\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.690\nwhen they're close together,\nyou might hit the wrong one.\n\n379\n00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.600\nSo, you can space an isle a little bit\nmore if you are using touch monitors\n\n380\n00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.400\nthere, or if you are in mouse mode,\nyou don't really need that much room.\n\n381\n00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.230\nYou go ahead and\nmake them a little bit smaller.\n\n382\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:03.270\nI love that command because sometimes\nI like to give it a little more space.\n\n383\n00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:08.230\nBut then you have really large hands, so\nthat makes it a little more difficult to.\n\n384\n00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.310\nIt's so close.\n\n385\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.930\nThat's why a lot of phones and\nstuff will kind of give you a preview.\n\n386\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.480\nWhich one of these did\nyou want to click on?\n\n387\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.260\nSo mobile devices will try to do that for\nyou.\n\n388\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.350\nBut here it's just like make it\nbigger on my mobile platform.\n\n389\n00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.440\nThere you go.\n\n390\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.440\nIt's nice that they've added that and it's\nnice that it's right in that drop down so\n\n391\n00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.300\nthat people don't have to go hunting for\nit.\n\n392\n00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.080\nSo it's like hm,what is that?\n\n393\n00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.290\nTry it.\nLet's send it.\n\n394\n00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.400\nDon't know what it is, try it.\n\n395\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.588\nThe worst that can happen is turn\nit on and turn it off again.\n\n396\n00:19:34.588 --> 00:19:36.346\n[LAUGH] You double-click something and\n\n397\n00:19:36.346 --> 00:19:39.141\nyou spend three hours trying to\nfigure out where you were going.\n\n398\n00:19:39.141 --> 00:19:41.110\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Exactly, yep, exactly.\n\n399\n00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:45.100\nSo let's move on down in\nthe sense of the status bar.\n\n400\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.490\nThe status bar, sorry,\nI clicked on something else.\n\n401\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.550\nI was actually in the Selection pane area.\n\n402\n00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.460\nWatch the Select Text episode and\nto know what I'm talking about.\n\n403\n00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.110\nDown at the bottom this is a status bar.\n\n404\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:59.560\nThe status bar is very handy because it\ngives you the status of where you're at.\n\n405\n00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.310\nLike right now, I'm on page one of seven.\n\n406\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.860\nI already know that we have\n4,194 words in this document,\n\n407\n00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.460\nso I've got a word count going and\nmy pages.\n\n408\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.020\nBehind my head actually there's a couple\nother buttons over here on the right-hand\n\n409\n00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.020\nside and this is where you can get\ninto your different document views and\n\n410\n00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.480\nyour zoom of your document.\n\n411\n00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.930\nSo I can click this little plus\nsign to zoom in a little bit,\n\n412\n00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.970\nclick this minus sign to zoom out.\n\n413\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:31.780\nWe're going in more in depth into document\nviews and zooms in the next episode.\n\n414\n00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.260\nIf you're watching in succession.\n\n415\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.110\nSo we kind of explore all of those.\n\n416\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.890\nBut those are the other buttons that\nare across the bottom of the status bar.\n\n417\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:46.460\nStatus bar is very important and you need,\nwell, I would suggest that you customize\n\n418\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.550\nit when we get into more advanced\nfeatures of Word, such as sections.\n\n419\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.310\nAnd if you're doing\ndocuments with sections,\n\n420\n00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.480\nif you don't know what section you're in,\nthat can kind of throw you off.\n\n421\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:01.320\nYou can customize your status bar by\nright-clicking on the status bar.\n\n422\n00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.388\nAnd there's all these different things\nthat you can put in the status bar to let\n\n423\n00:21:05.388 --> 00:21:06.430\nyou know.\n\n424\n00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.680\nWe had mentioned something\nabout the insert\n\n425\n00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.510\nkey on the keyboard when we were\ndoing our Window and Word Basics,\n\n426\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:17.948\nabout getting into override or\novertype mode versus the insert mode.\n\n427\n00:21:17.948 --> 00:21:22.310\nSo having that there might give you\na nice indication of whether you're\n\n428\n00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.440\nin the overwrite mode or the insert mode.\n\n429\n00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.630\nCaps lock.\n\n430\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.490\nHey, is my caps lock on?\n\n431\n00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.380\nMaybe your little button,\nthat little green light,\n\n432\n00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.710\nmaybe you don't have a green light.\n\n433\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.080\nI think, yeah,\nsome keyboards don't have green lights.\n\n434\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.830\nYeah, it's possible.\n\n435\n00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.140\nYeah.\nI'm like.\n\n436\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.890\nYeah.\nIt's been\n\n437\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.220\na while since I've had a keyboard\nwithout a green light.\n\n438\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.630\nBut you could go ahead and\nchange all of these different things.\n\n439\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.180\nLike I said, the section.\n\n440\n00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.610\nThat's a big thing for me.\n\n441\n00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.420\nAnd sometimes,\nI'll even do columns and line numbers,\n\n442\n00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.660\nbecause I use those from time to time.\n\n443\n00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:56.030\nSo adding different things that you\nwant to display on your status bar.\n\n444\n00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:01.000\nYou'll know how by right-clicking\non it and customizing it.\n\n445\n00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.870\nLast few little things\nabout our environment.\n\n446\n00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.920\nThe tell me what you want me to do.\n\n447\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:07.910\nThat's your help menu.\n\n448\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.150\nTell Me.\n[LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n449\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.910\nYeah, I mean, I'm kind of half and\nhalf on this.\n\n450\n00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.730\nCouldn't you say like help, question\nmark because it's been that way forever.\n\n451\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.350\nBut okay,\nit's the way that Microsoft wants to go.\n\n452\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:25.510\nSo if you click in here and if you wanted\nto say like where are the sections?\n\n453\n00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.070\nI don't know what a section is?\n\n454\n00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:31.470\nAnd so you can see that, well,\nwe went ahead and split view, didn't we?\n\n455\n00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:32.480\nYes you did.\n\n456\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.500\nThat's very interesting that\nit went ahead and did that.\n\n457\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.710\nNow luckily I know that\nthat's what we did so\n\n458\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.620\nif I go to view and\nwe should remove the split, hm.\n\n459\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.180\nVery strange.\n\n460\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.791\nAll right so maybe we should go\nuse the help files online [LAUGH].\n\n461\n00:22:47.791 --> 00:22:50.510\n[LAUGH] Just go on the Internet and\n\n462\n00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.620\ntype in something in Google and\nBing and find out what the answer is.\n\n463\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.850\nBecause it's going to direct you to the\nsame place that this tell me what to do.\n\n464\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:02.020\nIt's going to take you to like\nthe Microsoft Office help files or\n\n465\n00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.440\nhelp webpages and so just kind of fix it.\n\n466\n00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.860\nAnd there's no way to get to the help,\nthere's no more like local help files?\n\n467\n00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.900\nI don't think so.\n\n468\n00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.290\nYou know I might not know that.\n\n469\n00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.980\nI'm assuming.\nGo to file.\n\n470\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.390\nIt's gonna go out.\n\n471\n00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:24.340\nJust Let's go get help on print and\nwe will print the document in Word.\n\n472\n00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:24.950\nOkay.\n\n473\n00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:25.930\nBut it is loading.\n\n474\n00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.150\nIt's still yeah, so\nthis is kind of like always to play it.\n\n475\n00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:32.530\nI'm gonna say, they probably have\nthe local help files but- It really seemed\n\n476\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.400\nlike it was pulling from the net though.\n\n477\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.730\nYeah, so I'm gonna- Could we swear to it?\n\n478\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.850\nI'm gonna leave that one on,\nif you're not connected to the Internet,\n\n479\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.150\ntry it out and see if it happens.\n\n480\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.600\nI don't know when I'm not\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n481\n00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.870\nIt's very rare.\n\n482\n00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.368\nVery rare.\nIt's one of those like,\n\n483\n00:23:49.368 --> 00:23:53.002\nI haven't been unconnected in a long time.\n\n484\n00:23:53.002 --> 00:23:57.162\n[LAUGH] But they did have the local help\nfiles, in the older versions of Word,\n\n485\n00:23:57.162 --> 00:23:59.502\nthey always had it built into the program,\n\n486\n00:23:59.502 --> 00:24:02.634\nbecause we didn't have\nConstant Internet connection.\n\n487\n00:24:02.634 --> 00:24:07.500\nSo I'm gonna throw that\non a let's wait and see-\n\n488\n00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll withhold judgement [LAUGH].\n\n489\n00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll go with a maybe.\n\n490\n00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's absolutely,\npositively a maybe.\n\n491\n00:24:14.897 --> 00:24:15.397\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n\n492\n00:24:15.397 --> 00:24:16.189\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n493\n00:24:16.189 --> 00:24:18.200\n&gt;&gt; So we have our help file, or\n\n494\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.840\nour help area.\n\n495\n00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.140\nAnd then the last couple things we\nhave that we are connected, and\n\n496\n00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.100\nwe are logged into our account because\nthis is an Office 365 subscription.\n\n497\n00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:32.263\nSo if you don't see that in yours,\nyou might have a standalone version\n\n498\n00:24:32.263 --> 00:24:38.170\nwhere you're not on a subscription-based\nmodel for your program.\n\n499\n00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:42.570\nAnd then the other last things\nare the Share and the Comment buttons.\n\n500\n00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.707\nThe Share is where if you were going to\nshare this document with people, like say\n\n501\n00:24:46.707 --> 00:24:50.690\non the Web, and in cloud, or you were\ngoing to just send it as an attachment.\n\n502\n00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.970\nAnd it then automatically\nbrings up your Outlook program,\n\n503\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:59.675\nyour mail editor, and then being\nable to send it right from Word,\n\n504\n00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:04.430\nrather than opening up Outlook and\nadding it as an attachment.\n\n505\n00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.610\nSo, or cloud-based sharing,\nwhich is very cool as well.\n\n506\n00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:12.613\nNotice that this does bring up\nover here on the right hand side,\n\n507\n00:25:12.613 --> 00:25:15.031\nthis is known as a task pane or\njust a pane.\n\n508\n00:25:15.031 --> 00:25:15.769\nSometimes it can be a pain.\n\n509\n00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:17.536\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just kinda in your way.\n\n510\n00:25:17.536 --> 00:25:18.759\n&gt;&gt; P-A-I-N.\n\n511\n00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:22.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yes, the homonyms?\n\n512\n00:25:22.895 --> 00:25:23.791\nIs that what that is?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n513\n00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:24.823\n&gt;&gt; Homonym?\n&gt;&gt; Homonyms.\n\n514\n00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:26.311\n&gt;&gt; Words that sound-\n&gt;&gt; The same, but are spelled differently?\n\n515\n00:25:26.311 --> 00:25:26.911\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n516\n00:25:26.911 --> 00:25:27.455\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n517\n00:25:27.455 --> 00:25:29.342\n&gt;&gt; And so, the English language.\n\n518\n00:25:29.342 --> 00:25:30.490\n&gt;&gt; It's a fun time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n519\n00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.510\n&gt;&gt; I can always close this pane over here.\n\n520\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.040\nAnd then, the comments.\n\n521\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.640\nThis is where if you are going\nto be using track changes.\n\n522\n00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.050\nOr not even track changes, you're\njust wanting to comment up a document\n\n523\n00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.710\nto be able to collaborate with people.\n\n524\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.700\nYou could go ahead and click that\nNew Comment, and it brings it right in.\n\n525\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.950\nNow, if you're not familiar with using\nthese, we will have episodes on that.\n\n526\n00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.824\nAnd I just did a little fancy thing\non the keyboard, of a good old undo.\n\n527\n00:25:53.824 --> 00:25:54.655\nDon't forget about Undo.\n\n528\n00:25:54.655 --> 00:25:58.615\nIt is on your Quick Access toolbar,\nto where if you make a mistake,\n\n529\n00:25:58.615 --> 00:26:00.260\nit's your uh-oh button.\n\n530\n00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.180\nYou can go back, and\nyou could also go forward with your Redo.\n\n531\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.115\nI almost said Command.\n\n532\n00:26:05.115 --> 00:26:05.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Control,\n\n533\n00:26:05.885 --> 00:26:08.771\n[CROSSTALK] we're in the Windows version.\n\n534\n00:26:08.771 --> 00:26:12.640\nCtrl+Z, and Ctrl+Y is Redo.\n\n535\n00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.975\nBut at least you know Undo,\nit's your best friend.\n\n536\n00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:18.024\nYeah, right?\n\n537\n00:26:18.024 --> 00:26:19.040\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n538\n00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.348\n&gt;&gt; Understatement of\nthe year right there [LAUGH]\n\n539\n00:26:21.348 --> 00:26:22.261\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so and\n\n540\n00:26:22.261 --> 00:26:27.205\nI think that actually covers\neverything in our Word environment.\n\n541\n00:26:27.205 --> 00:26:28.675\nSo you are familiar with everything.\n\n542\n00:26:28.675 --> 00:26:30.884\nYou know where your spoons, and\nyour knives, and your cups.\n\n543\n00:26:30.884 --> 00:26:33.735\nAnd you're ready to bake a wonderful cake.\n\n544\n00:26:33.735 --> 00:26:36.300\nAnd yes, it always comes back to\nsomehow with kitchen and food, so.\n\n545\n00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.075\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love your analogies, Vonne.\n\n546\n00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:40.213\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's why I always enjoy working\n\n547\n00:26:40.213 --> 00:26:41.085\nwith you.\n\n548\n00:26:41.085 --> 00:26:44.630\nIt gets me hungry, and then I gotta\ngo eat and stuff myself stupid.\n\n549\n00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.685\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm feeling the same way, so.\n\n550\n00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:48.043\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it.\n\n551\n00:26:48.043 --> 00:26:48.585\nAll right, Vonne.\n\n552\n00:26:48.585 --> 00:26:53.290\nThanks for showing us the [COUGH]\nbasic fundamentals of Word and\n\n553\n00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.120\nits options that we have available to us.\n\n554\n00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.630\nSo we know what each one of them are,\n\n555\n00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.012\nbuilding our foundational\nknowledge of the product.\n\n556\n00:27:00.012 --> 00:27:02.970\nBut for looking at the clock,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n557\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.947\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n558\n00:27:04.947 --> 00:27:05.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n559\n00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.325\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.287\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:11.287 --> 00:00:16.053\nAnd in today's episode we are moving\non with more in our Word 2016 series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:19.286\nAnd of course, joining us back in\nthe studio, gracing us with her presence,\n\n6\n00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:20.844\nour good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:22.116\nVonne, so glad to have you again.\n\n8\n00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:22.669\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.861\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n10\n00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:27.640\n[LAUGH] When you said gracing, I just\nhad to do this hand wave right there.\n\n11\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Give me some gloves that go up to here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.501\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can do the wave.\n\n13\n00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:31.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n14\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.262\n&gt;&gt; Yes, elbow, elbow, wrist, wrist.\n\n15\n00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:33.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.540\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n17\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.250\nI never heard that.\n\n18\n00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.772\nThat's good.\n\n19\n00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:37.540\n&gt;&gt; Denise.\n&gt;&gt; Denise?\n\n20\n00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.391\n&gt;&gt; Yes, our owner's wife taught me that.\n\n21\n00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:42.976\nElbow, elbow, wrist, wrist.\n&gt;&gt; Is she a beauty queen?\n\n22\n00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:43.725\n&gt;&gt; Something or she had to do.\n\n23\n00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:44.249\n&gt;&gt; She probably was.\n\n24\n00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] I know she's gorgeous.\n\n25\n00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:46.517\n&gt;&gt; She's a pretty lady, yeah.\n\n26\n00:00:46.517 --> 00:00:48.351\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, so anyways,\n\n27\n00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:53.382\n[LAUGH] moving on we are talking\nabout document views and zoom.\n\n28\n00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:57.166\nSo, a little bit more with our,\nit's almost like our interface, but\n\n29\n00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:01.272\nit's more about the interface of our\ndocument and getting, starting, and\n\n30\n00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:03.148\nnavigating around our document.\n\n31\n00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:07.964\nWe will have another episode called\nNavigate a Document that kinda\n\n32\n00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:10.150\ngoes hand and hand with it.\n\n33\n00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.970\nBut I wanted to break it apart because\nthere's actually a lot to go over with\n\n34\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.720\njust how you can see your document,\nand how you can zoom in and out of it.\n\n35\n00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.760\nSo let's get started.\n\n36\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.749\nJumping down into our Welcome to Word\ndocument, I already have a file open for\n\n37\n00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:28.142\nus to get ready to go.\n\n38\n00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:32.334\nThis view that we're actually\nlooking at this page is in\n\n39\n00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:36.175\nthe Print Layout version or\nthe Print Layout view.\n\n40\n00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:40.437\nAnd if we're gonna be talking about views,\nwhat tab do you think we're gonna go to?\n\n41\n00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:41.075\n&gt;&gt; File.\n\n42\n00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:44.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, that is wrong.\n\n43\n00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.620\nIt is View.\n\n44\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.570\n&gt;&gt; Man, I almost had it, almost had it.\n\n45\n00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.930\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna come over here to View,\nand we are in the Print Layout.\n\n46\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.245\nAnd we're also in the Vertical\npage movement view.\n\n47\n00:01:55.245 --> 00:02:00.127\nThis is, I would, I'm safely gonna say,\nthis is like the default view.\n\n48\n00:02:00.127 --> 00:02:00.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.290\n&gt;&gt; And this is what people\nmostly use Word, this view in.\n\n50\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.600\nSo these are what we've got across\nthe top of all the different views.\n\n51\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.020\nBut there's a lot of different buttons\non here, so what do they all do?\n\n52\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.140\nAnd this really quickly, behind my head,\n\n53\n00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.640\nthere are some buttons down here that we\nhad gone over on the interface where you\n\n54\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.160\ncould go into the read mode by clicking\nthe button, the Print Layout button,\n\n55\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.060\nand then the Web Layout, and\nthen the zooming slides over here.\n\n56\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.920\nBut I am going to concentrate\non the ribbon, but\n\n57\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.710\njust wanted to show you that there's more\nthan one way to get somewhere in Word.\n\n58\n00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.454\nThere's usually about 15 different ways.\n\n59\n00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:38.962\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n60\n00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:42.020\n[LAUGH] Someone says,\ndid you know you could do that?\n\n61\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.682\nNo, I didn't, that is option number six.\n\n62\n00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:44.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n63\n00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.650\nlet's start with read mode since\nit's the first one on the ribbon.\n\n64\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.330\nNow where did it take me to?\n\n65\n00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.985\nIt almost looks like a book, like this\nis where we're going to be reading.\n\n66\n00:02:55.985 --> 00:03:00.455\nI don't know how many times I'm\ngoing to read a long story in Word.\n\n67\n00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.995\nIf I'm gonna be reading a book, I'm\nprobably gonna be using another app there,\n\n68\n00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:08.990\nbut at least we know that\nthis is what it is, wow.\n\n69\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.876\nOkay, circle.\n\n70\n00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:11.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sometimes you might\n\n71\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.560\neven open a document, maybe somebody sent\nit to you and it was already in this view.\n\n72\n00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.110\nSo that can be a little misleading.\n\n73\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.860\nIt's like, I thought this was a Word\nfile that I'm supposed to have a ribbon.\n\n74\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.990\nCuz my environment looks very,\nvery different in this read mode.\n\n75\n00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.019\nBeing aware of it and\nhow to leave it is always a good one.\n\n76\n00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.778\nI'll show you how to leave it right\nnow before we get into the option.\n\n77\n00:03:33.778 --> 00:03:37.924\nIt's in the View menu within the read\nmode and it doesn't say exit,\n\n78\n00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:42.240\nthat's another kinda of confusing,\nit's just Edit the Document.\n\n79\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.360\nIf you go to Edit the document, you're\nswitching back in the Print Layout mode\n\n80\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.960\nand back into normal land,\nif you wanna call it.\n\n81\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.930\nSo how do I get out of\nreading mode is always nice.\n\n82\n00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.780\nLet's go back into it and\nlook at some of these options, though.\n\n83\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.070\nYou have these buttons on the left and\nright hand\n\n84\n00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.590\nside that have little arrows for turning\nthe page, like move over, move over.\n\n85\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.505\nSo you can move through your\ndocument by clicking those buttons.\n\n86\n00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:08.184\nBut back on that view menu,\n\n87\n00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:13.446\nthere's a couple other things that you can\ndo with changing how your read mode looks,\n\n88\n00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:17.271\nlike maybe I wanna change the page color,\nI want a sepia tone.\n\n89\n00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:20.268\nOr maybe, it's easier for\nme to do the inverse,\n\n90\n00:04:20.268 --> 00:04:23.276\nwhere you have a dark background and\nwhite text.\n\n91\n00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:27.366\nIt also kinda depends on the lighting\nthat you have in your room.\n\n92\n00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:30.350\nA lot of our phones now\nhave night view mode or\n\n93\n00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.350\nwhere it kinda takes the blues down and\neverything.\n\n94\n00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.090\nSo it's similar to that.\n\n95\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.130\nSo I could change what type of page color,\nyou could always come in here and\n\n96\n00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.450\nchange the layout.\n\n97\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.580\nMaybe I want it in a paper\nlayout instead of a column view.\n\n98\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.700\nIt's up to you.\n&gt;&gt; It could be.\n\n99\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.350\n&gt;&gt; Could be, you come over to Column,\nbut if I come over to Column,\n\n100\n00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.800\nI could also change the column width.\n\n101\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.550\nI can make it narrow, make it three\ncolumns, different viewing methods.\n\n102\n00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.110\n&gt;&gt; Give you plenty of options,\nthat's for sure.\n\n103\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthis is kind of an interesting one.\n\n104\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.920\nThe syllables,\nit breaks them up into syllables.\n\n105\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.590\nAnd I thought that was int-\n&gt;&gt; So it's good for, maybe,\n\n106\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.800\nnot native English speakers or something?\n\n107\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.090\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was thinking,\n\n108\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.394\nof how we actually speak in our very\ninteresting language that we have.\n\n109\n00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:17.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; English is a weird language.\n\n110\n00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:19.097\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n111\n00:05:19.097 --> 00:05:22.410\n&gt;&gt; So it's nice that it goes ahead and\nbreaks that up for you.\n\n112\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.220\nAnd then you also have,\nthat's a little to much.\n\n113\n00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.600\nBut hey, it helps for-\n&gt;&gt; We've gone crazy.\n\n114\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and maybe for accessibility.\n\n115\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.840\nMaybe it's hard to be able to\nkind of show where the lines are.\n\n116\n00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.738\nMan, I keep hitting that\nvirtual machine today.\n\n117\n00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:37.810\n[LAUGH] So you could always come back and\nchange these, and\n\n118\n00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.270\nyou could have it read aloud to you.\n\n119\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.280\nSo that's an option in the reading mode.\n\n120\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.480\nDifferent things that you could do,\nI wouldn't probably do much with\n\n121\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.400\nediting a document in the Read mode,\nbut at least you know it's here and\n\n122\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.270\nthere are some things, you can use\nthe Find, and you can use the Smart Lookup\n\n123\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.960\nwhen we talk about proofing our documents,\nwe'll learn more about that.\n\n124\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.480\nTo leave our Reading mode,\n\n125\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.810\nyou can always come down to\nthe buttons down on the bottom left,\n\n126\n00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.450\nthat would be the other left,\nthe other right hand side of the sides.\n\n127\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.520\nBut I just go to View and go to Edit the\ndocument and back in my Print Layout mode.\n\n128\n00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.200\nLet's check out some of the other ones.\n\n129\n00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.460\nThe Web Layout mode.\n\n130\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.146\nNow, this mode is where it's\nsuppose to show you how it\n\n131\n00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:24.880\nwould look if this was in a web page.\n\n132\n00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.810\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting.\n\n133\n00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.690\nWord is an HTML editor, correct?\n\n134\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.579\nSo this make sense that\nthis option's in here.\n\n135\n00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n136\n00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.280\nBut as somebody that [LAUGH],\nyou gotta, yes.\n\n137\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.855\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n138\n00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:40.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But as somebody that codes web pages-\n\n139\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Not your default go to kind of thing.\n\n140\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.410\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not gonna use\nWord to build a web page.\n\n141\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.780\nWell, you can.\n\n142\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, you might.\n\n143\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n144\n00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.746\n&gt;&gt; The option is there.\n\n145\n00:06:49.746 --> 00:06:52.368\n&gt;&gt; A very simple web page,\nyou could do it.\n\n146\n00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:59.760\nAnd you do have the option of saving this\nor exporting it as an HTML file from Word.\n\n147\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.810\nBut like I said, it's kind of\nlike eating soup with a knife.\n\n148\n00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.090\n&gt;&gt; It can be done.\n\n149\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI mean you get like a tiny little-\n\n150\n00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.660\n&gt;&gt; But it is painful.\n\n151\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.001\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, It's probably not the best so\n\n152\n00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:13.514\nyou probably want a spoon.\n\n153\n00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:18.136\n&gt;&gt; Just like you said, you're probably not\nworking on developing a corporate website\n\n154\n00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:21.535\nor something that's gonna make money and\nbe revenue driven.\n\n155\n00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:23.739\nIt's gonna be just a very simple plan,\nhey,\n\n156\n00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:27.940\nI need to throw a webpage up to put out an\ninvitation or something like that, right?\n\n157\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Very simple stuff and\n\n158\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.850\nit can be done here.\n\n159\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.310\nSo it's a nice feature.\n\n160\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.080\n&gt;&gt; Having the right tool for\nthe right job.\n\n161\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.270\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; This is a document processor and this\n\n162\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:42.470\nis great for typing out long documents,\nshort documents, making a simple flyer.\n\n163\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.664\nEven when I say that, I'm like, well,\nPublisher's actually better than that.\n\n164\n00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:47.046\nAnd then you wanna go- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But you might not have Publisher.\n\n165\n00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:47.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n166\n00:07:47.702 --> 00:07:48.916\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo there you go.\n\n167\n00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:52.960\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it can do a lot of cool stuff.\n\n168\n00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.779\nYou could write a textbook in Word.\n\n169\n00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:58.967\nBut I would use InDesign,\nbecause it would start to like-\n\n170\n00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:00.069\n&gt;&gt; Because that is was is meant to do.\n\n171\n00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:01.421\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n172\n00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:05.086\nSo, just knowing what you need to do Yay,\nWeb Layout,\n\n173\n00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:08.753\nlet's move out of there,\nlet's go to the other ones,\n\n174\n00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:13.717\nOutline view, this one can throw people\noff and they get a little scared.\n\n175\n00:08:13.717 --> 00:08:16.166\nThey're like,\nwhat are all these plus signs,\n\n176\n00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:18.931\nwhy do I have all of these\nbubbles next to everything?\n\n177\n00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:22.214\nIf you think about what's an outline,\nit's an outline,\n\n178\n00:08:22.214 --> 00:08:26.590\nyou have different sections and\nyou have different parts of it.\n\n179\n00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.305\nThis will be very handy if\nyou're using Word with styles,\n\n180\n00:08:31.305 --> 00:08:36.613\nif you start using Heading 1s,\nHeading 2s, things like that.\n\n181\n00:08:36.613 --> 00:08:40.558\nIf you use that type of styling and\nformatting,\n\n182\n00:08:40.558 --> 00:08:43.426\nthis can be really handy because.\n\n183\n00:08:43.426 --> 00:08:45.738\nIf you have everything under a Heading 1,\n\n184\n00:08:45.738 --> 00:08:48.280\nwhich this one is\nformatted with a Heading 1.\n\n185\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.021\nSee the plus sign, you can select it, but\nyou could also click the minus sign, and\n\n186\n00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:55.863\nyou can collapse it,\nwell, that's a bad idea.\n\n187\n00:08:55.863 --> 00:08:57.022\n&gt;&gt; If you select it.\n\n188\n00:08:57.022 --> 00:09:01.270\n&gt;&gt; There we go, so I can collapse this\ndown, because think about a book,\n\n189\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.080\nsuch as Alice in Wonderland.\n\n190\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.669\nThere's many, many chapters, and\nif you're an editor or something,\n\n191\n00:09:07.669 --> 00:09:12.120\nmaybe you realize, chapter two and\nchapter three need to be flipped.\n\n192\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.930\nIf you were in, what,\nyou have to select it all?\n\n193\n00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.311\nIf you are here you can just drag and\ndrop them so\n\n194\n00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.705\nit keeps it in sections\nin an outline version.\n\n195\n00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:22.556\nWhere you can collapse and expand and\n\n196\n00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:25.310\nbe able to move some things\naround a little bit easier.\n\n197\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.101\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif you were creating a document for\n\n198\n00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:29.877\na presentation that you were gonna\npass out to a group of people.\n\n199\n00:09:29.877 --> 00:09:33.185\nAnd it was just the outline of\nthe presentation, this'll be great for\n\n200\n00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:33.810\nthat right?\n\n201\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.350\nThrow in all the outline, print it out,\npass it out around the table, and\n\n202\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.050\neverybody could follow.\n\n203\n00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz they don't need all the details,\n\n204\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.540\nyou'll have all the paragraphs but\nthe main heading levels.\n\n205\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.430\nThat might be just enough for\nthem to follow along, so\n\n206\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.600\nbeing able to do that\nhere is pretty handy.\n\n207\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.880\nAnd so the different levels but again if\nyou don't use headings it's not gonna\n\n208\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.458\nreally work to its fullest potential.\n\n209\n00:09:55.458 --> 00:09:59.460\nSo you could click on Chapter 2,\nand I can collapse that, so\n\n210\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.150\nnow you can see if I can\ncollapse all of them down.\n\n211\n00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.110\nAnd then I could always come\nback into here to Show Levels,\n\n212\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.680\nif I wanna show all my levels, see.\n\n213\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.620\nThen it goes ahead and gives me everything\ndown from whether Heading 1, 2, 3, 4,\n\n214\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.149\nor into the basic paragraphs.\n\n215\n00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:21.130\nYou also use Outline View if you start\ngetting into what's known as a master\n\n216\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.810\ndocument, long story short,\nbecause we have other episodes about this.\n\n217\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.010\nIf you think about a master document,\n\n218\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:33.070\nyou have the big one that has individual\ndocuments and they all come together.\n\n219\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.342\nSo you could have chapters\nin individual files,\n\n220\n00:10:36.342 --> 00:10:40.470\nlike actual Word files and\nthen have a master document that says.\n\n221\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.120\nLet me show them all together, but\n\n222\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.330\nthey're really in separate files,\ndifferent ways of doing it.\n\n223\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.370\nDifferent ways or organizing it and they\nare called subdocuments, so clicking on\n\n224\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.460\nthat button gets you into this mode but\nyou do have to be in Outline View.\n\n225\n00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.690\nTo be able to start using master\ndocuments, and then of course\n\n226\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.320\nshowing the first line only, notice\nthat this is showing the first line of.\n\n227\n00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.390\nEach one of those paragraphs, and then\nshowing the text formating whether or not,\n\n228\n00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.540\nbecause it does give you\ncertain font sizes and colors.\n\n229\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.090\nThis is just if you take the formatting\noff, it's not taking it off of the actual\n\n230\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.560\nfile, it's just a view mechanism for\nusing the outline view.\n\n231\n00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.170\nIf you wanna get out of\nthe Outline View just close it and\n\n232\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.922\nthen you're back into Print Layout,\nlet's go back over to that View tab.\n\n233\n00:11:26.922 --> 00:11:30.520\nThe only other one before we\nexplore some of the other parts\n\n234\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.585\nof the zooming would be the Draft version.\n\n235\n00:11:32.585 --> 00:11:38.108\nDraft version is Print Layout\nwithout showing things like margins,\n\n236\n00:11:38.108 --> 00:11:42.210\npage breaks,\nthat right there is your page break.\n\n237\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.597\nSo it's not showing you the space that it\n\n238\n00:11:46.597 --> 00:11:51.501\nwould actually live in\non the printed paper,\n\n239\n00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:57.971\nit's just the text as text,\nI've never really used this.\n\n240\n00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:02.858\nBut I know people can and they do,\nI just still prefer personally to be in\n\n241\n00:12:02.858 --> 00:12:06.218\nPrint Layout so I know,\nthere are my margins.\n\n242\n00:12:06.218 --> 00:12:10.820\nThere is an actual break in the page,\nit's a physical representation of\n\n243\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:16.110\nprinted paper on the screen so\nI can see all of that.\n\n244\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:22.600\nSo that is the main view that I will be\nworking in throughout this entire show.\n\n245\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.300\nYou're more than welcome to use\nwhatever view you want, but\n\n246\n00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.710\nthis is the one we're gonna stick with.\n\n247\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:32.414\nSome other things across the top in\nthis View menu or this View tab,\n\n248\n00:12:32.414 --> 00:12:35.702\n[LAUGH] Still using that\nterminology of menus.\n\n249\n00:12:35.702 --> 00:12:40.061\nRulers, gridlines, and navigation pane,\n\n250\n00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:46.482\nI use the ruler a lot because I do\na lot of formatting with tab stops,\n\n251\n00:12:46.482 --> 00:12:50.397\nI love tab stops, they're fantastic.\n\n252\n00:12:50.397 --> 00:12:52.245\nThey're very confusing at first,\n\n253\n00:12:52.245 --> 00:12:55.210\nbut once you master them your\nworld becomes a lot easier.\n\n254\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.090\nYou can also see your indents on here,\nand the space for\n\n255\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.670\nyour margins, I use this so frequently\nthat I always have to turn this check on.\n\n256\n00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.510\nIt's the first thing I do when I turn\non Word, once I already have it,\n\n257\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.870\nit's already there, but\na new installation, gotta show that ruler.\n\n258\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.500\nGridlines, I don't really need\nthe gridlines, [LAUGH] But they are there.\n\n259\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.110\nSay you are trying to lay something out,\nyou're putting a lot of pictures on,\n\n260\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.510\nyou wanna be able to lay\nthem out specifically.\n\n261\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.510\nYou could turn that gridlines on so\nit does have functionality, and\n\n262\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.710\nthen the navigation pane.\n\n263\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.110\nThis is what comes over on the left\nhand side to help us navigate\n\n264\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.230\nalong our document.\n\n265\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:36.510\nSo, if I wanted to go to the different\npages, then I can jump through\n\n266\n00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:42.310\nmy pages here, depending on how your\ndocument is set up with stylized headings.\n\n267\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:47.610\nYou could go ahead and navigate for your\ndocument by heading levels as well, so\n\n268\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.480\nthat navigation pane is there.\n\n269\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.042\nThe vertical now, we're scrolling, which\nwhen we get into navigating documents,\n\n270\n00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:57.880\nthat's one way you can, well,\nnavigate your document.\n\n271\n00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.022\n&gt;&gt; Navigate your document, yeah.\n\n272\n00:13:59.022 --> 00:14:03.054\n&gt;&gt; But it's going up or down because\nwe're in vertical page movement, but\n\n273\n00:14:03.054 --> 00:14:04.651\nyou can also go side to side.\n\n274\n00:14:04.651 --> 00:14:07.144\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, now that's fancy.\n\n275\n00:14:07.144 --> 00:14:08.520\n&gt;&gt; I know, I think it's super cute.\n\n276\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.480\n&gt;&gt; I actually really like it, because it\nmakes me feel like I'm reading a book,\n\n277\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.000\nI'm so used to that format\nthat it's helpful for me.\n\n278\n00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.766\n&gt;&gt; And a scrollbar,\n\n279\n00:14:14.766 --> 00:14:18.300\nnotice the scrollbar comes at the bottom\ncuz now we're going this way.\n\n280\n00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.820\nAnd it actually has that\nphysical sensation of\n\n281\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.050\nmoving through the book and\nso you can move back and\n\n282\n00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.980\nforth, so I like the-\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n283\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.409\n&gt;&gt; I think it's really cute so, and\nthen you can come into the thumbnails view\n\n284\n00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:36.506\nin the side to side to where I'm,\nI wanna come over to page four.\n\n285\n00:14:36.506 --> 00:14:40.154\nAnd it brings me into\nwhere I have page four and\n\n286\n00:14:40.154 --> 00:14:45.340\nfive because this is in a facing\npages layout in side to side.\n\n287\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.670\nCome back and over to vertical notes,\nthumbnails go away when I'm not\n\n288\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.130\nin side to side view, that you know\nit's just something different.\n\n289\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.130\nSo you can move this around, and again,\nI'm not changing anything in my text,\n\n290\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.210\nI'm not changing anything in the document.\n\n291\n00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:04.060\nIt's just how I'm seeing it, so no\nmodifications to the actual information.\n\n292\n00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.580\nMoving over to our Zooms,\ndifferent things,\n\n293\n00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.710\nthat if I zoom in and out of the document,\n\n294\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.840\nnow this one I will go behind my\nhead just for a second to show you.\n\n295\n00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:21.393\nSo if I go down to the zoom here, I have\na little slider, yeah, the slidery thingy,\n\n296\n00:15:21.393 --> 00:15:25.490\n[LAUGH] So I can pull this guy in\nthe middle to slide to the right.\n\n297\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.430\nZoom in, pull it to the left, slide to\nthe left, there's where it was breaking so\n\n298\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.740\nyou see how it broke out\ninto multiple pages?\n\n299\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.970\nIf I zoom far enough out and\nif I zoom in and\n\n300\n00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:42.910\nsometimes if you go too fast it\nneeds to reset itself, there.\n\n301\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:50.741\nSo it will show multiple pages side\nby side if you zoom far enough out.\n\n302\n00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:55.645\nIf I come up here,\nthere are some controlling things that you\n\n303\n00:15:55.645 --> 00:15:59.500\ncan do with your zoom,\nif I stick with one page.\n\n304\n00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.615\nI just want to have a single page and\nif I zoom out a little bit more,\n\n305\n00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:09.823\nyou see, it's not gonna put it\nacross the side and show me multiple\n\n306\n00:16:09.823 --> 00:16:15.790\npages next to each other because I'm\nforcing it to only do one page at a time.\n\n307\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.294\nYou can also do 100%.\n\n308\n00:16:17.294 --> 00:16:20.098\nThe 100% view and\nI like that button really quickly.\n\n309\n00:16:20.098 --> 00:16:23.187\nSo I can just like nope this is,\nI need 100 % view.\n\n310\n00:16:23.187 --> 00:16:25.958\nI wanna see or let's go with page width.\n\n311\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.287\nNow I can see the text.\n\n312\n00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:30.800\nThe page goes all the way to\nthe width of my monitor so\n\n313\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.550\nI can see it a little clearer.\n\n314\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.120\nYou have got to zoom in to be\nable to edit that text and\n\n315\n00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.460\nhow am I actually selecting it.\n\n316\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.650\nIf you're really far out,\nit's kinda hard to see.\n\n317\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.080\nSo knowing that one page, page width 100%,\n\n318\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.830\nif I go to multiple pages it just\nshows me in that multiple page view.\n\n319\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.200\nAnd if I zoom in and\n\n320\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.440\nzoom out with the slider down there\nin the bottom right hand corner,\n\n321\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:17:00.300\nit will go ahead and pop out however far\nzoomed out, it'll show three pages across,\n\n322\n00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.530\ntwo pages across, or you zoom far enough\nin, it's only gonna show you one page.\n\n323\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.980\nSo just some slight variations on\nhow things work when you're zooming.\n\n324\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.750\nThen you also have the zoom dialogue box\nfrom the zoom button here to where you\n\n325\n00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.050\ncan pick a specific percentage,\nlike typing it in.\n\n326\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.140\nThe page width, the text width and\nthe whole page.\n\n327\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.570\nThose are the same options, very similar\nto the ones in the buttons here.\n\n328\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:28.367\nAnd then how many pages do\nI want to go across when I\n\n329\n00:17:28.367 --> 00:17:31.830\nhave it in a multi-page view?\n\n330\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:36.290\nSo just a dialogue box to give\nyou some more of those options.\n\n331\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.949\nLet's go with just page width for\nnow and I'll click OK.\n\n332\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.510\nAnd then the last one,\nI want to show you is some\n\n333\n00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.670\nlittle shortcut and it's kind of one of my\nfaves that I use a lot cuz I don't wanna\n\n334\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.600\nhave to come down to a slider and slide\nleft and right to zoom in and zoom out.\n\n335\n00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.302\nI don't wanna have to come over to the\nview tab cuz I might be like hanging out\n\n336\n00:17:59.302 --> 00:18:00.856\nat my home tab.\n\n337\n00:18:00.856 --> 00:18:05.246\nSo I'm formatting my text and changing\nthings but I need to zoom in and zoom out.\n\n338\n00:18:05.246 --> 00:18:11.770\nUsing your mouse with your scroll,\nif you hold your CTRL key down,\n\n339\n00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.559\nhold the CTRL key and\nscroll down, you zoom out.\n\n340\n00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:21.256\nHold the control, scroll the wheel\nup then you're zooming in.\n\n341\n00:18:21.256 --> 00:18:24.701\nI use this all the time like once\nI found this, I'm just like whoa,\n\n342\n00:18:24.701 --> 00:18:27.594\nI don't have to go there in the buttons,\nI can zoom in and\n\n343\n00:18:27.594 --> 00:18:30.820\nthat's really where I can go and\nthen I can let go the control.\n\n344\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.084\nAnd then just using the scroll regularly\nor I need to zoom out a little bit.\n\n345\n00:18:34.084 --> 00:18:38.941\nCtrl + Scroll down,\nokay let go of Ctrl + scroll up, up,\n\n346\n00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:42.725\nlet me zoom in,\nCtrl + scroll up, I love it.\n\n347\n00:18:42.725 --> 00:18:43.326\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n\n348\n00:18:43.326 --> 00:18:48.032\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's my go to for\nhow to zoom in and out of a document but\n\n349\n00:18:48.032 --> 00:18:52.740\nhaving this, the differences\nbetween one page or multi-view,\n\n350\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.506\nwhen you zoom in and out,\nthose are on the view tab and\n\n351\n00:18:56.506 --> 00:19:00.721\nonce you have it like on,\nthen it goes ahead and does this.\n\n352\n00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:04.954\nWe did do a few things about maneuvering\nmultiple windows in our Windows Basic or\n\n353\n00:19:04.954 --> 00:19:06.798\nwhat now we called it Word Basics.\n\n354\n00:19:06.798 --> 00:19:07.319\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n355\n00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:10.909\n&gt;&gt; But it was controlling different\nwindows and you could go ahead and\n\n356\n00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:12.910\narrange them and split them.\n\n357\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.200\nI usually just go ahead and grab from\nthe title bar then move them around\n\n358\n00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.340\nas I need them or switching back and\nforth from documents.\n\n359\n00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.050\nI just come down to my\nTask Bar to go there.\n\n360\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.940\nOr of course, our Alt + Tab,\nI love me and Alt + Tab.\n\n361\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.410\nI don't have enough documents open, but-\n&gt;&gt; It's just so quick.\n\n362\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, holding the Alt key on your\nkeyboard and then clicking your Tab key,\n\n363\n00:19:33.823 --> 00:19:35.583\nthis is not just a Word thing.\n\n364\n00:19:35.583 --> 00:19:36.957\nThis is a Windows thing.\n&gt;&gt; Nah, this is a Windows thing.\n\n365\n00:19:36.957 --> 00:19:37.570\nYeah.\n\n366\n00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.860\n&gt;&gt; So you could go across all sorts\nof different programs, and like,\n\n367\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.290\nhey, I'm copying something from\nInternet Explorer, you Alt+Tab.\n\n368\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.540\nYou hold click, click, click,\nclick, click with the tab and\n\n369\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.530\nthen you get to where you need to go.\n\n370\n00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.080\nYou let go of Alt.\n\n371\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.180\nHold the Alt again, click that tab\nto the place where you need to go.\n\n372\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.221\nLet go of the Alt.\n\n373\n00:19:55.221 --> 00:20:01.545\nIt's an awesome Windows switcher and\neverything in it's, yeah, I don't ever do.\n\n374\n00:20:01.545 --> 00:20:05.323\nIt's weird because of course now with all\nmy different operating systems that I'm in\n\n375\n00:20:05.323 --> 00:20:07.720\nthe virtual and\nI'm like I'm still doing Cmd+Tab.\n\n376\n00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.070\nBecause that's what you do\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n377\n00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.830\n&gt;&gt; In Mac\n\n378\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.365\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n379\n00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:11.430\n&gt;&gt; But, I'm in Windows so\n\n380\n00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.940\nI have to not move the thumb over that and\nalso there is also the command til they,\n\n381\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.750\nwhen you insert the programs\nthat cycles you through\n\n382\n00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.370\nopen documents within the program.\n\n383\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.710\nAnd then.\n\n384\n00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.020\ngoing back and forth from virtual to\nnon-virtual, and wait, where am I,\n\n385\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.800\nand yes so\ngets a little confusing sometimes.\n\n386\n00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.550\nBut Windows people, since this is\na Windows show, Alt+tab, do it,\n\n387\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.460\nit's awesome.\n\n388\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.140\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n389\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.360\nVonne I've got the sneaky suspicion that\nyou learned that because it was like,\n\n390\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.327\nhere comes the boss.\n\n391\n00:20:38.327 --> 00:20:39.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a great way-\n\n392\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.446\n&gt;&gt; Hurry get rid of that free cell game.\n\n393\n00:20:41.446 --> 00:20:43.330\n[LAUGH] Raise your hand, right.\n\n394\n00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.845\nYeah there you go, let's be honest.\n\n395\n00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so funny,\n\n396\n00:20:46.028 --> 00:20:47.393\nit's bringing back memories.\n\n397\n00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:48.008\n&gt;&gt; It's true, it's true.\n\n398\n00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:48.790\n&gt;&gt; Like whoop, guys,\n\n399\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.466\nyou don't wanna click the mouse cuz\nthen it makes it really obvious.\n\n400\n00:20:51.466 --> 00:20:54.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just have to look,\nI learned this from Seinfeld,\n\n401\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.888\njust look like you're annoyed.\n\n402\n00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they think you're working.\n\n403\n00:20:58.898 --> 00:21:01.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that

Good, thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.950\nhaving me as always.\n\n10\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.290\nAnd, we are going to learn how to\nnavigate our document in Word.\n\n11\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.820\nIt's always good to\nknow where we're at and\n\n12\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.440\nwhat our names are just as we've always\ntalked about on some other episodes and\n\n13\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.470\nhaving sometimes a little identity crisis\nbut I don't have an identity crisis today.\n\n14\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.969\nI know where I'm going and\nI'm going to take you along with me, yes.\n\n15\n00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.839\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're gonna go down the rabbit\n\n16\n00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.459\nhole as it says right here in\nthe welcome to word document that I have\n\n17\n00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:56.240\nopened up in Word.\n\n18\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.543\nSo getting familiar with our environment,\n\n19\n00:00:58.543 --> 00:01:02.224\nwith some of the things we've talked\nabout in our previous episodes.\n\n20\n00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:06.861\nNow, we're going to get familiar with\nmaking sure that we're in the right\n\n21\n00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:11.571\nplace at the right time for us to start\ndoing things like selecting texts, or\n\n22\n00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:16.880\ninputting texts, or adding a table or\nan image or any of those different things.\n\n23\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.770\nIt's all about your mouse-cursor icons.\n\n24\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.750\nIt's probably the thing I say the most in\nall the Office products training is that\n\n25\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.550\nyou always got to be aware of what\ndoes the mouse look like, and where is\n\n26\n00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.390\nthe flashing cursor if we're in Word or\nthe active cell if you're in Excel.\n\n27\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.330\nYou know, those types of things;\nwhat slide you're on in PowerPoint\n\n28\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.510\nbecause it's these tiny little things that\nI think we all kind of take for granted.\n\n29\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.580\nI do the same thing too as\nI start going too fast.\n\n30\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.940\nAnd my mind is working\nfaster than the computer.\n\n31\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.390\nOr maybe there's some signals\nthat are being kind of misguided\n\n32\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.340\nfrom what I think is happening to what\nI'm actually clicking on on the computer.\n\n33\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.390\nSo watching what we're doing.\n\n34\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.500\nThat being said, the all important\ni-beam and the flashing cursor.\n\n35\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.129\nLike my mouse moving around\nhere in this document and\n\n36\n00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.760\nthis area looks like an i, like\nthe letter i, and they call it an i beam.\n\n37\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.500\nSo that's what the cursor looks like.\n\n38\n00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.250\nIf I move off over here to the right,\nit still stays that way, but\n\n39\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.720\nlook what happens when\nI move off to the left.\n\n40\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.720\nMove up to the left of the document,\nin this gray area, which is right here,\n\n41\n00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.260\nit's like the outside of the page,\nit turns to white arrow.\n\n42\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.365\nWhite arrow, versus i-beam, do very\ndifferent things when you click on it.\n\n43\n00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:38.935\nAnd if you move around a little bit more,\n\n44\n00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:43.665\nif you come up over into this area,\nthat's a totally different icon.\n\n45\n00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:47.012\nThat's the two arrows with two lines and\nsome pointy things going on here.\n\n46\n00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:47.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.167\n&gt;&gt; I don't really know how else\n\n48\n00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:50.045\nto describe that.\n\n49\n00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.415\nBut we have this is where\nyou're going to actually click.\n\n50\n00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:55.095\nIf you click there, or\nactually where it says double click,\n\n51\n00:02:55.095 --> 00:02:58.710\nyou're going to be hiding the white\nspace in this document which\n\n52\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.120\npeople have done throughout their times\nand like, I don't know what happened.\n\n53\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.500\nIt's just because you may have\nbeen going pretty quickly and\n\n54\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.880\nyou start clicking around like,\nhow did I lose all my headers?\n\n55\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.130\nSo if I do it,\nnotice that all the white space goes away.\n\n56\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.090\nWhen I scroll down,\nnotice that I don't have\n\n57\n00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.980\nany divisions of like where my page\nstops and where the next one starts.\n\n58\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.100\nAnd so that physical space can\nthrow people off Really easily.\n\n59\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.070\nSo watching that mouse cursor, finding it\nagain once you realize what it does, and\n\n60\n00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.910\nthen double clicking again will\nbring that space back in for you,\n\n61\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.400\nso you can actually see your\nmargins in our print layout view.\n\n62\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.155\n&gt;&gt; I can just see the myriads of people\nout there that have accidentally double\n\n63\n00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.968\nclicked that little icon not thinking,\nnot knowing that they had done it and\n\n64\n00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:48.007\nthen going what has happened to my page?\n\n65\n00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:49.725\nAnd then what happens?\n\n66\n00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:50.813\nYou call tech support.\n\n67\n00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.249\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n68\n00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:54.780\n&gt;&gt; What's going on sir?\n\n69\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.820\n&gt;&gt; And all this time,\nI've been teaching Word, the basic,\n\n70\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.500\nI love teaching like the introduction\nto Word series cuz it's just.\n\n71\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.810\nThere's so many little things\nthat people got ohh, ahh.\n\n72\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.560\nThose ahuh moments of like,\n\n73\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.830\nI totally know what you're talking\nabout because I've done it.\n\n74\n00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.320\nSo, I'd like to explain all those things.\n\n75\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.184\n&gt;&gt; One day I want someone\nto actually yell Ureka!\n\n76\n00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:16.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n78\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.133\n&gt;&gt; Like screaming from the rooftop.\n\n79\n00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:21.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n80\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.290\nYes, I did it.\n\n81\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.320\nHaving the mouse cursor I'm kind of like\nwhat does it mean when I have the I-beam\n\n82\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.680\nanywhere that means if I click I'm going\nto be activating the flashing cursor.\n\n83\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.897\nThat's probably the other most important\nthing in Word is understanding\n\n84\n00:04:38.897 --> 00:04:44.884\nlike where is my insert, cursor, what's\ngonna happen when I do something button?\n\n85\n00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.595\nI don't know, it's just a button I guess!\n\n86\n00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:47.495\n[LAUGH]\n\n87\n00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n88\n00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:49.152\nI kind of extended that one didn't I.\n\n89\n00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:50.613\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you really took that one\n\n90\n00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:51.162\nfor a ride!\n\n91\n00:04:51.162 --> 00:04:53.475\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n92\n00:04:53.475 --> 00:04:55.260\nSo, flashing cursor.\n\n93\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.960\nGot to know where it's at.\n\n94\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.260\nAnd what happens when, hey, if I move\naround my document, is the cursor there?\n\n95\n00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.020\nBecause if the cursor isn't there,\nit ain't happening right there.\n\n96\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.360\nAnd then the white arrow, when we get\ninto our episode about selecting text,\n\n97\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.580\nthe white arrow over on the left\nhand side,this left margin area,\n\n98\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.420\nthat's actually the selection.\n\n99\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.370\nI wouldn't call it a pane.\n\n100\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.230\nWe're gonna call it a selection\narea to where you can use that\n\n101\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.300\narea to select text.\n\n102\n00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.120\nIn this case, we need to select lines\nof text rather than selecting words of\n\n103\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.146\ntext with your flashing cursor.\n\n104\n00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:34.860\nAnd I just deselected, I clicked off,\nand I just put my cursor somewhere\n\n105\n00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.580\ninto the document to go ahead and\nsay this is where I need to be.\n\n106\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.860\nSo the mouse cursor icon's having\nyour white space header and\n\n107\n00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.640\nthen the I beam versus the white arrow,\nknowing all of those different pieces.\n\n108\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.840\nSo getting around.\n\n109\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.260\nWe did talk about our view tab up\nhere in the document views and\n\n110\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.800\nwe did talk about the navigation pane.\n\n111\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.280\nSo, figure it's appropriate\nto go ahead and\n\n112\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.350\nrevisit this because we are talking\nabout navigating a document.\n\n113\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.280\nSo if I turn on the navigation pane for\nme to see it,\n\n114\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.160\nI can come over here to Navigate\nmy document based on headings.\n\n115\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.920\nNow, if you have a document, and\nyou come to Headings and you don't see\n\n116\n00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.059\nanything in there, that's because your\ndocument doesn't have any headings.\n\n117\n00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:22.635\nYou have to have it actually formatted\nwith styles that are Heading 1,\n\n118\n00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:26.616\nHeading 2, for you to be able\nto use this type of navigation.\n\n119\n00:06:26.616 --> 00:06:30.895\nBut you do have the pages, so if you have\nthe pages tab or I guess the section\n\n120\n00:06:30.895 --> 00:06:36.290\nwithin this pane, you could take this and\nsay hey, I really wanna go to page five.\n\n121\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.290\nYou click on page five, and\nit navigates you to page five.\n\n122\n00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.910\nTake notice here that when\nI clicked on page five.\n\n123\n00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.950\nMy flashing cursor goes\ninto that particular page.\n\n124\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.080\nSo you're actually jumping the cursor down\n\n125\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.700\ninto that particular page by\nusing the navigation pane.\n\n126\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.350\nLet me scroll up over here on the pages\npanel or the navigation pane and\n\n127\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.830\nI'm in my pages because I do have my\nscroll bar to scroll up and down.\n\n128\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.440\nI guess I'm taking\n&gt;&gt; Taking the liberty of\n\n129\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.580\nknowing that there is a scroll bar.\n\n130\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.660\nJust like we're going\nto get into the scroll\n\n131\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.790\nbar of our document that is used for\nnavigating as well.\n\n132\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.170\nI'm gonna click back over on page one.\n\n133\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.110\nI'm gonna close the navigation pane\nbecause I don't really need it anymore.\n\n134\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.748\nI'm gonna zoom out just a little bit,\n\n135\n00:07:31.748 --> 00:07:35.129\njust a giving you a little\nbit of different view,\n\n136\n00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:40.756\nI'm just using the zoom slider down the\nbottom of my, what is that thing called?\n\n137\n00:07:40.756 --> 00:07:42.145\n[LAUGH] The status bar-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:43.916\n&gt;&gt; and coming over here to the scroll bar.\n\n139\n00:07:43.916 --> 00:07:48.609\nNow, your scroll bar, and actually, let's\ngo behind my head for a little bit so\n\n140\n00:07:48.609 --> 00:07:52.420\nyou can see that you do have two\nbuttons on the very, very bottom.\n\n141\n00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.046\nSee, I'm down here.\n\n142\n00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:55.222\nSo, down at the very bottom.\n\n143\n00:07:55.222 --> 00:07:56.050\nAnd then,\n\n144\n00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.770\nall the way up to the top that you can\nuse to bump your scroll up, or down.\n\n145\n00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.070\nSo, if I take this bottom scroll and\nstart bumping,\n\n146\n00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.521\nit's going to go ahead and\nstart moving the page down.\n\n147\n00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:13.791\nYou can also take the actual scroll\nitself like a little bar in the middle,\n\n148\n00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:18.387\nyou can click and hold it with your mouse,\nand you can drag down.\n\n149\n00:08:18.387 --> 00:08:21.560\nNotice that you get a little tool tip as\nyou start scrolling down through here.\n\n150\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.220\nSo, like, now I'm on page three.\n\n151\n00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.707\nNow, I'm on page four.\n\n152\n00:08:25.707 --> 00:08:29.772\nI'm holding my mouse button down,\nover that little rectangle, and\n\n153\n00:08:29.772 --> 00:08:33.835\nsliding this up and down to get to\nthe different pages that I want, and\n\n154\n00:08:33.835 --> 00:08:35.886\nletting it know where I'm going.\n\n155\n00:08:35.886 --> 00:08:39.853\nNow, if I go ahead and\nmove down to here, page 4,\n\n156\n00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:44.680\ntake notice, using the scroll\nmy cursor is not in page 45.\n\n157\n00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.350\nIf I start typing right now,\nI'm actually typing up on page one,\n\n158\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.930\nbecause that's where the cursor is.\n\n159\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.340\nSo, if you're gonna use the scroll, which\nis totally fine, just make sure to know\n\n160\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.910\nthat you are gonna need to take your mouse\nwith your eye beam, click into the page,\n\n161\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.090\nor the space where you wanna be, and\nthat's where you start actually inputting,\n\n162\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.710\nor doing something within your document.\n\n163\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.370\nSo, scrolling.\n\n164\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.540\nAnd of course your mouse\nwheel does the same thing.\n\n165\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.928\nI can take my scroll wheel up,\nor in my fancy magic mouse.\n\n166\n00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:14.120\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] So, the go to functionality,\n\n241\n00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:21.660\ntalking about the keyboard,\nlet's stay on the keyboard, and\n\n242\n00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.650\nsee where we can get around.\n\n243\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.300\nYour arrow keys on the keyboard.\n\n244\n00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.200\nWhen I'm using them, I can.\n\n245\n00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.994\nWell, here, let me stop.\n\n246\n00:12:29.994 --> 00:12:31.040\nLet me get to the beginning.\n\n247\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.680\nSo, I'm gonna scroll on up,\n\n248\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.600\nput my flashing cursor in\nfront of the W in Welcome.\n\n249\n00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:41.403\nLet me zoom in just a little bit for\nthis particular demonstration.\n\n250\n00:12:41.403 --> 00:12:43.760\nI need to get my flashing cursor.\n\n251\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.920\nTo the word tired.\n\n252\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.190\nSo, I can get there by clicking the mouse,\nor use the arrow keys.\n\n253\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.320\nDown arrow goes, yeah.\n\n254\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.884\n&gt;&gt; Line by line.\n\n255\n00:12:54.884 --> 00:12:56.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Down, yeah.\n\n256\n00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.150\nWe're gonna down line by line.\n\n257\n00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:04.290\nThe right arrow key is going to\nthe right by each character.\n\n258\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.720\nYes, character by character.\n\n259\n00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.510\nSame with the left, we'll go backwards.\n\n260\n00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.710\nNow, we're not deleting,\nwe're just navigating,\n\n261\n00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.680\nwe're going left, we're going right,\nwe're going up, we're going down.\n\n262\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.290\nLine by line, or character by character.\n\n263\n00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.440\nWell, you throw in some modifier keys,\nyou go ahead and hold down some\n\n264\n00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.030\nother keys on your keyboard, and\nyou can start doing some different things.\n\n265\n00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.520\nSo, I'm putting my mouse,\nhere, let's go ahead, and\n\n266\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.220\nI'm just going to try to\nnot use the keyboard, but.\n\n267\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:31.840\nOr my mouse.\n\n268\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.640\nSo, now, I have the cursor\nin front of B in beginning.\n\n269\n00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.556\nI use my control key on my keyboard,\nhit the right arrow key, and\n\n270\n00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:43.847\nlook at where my flashing cursor is going.\n\n271\n00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:44.560\nDo you see that Daniel?\n\n272\n00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's jumping by word\ninstead of individual characters.\n\n273\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.420\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; That can be a whole lot quicker to\n\n274\n00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.670\nnavigate with if you know you're\ngoing long swats along the line.\n\n275\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so holding the control key and\ngoing left, or\n\n276\n00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:02.600\nright is gonna jump you by\nword instead of by character.\n\n277\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.644\nUsing your group of keys\nbetween your characters and\n\n278\n00:14:08.644 --> 00:14:13.777\nyour numbers, the home, and\npage up, and page down.\n\n279\n00:14:13.777 --> 00:14:16.290\nThose are some other\nthings that you can do.\n\n280\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.700\nIf I'm here on the word, was, and\n\n281\n00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.660\nI hit the END, E-N-D, not the letter N.\n\n282\n00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.160\nThe E-N-D key on the keyboard,\nwatch what happens.\n\n283\n00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.794\nIt goes all the way to the end\nof the line, to the word, do,\n\n284\n00:14:32.794 --> 00:14:34.697\nthat's where it goes.\n\n285\n00:14:34.697 --> 00:14:37.900\nWhat do you think is going to happen\nwhen I hit the home button, Daniel?\n\n286\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.620\n&gt;&gt; It's going to go to\nthe beginning of the line.\n\n287\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Correct!\n\n288\n00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.711\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You get a point!\n\n289\n00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:46.840\n[LAUGH] So, yes, the Home and\nEnd key will take you to the beginnings,\n\n290\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.230\nand the ends of the lines\nthat you are currently in.\n\n291\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.780\nThe Page Up and Page Down,\nPage Down ,if I go ahead and\n\n292\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.330\njump that down I just went off\nthe arrow keys a little bit.\n\n293\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.520\nBecause I was right next to the Home and\nthe END.\n\n294\n00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:10.030\nNotice, that it jumps down a page\nwithin whatever my zoom level is.\n\n295\n00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.832\nIf I jump it down again see,\nit's just going within the area.\n\n296\n00:15:12.832 --> 00:15:16.999\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, just that brick of white that\nwe can see and actually see the text,\n\n297\n00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.530\nthat is considered a page.\n\n298\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.420\nIf we were to zoom it down to where\nwe can the whole entire page, and\n\n299\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.870\nit would jump full pages.\n\n300\n00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.389\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n301\n00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:24.790\n&gt;&gt; So, let's zoom out a little bit.\n\n302\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.060\nSo, now,\nI can see more within that white area.\n\n303\n00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.840\nI like how you described that.\n\n304\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like the white\n\n305\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.170\narea that we're actually seeing.\n\n306\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.620\nJump down a page, jump down a page,\nso it's just kind of moving it.\n\n307\n00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.210\nIn those chunks that I can see.\n\n308\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.795\nSo, I'll go page up and\npage down, so that's another way\n\n309\n00:15:40.795 --> 00:15:44.982\nthat you can start jumping through\nyour document a little quicker.\n\n310\n00:15:44.982 --> 00:15:49.000\nGoing back over to those arrow\nkeys that we were talking about.\n\n311\n00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.770\nI'm gonna put my cursor in\nfront of the chapter here.\n\n312\n00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.385\nThis is a paragraph.\n\n313\n00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:59.457\nThe reason it is a paragraph is because\nthere is an enter mark after Down\n\n314\n00:15:59.457 --> 00:16:00.850\nthe Rabbit Hole.\n\n315\n00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.630\nWe don't see that right now.\n\n316\n00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.565\nWe're gonna learn about the wonderful\nshow hide button that is pretty much like\n\n317\n00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:08.747\nthe be all and\nend all of everything in Word.\n\n318\n00:16:08.747 --> 00:16:09.979\nYou should always have it on.\n\n319\n00:16:09.979 --> 00:16:12.665\nIt's actually making me feel a little\nweird not having it on right now.\n\n320\n00:16:12.665 --> 00:16:14.210\n[LAUGH] But that's okay, we'll get there.\n\n321\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.771\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like riding\na bike blindfolded, right?\n\n322\n00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:19.331\nIt's like, I can do it, but\nthis is a little disconcerting.\n\n323\n00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:20.363\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's actually how I\n\n324\n00:16:20.363 --> 00:16:20.960\nfeel-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.923\n&gt;&gt; In Word without this on.\n\n326\n00:16:22.923 --> 00:16:27.534\nSo [LAUGH] if I hold my Ctrl key down,\nand use the Down Arrow key,\n\n327\n00:16:27.534 --> 00:16:31.014\ncuz we learned that left and\nright was by word.\n\n328\n00:16:31.014 --> 00:16:33.870\nHolding the Ctrl + Down,\nwatch where it goes.\n\n329\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.780\nIt jumps to the next paragraph.\n\n330\n00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.537\nSo by paragraphs, up and\ndown, holding the Ctrl key,\n\n331\n00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:46.801\nthat's how you can get around,\nkinda sound like Yoda there.\n\n332\n00:16:46.801 --> 00:16:47.809\n&gt;&gt; Do you?\n[LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:48.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Up and down, jump,\n\n334\n00:16:48.989 --> 00:16:49.852\nwell you shall be.\n\n335\n00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:50.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n336\n00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:56.000\nyou can use those modifiers by word or\nby paragraph.\n\n337\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.990\nAlso using that Ctrl key with the Home and\nthe End key,\n\n338\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.670\nthis is another one of my favorites.\n\n339\n00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.208\nSo End by itself is the end of a line.\n\n340\n00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:08.494\nHold the Ctrl key and\nthen the End, E-N-D, key,\n\n341\n00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:12.140\ntakes you all the way to\nthe end of the document.\n\n342\n00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.160\nThink about what we were talking about if\nyou had a 65 page document, and you needed\n\n343\n00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.585\nto get to the end of it to start keep\nwriting your manuscript that you're doing.\n\n344\n00:17:18.585 --> 00:17:22.400\nCtrl+End, jump to the bottom,\nboop boop boop, type.\n\n345\n00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.555\nHm, how do you think you're gonna get\nto the very beginning of the document\n\n346\n00:17:25.555 --> 00:17:26.317\nthere, Daniel?\n\n347\n00:17:26.317 --> 00:17:26.912\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n348\n00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:29.728\n[LAUGH] I literally have no idea.\n\n349\n00:17:29.728 --> 00:17:32.229\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n350\n00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:37.001\nif you can get to the beginning of\nthe line by going to Home, the Home key,\n\n351\n00:17:37.001 --> 00:17:40.412\nand Ctrl+End gets you to\nthe end of a document.\n\n352\n00:17:40.412 --> 00:17:44.054\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we just add our Ctrl,\nhit our Home key, and bada bing,\n\n353\n00:17:44.054 --> 00:17:45.813\nwe're back at the beginning.\n\n354\n00:17:45.813 --> 00:17:46.548\n&gt;&gt; Ta-da.\n\n355\n00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:47.348\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Concatenate means take\ntwo pieces and put it together.\n\n359\n00:17:54.376 --> 00:17:56.481\nSo it's a big fancy word though.\n\n360\n00:17:56.481 --> 00:17:58.588\n&gt;&gt; It's actually a command\ninside of your terminal.\n\n361\n00:17:58.588 --> 00:18:01.713\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's also a function in Excel.\n\n362\n00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.814\nWoah, watch the Excel series.\n\n363\n00:18:03.814 --> 00:18:04.703\n&gt;&gt; It's all over the place, [LAUGH],\nshameless plug for the Excel series.\n\n364\n00:18:04.703 --> 00:18:11.045\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Definitely, so\nthe only other thing I wanna throw\n\n391\n00:19:42.385 --> 00:19:46.357\nout there before we close\nthis show was the status bar.\n\n392\n00:19:46.357 --> 00:19:50.925\nAnd I'm opening up another document\nright now that's the Word.\n\n393\n00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:53.685\nWelcome to Word 2,\nit might not look that much different.\n\n394\n00:19:53.685 --> 00:19:54.526\n&gt;&gt; Now we're completely lost.\n\n395\n00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.375\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, and\n\n396\n00:19:56.375 --> 00:19:58.444\ndo you know how many times\nI've named my file that?\n\n397\n00:19:58.444 --> 00:20:01.366\nLike two, three, four, and then I\ncome back like years later, I'm like,\n\n398\n00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.382\nthis means nothing to me.\n\n399\n00:20:02.382 --> 00:20:03.638\n&gt;&gt; Why did I even do this?\n\n400\n00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:06.732\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it meant so\nmuch to me at the time.\n\n401\n00:20:06.732 --> 00:20:09.013\nSo watching your status bar, okay,\n\n402\n00:20:09.013 --> 00:20:13.731\nwe might not see anything different\naround here, like okay, so where am I?\n\n403\n00:20:13.731 --> 00:20:16.550\nIt just says I'm on page two, three, four.\n\n404\n00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.700\nWell, there's some columns in here,\nwhat's going on here?\n\n405\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.950\nWhere am I?\n\n406\n00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.810\nYour sections, okay,\nnow if you don't section your document,\n\n407\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.898\nthis doesn't mean anything to you.\n\n408\n00:20:26.898 --> 00:20:30.541\nI'm gonna right-click on our status bar,\n\n409\n00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:34.780\nbecause I want to be able to\nsee what section am I in?\n\n410\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.863\nNow, I'm scrolling, and I'm like, man,\ncuz this looks different than this, but\n\n411\n00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.752\nwhy is there only, there it goes.\n\n412\n00:20:40.752 --> 00:20:41.830\nThere, look at there.\n\n413\n00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:46.329\nSo now it's seeing section three,\nsection one, all right,\n\n414\n00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:50.058\nclick my cursor in here so\nthis is section two.\n\n415\n00:20:50.058 --> 00:20:51.761\n&gt;&gt; So I'm not seeing that,\nwhere are you seeing section two?\n\n416\n00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:52.772\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, right down here.\n\n417\n00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:53.323\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n418\n00:20:53.323 --> 00:20:58.470\n&gt;&gt; On the bottom, so you can see that\nthis is the section cuz I formulated.\n\n419\n00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.631\n&gt;&gt; Formulated.\n&gt;&gt; Formatted [LAUGH] my status bar to show\n\n420\n00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:04.530\nthat, so I can see what sections mean.\n\n421\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.050\nAnd in a nutshell, is if you think\nabout well, this is a section,\n\n422\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.760\nthis is a section, this is a section, and\nyou can apply different page layouts.\n\n423\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:16.770\nThat's why this particular section shows\nthat in columns and this section up here,\n\n424\n00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.656\nlet me go ahead and scroll out\na little bit, so you could see it.\n\n425\n00:21:19.656 --> 00:21:23.760\nWhoops, too much, this section\nlooks different than here, okay?\n\n426\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:29.190\nDifferent page layouts or margins or any\nof those different things that you can do,\n\n427\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.850\nyou can apply in sections, rather than\nif I had said, let's go ahead and\n\n428\n00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.361\nmake this document columns.\n\n429\n00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:37.019\nIt would do the entire document,\nsection it out, and\n\n430\n00:21:37.019 --> 00:21:39.742\nthen you can apply different ones.\n\n431\n00:21:39.742 --> 00:21:41.610\nHow would I even know\nthat that was possible,\n\n432\n00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.650\neven if I didn't even see\nthe status bar down there?\n\n433\n00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.150\nI can't leave this episode\nwithout showing this button,\n\n434\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:53.040\neven though I'm gonna show it 1,000\nmore times in my other episodes.\n\n435\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.440\nHere, this show hide button is so\nvery important,\n\n436\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.570\nit will show you all of the non-printing\ncharacters in your document.\n\n437\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:08.540\nSo I can see that there’s each change in\nparagraph if I scroll, that right there.\n\n438\n00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.842\nIt’s kinda small because of where it’s\nplaced, but that is a section break.\n\n439\n00:22:12.842 --> 00:22:15.821\nIf I scroll down a little bit more,\nI think it’s right, yeah,\n\n440\n00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:17.406\nthat’s another section break.\n\n441\n00:22:17.406 --> 00:22:22.091\nYou start getting familiar with all\nof these non-printing characters, and\n\n442\n00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:27.075\nit makes your life a lot easier because\nyou know what's going on in your document.\n\n443\n00:22:27.075 --> 00:22:30.674\nSo I feel it is part of\nnavigating a document.\n\n444\n00:22:30.674 --> 00:22:34.856\nNow how to identify all of these pieces,\nthat's why we have full episodes on them,\n\n445\n00:22:34.856 --> 00:22:38.130\nbut I couldn't leave without\nshowing you that button.\n\n446\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.732\nBut definitely stick around for the input\ntext episode because we're gonna talk\n\n447\n00:22:42.732 --> 00:22:45.248\na little bit more about\nwhat this all means.\n\n448\n00:22:45.248 --> 00:22:48.905\nWe're also gonna have a small\nlittle history lesson about it,\n\n449\n00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:53.330\nwhich I love to really dork out on,\nbut I'll keep it small, I promise.\n\n450\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.524\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, well thank you so\nmuch for showing us how we can navigate\n\n451\n00:22:56.524 --> 00:22:59.279\naround our Microsoft Word 2016\ndocuments a little better.\n\n452\n00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:01.803\nWe've definitely learned\na little bit about what all\n\n453\n00:23:01.803 --> 00:23:04.447\nthese little weird icons mean and\nother things as well.\n\n454\n00:23:04.447 --> 00:23:08.430\nSo hopefully, you're now a little\nmore in tune with your documents.\n\n455\n00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.265\nThat being said, it looks like we've\ncome to the end of our episode here for\n\n456\n00:23:11.265 --> 00:23:11.948\nOfficePro.TV.\n\n457\n00:23:11.948 --> 00:23:14.229\nWe do thank you for watching,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n458\n00:23:14.229 --> 00:23:15.089\n&gt;&gt;

to another great\nepisode of OfficePro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:11.906\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n5\n00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:15.830\nand in today's episode we are continuing\non with our Word 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.558\nJoining us in the studio again to lend her\nexpertise on that topic, our good friend,\n\n7\n00:00:19.558 --> 00:00:20.411\nMs. Vonne

move on to selecting text.\n\n10\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.140\nWe need to know how to select before we\ncan affect, one of my favorite rules and\n\n11\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.120\none of the,\npart of the trinity that we have.\n\n12\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.743\nWe have the selector effect,\ngosh hover to discover,\n\n13\n00:00:38.743 --> 00:00:42.066\nI was trying to remember\nthe fun one that you made up.\n\n14\n00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.848\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhen in doubt give right-click a shout.\n\n15\n00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:47.254\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I love it because we always said,\nwhen in doubt right-click but\n\n16\n00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:49.925\nthat doesn't rhyme, and\nthen you just made it rhyme.\n\n17\n00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:55.255\n&gt;&gt; I did, I had to fit in make it work,\nmy brain wasn't handling the dissonance.\n\n18\n00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.203\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah those three rules of\n\n19\n00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:02.878\ncomputing, so we're going to go ahead and\ntackle the first one.\n\n20\n00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:05.398\nNow this is only gonna be\nhow to select your text,\n\n21\n00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.294\nwe're not actually going to\ndo anything with our text.\n\n22\n00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:12.028\nWe're not gonna change it to purple,\nwe're not gonna center it, but\n\n23\n00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:16.143\nthese are the things that you're gonna\nneed to do first before you go ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:17.172\nmake that effect.\n\n25\n00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:20.726\nSo let's jump on in to our Word document.\n\n26\n00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:24.947\nWe're in our Welcome to Word file that\nwe've been seeing throughout quite a few\n\n27\n00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:27.720\nof our episodes so\nfar if you're watching in order.\n\n28\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.670\nWe did talk about in the navigated\ndocument episode about the importance\n\n29\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.718\nof the I-beam and about your cursor.\n\n30\n00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:41.170\nThis is gonna come in to play again when\nstart selecting our text is making sure\n\n31\n00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.380\nwhat kind of icon do I have before I start\nclicking and dragging and doing things\n\n32\n00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.230\nbecause it always tell you what's going\nto happen, and the mouse cursor as well.\n\n33\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.770\nSo, if I wanted to start selecting text,\n\n34\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.680\none of the first techniques that you\ncan do is the click-hold-drag method.\n\n35\n00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.770\nI want to click my mouse, I wanna hold the\nmouse, and I want to drag the mouse around\n\n36\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.728\nto be able to activate the text or\nthings that I want to have selected.\n\n37\n00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:16.450\nSo I'm gonna zoom in, whoops, that's the\nwrong zoom, we're going to go ahead and\n\n38\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.609\nzoom in just a little bit so\nI can show you.\n\n39\n00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.575\nI would like to select the words Alice\nwas beginning to get very tired, so\n\n40\n00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:26.414\nI put my cursor in the front.\n\n41\n00:02:26.414 --> 00:02:28.878\nNow, I just clicked,\nI'm not holding the mouse down.\n\n42\n00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:33.839\nBut now with my mouse at that point and\nmy I-beam, I'm gonna click-hold,\n\n43\n00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:38.491\ndrag my mouse, keeping the mouse\nbutton pressed down until I have moved\n\n44\n00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.160\nthe mouse to the appropriate\npoint where I want to stop.\n\n45\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.870\nI let go of the mouse and\n\n46\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.320\nnow I have selected this text, that's\nall we're doing in this episode, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.370\nI want this, that's what I got,\nI did it, I'm good.\n\n48\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.800\nAny time you select something,\n\n49\n00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.478\nyou need to get in a good habit of always\nclicking off, you wanna click off.\n\n50\n00:03:00.478 --> 00:03:02.885\nYou wanna, that almost sounds like\nI'm telling you something bad,\n\n51\n00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:04.348\nlike I'm really mad at you or something.\n\n52\n00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:06.343\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Click off, buddy.\n\n53\n00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:07.696\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, right?\n\n54\n00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:08.656\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm walking here.\n\n55\n00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:11.635\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You need to click off this right now,\n\n56\n00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:15.988\nso, this where we need to deselect,\nwe want to stop selecting this, so\n\n57\n00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:18.260\nyou just click off into a blank area.\n\n58\n00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.618\nI mean, I click on some like random\nword to deactivate that section.\n\n59\n00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.789\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like something even worse, go\nclick off to a blank area, crazy person.\n\n60\n00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:29.186\n[LAUGH] I know, I really do mean\nthis in the technical sense.\n\n61\n00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:32.132\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\nfind a blank space, click there.\n\n62\n00:03:32.132 --> 00:03:35.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we're deselecting and\nspecifically for\n\n63\n00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:40.106\nthis reason is that what if I started\nselecting my text, let's do this again.\n\n64\n00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:42.453\nSo I'm gonna click hold and\ndrag on my mouse cursor and\n\n65\n00:03:42.453 --> 00:03:43.765\nI'm gonna let go right here.\n\n66\n00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:48.530\nAnd I realize that I didn't get all\nof the text that I wanted to select.\n\n67\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.740\nI wanted to keep on going till have\nsitting by her sister on the bank,\n\n68\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.770\nI wanted to get the rest of that.\n\n69\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.993\nDo not come over here and start dragging\nfrom the selection that you already\n\n70\n00:03:57.993 --> 00:04:02.420\nhave because remember that mouse cursor\nI told you about, that is not an I-beam,\n\n71\n00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.516\nthat is a cursor, the wall,\nactually that's an arrow.\n\n72\n00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:07.364\n[LAUGH] That is an arrow which means,\n\n73\n00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:09.990\nit's not going to be\nthe same thing as an I-beam.\n\n74\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.085\nIt is going to actually move that text,\nthis could be a good thing,\n\n75\n00:04:17.085 --> 00:04:22.215\nI personally don't find it very good,\nbecause from all my years of teaching\n\n76\n00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:27.800\nWord it is really discouraging to people\nbecause they're dragging the text.\n\n77\n00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.310\nThis is known as drag and\ndrop editing, once you've selected\n\n78\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.432\ntext if you start dragging,\nI'm gonna do this so you can see.\n\n79\n00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:35.645\nPeople wanna go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:39.697\nclick-drag and then they get this weird,\nlike a black bar that's moving around.\n\n81\n00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:40.872\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna do something crazy,\nisn't it?\n\n82\n00:04:40.872 --> 00:04:41.799\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n83\n00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.305\nAnd you like let go,\nand you're like, wait.\n\n84\n00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:47.865\nAnd if you weren't paying attention,\nyou just moved the text.\n\n85\n00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:51.734\nYou moved it over cuz you're\ntaking selected blocks of text and\n\n86\n00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:54.945\nyou're moving it and\ndropping it into a new place.\n\n87\n00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:56.399\n&gt;&gt; Where's that undo button, quick.\n\n88\n00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:59.847\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, always,\nyes, undo, undo, undo,\n\n89\n00:04:59.847 --> 00:05:05.260\nCtrl+z is your keyboard shortcut for\nit, and so that takes it away.\n\n90\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.969\nSo that's what I mean by if you don't\nget it right the first time, click off,\n\n91\n00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.721\ndeselect, and start over.\n\n92\n00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:14.294\nAnd we try it again to\nget the whole kit and\n\n93\n00:05:14.294 --> 00:05:19.170\ncaboodle that I wanted, then I let go,\nand that's what I want, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.560\nSo I'm not saying don't ever\ndrag that selected text,\n\n95\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.110\nyou could,\nif you wanted that action to happen.\n\n96\n00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.090\nThat will be the effect like\nI want to move this text.\n\n97\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.515\nSo, at least being aware of it,\nunderstanding what it does, and\n\n98\n00:05:38.515 --> 00:05:42.787\nusing it appropriately,\nthat's always the name of the game.\n\n99\n00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:47.504\nI will say right here that if this is\nsomething that just unnerves you to no end\n\n100\n00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:52.309\nand you're like, I can't live with this,\nI cannot have Word let me do this.\n\n101\n00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.949\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can turn this off,\n\n102\n00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.427\nthis is in your options just\nlike with any of our programs.\n\n103\n00:05:58.427 --> 00:06:03.683\nIf you go to File and\nwe go to Options, it's in the Approve\n\n104\n00:06:03.683 --> 00:06:08.840\nthing I believe, nope,\nit's in the Advanced, okay.\n\n105\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.868\n[LAUGH] I started clicking and I'm like\nI should have written it down again.\n\n106\n00:06:11.868 --> 00:06:16.994\nWe have in the Word Options\n&gt; Advanced right here,\n\n107\n00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:20.485\nAllow text to be dragged and drop.\n\n108\n00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:26.470\n[LAUGH] That's the one that you can\nuncheck, if you don't want that to happen.\n\n109\n00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.240\nThere is another one while I'm here,\n\n110\n00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.960\nwhere it says when selecting\nautomatically select entire word.\n\n111\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.270\nLet me show you what that is and so\n\n112\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.660\nnow you know that his is an option\nif you wanted to turn off you could.\n\n113\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.000\nIf I started selecting this text,\nI'm gonna to put my cursor there,\n\n114\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.200\nI'm gonna click hold, and drag because I\njust want the begin not the beginning.\n\n115\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.580\nIf I'm in one word,\nit will stop at the n and not continue on,\n\n116\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.050\nbut if I go from the middle or beginning,\ncuz maybe I just need I-N-I-G,\n\n117\n00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.030\nand then the rest of the text like for\nsomewhat reason.\n\n118\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.610\nSo I start in the middle of the word,\n\n119\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.350\nwatch what happens as soon as I get past\nthe end of the word, do you see how it\n\n120\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:16.350\nautomatically extended the selection\nto include the entire word beginning.\n\n121\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.780\nThis does throw me off sometimes because\nI wanna approach the word right.\n\n122\n00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.510\n&gt;&gt; It's like it's assuming\nthings about your clicking and\n\n123\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.590\ndragging that might not\nnecessarily be true.\n\n124\n00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.620\nSometimes you do, yeah,\nI grabbed in the middle of the world and\n\n125\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.820\nI did want all of beginning, but sometimes\nI just want to get the I-N-G to get.\n\n126\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.860\nMaybe that's exactly, yeah, and\nforget typing cause I'm a horrible typer,\n\n127\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.940\njust gonna select and copy that.\n\n128\n00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.010\nAnd it finishes it for me and\nI might not wanna it to do that.\n\n129\n00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.668\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nthat is an option that is on by default so\n\n130\n00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:52.009\nif you don't like it turn it off.\n\n131\n00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:52.979\nMaybe you've never noticed it.\n\n132\n00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:54.810\n&gt;&gt; If you don't like it click off [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n133\n00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.609\nmaybe you've never even noticed it.\n\n134\n00:07:58.609 --> 00:08:02.621\nMaybe you've been using Word for\na while and it does do that,\n\n135\n00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:06.570\nit's just always been to my advantage,\nso I'm good with it.\n\n136\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.375\nSomething that is probably\nhappening when you select text,\n\n137\n00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:14.179\nthis little guy right here this\nis known as the mini toolbar,\n\n138\n00:08:14.179 --> 00:08:18.830\nI have a love/hate relationship with it,\nI've grown to love it.\n\n139\n00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.920\nI didn't like it at first\ncuz I was just like,\n\n140\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.450\nplease get out of my way, I don't need\nyou right now, I don't wanna format it.\n\n141\n00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.536\nBut it is a quick way to select text,\nand instead of going all the way up to\n\n142\n00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:32.422\nthe ribbon, you could do that mini\nselection or the mini formatting\n\n143\n00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:36.613\ntoolbar and you can go ahead and\ndo some of those functionalities there.\n\n144\n00:08:36.613 --> 00:08:40.153\nIt's good now, I didn't like it when\nit first came out though, okay,\n\n145\n00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:42.756\nbut I'm just telling you\nmy personal preferences.\n\n146\n00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:43.854\nSo, deselect.\n\n147\n00:08:43.854 --> 00:08:48.784\nLet's start getting into how\nyou could do other selection\n\n148\n00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:52.312\ntechniques I just want the one word very.\n\n149\n00:08:52.312 --> 00:08:54.522\nI want this one word,\ninstead of clicking and\n\n150\n00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:57.238\ndragging selection of word\nyou could double-click.\n\n151\n00:08:57.238 --> 00:09:02.468\nIf you double-click on that word,\nclick click then it selects that one word.\n\n152\n00:09:02.468 --> 00:09:06.180\nIf I double-click on remarkable,\nit will select that one word,\n\n153\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.565\nif I double-click on pictures, I think\nyou're getting the idea here is that\n\n154\n00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:13.612\ndouble-clicking will allow\nyou to select the word.\n\n155\n00:09:13.612 --> 00:09:18.010\nTriple-clicking, this is a fun one,\ntriple click one, two, three,\n\n156\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.966\nyou do have to do it in\nenough rapid succession for\n\n157\n00:09:20.966 --> 00:09:24.011\nit to understand that you\nare doing three clicks.\n\n158\n00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:28.219\nSo one, two, three,\nit will select your entire paragraph.\n\n159\n00:09:28.219 --> 00:09:32.911\nThat's a fun little trick that I know a\nlot of people are like, that's kinda cute,\n\n160\n00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:35.330\nI just clicked once to deselect.\n\n161\n00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.720\nAnother cute trick if you wanted,\nyou can have it select sentences.\n\n162\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.050\nNow it does have to see that the end\nof a sentence would be like a period or\n\n163\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.420\nquestion mark, and then a space,\nor possibly two, and\n\n164\n00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:55.720\nthen to another character for it to know\nwhere your sentences start and stop.\n\n165\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.440\nYou hold your Crtl key, and you single-\nclick on, whoops, that's the wrong Ctrl,\n\n166\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.120\nsince I have a different keyboard, there\nyou go, it will select this one sentence.\n\n167\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.220\nNow because of the way\nthat this text is written,\n\n168\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.560\nit might be a little harder to see where\nthe sentence is starting and stopping.\n\n169\n00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.030\nHere's one, right here,\nthis first sentence of this paragraph.\n\n170\n00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.229\nHold the Ctrl key,\nclick on one word in the sentence and\n\n171\n00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:24.213\nit selects that entire sentence, so\nCtrl click on a word for your sentences.\n\n172\n00:10:24.213 --> 00:10:30.370\nYou could also select a range of text,\nnow this selecting a range and\n\n173\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.520\nselecting multiples, this is not just\na Word thing, this is across the board.\n\n174\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.910\nThis could be selecting files in your\nfile explorer, this could be selecting\n\n175\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.740\ncells within Excel, so\nthis is multiple places where this works.\n\n176\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:51.270\nThe Shift, versus Ctrl,\nI'd like to select from here,\n\n177\n00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.408\nthis paragraph,\nall the way down to this paragraph.\n\n178\n00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:57.838\nNow, there is nothing wrong with me\nclicking, holding and dragging, and\n\n179\n00:10:57.838 --> 00:10:58.497\nmoving down.\n\n180\n00:10:58.497 --> 00:11:02.218\nBut if you've ever done this where\nyou go and then woah, you freak out,\n\n181\n00:11:02.218 --> 00:11:03.380\nyou're jumping.\n\n182\n00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.560\nEspecially across page breaks or\n\n183\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.660\nscreen breaks it can get\na little hairy sometimes.\n\n184\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:15.080\nSo using that Shift key to select\nthe range, it can be very handy.\n\n185\n00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.251\nHow does it work?\n\n186\n00:11:16.251 --> 00:11:18.181\nYou click where you wanna start, so\n\n187\n00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:21.210\nyou have to have your flashing\ncursor at the beginning.\n\n188\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.370\nYou navigate do not click yet,\n\n189\n00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.600\nyou navigate to the place you want\nto end which would be right here.\n\n190\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.350\nDon't click, hold your Shift key,\nnow if you hold your shift and then click\n\n191\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:40.130\nthe end, that will select everything\nfrom your starting to your ending point.\n\n192\n00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:45.780\nSo it's start, Shift, end,\nthat gets everything in between.\n\n193\n00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.638\n&gt;&gt; I like that because I am\nhorrendous about over-scrolling, and\n\n194\n00:11:49.638 --> 00:11:52.146\nI completely select way more than I need.\n\n195\n00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:55.850\nThen I try to back it up, it's just a\ncomedy of errors after that point, right?\n\n196\n00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.458\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're trying to back it up,\n\n197\n00:11:57.458 --> 00:12:00.671\nyou're like, no, too far,\njust start again, and you do it again, and\n\n198\n00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:03.086\nyou just, so\nthat is a lifesaver in my estimation.\n\n199\n00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:07.227\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah, especially,\nlike we say, across those pages where your\n\n200\n00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:10.694\nscreen's jumping around, so\nI love that, I use it all the time.\n\n201\n00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:14.524\nNow the Ctrl key, the Ctrl key is\nwhere you can select multiples.\n\n202\n00:12:14.524 --> 00:12:18.123\nI can select multiple words,\nmultiple clicks and drags,\n\n203\n00:12:18.123 --> 00:12:20.430\nwhichever way you wanna go.\n\n204\n00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.944\nLet's zoom in a little bit so\nyou can see, I'm going to click, hold and\n\n205\n00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.437\ndrag and select this one block of text.\n\n206\n00:12:27.437 --> 00:12:32.981\nI'm gonna let go, my mouse has let go,\nI'm going to hold the Ctrl key now,\n\n207\n00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:36.700\nclick, hold and drag,\nsorry keyboard mapping.\n\n208\n00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.110\nLet's try again click,\nhold and drag, there we go.\n\n209\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.761\nThat selects that amount of text,\nlet go of my mouse, hold the Ctrl key,\n\n210\n00:12:44.761 --> 00:12:46.150\nclick hold and drag.\n\n211\n00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.915\nSo I can sit here and select multiple,\nI can hold the Ctrl key,\n\n212\n00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:53.370\ndouble-click on that one word cuz\nthat's selecting the one word.\n\n213\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.050\nLetting go of all my keys,\n\n214\n00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.700\nokay, cuz remember if you scroll with\nyour Ctrl key you're zooming in and out.\n\n215\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.010\nSo you have to know when to stop the Ctrl,\n\n216\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.752\nwhen to turn on the Ctrl,\nit's kinda like life.\n\n217\n00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:08.491\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I scroll up here,\n\n218\n00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:12.410\nhold my Ctrl key,\ntriple-click, one, two, three.\n\n219\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.280\nSo you can see you can use in different\ncombinations of selection techniques, but\n\n220\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.890\njust using that Ctrl\nkey to get all of that,\n\n221\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:23.770\ncuz maybe I want all of these\nselections to be bold, or be purple.\n\n222\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.750\nSo instead of clicking one,make it bold,\nclicking one, make it bold, get\n\n223\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.440\nthem all selected first, and then go ahead\nand apply whatever you want to do with it.\n\n224\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.839\nSo it's another one of my faves.\n\n225\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.980\nLet's scroll out just a little bit more,\nthis left hand side,\n\n226\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.350\nthis is your selection,\nI wanna say pane, selection area.\n\n227\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:49.670\nWith the white arrow,\nif you click once, wherever your mouse,\n\n228\n00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.055\nsorry, I'm trying to tip my mouse out.\n\n229\n00:13:54.055 --> 00:13:58.330\n[LAUGH] Where your mouse was is where\nit's going to select that line.\n\n230\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.870\nSo if I click here, selecting line,\nthat's why I always tell people,\n\n231\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.860\nwhen you deselect,\ndo not deselect to the left,\n\n232\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.080\nalways go the right because\nthe left will always select things.\n\n233\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.500\nAnd so people like, I'm trying to click\noff, but it keeps selecting stuff,\n\n234\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.560\nI'm like, yep,\nthat's cuz it's supposed to.\n\n235\n00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.660\nSo selecting a single line,\nyou could also use the click, hold, and\n\n236\n00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.561\ndrag in the selection area to go ahead and\nselect multiple lines.\n\n237\n00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:26.024\nSo notice, it will not do a half a line,\nit's the whole line and\n\n238\n00:14:26.024 --> 00:14:28.480\nnothing but the line-\n&gt;&gt; But the line, there you go.\n\n239\n00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n240\n00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:32.920\nit gets all of those lines for you so\nthat's one way you could do it.\n\n241\n00:14:34.068 --> 00:14:39.400\nIf you double-click near\na paragraph in the selection area,\n\n242\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.818\nit will select the paragraph.\n\n243\n00:14:41.818 --> 00:14:46.451\nIf you triple-click in the selection area,\none, two, three, you're actually doing\n\n244\n00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:49.931\nselect all, you're selecting all\nof the text, all the way it is.\n\n245\n00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:53.866\nSo if I start scrolling through, every\nsingle thing in this document has been\n\n246\n00:14:53.866 --> 00:14:56.610\nselected, so,\nthat's another cute little trick.\n\n247\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:01.579\nThe keyboard shortcut for select all, what\ndo you think that might be there Daniel?\n\n248\n00:15:01.579 --> 00:15:05.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with, well if\nconvention stays true it'll be Ctrl+a.\n\n249\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.728\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n250\n00:15:06.728 --> 00:15:07.584\n&gt;&gt; Look at me.\n\n251\n00:15:07.584 --> 00:15:09.389\nOld school keyboard shortcuts.\n\n252\n00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:12.523\n&gt;&gt; You get another point,\nyou're racking them all up.\n\n253\n00:15:12.523 --> 00:15:14.247\n&gt;&gt; I am, I'm really learning here.\n\n254\n00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.339\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we can do a Ctrl+a and\n\n255\n00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:19.135\nselect all as well.\n\n256\n00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:22.255\nAnd so all of these different\ntechniques you can use one last\n\n257\n00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:27.140\none with that shift key, cuz we talked\nabout using our Shift and our arrow keys.\n\n258\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.181\nOr, actually, we can use the Shift\nkey with the clicking of the mouse,\n\n259\n00:15:30.181 --> 00:15:32.731\nI actually didn't show you with\nthe arrow keys yet, did I?\n\n260\n00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:33.556\n&gt;&gt; Don't think so, no.\n\n261\n00:15:33.556 --> 00:15:34.155\n&gt;&gt; No, we didn't do that.\n\n262\n00:15:34.155 --> 00:15:36.124\nAll right, so,\nlet's zoom in just a little bit.\n\n263\n00:15:36.124 --> 00:15:40.230\nWe did talk about navigating in our\nother episode by using the arrow keys.\n\n264\n00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:45.280\nIf you hold the Shift key, and use\nthe arrow keys you're actually selecting.\n\n265\n00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.030\nSo if I single-click and\njust select by character,\n\n266\n00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:53.320\nbut we also learn that jumping\nby word will get to selecting.\n\n267\n00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.330\nSo if you hold the Ctrl\nkey with the Shift key and\n\n268\n00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:03.700\nuse the arrow keys you can start\nselecting by word, woo fun.\n\n269\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.390\nUse the arrow key to deselect,\nhold the Shift key, hit the down arrow,\n\n270\n00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.826\nyou're selecting by line.\n\n271\n00:16:09.826 --> 00:16:13.280\nHold the Shift key and the Ctrl key and\n\n272\n00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.980\nuse the down you\nare selecting by paragraph.\n\n273\n00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:21.870\nSo those ways that we are using the arrow\nkeys to navigate through our document,\n\n274\n00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.540\nyou hold that Shift key\nin conjunction with it,\n\n275\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.430\nyou're gonna be selecting\nusing the arrow keys.\n\n276\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.780\nAnd that's a good one\nto where if I selected,\n\n277\n00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.964\nremember where I said if you don't get\nit all in the first try you gotta stop,\n\n278\n00:16:32.964 --> 00:16:34.560\nyou gotta deselect and start over.\n\n279\n00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.540\nIf I selected this and said oops, I\ndidn't, I didn't get everything I needed.\n\n280\n00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.046\nYou don't have to start over, just use\nthis new combination that we just learned.\n\n281\n00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:46.483\nHold the Shift key, use the arrow key and\nyou can just go ahead and\n\n282\n00:16:46.483 --> 00:16:50.255\nget just that last little bit or\nmaybe, oops that's little too much.\n\n283\n00:16:50.255 --> 00:16:54.816\nSo use them in conjunction and you can\ndo all sorts of stuff to make it so\n\n284\n00:16:54.816 --> 00:16:58.370\nmuch easier to get what you\nneed to be able to do stuff.\n\n285\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.476\nSo all those shortcuts that\nwe've been talking about are in\n\n286\n00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:06.660\nthe shortcut list that I've\ngiven you in the show notes.\n\n287\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:12.960\nSo you can write those down, and just try\nit, you don't have to be stuck to just\n\n288\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:19.080\none type of selection, use them all in\ncombinations to get exactly what you need.\n\n289\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.501\nAnd I believe, looking at my notes\nI think I covered everything.\n\n290\n00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:26.639\n&gt;&gt; You covered everything, Vonne, you\nare awesome at this, we do appreciate you\n\n291\n00:17:26.639 --> 00:17:30.117\nshowing us how we can select our\ntext in a myriad of different ways.\n\n292\n00:17:30.117 --> 00:17:35.044\nI didn't understand what's even possible,\nhopefully, you now are walking away just\n\n293\n00:17:35.044 --> 00:17:39.053\nas flabbergasted and amazed as I\nam at Vonne's skill at Word 2016.\n\n294\n00:17:39.053 --> 00:17:42.572\nShe is a very, very smart girl, so you\nfollow her example, learn those tricks and\n\n295\n00:17:42.572 --> 00:17:43.698\nbe better at it yourself.\n\n296\n00:17:43.698 --> 00:17:46.879\nThat being said, it looks like we've come\nto the end of our episode, we do thank you\n\n297\n00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:49.760\nfor watching, for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n298\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.390\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n299\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.483\n&gt;&gt;

Speaking the computer's language,\nare we?\n\n19\n00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.190\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are.\n\n20\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.880\nWe're going to be speaking\nall sorts of languages today.\n\n21\n00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.220\nSo what we are going to talk\nabout is inputting text.\n\n22\n00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.790\nHow you actually type\ntext into a document.\n\n23\n00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.660\nYou're thinking Hm, well,\nyou just click the keys.\n\n24\n00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.630\nYou're right, and so\nwe're gonna click some keys, and\n\n25\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.760\nwe're gonna click some non keys, and we're\ngonna talk about non printing characters.\n\n26\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820\nSpecial things near and\ndear to my heart, so\n\n27\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.740\nwhy don't we get started\nwith a new document.\n\n28\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.150\nI'm actually on my start screen in Word,\nto get our new document started.\n\n29\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.640\nWe have our flashing cursor in the place\nthat we want to start because,\n\n30\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.710\nright at the very beginning.\n\n31\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.050\nOne thing in Word, though, you can't\nclick lower than where the cursor is, and\n\n32\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.410\nmore than just that, you have to have\n\n33\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.680\na space available for\nyou to input text into.\n\n34\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.490\nWhat I mean by that,\n\n35\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.820\nif I wanted to get down a line,\nyou have to hit the Enter key.\n\n36\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.170\nNow the Enter key.\n\n37\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.600\nWhat is the Enter key do?\n\n38\n00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.810\nIt takes you down a line, but more\nspecifically it's creating a paragraph.\n\n39\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.960\nAnd when you start, you're starting off\nwith a default paragraph, because there's\n\n40\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.262\nthe only place, well, I know as soon as I\nsay this, I know it's going to be wrong.\n\n41\n00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:03.390\n[LAUGH] The only place that you can put\ntext into a document is in a paragraph.\n\n42\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.931\nNow as soon as I say that, I stop myself\nand went, well, what about a table.\n\n43\n00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:08.493\nWell, yeah, you could put a table.\n\n44\n00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:09.971\nBut then where does a table go?\n\n45\n00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:11.364\nA table has to go into a paragraph.\n\n46\n00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:17.180\nYou have to have a paragraph mark or\na paragraph to start.\n\n47\n00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.510\nThat's all that is to it.\n\n48\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.080\nSo, flashing cursor's where it's at, and\n\n49\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.780\nI want to type my letters\ninto this document.\n\n50\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.500\nThere are lower case letters like a,b,c,\nand I hit the space bar.\n\n51\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.160\nWhat does the space bar do?\n\n52\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.720\nIt gives you a space.\n\n53\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.810\nYou're thinking, wow really, we're gonna\nhave an entire episode of that explaining\n\n54\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.078\neach one of these keys on the keyboard,\nnot necessarily but yes.\n\n55\n00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:46.690\n[LAUGH] You never assume,\nyou never assume.\n\n56\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.720\n&gt;&gt; You hypothesize.\n\n57\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] How do I\n\n58\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.190\nget to make capital letters?\n\n59\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.260\nYou hold the Shift key.\n\n60\n00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.470\nSo capital, hold the Shift+A, B, C.\n\n61\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.760\nAnd of course is this caps lock key,\nthat caps lock will lock\n\n62\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.880\non the keys to be in capital letters, and\nthen of course you also have numeric keys.\n\n63\n00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.700\nYou have alpha numeric keys,\nanything than A, a number.\n\n64\n00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.960\nSo if I wanted to type in one,\ntwo, three, I could type that in.\n\n65\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.030\nHit the space bar.\n\n66\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.380\nHold my shift key.\n\n67\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.110\nThen it goes into your other special\ncharacters like the exclamation,\n\n68\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.430\nthe at sign, the pound sign,\nthe dollar sign.\n\n69\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.870\nI guess that's also a number sign or\nnowadays, what is it?\n\n70\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.930\nIt's a hashtag.\n\n71\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.570\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.220\n&gt;&gt; We always call it the, yeah,\n\n73\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.200\nthe hash sign.\n\n74\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.340\nThat's what we always call it.\n\n75\n00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hash hash, hash tag.\n\n76\n00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.930\nSo I've always called it the pound sign.\n\n77\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the pound sign as well,\ncuz on a phone, back when Well,\n\n78\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.670\nI guess you used normal style\ntelephones that had one, two, three.\n\n79\n00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.790\nThat was know as the pound, so it would\nsay dial pound 732 or whatever, and\n\n80\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.510\nyou would get special\nthings on your phone.\n\n81\n00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.990\n&gt;&gt;

Changed your life, didn't it?\n\n90\n00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes in a bad way.\n\n91\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.610\nMost of the time, it's in a bad way.\n\n92\n00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.233\nIt was, [SOUND] we were\nhorrible to each other, so.\n\n93\n00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.452\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Get off the phone, mom.\n\n94\n00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:14.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, that's why\n\n95\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.380\nI remember pound 70 and pound 68 or\nsomething like that to get all those.\n\n96\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.080\nAlright, so I'm glad we're having\nthis psychology right here.\n\n97\n00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.620\nI'm having a little session to remind\nmyself of why, I call it the pound sign.\n\n98\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.340\nSo, we have all these different\ncharacters that are on our keyboard.\n\n99\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.510\nAnd all the pipe sign,\nyou know the double pipes,this one?\n\n100\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.455\n&gt;&gt; The logical or.\n\n101\n00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:36.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n102\n00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.410\n&gt;&gt; The logical or's and\n\n103\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.480\nthe double ampersands for and.\n\n104\n00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.560\n&gt;&gt; Logical ands, yep.\n\n105\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.132\n&gt;&gt; We're starting to digress\ninto multiple languages.\n\n106\n00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] this is geekdom.\n\n107\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.510\nHardcore geekdom.\n\n108\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.810\n&gt;&gt; I did say we were gonna talk about some\nlanguages, and so now we're getting into\n\n109\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.884\nprogramming and coding languages\nthat we need to come back to Word.\n\n110\n00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:54.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about this.\n\n111\n00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:56.320\nSo How do I get down to the next line?\n\n112\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.010\nLike I said, you hit the Enter key.\n\n113\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.070\nSo I've made a paragraph.\n\n114\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.900\nI could type some letters into here,\nand pretend I can type, and\n\n115\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.590\nif I hit the Tab key.\n\n116\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.550\nNow, the Tab key, Daniel, let me ask you,\nwhat happens when you hit the Tab key?\n\n117\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.710\n&gt;&gt; If I'm remembering correctly, the Tab\nkey does a specific amount of white spaces\n\n118\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.070\nTo the right, and\nI think it's four by default.\n\n119\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.520\nOr eight.\nIs it eight or four?\n\n120\n00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.970\n&gt;&gt; Well as soon-\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember.\n\n121\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.750\n&gt;&gt; As you say it, I'm like, kind of,\nbut what threw me off was the spaces,\n\n122\n00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.720\nbut this is why I asked this-\n&gt;&gt; Blank characters.\n\n123\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because a lot of people,\nwhen I ask them, tab, what does it do?\n\n124\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.980\nThey're like, it takes you in five spaces.\n\n125\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.270\nThat's how I was always taught.\n\n126\n00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.080\nIt takes you in five spaces.\n\n127\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.500\nSo if I type some more letters, and\nI hit the tab key, that's five spaces.\n\n128\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.920\nType a few more letters, that's, wait\na second, so every time I'm hitting tab,\n\n129\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.830\nwhy am I getting different\namounts of space?\n\n130\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.430\nI thought you said it was five spaces?\n\n131\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.970\nSo that's where it's one of those like,\nI think it's, and\n\n132\n00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.840\nmaybe this is the day\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n133\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.180\n&gt;&gt; Of the old typewriters.\n\n134\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.581\nIs that it was hard coded, to where it\nmoved the carriage over five spaces\n\n135\n00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:07.160\n&gt;&gt; X amount of spaces, regardless if there\n\n136\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.852\nwas something in it already or not\n&gt;&gt; Correct\n\n137\n00:06:08.852 --> 00:06:09.544\n&gt;&gt; There you go\n\n138\n00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:11.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, when you get into computers, and\n\n139\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.350\nwe start getting to hear what a tab does,\nit takes you to the next\n\n140\n00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.430\ndefault tab stop on the ruler\nwhich is Every half inch.\n\n141\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.010\nTalked about seeing the ruler up here.\n\n142\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.120\nI know that there's tabs in here,\nokay, I know cuz I typed them in.\n\n143\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.440\nBut that's a tab,\nthat's a tab, that's a tab.\n\n144\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.520\nYou get a tab, you get a tab.\n\n145\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.230\nEverybody has tabs in here,\nbut it all corresponds to that\n\n146\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.540\nruler that's on the top here.\n\n147\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.070\nSo you could almost see\nthere's A one here,\n\n148\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.440\nand you're not gonna really\nknow exactly what I'm doing.\n\n149\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.290\nThere's another half here,\nthere's another, whoops,\n\n150\n00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.200\nI'm actually making tab stops.\n\n151\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.680\nSo there's that half, so every half mark\non the ruler is where the tab stops.\n\n152\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.260\nNow, this line of text right here,\nnotice that it went over.\n\n153\n00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.780\nWhat was that?\n\n154\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.470\nThree.\n\n155\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.280\nIt went past the three and a half,\nso the next stop is at four.\n\n156\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.590\nSo, it's not five spaces,\nit's every half inch on the ruler, and\n\n157\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.180\nthat's why I think that\n&gt;&gt; And that's specific to Word, correct?\n\n158\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.240\nBecause if I was using some text editor\n\n159\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.610\nin a terminal environment,\nthat might be different, right?\n\n160\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.430\nSo, where as Word has said, okay,\nwe're looking at document typing.\n\n161\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.240\nLet's set a standard and we'll use that.\n\n162\n00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you're exactly correct,\nbecause tabs do something different in\n\n163\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.710\nother programs so, yes, and\nif you talk to coders about\n\n164\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.950\nthe difference between tabs and spaces\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] Yeah.\n\n165\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.300\nThere is whole episodes online.\n\n166\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.180\nOne of my favorite shows that talks about\nit is hilarious, but again I'm digressing.\n\n167\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.140\nBut yes, tabs versus spaces.\n\n168\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.711\nCoders, that's like, you know,\nbad territory to start debating there.\n\n169\n00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:55.847\nBut in Word, like you're saying,\nit is every half inch on the ruler mark.\n\n170\n00:07:55.847 --> 00:08:01.874\nAnd if I hit enter again after the n\nI'm typing in There's something else.\n\n171\n00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:06.740\nWhen I type Enter, that's a hard return,\nit is making an actual paragraph.\n\n172\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.770\nThere is also something known as a soft\nreturn, or also known as a line break.\n\n173\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.990\nI'm just typing in blah-be-blahs,\n\n174\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.775\nI'm not going to not do the Enter key,\nI'm doing Shift+Enter.\n\n175\n00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:24.410\nShift+Enter takes me to the next line,\nbut it doesn't break the paragraph,\n\n176\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.590\nand I'll have some more text.\n\n177\n00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.000\nI'm gonna hit Enter, and\nthere's my difference.\n\n178\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.723\nNow, if I'm looking at this right here,\nI have no clue as, is this five spaces, or\n\n179\n00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:39.857\ndid somebody hit the Space, Space, Space,\nSpace, Space, and how many people do that?\n\n180\n00:08:39.857 --> 00:08:42.556\nI got to move over, Space, Space,\nSpace, then you got to move over.\n\n181\n00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:44.450\nNo, use tabs, use tabs!\n\n182\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.300\nWatch my episode on tabs, I love them.\n\n183\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.500\nSo, I don't know if these are spaces, or\ntabs, or a line break, or a hard return.\n\n184\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.640\nWhat's going on in here?\n\n185\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:09:00.100\nThis wonderful button here,\nthis show/hide character button.\n\n186\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.550\nI always have this on,\nalways, because I do so\n\n187\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.980\nmuch typesetting that I need\nto know what's going on here.\n\n188\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.730\nAs soon as you turn this on, it's going to\nshow you everyplace that there is a space.\n\n189\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.320\nIndicated by a dot, where there is a tab.\n\n190\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.630\nIndicated by an arrow,\nwhere there is a line break.\n\n191\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:23.130\nSee that that is not the same\nAs the enter mark on\n\n192\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.630\nthe paragraph, that is a paragraph,\nthat is a line break.\n\n193\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.300\nSo if I'm trying to format this with tabs,\nand\n\n194\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.570\nthere are just a bunch of spaces, I'm\nnot going to be able to do anything with\n\n195\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.540\nmy tabs because there's\nno character in there.\n\n196\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.050\nThere.\n\n197\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.290\nSo having this on is gonna show\nyou all of those different things.\n\n198\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.910\nIf I had a page break,\nyou see it, if you have sections,\n\n199\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:49.470\nif you have all those different things\nthat you don't see, it's there.\n\n200\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.830\nIt's just different commands\nthat Is that you are telling\n\n201\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.770\nWord how to organize all of\nthe information on your page.\n\n202\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:07.610\nSo that's very important to understand\nthat button, and why you need to have it.\n\n203\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.680\nThis also starts to get into\nthe wonderful world of.\n\n204\n00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.520\nANSI characters.\n\n205\n00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.180\nAnd yes,\n\n206\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.100\nhe's laughing over here cuz I said\nwe're gonna get into our geek session.\n\n207\n00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.960\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nget into this right now.\n\n208\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Not antsy like they\nare trying to dance around and\n\n209\n00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.870\nthey just can't sit in their seats still,\nright?\n\n210\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.393\n&gt;&gt; Antsy pants, antsy pants, yeah.\n\n211\n00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:27.941\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; ANSI, right?\n\n212\n00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:32.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's actually AS, whoops,\nthere's ANSI and there's ASCII.\n\n213\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.190\n&gt;&gt; And ASCII, right.\n\n214\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.230\n&gt;&gt; So let me, yes, you are correct, ANSI.\n\n215\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which.\n\n216\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.890\nI don't remember what that stands for\nbut [LAUGH] there is the ASCI so\n\n217\n00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.780\nI said ANSI and ASCI so they're usually\nkinda together because what we're talking\n\n218\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.700\nabout here is we're talking\nabout character sets okay.\n\n219\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.730\nThink about I just said alphanumerical\ncharacters when we're talking\n\n220\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.300\nabout that we're talking about a's.\n\n221\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.950\nAnd numbers and maybe sometimes,\nthose special characters but\n\n222\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.810\nwhat about the copyright symbol,\nor the trademark symbol?\n\n223\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.730\nThere are different characters that we\nhave that you could ahead and print.\n\n224\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.330\nTake that a little bit further,\nwhat about different languages?\n\n225\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.560\nLike, we're talking about English where we\nhave a specific character set well what if\n\n226\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.270\nwe're talking about Greek or Russian, or\n\n227\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.310\nyou're talking about a Middle Eastern\nlanguage that has different characters, or\n\n228\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.890\nwe talked about, I think it's in\nGerman where you have the umlaut.\n\n229\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.640\n&gt;&gt; The umlaut, yeah.\n\n230\n00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.630\n&gt;&gt; I love that word, the umlaut.\n\n231\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.660\nThose are the two little\ndots on top of your O.\n\n232\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.540\n&gt;&gt; Or the grave or accents.\n\n233\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.840\n&gt;&gt; yes, yes, the tilde on the N's\nin Spanish and all that good stuff.\n\n234\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.370\nHow do you do that?\n\n235\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.630\n&gt;&gt; I will show you.\n\n236\n00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.290\nWell if you are typing in\na different language then that's\n\n237\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.460\nwhere you do have to talk about\nsetting your languages in Word.\n\n238\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.210\nSo if you are typing a little like...\n\n239\n00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.990\nMaybe I need one letter\nwith the accent on it.\n\n240\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.190\nThe e with the accent on or\nthe n with the tilde.\n\n241\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.030\nBut I'm not using it all time Then\nthose are things that you can do to\n\n242\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.120\ninsert special characters.\n\n243\n00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.990\nAnd I actually have a link in\nthe show notes to where if you\n\n244\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.320\nare using specific characters\nthat do have accent marks.\n\n245\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.040\nThere's keyboard shortcuts to go ahead and\nmap to that so.\n\n246\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.480\nBut back over to this whole\nidea about a character set.\n\n247\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:21.550\nAnd let me switch over to Wikipedia\nbecause I have an article about ASCII,\n\n248\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.504\nthe American Standard Code for\nInformation Interchange.\n\n249\n00:12:24.504 --> 00:12:25.544\n&gt;&gt; Say that three times.\n\n250\n00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:27.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.\n\n251\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.510\nIt is a character and coding standard\nthat is designated by someone and\n\n252\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.430\nit represents text in computers.\n\n253\n00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.601\nDid you like how I just\nskipped on over that?\n\n254\n00:12:36.601 --> 00:12:39.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, blah blah blah blah blah,\ncharacter stuff.\n\n255\n00:12:39.681 --> 00:12:43.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Represents text in computers,\ntelecommunications equipment, and\n\n256\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:43.570\nother devices.\n\n257\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.760\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.940\nSo when we talk about our computers,\nwe have input devices and\n\n259\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.330\noutput devices, because Daniel what are\nwe, when we're working with computers and\n\n260\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.830\nall this information,\nit really boils down to what?\n\n261\n00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.340\nWhat's the base?\n\n262\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.600\n&gt;&gt; The base is us being able\nto interact with the computer\n\n263\n00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.410\nitself\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n264\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.460\nit being able to interact with us back.\n\n265\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So we need to be able to\n\n266\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.620\ninput information.\n\n267\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.850\nIt needs to be able to output readable\ninformation for us as humans.\n\n268\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nit's all about electrical signals.\n\n269\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n270\n00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.770\n&gt;&gt; And those electrical\nsignals are represented in?\n\n271\n00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.120\n&gt;&gt; Binary.\n\n272\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.720\nYes.\n\n273\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.740\nAnd there are ones and zeroes.\n\n274\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.310\n&gt;&gt; Ones and zeroes.\n\n275\n00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.540\n&gt;&gt; Everything is ones and zeroes.\n\n276\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.320\nThe whole, talk about the matrix, where\nyou see all the letters, right, yeah.\n\n277\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.540\nI mean, that's modern type stuff,\n\n278\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.540\nbut it really does boil down to it's on or\nit's off.\n\n279\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.560\nSo when I am clicking the letter A on my\nkeyboard, the keyboard is an input device,\n\n280\n00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.090\nit is inputting information\ninto the computer.\n\n281\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:46.320\nMy screen is outputting that information,\nso when I click the letter A, there's\n\n282\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.890\nsome type of electrical signal that that\nis saying, A's being pushed, display A.\n\n283\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.120\nWhat about the b or the c or the d?\n\n284\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.270\nIt's all code, it's all this mapped code\nthat is represented in these machines.\n\n285\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.220\nBecause we're actually\ntalking about machines here,\n\n286\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.320\nright, that have [INAUDIBLE] And\nall that wonderful sub.\n\n287\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.840\nAnd back in the day,\nwe didn't have all this fancy computers,\n\n288\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.960\nI never was around for the punch cards.\n\n289\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; People tell me about-\n\n290\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.260\n&gt;&gt; So, I worked at a company where they\n\n291\n00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.560\nhad done that for many years and\nobviously they're modern now.\n\n292\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.860\nBut they still have a lot of\ntheir old equipment around and\n\n293\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.820\nthey had punch card operating machines.\n\n294\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.000\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Like sitting in a room.\n\n295\n00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.190\nWith cards and everything, yeah they had\nreal tapes from old main frame stuff,\n\n296\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.514\nit was really cool,\nit was like a museum in a lot of ways.\n\n297\n00:14:36.514 --> 00:14:37.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n298\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.350\n&gt;&gt; Of course we had a server room with\nall modern server virtualization and\n\n299\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.190\nwhat not but\nthat stuff is still hanging around.\n\n300\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.730\nSo you just grab one and\nplay with it, it's a lot of fun.\n\n301\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and if you read this article,\nI'm not gonna read this for\n\n302\n00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.530\nyou and again I don't wanna go to\nfar down the rabbit hole, right?\n\n303\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.370\nBecause it can get Really...\n\n304\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.240\n&gt;&gt; Heady?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very heady, very quickly.\n\n305\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.780\nSo trying to stay up on\nthe surface up here.\n\n306\n00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.740\nYou had to have, I'm talking about\nthose non-printing characters,\n\n307\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.200\nto kind of bring it on back\nto where I had started.\n\n308\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.910\nThe, when am I doing a line return or\na soft return versus a carriage return?\n\n309\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.290\nI think i've used that terminology\nin other episodes where I am saying\n\n310\n00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.420\nenter is a carriage return.\n\n311\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.160\nThink about back to even like\nthe old typewriters, right.\n\n312\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.480\nWhen you, it got to the end you had to\ntell the carriage to actually return and\n\n313\n00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.270\nmove down a line.\n\n314\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.310\nIt had to be.\n\n315\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.080\n&gt;&gt; It was called a carriage,\nhence the terminology carriage return.\n\n316\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.345\nJust basically bringing all the stuff over\nfrom old style teletype and texts, yeah.\n\n317\n00:15:36.345 --> 00:15:39.500\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\nAnd so they're talking about that ask,\n\n318\n00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.060\nI keep saying antsy Well, I did say ASCII.\n\n319\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.890\n&gt;&gt; You did say ASCII.\n\n320\n00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.223\n&gt;&gt; I get them kinda confused, but\n\n321\n00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:51.163\nthere's ASCII,and when it was first\nstarted it was a 7-bit character set.\n\n322\n00:15:51.163 --> 00:15:55.015\nThere's 128 characters\nthat were available, and\n\n323\n00:15:55.015 --> 00:16:00.375\nit's talking about how the first 32\ncodes Where for control characters,\n\n324\n00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:04.645\nfor those that were not\nrepresented in printable language,\n\n325\n00:16:04.645 --> 00:16:09.810\nit's those things like, did you move\nover five spaces or did you tab?\n\n326\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.300\nDid you enter,\ndid you do a carriage return?\n\n327\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.510\nAre we just line feeding?\n\n328\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.470\nAre we just gonna keep on moving down or\ndo we need to move things around?\n\n329\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:22.940\nSo these non printed characters, it comes\ndown from the base of everything that we\n\n330\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.460\ntalk about in, or talk meaning like\nwe input text into our devices,\n\n331\n00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.250\nit's all based off of\nthis ASCII character set.\n\n332\n00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.960\nAnd it started out with just,\nall right, some as and some bs and\n\n333\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.000\nsome numbers, and all of these different\nthings to make our machines do things.\n\n334\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.840\nLike backspace and so on and so forth.\n\n335\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.880\nAnd there's something down in here,\n\n336\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:49.280\nI'm trying to just point out things that\nmight actually represent things to us now.\n\n337\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.330\nAnd remember I talked about there's like\na code, look at where I said, binary.\n\n338\n00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.040\nThere is an actual binary.\n\n339\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.550\nSee that I talked about line feeds and\nthese backspace, the shift.\n\n340\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.970\nIf I keep on moving down, these are all\nthe characters that you have, where it's\n\n341\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:07.890\nmoving around our device, either physical\nmachinery or in this case our computer.\n\n342\n00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:13.470\nSo where is that cursor going to and\nall those different 1's and 0's?\n\n343\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.490\nThis one right here.\n\n344\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:20.650\nCodes 20 for representation, and\nthe code for the space characters.\n\n345\n00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:25.700\nDanny, have you ever gotten a file name\nfrom somebody, and in the title there's\n\n346\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.220\nlike character character, %20, something,\nsomething %20, have you ever seen that?\n\n347\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the machine going, I need\nto put something here as a place, so\n\n348\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.920\nit can't be blank.\n\n349\n00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.160\nSo it just throws up it's character\nrepresentation from this.\n\n350\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going back to its\nsource language of a space is 20-\n\n351\n00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:45.470\n&gt;&gt; It'd be like a hex value.\n\n352\n00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we're taking about\nthese encoding character sets,\n\n353\n00:17:50.692 --> 00:17:54.248\nencoding languages,\njust think of them as language.\n\n354\n00:17:54.248 --> 00:17:56.223\nLike we're just speaking in English,\nor Spanish, or French.\n\n355\n00:17:56.223 --> 00:18:00.987\nAnd so, it's saying, well, I don't know\nwhat this is cuz it's speaking in French,\n\n356\n00:18:00.987 --> 00:18:04.190\nbut I'm sending it to somebody in English.\n\n357\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.177\nBut I know that a space is 20, so\nI'm gonna throw a 20 sign in there.\n\n358\n00:18:08.177 --> 00:18:09.776\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly enough,\n\n359\n00:18:09.776 --> 00:18:14.042\nthis is how hackers actually get\naround sanitation of your input.\n\n360\n00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:17.600\nSo you can create a Word document,\nyou can put a web link in there, correct?\n\n361\n00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.070\nAnd you can click on that link and\nit'll take you somewhere.\n\n362\n00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:24.809\nBut if your website or\nyour web security is looking for\n\n363\n00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:28.508\ncertain things like a .com of some sort.\n\n364\n00:18:28.508 --> 00:18:32.816\nI can actually put it in using their hex\nvalues and it might not be checking for\n\n365\n00:18:32.816 --> 00:18:35.320\nthat and\nstill take you to a malicious area.\n\n366\n00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.408\nSo it's really important for\nus to be able to look at these things and\n\n367\n00:18:39.408 --> 00:18:44.230\nsee why is %20 showing up instead of\nsomething, like the normal character?\n\n368\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember how you could mask\nemail addresses you'd have from spammers,\n\n369\n00:18:48.885 --> 00:18:51.080\nfrom spambots and stop spamming you.\n\n370\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.377\nThis was like a while ago,\nback when I was teaching this.\n\n371\n00:18:53.377 --> 00:18:56.928\nAnd you could type in each letter\nin their hex value or their binary,\n\n372\n00:18:56.928 --> 00:19:01.360\ncuz binary is hex and hex is binary,\nall these kind of different translations.\n\n373\n00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:07.772\nTo where it shows, it is outputting on our\ndevice that it looks like Vonne@Smith.com.\n\n374\n00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.883\n&gt;&gt; It's really a pain in\nthe keister to try to do [LAUGH].\n\n375\n00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.676\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's-\n&gt;&gt; But it is doable.\n\n376\n00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:16.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I mean we take for\ngranted, we just type.\n\n377\n00:19:16.338 --> 00:19:19.591\nBut all of this stuff is going\non in the background, and\n\n378\n00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:24.355\nall of our things that we're typing in is\nbased off of this base ASCII language.\n\n379\n00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:26.605\nAnd so here's all the printable codes.\n\n380\n00:19:26.605 --> 00:19:28.971\nThere's the binary,\nthere's the code for the letter A.\n\n381\n00:19:28.971 --> 00:19:31.616\n&gt;&gt; 41, I know that one very well.\n\n382\n00:19:31.616 --> 00:19:33.398\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; For writing exploit code, yeah.\n\n383\n00:19:33.398 --> 00:19:34.796\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I use it a lot.\n\n384\n00:19:34.796 --> 00:19:36.455\n&gt;&gt; What are you exploiting?\n\n385\n00:19:36.455 --> 00:19:38.205\nI know you do a lot of-\n&gt;&gt; Many things, yes.\n\n386\n00:19:38.205 --> 00:19:41.070\n&gt;&gt; I know you do a lot of stuff\nwith security and pen testing.\n\n387\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.131\nSo penetration testing of security\nnetworks and all that kind of fun.\n\n388\n00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:48.067\nI just sounded like really\nsmart right there, didn't I?\n\n389\n00:19:48.067 --> 00:19:51.170\n[LAUGH] So you get in the zone\nthat techie heady stuff.\n\n390\n00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.593\nBut just getting back to everything is\ncoded and there are character sets and\n\n391\n00:19:55.593 --> 00:19:56.630\nthese letters and\n\n392\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.795\nthese numbers that really mean\nsomething in the back to your computer.\n\n393\n00:20:00.795 --> 00:20:06.632\nIt was talking also about right here in\n1963, that it was determined that this\n\n394\n00:20:06.632 --> 00:20:12.234\nwas going to be the language that all\ncomputers or machines were gonna talk in.\n\n395\n00:20:12.234 --> 00:20:15.390\nAgain, I don't want to\ngo too deep into this.\n\n396\n00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.425\nBut it's just one of those, I love the-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n397\n00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.442\nit's nice to know where it came from and\nthe evolution of it so\n\n398\n00:20:20.442 --> 00:20:23.650\nthat you can understand it better\nwhen you're working with it.\n\n399\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.050\nOtherwise it's just a bunch of stuff and\nyou're like, why does this thing do this?\n\n400\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n401\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.032\n&gt;&gt; And how a little bit of the back story\ncan help out with that which can help you\n\n402\n00:20:32.032 --> 00:20:36.441\nunderstand why it's doing certain things\nand maybe overcome some obstacles.\n\n403\n00:20:36.441 --> 00:20:38.860\n&gt;&gt; Why the %20 comes up in\nsome of your file names.\n\n404\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.728\nEspecially when a lot of times\nit goes from like Mac to PC.\n\n405\n00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:43.205\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I get that a lot so,\n\n406\n00:20:43.205 --> 00:20:46.070\nthe 7-bit encoding and the 128.\n\n407\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.946\nThis is where you hear\nthese numbers a lot.\n\n408\n00:20:49.946 --> 00:20:56.530\nIf you're in a computer talk enough, you\nhear 128, you hear 256, you hear 65,536.\n\n409\n00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:02.075\nBecause these are all 2 to the certain\npower, we're talking about exponents.\n\n410\n00:21:02.075 --> 00:21:04.650\nI noticed, we're getting into math,\nit starts getting scary.\n\n411\n00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.019\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just started sweating.\n\n412\n00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:08.692\nJust started sweating, help me.\n\n413\n00:21:08.692 --> 00:21:10.018\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n414\n00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:14.978\nSo 2 to the 8th is, and I had to write\nthis down to make sure I was doing it,\n\n415\n00:21:14.978 --> 00:21:17.380\nso to the 8th in binary is a 128.\n\n416\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.550\n2 to the 16th is 65,536.\n\n417\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.100\n2 to the 24 is-\n&gt;&gt; 4 point, no its not, yeah.\n\n418\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.325\n&gt;&gt; One million, wait, 16 million,\n777 thousand, a lot of numbers [LAUGH].\n\n419\n00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:26.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and to 32 it's 4.3 billion.\n\n420\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI have it written down right there.\n\n421\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see we work in computers.\n\n422\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.135\nWe hear these numbers quite often.\n\n423\n00:21:33.135 --> 00:21:34.782\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the other thing,\n\n424\n00:21:34.782 --> 00:21:38.096\nif you go into gaming, remember like\nback where we had 8-bit gaming systems,\n\n425\n00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:41.220\nwhere just it had those little squares\nlike Super Mario and all that stuff.\n\n426\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.615\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then you went to 16-bit.\n\n427\n00:21:42.615 --> 00:21:46.933\n&gt;&gt; And you were like that means\nit can hold more information,\n\n428\n00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:50.350\ntherefore render a higher quality graphic.\n\n429\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.770\nHence the reason this looks so\n\n430\n00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.440\ngood compared to what our previous\ngame systems looked like.\n\n431\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.889\nThere you go,\nnow you understand the bit technology.\n\n432\n00:21:56.889 --> 00:22:00.426\n&gt;&gt; And then you get into 32-bit operating\nsystems, 64-bit operating systems,\n\n433\n00:22:00.426 --> 00:22:03.180\nbecause now it's not just like,\nwhat is your operating system?\n\n434\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.892\nIt's like, I'm Windows 10 64-bit,\nI'm Windows 8 32-bit,\n\n435\n00:22:07.892 --> 00:22:12.420\nbecause think about the bigger the number,\nthe more stuff it can hold.\n\n436\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.000\nTranslate this into your televisions,\nright?\n\n437\n00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.650\nAll of these, hey,\nit can display 50 million colors and\n\n438\n00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.183\nthe colors are so rich, it's because,\n\n439\n00:22:21.183 --> 00:22:25.600\nit's just the byte information that\nis allowed in these devices now.\n\n440\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.689\nWe keep getting smaller but yet\n\n441\n00:22:27.689 --> 00:22:31.395\nwe keep getting bigger in\nwhat we can display and show.\n\n442\n00:22:31.395 --> 00:22:33.960\nAnd so\nall of this is on that base of binary.\n\n443\n00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.568\nIt's 1's and 0's, either on or off,\nand then how much this stuff can do.\n\n444\n00:22:38.568 --> 00:22:43.105\n&gt;&gt; At the end of the day, that's just\na processor going, here is a binary value.\n\n445\n00:22:43.105 --> 00:22:45.716\nLet me calculate that and turn\nthe correct switches, and there you go.\n\n446\n00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:47.884\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and-\n&gt;&gt; And it just does it really fast.\n\n447\n00:22:47.884 --> 00:22:48.384\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n448\n00:22:48.384 --> 00:22:50.424\n&gt;&gt; And they're like, you can't see them,\n\n449\n00:22:50.424 --> 00:22:52.351\nwith all these chips and everything.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n450\n00:22:52.351 --> 00:22:52.997\n&gt;&gt; But again,\n\n451\n00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:56.245\nit all comes back to this and\nit's talking about letters.\n\n452\n00:22:56.245 --> 00:22:59.122\nIf we come back down in this page,\nwhere we have the 8-bit length.\n\n453\n00:22:59.122 --> 00:23:00.836\nThink about, like I said,\n\n454\n00:23:00.836 --> 00:23:05.620\nwhat about different languages that\ndon't have just As and Bs and Cs and Ds?\n\n455\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.530\nWe need different characters.\n\n456\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.765\nYou start getting into your\nEastern languages, and\n\n457\n00:23:09.765 --> 00:23:12.423\nyou have your double-byte congee fonts.\n\n458\n00:23:12.423 --> 00:23:15.923\nAnd you have things that are in\nactual graphical representations but\n\n459\n00:23:15.923 --> 00:23:17.500\nthey're still letters.\n\n460\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.290\nSo how could we display on this?\n\n461\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.397\nAnd this is where ASCII started and\nthen you had to go a little bit further.\n\n462\n00:23:23.397 --> 00:23:29.170\nAnd then you start getting into things\nlike Unicode, and this character set.\n\n463\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.750\nAnd you can see, UTF 8 UTF 16, UTF 32.\n\n464\n00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:38.110\nHow much support will this\ncharacter set allow you to have?\n\n465\n00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:45.240\nAnd so you can see that this is where it\nstarted, ASCII is the base of Unicode.\n\n466\n00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.613\nUnicode is what we now\nreally kind of work with and\n\n467\n00:23:48.613 --> 00:23:52.003\nwhen you start getting\ninto how different code.\n\n468\n00:23:52.003 --> 00:23:54.821\nI know with languages,\nlike computer languages,\n\n469\n00:23:54.821 --> 00:23:58.633\nyou start formatting webpages and\nhow databases talk to each other.\n\n470\n00:23:58.633 --> 00:24:04.421\nAnd how you have to designate\nWhat character set you're using?\n\n471\n00:24:04.421 --> 00:24:07.544\nIt's like the ISO something 49.\n\n472\n00:24:07.544 --> 00:24:11.149\nIt's like the standard Latin,\nokay, we're in a Latin language,\n\n473\n00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:14.570\nmeaning that we can have\nthese Latin characters.\n\n474\n00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.430\nWe're not in Chinese or\n\n475\n00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.880\nKorean or a different type of language\nthat we need a different character set.\n\n476\n00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.729\nSo you just have to designate\nthat this is what we're using.\n\n477\n00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:28.143\nAnd just to throw over that other\nweb page that's talking about with\n\n478\n00:24:28.143 --> 00:24:30.552\nthe Universal Coded Character Set.\n\n479\n00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:38.158\nAnd it starts getting into the lines\nwhere it has 128 groups of 256 planes.\n\n480\n00:24:38.158 --> 00:24:39.479\nLook at those numbers again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there they are.\n\n481\n00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:41.383\n&gt;&gt; 128 and 256, right?\n\n482\n00:24:41.383 --> 00:24:43.300\nThey're all based on two.\n\n483\n00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.780\nAnd that gets to where you have so\n\n484\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.790\nmany characters that can be\nallowed in a character set.\n\n485\n00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.840\nSo small little techie,\ngeeky history lesson about how\n\n486\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:00.070\nwe're even getting to, in Word,\nbeing able to type these letters.\n\n487\n00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.955\nAnd what these non-printed characters,\nand then,\n\n488\n00:25:03.955 --> 00:25:09.649\ncoming back full circle, what about if\nI do need to insert a copyright symbol,\n\n489\n00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:13.388\nor I need to insert the n\nwith the tilde on it, the ñ?\n\n490\n00:25:13.388 --> 00:25:18.133\nI need to get a different character\nbesides the ones that I can actually\n\n491\n00:25:18.133 --> 00:25:20.960\nclick on the keyboard on my input device.\n\n492\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.220\nIt's there, I just can't type it.\n\n493\n00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.135\nYou go into your Insert menu,\nand you come over to your Symbol.\n\n494\n00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:31.940\nAnd in the Symbol,\nyou have some basic characters.\n\n495\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.650\nYou come into more symbols.\n\n496\n00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:40.170\nAnd if you read that whole Wikipedia\narticle and really get into the geeky\n\n497\n00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:45.830\nstuff, the different subsets of where\nthe Greek Extended, the Latin Extended.\n\n498\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.220\nAll of those base off of the that ASCII,\nbut then you got to make it a little bit\n\n499\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.760\nbigger to support all those\ndifferent characters.\n\n500\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.310\nAnd there's a lot of different categories.\n\n501\n00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.502\nBut if I start scrolling down\nthrough here, and you can see, okay,\n\n502\n00:25:59.502 --> 00:26:02.526\nlike what we would consider in\nEnglish our regular characters,\n\n503\n00:26:02.526 --> 00:26:05.607\nthen you get into your character\nwith the umlauts and the tildes.\n\n504\n00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:06.228\n&gt;&gt; Umlaut? [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n505\n00:26:06.228 --> 00:26:07.004\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Umlaut!\n\n506\n00:26:07.004 --> 00:26:11.120\n[LAUGH] So you get into these characters,\nand you keep on scrolling down.\n\n507\n00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.826\nAnd you get into, I don't know what\nthose are, but they're something.\n\n508\n00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:14.532\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Some script [CROSSTALK].\n\n509\n00:26:14.532 --> 00:26:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n510\n00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.639\nThen you get into,\n\n511\n00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:20.680\nlike these looks a little bit\nmore like the Cyrillic languages.\n\n512\n00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.466\nSo you get into languages that look\nmore like either Russian or Greek.\n\n513\n00:26:24.466 --> 00:26:26.950\n&gt;&gt; That looks like Hebrew right there,\nor something.\n\n514\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so\nyou get into these languages, and\n\n515\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.640\nthen you get into some of your\nMiddle Eastern languages.\n\n516\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.248\nSo these are all, and\nyou can see that subset changing.\n\n517\n00:26:35.248 --> 00:26:38.465\nAnd I can feel myself talking faster,\ncuz I'm getting really excited.\n\n518\n00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:41.903\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Calm down, Windmill, calm down.\n\n519\n00:26:41.903 --> 00:26:42.566\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n520\n00:26:42.566 --> 00:26:45.882\nnow cuz I really just wanted\nthe copyright symbol.\n\n521\n00:26:45.882 --> 00:26:46.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Where is it?\n\n522\n00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it is in one of the most\nrecently used, cuz I was using this.\n\n523\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.289\nAnd it's a very common symbol\nthat you might want to.\n\n524\n00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:58.629\nI'm gonna single-click on it, because\nthese character codes we talked about that\n\n525\n00:26:58.629 --> 00:27:00.717\nit did have a character, Unicode.\n\n526\n00:27:00.717 --> 00:27:01.410\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n527\n00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.170\n&gt;&gt; We were just talking about that.\n\n528\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.754\n&gt;&gt; Yes, what a coincidence.\n\n529\n00:27:03.754 --> 00:27:04.802\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n530\n00:27:04.802 --> 00:27:08.234\n[LAUGH] Round and round, come full circle.\n\n531\n00:27:08.234 --> 00:27:09.430\nAll good, circular.\n\n532\n00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.980\nAnd you can see that\nthere is a shortcut here.\n\n533\n00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.655\nIf I wanted to type it in,\nI could hold my Alt key,\n\n534\n00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:21.348\nthen type in 0169,\nI don't think you even have to let go.\n\n535\n00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:25.490\nYou just tell it to go into Alt, type\nin the code, and it types it right in.\n\n536\n00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.004\nSo if you memorize some of these codes,\nso if you're always using the ñ,\n\n537\n00:27:30.004 --> 00:27:33.261\nyou can find the code, and\nthen be able to map it out.\n\n538\n00:27:33.261 --> 00:27:37.638\nOr find that website that goes ahead and\nlists those out for you and\n\n539\n00:27:37.638 --> 00:27:41.172\nyou can make it put in\nthese different symbols.\n\n540\n00:27:41.172 --> 00:27:43.940\nI double-clicked on it and\nnoticed that it did insert it.\n\n541\n00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.880\nThat's one thing, if it's here and\nyou just click Insert, you're like,\n\n542\n00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.330\nit's not doing anything, and\nthen you close and you're like, well, now,\n\n543\n00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.566\nI have a bunch of those.\n\n544\n00:27:51.566 --> 00:27:56.321\n[LAUGH] One other one that you might see,\njust to kinda end,\n\n545\n00:27:56.321 --> 00:27:59.120\nI've talked about the %20 for the space.\n\n546\n00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.290\nThere's also something known\nas a non-breaking space.\n\n547\n00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.450\nIf I hit the space bar, space, space,\n\n548\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.960\nspace, space, you can see little dots\nwhere it's just indicating a space.\n\n549\n00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.280\nLet's see if I can remember the shortcut,\nyep, there it is.\n\n550\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.912\nAnd let me zoom in so you can see-\n&gt;&gt; Share with the whole class, Vonne.\n\n551\n00:28:15.912 --> 00:28:18.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever seen those, Daniel?\n\n552\n00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.404\nWell, I don't know how many times-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've never seen this now.\n\n553\n00:28:21.404 --> 00:28:26.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, because I always\nhave my show hide characters.\n\n554\n00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.150\nI work in a Macintosh and\na PC environment.\n\n555\n00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.180\nI work with lots of files from\nlots of different peoples.\n\n556\n00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.880\nI see this all the time,\nespecially in tables, and\n\n557\n00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.860\nwhere they've copied it from some website.\n\n558\n00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.507\nIt's usually from websites, because\na lot of times when you're talking about\n\n559\n00:28:46.507 --> 00:28:49.428\ncoding for web pages,\nyou can only hit one space.\n\n560\n00:28:49.428 --> 00:28:51.948\nIt will only render, but let me back up.\n\n561\n00:28:51.948 --> 00:28:53.604\nYou can hit the space bar\nas many times as you want.\n\n562\n00:28:53.604 --> 00:28:57.857\nBut in HTML coding, it will only render\non the screen as one single space,\n\n563\n00:28:57.857 --> 00:29:00.930\neven if you have 15 of them in your code.\n\n564\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.640\nBut to force the space over, talking\nabout these non-printing characters,\n\n565\n00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.237\nyou have to do what's known\nas a non-printing space.\n\n566\n00:29:07.237 --> 00:29:12.940\nA non-breaking space is\nShift+ Ctrl+Space bar, and you see this.\n\n567\n00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.380\nSo I've gotten documents from people,\nespecially since I do a lot of designing,\n\n568\n00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.790\nlike, here, here's all our information.\n\n569\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.691\nNow make it pretty into a nice flier or\nwhatever.\n\n570\n00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:24.988\nI go ahead and get the text, and\nI see all of this cuz they've copied it.\n\n571\n00:29:24.988 --> 00:29:27.272\nAnd so I have to come in here and\nsay, nope,\n\n572\n00:29:27.272 --> 00:29:29.435\nget the non-breaking spaces out of it.\n\n573\n00:29:29.435 --> 00:29:34.681\nI don't want that, because it's not going\nto render, or do what I want it to do.\n\n574\n00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:37.060\nSo I have to pull it all out.\n\n575\n00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.700\nBut if I didn't know that there was a\nbutton in Word that would even allow me to\n\n576\n00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.750\nsee that, you're like,\nit just will not stop moving over.\n\n577\n00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.390\nWhy does it keep moving over?\n\n578\n00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.240\nYou probably have those in there.\n\n579\n00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.240\nOr you might have a line break,\nor a tab, or a section,\n\n580\n00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.830\nor all those different things.\n\n581\n00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.420\nIt is like,\nto me it's like the Holy Grail.\n\n582\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:56.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n583\n00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.994\n&gt;&gt; Why is Word doing this?\n\n584\n00:29:57.994 --> 00:29:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n585\n00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.968\n&gt;&gt; That's why.\n\n586\n00:29:59.968 --> 00:30:04.594\nThere's a whole world of special\ncharacters and non-printing characters\n\n587\n00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:09.506\nthat is telling your document what to do\nall based on our ASCII, and our Unicode,\n\n588\n00:30:09.506 --> 00:30:12.280\nand so, keep that button in your mind.\n\n589\n00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.490\nAlways turn it on.\n\n590\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.760\nLove that button, and it will love you.\n\n591\n00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.905\n&gt;&gt; Now I understand why in the world these\nfunky backwards ps have been showing up.\n\n592\n00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:21.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I used to get calls\n\n593\n00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:22.760\nabout this all the time.\n\n594\n00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.720\nWhy is this weird backwards p showing up?\n\n595\n00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.950\nThey were turning this on.\n\n596\n00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.240\nSo and now we know.\n\n597\n00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.599\nIt's actually a useful function, and\n\n598\n00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:30.959\nnot just there to irritate people\nthat don't know what it is [LAUGH].\n\n599\n00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:32.655\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly [LAUGH].\n\n600\n00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, though, Vonne.\n\n601\n00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:37.600\nYou did a great job of showing us why\nthe characters that we use are there,\n\n602\n00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.630\nhow they're displayed, how characters that\naren't displayed are actually still there,\n\n603\n00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.720\nand why they are there and\nwhere they come from.\n\n604\n00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.010\nAnd a little bit of back story,\n\n605\n00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.470\nwhich was a lot of fun to go\ndown memory lane as well.\n\n606\n00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:49.442\nWe do thank you for that.\n\n607\n00:30:49.442 --> 00:30:52.050\nBut Vonne, it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n608\n00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.740\nWe do thank you all for watching as well.\n\n609\n00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.760\nSigning off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n610\n00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.420\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:11.179\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.531\nAnd in today's episode, we're coming\nback with more of our Word 2016 series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:17.559\nAnd of course,\njoining us in the studio yet again,\n\n6\n00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.000\nto lend her expertise on the very topic,\nour good friend, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.523\nVonne, welcome to the show,\nand how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:23.760\n&gt;&gt; It is going wonderful.\n\n9\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.061\nWe're gonna talk all about\nAutoCorrect options in Word,\n\n10\n00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.495\nall the things that Word\ndoes to help us along.\n\n11\n00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:35.389\nAnd sometimes while it's trying\nto be helpful, you're kinda like,\n\n12\n00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:36.591\ncan you please stop?\n\n13\n00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:42.370\nSo I'll show you how to disable some of\nthese AutoCorrect options, along the way.\n\n14\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.160\nSo why don't we go ahead and get started,\nand start inputting some text.\n\n15\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.610\nWe did have an entire\nepisode about inputting text.\n\n16\n00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.627\nWe got to geek out really good\nabout character sets, and\n\n17\n00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:55.884\nUTF-8, and ASCII, and it was a lot of fun.\n\n18\n00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:58.158\nSo if you haven't checked that out,\ndefinitely go back.\n\n19\n00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:02.828\nCuz you might have seen the title,\nInput Text, I know how to input text,\n\n20\n00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:03.680\ngo watch it.\n\n21\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.080\n&gt;&gt; It'll definitely increase\nyour nerd street rep, no doubt.\n\n22\n00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.892\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, you could maybe\nexpand your knowledge, expand?\n\n23\n00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:13.397\nExpound your knowledge on somebody.\n\n24\n00:01:13.397 --> 00:01:16.757\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can't expand and\nexpound your knowledge, [CROSSTALK].\n\n25\n00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:19.879\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and people might look at\nyou going, that's why [CROSSTALK].\n\n26\n00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.419\n&gt;&gt; Well listen, you know you've arrived\nwhen they get that glazed-over look.\n\n27\n00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:27.821\nYeah, sounds interesting, anyway-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.407\n&gt;&gt; So, why don't we go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:32.590\njump down into Justin's computer,\nand our lovely desktop.\n\n30\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.980\nWe're going to be starting from scratch,\nso\n\n31\n00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.600\nwe're going to start a new Word document.\n\n32\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.032\nI actually pinned word to the Start,\nthat's not the Start, that's the taskbar\n\n33\n00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:43.901\ndown there, to go ahead and make it\neasier for me to launch the product.\n\n34\n00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:48.859\nStarting at our Start screen, and we'll\nclick on Blank Document to go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:49.679\ngo forward.\n\n36\n00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.637\nI do have right now our\nShow/Hide Hidden Characters on,\n\n37\n00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:56.699\nbecause it was left over\nfrom our last show.\n\n38\n00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:00.612\nAnd just me always having it on,\nwhen I'm working in Word.\n\n39\n00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:03.905\nI'll turn it off just for now,\njust to make it a little less cluttered.\n\n40\n00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:05.144\nAs we go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:10.021\ndemonstrate some of these different\noptions that Word gives us.\n\n42\n00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:13.360\nSo, AutoCorrect options.\n\n43\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.815\nI'm going to show you where\nit is in the Options menu, or\n\n44\n00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:21.094\ndialog box, whatever you want to call it,\nfrom the backstage view.\n\n45\n00:02:21.094 --> 00:02:24.593\nSo if you come over here to File,\nyou come over to Options.\n\n46\n00:02:24.593 --> 00:02:28.920\nWhich we've been to quite a few times,\nin a number of our different episodes.\n\n47\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.410\nWe're going to go into\nthe Proofing section, right here.\n\n48\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.355\nAnd to show you that all of these things,\nand I'm going to show you what it does.\n\n49\n00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:41.561\nHere is where you can control whether or\nnot you want it to do certain things, or\n\n50\n00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:42.855\nnot do certain things.\n\n51\n00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:47.239\nSo you have things like\nthe Ignore Words in Uppercase when it's\n\n52\n00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.474\ncorrecting spelling, and things like that.\n\n53\n00:02:50.474 --> 00:02:51.654\nCuz when we type,\n\n54\n00:02:51.654 --> 00:02:55.991\nit is going to automatically start\nproofing our document for us.\n\n55\n00:02:55.991 --> 00:03:00.154\nAnd we'll be seeing little squiggly lines\nand sometimes some double blue underlines,\n\n56\n00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:01.550\nand what do those mean?\n\n57\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.120\nWell, we'll go ahead and\nidentify some of them.\n\n58\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.752\nBut you have also here,\nyour AutoCorrect Options button.\n\n59\n00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:13.510\nAnd when you click on this, there\nare multiple tabs within this dialog box.\n\n60\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.223\nYou can see there's the AutoCorrect,\nthe AutoFormat, as you type.\n\n61\n00:03:17.223 --> 00:03:21.539\nCuz we have different things that it's\ngoing to be doing, to correct ourselves.\n\n62\n00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.464\nBut then the other one, the AutoFormat?\n\n63\n00:03:24.464 --> 00:03:29.381\nThis is where Word will format\nautomatically as we type, if we input\n\n64\n00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:34.752\na certain amount of characters, or\ncertain things within our document.\n\n65\n00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:38.489\nFor it to say, I'm going to\nautomatically format that for you.\n\n66\n00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.057\nSo these are our different tabs,\n\n67\n00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:43.590\nthat we will be coming back through as\nwe go through some of these examples.\n\n68\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.380\nTo say, this is the specific one\nthat I'm demonstrating right now.\n\n69\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.990\nSo, at least now you know where we are at,\nor where we can go,\n\n70\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.480\nto cancel some of these options\nthat happen automatically.\n\n71\n00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.890\nSo flashing cursor in my page,\nwhere I want to start typing.\n\n72\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.140\nOne of the first AutoCorrect\noptions that it does, is it will\n\n73\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.160\nautomatically capitalize the first letters\nof your sentence, if you don't do it.\n\n74\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.817\nI'll tell you,\nI've gotten so used to this,\n\n75\n00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:14.400\nthat I don't capitalize\nthe first words of the sentences\n\n76\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.510\nby holding the Shift key, and\ncapitalizing that first letter.\n\n77\n00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.296\nAnd it's kind of a bad habit\nthat it's gotten me into,\n\n78\n00:04:21.296 --> 00:04:23.125\ncuz not all of our programs do this.\n\n79\n00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:26.473\nSo it looks like I don't know\nthe rules of the English language,\n\n80\n00:04:26.473 --> 00:04:28.214\nI don't know how to type things.\n\n81\n00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:30.709\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, which a lot of times, I don't,\n\n82\n00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:32.472\nwhich is nice, that Word helps us.\n\n83\n00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:36.903\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I started by typing in hello\n\n84\n00:04:36.903 --> 00:04:41.140\nwithout a capital H, so there we go.\n\n85\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.022\nAs soon as I space off this, because right\nnow, you're like, it's not doing anything.\n\n86\n00:04:45.022 --> 00:04:46.120\nYou gotta space off it, for\n\n87\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.460\nit to know that you're finished\ntyping that particular word.\n\n88\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.200\nSo I hit the Space bar, and there you\ncan see, the H becomes capitalized,\n\n89\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.490\nbecause that is one of\nthose Auto settings.\n\n90\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.440\nAnother thing it's going to be doing is,\n\n91\n00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.630\nit's going to start correcting\nwords that are commonly misspelled.\n\n92\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.830\nWhich can be very helpful for\nlike, receive.\n\n93\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.825\nWhat's the rule there, Daniel?\n\n94\n00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.970\n&gt;&gt; I before E, except after C, right?\n\n95\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and then isn't.\n\n96\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.843\n&gt;&gt; Except for in receive, right?\n\n97\n00:05:14.843 --> 00:05:17.180\n&gt;&gt; I before E except after C, right?\n\n98\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.822\n&gt;&gt; No, that works, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:20.588\n&gt;&gt; And then the others, and also like E-I,\n\n100\n00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:23.085\nin neighbor and weigh,\ndo you remember that part of it?\n\n101\n00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:24.979\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do remember that one, yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.392\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because weigh doesn't\nhave the I before E either.\n\n103\n00:05:28.392 --> 00:05:31.477\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So yes, so the A sound of the I-E, yes,\n\n104\n00:05:31.477 --> 00:05:34.240\nour wonderful English language.\n\n105\n00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.558\nIt's wonderful, but\nit's really complicated.\n\n106\n00:05:35.558 --> 00:05:37.310\n&gt;&gt; That's what happens when you\ntake a bunch of languages and\n\n107\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.034\nyou throw them in a pot.\n\n108\n00:05:38.034 --> 00:05:40.333\nAnd you stir it all up and\nyou go, here's English.\n\n109\n00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:42.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n\n110\n00:05:42.328 --> 00:05:49.488\nSo if I wanted to type in receive R-E-C-\n&gt;&gt; E-I-V-E.\n\n111\n00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:52.816\n&gt;&gt; And every time I spell it,\nI have to do it in my brain,\n\n112\n00:05:52.816 --> 00:05:55.553\nbecause I'm gonna do it wrong, receive.\n\n113\n00:05:55.553 --> 00:06:00.636\nAnd you see how it automatically\nswitched that I before E rule and\n\n114\n00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:04.420\ndid it for me, thank you very much, Word.\n\n115\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.068\nSome other things that it will do,\nif I type in the, the.\n\n116\n00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:15.056\nOkay, so H-T-E, hit the spacebar,\nit changes that.\n\n117\n00:06:15.056 --> 00:06:19.190\nWith contractions,\nlike I can't do something, do you see?\n\n118\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.172\nWell, it didn't do that one.\n\n119\n00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:20.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK],\n\n120\n00:06:20.921 --> 00:06:23.652\nnot using the apostrophe has become so\nprevalent,\n\n121\n00:06:23.652 --> 00:06:25.695\nI think that they've allowed it now.\n\n122\n00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:29.342\nI think it's almost become a part\nof the English language anymore.\n\n123\n00:06:29.342 --> 00:06:31.133\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,I t's kind of one of those,\n\n124\n00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:34.197\nI'm sure people who teach\nEnglish are just like, no!\n\n125\n00:06:34.197 --> 00:06:37.427\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ngrammar Nazis are going crazy right now.\n\n126\n00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:39.099\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's not like-\n&gt;&gt; And that would be me, by the way.\n\n127\n00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have certain ones that bother me.\n\n128\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.093\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, though we all do.\n\n129\n00:06:43.093 --> 00:06:46.826\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I remember about\nthe one rule when I was growing up,\n\n130\n00:06:46.826 --> 00:06:49.253\nthe more better you know-\n&gt;&gt; The more better?\n\n131\n00:06:49.253 --> 00:06:52.163\n&gt;&gt; The double negative, right, I can't\neven remember the proper terminology.\n\n132\n00:06:52.163 --> 00:06:57.671\nAnd I was like, that's the easiest English\nrule ever, I always got that one correct.\n\n133\n00:06:57.671 --> 00:07:01.015\nAnd now the older I get,\nI say it more and more.\n\n134\n00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:03.271\nAnd I'm just like,\nmore clearer, I'm like no,\n\n135\n00:07:03.271 --> 00:07:05.001\nthat's not how you're supposed to-\n\n136\n00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:05.929\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More clearly.\n\n137\n00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:08.488\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's just one of those things\n\n138\n00:07:08.488 --> 00:07:12.243\nwhere I'm kind of regressingI\nn some of those things, but-\n\n139\n00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:12.915\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a refresher.\n\n140\n00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:15.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'd probably fail.\n\n141\n00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.775\nSo if we have doesn't right here, and I\nactually typed it without that apostrophe,\n\n142\n00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.707\nit automatically did it for me.\n\n143\n00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:27.179\nWhy it did not do can't,\nI can't tell you, honestly.\n\n144\n00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:29.137\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But maybe I might have,\n\n145\n00:07:29.137 --> 00:07:31.584\nin another show,\nadded it to the dictionary or-\n\n146\n00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:33.974\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that's just,\n\n147\n00:07:33.974 --> 00:07:37.435\nAutoCorrect is not\ncorrecting that anymore.\n\n148\n00:07:37.435 --> 00:07:38.303\n&gt;&gt; You know what, you might be right.\n\n149\n00:07:38.303 --> 00:07:41.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go with that one.\n\n150\n00:07:41.435 --> 00:07:44.324\nBut I did hit the Enter and\nI typed it again, and\n\n151\n00:07:44.324 --> 00:07:46.560\nit did automatically capitalize.\n\n152\n00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.194\nSo all these different words that\nit's going to do for us, and\n\n153\n00:07:51.194 --> 00:07:55.751\nhelp us along, with trying to\ncorrect our typing as we type.\n\n154\n00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:58.349\nSome of these can be really, really handy.\n\n155\n00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:03.543\nFor the word can,\ncuz the one I always like to do for\n\n156\n00:08:03.543 --> 00:08:07.399\ndemonstrations Can I do the dishes?\n\n157\n00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:11.083\nSo I would type in cna and\nthen hit the spacebar, and\n\n158\n00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:16.927\nit automatically switches to can, so\ncan I, automatically capitalizes the I.\n\n159\n00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:21.488\nDo, which is whatever,\nthe, hte, space, and\n\n160\n00:08:21.488 --> 00:08:26.379\nthen dishes, d, i, I have to,\nokay, H S E S there,\n\n161\n00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:29.630\nsee it switched all of that for me.\n\n162\n00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.998\nAll of these autocorrect options, and\n\n163\n00:08:30.998 --> 00:08:33.496\nthat's the sentence that I used to\nproperly I think, demonstrate on.\n\n164\n00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:38.260\n&gt;&gt; You know what it is?\n\n165\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.510\nCant is an actual word, right,\nit's like, to cant or tilt,\n\n166\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.530\nthat's the problem, so it's saying,\nwell this is a real word.\n\n167\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.000\nAnd which would be an issue without\nautocorrect, it's like, well,\n\n168\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.630\nyou didn't misspell anything so\nit doesn't know, that's the problem.\n\n169\n00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm so glad that you looked that\nup for us and now we all know [LAUGH].\n\n170\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.162\n&gt;&gt; It came to me, I wasn't able to\nfind anything about autocorrect,\n\n171\n00:09:01.162 --> 00:09:03.924\nwhich is like, yes,\ncant is a word [LAUGH].\n\n172\n00:09:03.924 --> 00:09:07.983\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I do know it used to do it at one\npoint, but I guess I'm sure it's like,\n\n173\n00:09:07.983 --> 00:09:09.130\nyep, no it is.\n\n174\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:14.660\nAnd this actually goes perfectly, that\nwas a wonderful segue into what I wanted\n\n175\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.220\nto tell you next is that sometimes there\nare words that I'm typing incorrectly.\n\n176\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.760\nBut Word is switching it for me or\nnot switching it for me and it's like,\n\n177\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.130\nno stop doing that, like the word can.\n\n178\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:33.360\nWell Cna, Cna is also something that\nis used in the medical field for\n\n179\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.640\ncertified nursing assistance, I believe?\n\n180\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So this might be something that\n\n181\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.740\nyou use all the time in what you're typing\nand maybe you always capitalize it.\n\n182\n00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.617\nAnd it's like can you please stop doing\nit, HTE, maybe that's the letters of-\n\n183\n00:09:46.617 --> 00:09:48.449\n&gt;&gt; Of a phone, isn't that right, HTE,\n\n184\n00:09:48.449 --> 00:09:49.489\nI believe is a phone.\n\n185\n00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:50.377\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:50.377 --> 00:09:51.753\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll go with that too [LAUGH].\n\n187\n00:09:51.753 --> 00:09:55.413\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, it sounds vaguely familiar,\n\n188\n00:09:55.413 --> 00:09:58.806\nso all these things that I\ndon't want you to do it, well,\n\n189\n00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:01.660\nwe can go out to our options and\ndo it right here.\n\n190\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.510\nBut while I'm typing, there is going\nto be something, and I'm gonna try and\n\n191\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.130\nsee if I can get it on the screen.\n\n192\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.280\nThere, do you see when I'm hovering,\n\n193\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.460\nI'm not clicking on it,\nI'm hovering over the word can.\n\n194\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.850\nAnd there's this tiny little blue thing\non the bottom left-hand corner that is\n\n195\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:23.780\nindicating that if I click it it's\ngoing to bring up a smart tag.\n\n196\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.471\nSee, I hovered over it and\nbrought up this little dropdown,\n\n197\n00:10:26.471 --> 00:10:29.870\nsmart tags, when these first came\nout it was of those features.\n\n198\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.980\nWhere I'm just like,\nyou are really annoying me,\n\n199\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.550\nyou're always getting in my way.\n\n200\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:40.700\nBut I quickly learned to appreciate them\nbecause it is making Word be smart for me.\n\n201\n00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.360\nAnd then giving me all the options for\n\n202\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.910\nit to maybe not be as\nsmart as I want it to be.\n\n203\n00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.308\nSo right here, look at the options\nI have for this particular word,\n\n204\n00:10:49.308 --> 00:10:52.560\ndo you want me to undo\nthe automatic corrections?\n\n205\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.310\nAll of them or look,\nyou may stop capitalizing or\n\n206\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.970\ndo you want me to stop correcting?\n\n207\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.753\nBecause there was two things it did there,\nso\n\n208\n00:11:01.753 --> 00:11:05.060\nyou could control which one\nyou want it to stop doing.\n\n209\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:10.910\nAnd if you say, hey, just stop correcting\nCna, it will go ahead and stop doing that.\n\n210\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.495\n&gt;&gt; Now does that learn that permanently or\nis it just that one instance?\n\n211\n00:11:13.495 --> 00:11:17.793\n&gt;&gt; It's for this particular document,\nbecause if I did this again you could\n\n212\n00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:20.645\nsee that it's still gonna stay with it for\nhere.\n\n213\n00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:26.071\nBut if I close Word and then start a new\ndocument, it's gonna reset itself.\n\n214\n00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:26.596\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n215\n00:11:26.596 --> 00:11:30.062\n&gt;&gt; But this is where when we\nget into our proofing episode,\n\n216\n00:11:30.062 --> 00:11:32.510\nyou could add this to your dictionary.\n\n217\n00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.690\nBecause now you can see that\nsaying Cna is spelled wrong,\n\n218\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.250\nit's giving me that, what is that color?\n\n219\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:38.875\n&gt;&gt; Red squiggly, yeah.\n\n220\n00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:42.171\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I'm looking right at it,\nit's like, that is red.\n\n221\n00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:42.904\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n222\n00:11:42.904 --> 00:11:45.818\nwe have a red squiggly there\nto let us know that but again,\n\n223\n00:11:45.818 --> 00:11:49.550\nthat's more into the proofing and\nstarting to add into our dictionary.\n\n224\n00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.320\nSo, you can tell it to always remember or\n\n225\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.580\njust this one instance for\nthis particular document.\n\n226\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.319\nSo all of these smart tags are gonna come\nup, even back over here, you can see\n\n227\n00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:06.152\nthat I typed this in a while ago and\nit's still remembering those smart tags.\n\n228\n00:12:06.152 --> 00:12:09.255\nNow if I save this and\nthen close it and came back,\n\n229\n00:12:09.255 --> 00:12:13.126\nit's most likely not going to\npop up those smart tags again.\n\n230\n00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:16.833\nBecause it's like, well,\nyou've already committed the changes and\n\n231\n00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:17.889\nyou've closed it.\n\n232\n00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:22.369\nSo I'm not going to keep these little\ntags that are gonna come up for\n\n233\n00:12:22.369 --> 00:12:25.809\nevery single thing that l\nautocorrected for you but\n\n234\n00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:30.310\nit's usually as we're going\nthat you want to change that.\n\n235\n00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.797\nSo, all of the smart tags,\ngreat to know what they do and\n\n236\n00:12:33.797 --> 00:12:36.480\nwhere to find them and\nhow to control them.\n\n237\n00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.369\nSome other things that these\nautocorrect features are going to do,\n\n238\n00:12:42.369 --> 00:12:47.435\nnow this is one of my faves, so if I\ngo ahead and say, I'm just gonna type.\n\n239\n00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:51.562\nAnd then I'm going to say, let's go,\nand I don't even know if this is where\n\n240\n00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:55.737\nyou would do it, endpoint, what I'm\ntrying to get to is a hyphen, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:55.737 --> 00:12:57.108\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay [LAUGH].\n\n242\n00:12:57.108 --> 00:13:02.140\n&gt;&gt; Hyphenated words or compound words\nthat we need to have that hyphen.\n\n243\n00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.916\nAnd sometimes I always have to go back and\nlike, do you hyphenate this word,\n\n244\n00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:06.750\nwhich one is it?\n\n245\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.516\nI can't remember an example right\noff the top of my head, and\n\n246\n00:13:09.516 --> 00:13:11.315\nI'm pretty sure that endpoint is not.\n\n247\n00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:12.330\n&gt;&gt; It's not hyphenated.\n\n248\n00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.870\n&gt;&gt; Not hyphenated, but\n\n249\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.900\nas soon as we're talking-\n&gt;&gt; Something tells me it's not hyphenated.\n\n250\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm almost a 100% sure, but then-\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm having a hard time\n\n251\n00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.628\nremembering, if I remember correctly,\nyou take two separate words.\n\n252\n00:13:25.628 --> 00:13:29.320\nIf you wanna put them together,\nyou need a hyphen to put them together,\n\n253\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.500\nI think it just falls under\nnon-traditionally used that way.\n\n254\n00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.640\nSo if I wanted to say pink toaster or\nI wanted to say pink toasters of the world\n\n255\n00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.486\nunite, pink toasters would\nbe a hyphenated term.\n\n256\n00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:46.562\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I believe so and this is where we\ngo to the good old oracle of the Internet.\n\n257\n00:13:46.562 --> 00:13:47.186\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [SOUND].\n\n258\n00:13:47.186 --> 00:13:51.454\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, tell me how\nto type and how to speak right.\n\n259\n00:13:51.454 --> 00:13:54.510\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I mean no [LAUGH].\n\n260\n00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:59.775\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, but when used within words\nthen it creates what we know as a hyphen,\n\n261\n00:13:59.775 --> 00:14:03.768\nbut a lot of times and\nthis is maybe like a stylistic thing.\n\n262\n00:14:03.768 --> 00:14:08.680\nIf like, endpoint and then I wanna I do\na space and then what we think is a hyphen\n\n263\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:14.120\nand then a space, that's where we\nstart getting into our dashes, okay.\n\n264\n00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.590\nAnd notice as soon as I hit Enter,\nlook what just happened to that,\n\n265\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.200\nI don't know if I can do it again.\n\n266\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.710\nWell if it will show you here,\nspace-hyphen-space and\n\n267\n00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:26.300\nthen I keep typing space-hyphen,\nthere, you see how it extended itself?\n\n268\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:32.181\nAll right, well, this is where you get\nto learn a little bit about topography,\n\n269\n00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:32.907\nin a sense.\n\n270\n00:14:32.907 --> 00:14:36.086\nAnd a little bit more of\nthe English language, as we,\n\n271\n00:14:36.086 --> 00:14:40.268\n[LAUGH] try to get through it together,\n[LAUGH] and tell you it properly.\n\n272\n00:14:40.268 --> 00:14:45.485\n&gt;&gt; The rule is, generally, hyphenate two\nor more words when they come before a noun\n\n273\n00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:50.338\nthey modify and act as a single idea,\nthis is called a compound adjective.\n\n274\n00:14:50.338 --> 00:14:51.498\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n275\n00:14:51.498 --> 00:14:53.842\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Oracle.\n\n276\n00:14:53.842 --> 00:14:57.154\nSo yes, it will take two words and\nput them together, but\n\n277\n00:14:57.154 --> 00:14:59.231\nwhen you're using it with a space.\n\n278\n00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:04.496\nYou did space-hyphen-space, we start\ngetting into what is known as a dash,\n\n279\n00:15:04.496 --> 00:15:08.330\nokay, now a dash is like\nseparating thoughts.\n\n280\n00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.560\nIt's where you say,\nI want this versus that, and\n\n281\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.520\nthis is where I pulled up a website and\nyou're talking about this.\n\n282\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.765\nNow you get into the wonderful world of,\nis it an n dash or is it an m dash?\n\n283\n00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:24.445\nOoh, now this is getting into\nsome of my dorky stuff of\n\n284\n00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:28.349\nin-depth typography, m, now an\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n285\n00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:30.080\nthis looks just like Stack Exchange,\nit is Stack Exchange.\n\n286\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.318\n&gt;&gt; It is Stack Exchange.\n\n287\n00:15:31.318 --> 00:15:33.678\n&gt;&gt; Do they just yell at each other\nbefore the actual answer comes out?\n\n288\n00:15:33.678 --> 00:15:35.994\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's\nthe English Stack Exchange, so\n\n289\n00:15:35.994 --> 00:15:38.005\nmaybe it's a little bit more proper.\n\n290\n00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:38.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n291\n00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:39.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n292\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.652\n&gt;&gt; It's very polite flame wars.\n\n293\n00:15:41.652 --> 00:15:46.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, [LAUGH] So an an E M\nis actually a unit of measurement,\n\n294\n00:15:46.574 --> 00:15:50.030\nand when you're talking\nin topography you have.\n\n295\n00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.212\nThere's all sorts of stuff in topography\nthough, like how it actually dissects\n\n296\n00:15:53.212 --> 00:15:56.490\nall of our words and has a lot of\nterminology that's associated with it.\n\n297\n00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.408\nBut think about all of our letters, M.\n\n298\n00:15:59.408 --> 00:16:05.500\nThe m is the widest letter in\nour language, in our alphabet.\n\n299\n00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.870\nAnd so, when they start measuring\nthings like kerning and tracking,\n\n300\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.290\nthe spaces between letters and\neverything, they're usually measured\n\n301\n00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.010\nin one-thousandths of an m,\nor in m's in general.\n\n302\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:21.400\nAnd so, an m is the widest part of\na letter that becomes a measurement.\n\n303\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.994\nIf you think about an en, an E-N\nwell an en is just one half of an so\n\n304\n00:16:25.994 --> 00:16:28.553\nthen that becomes a little smaller.\n\n305\n00:16:28.553 --> 00:16:32.430\nSo you have different lengths of dashes.\n\n306\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.280\nAnd whether you use\nan dash versus an en dash,\n\n307\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.720\nand this is where we start getting\ninto some of the stuff of.\n\n308\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.160\nNotice here like an dash is used for like\na comma, like it's separating thoughts.\n\n309\n00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.620\nOr phrases, or even just a word.\n\n310\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.510\nSo, the three r's, reading, writing,\nand arithmetic, those types of things.\n\n311\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.866\nIt separates like a comma, but\n\n312\n00:16:53.866 --> 00:16:59.678\nan en dash is what we might think of as\na hyphen, in the sense of how long it is.\n\n313\n00:16:59.678 --> 00:17:05.390\nIt's in the years of 1939 through 1945.\n\n314\n00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.930\nThat's kind of cool.\n\n315\n00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.395\nAnd then hyphens are used to join that\ncompound words that we talked about.\n\n316\n00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:13.705\nSo pro-America, cruelty free,\nthere you go like cage-free eggs.\n\n317\n00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:15.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those types of things that's\n\n318\n00:17:15.177 --> 00:17:16.075\na hyphenated word.\n\n319\n00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:16.814\n&gt;&gt; Cruelty-free eggs.\n\n320\n00:17:16.814 --> 00:17:18.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n321\n00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.309\n&gt;&gt; They don't put that on the package.\n\n322\n00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:23.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, right.\n\n323\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.793\nSo it's talking about that\nthese are different things and\n\n324\n00:17:25.793 --> 00:17:27.511\nwhen you're supposed to use them.\n\n325\n00:17:27.511 --> 00:17:32.201\nWell I've done an entire textbook layout\nout where the en dashes and the dashes,\n\n326\n00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:35.283\nit was a big deal cuz we want\nto be grammatically correct\n\n327\n00:17:35.283 --> 00:17:37.330\nin a textbook about anatomy.\n\n328\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:42.130\nSo I had to make sure I went back through\nall of those to, is it an dash or\n\n329\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.160\nis it an en dash?\n\n330\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.685\nAnd make sure that they're using properly\nbecause my other program in InDesign,\n\n331\n00:17:47.685 --> 00:17:49.464\nit was not making the dashes.\n\n332\n00:17:49.464 --> 00:17:52.670\nI was just seeing it as like a hyphen or\na dash.\n\n333\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.177\n&gt;&gt; Got ya.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n334\n00:17:53.177 --> 00:17:57.555\nlittle bit deeper than you might have\nwanted to know about the world of hyphens,\n\n335\n00:17:57.555 --> 00:17:58.894\ndashes, and en dashes.\n\n336\n00:17:58.894 --> 00:17:59.926\n&gt;&gt; We're better for it though.\n\n337\n00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:00.845\n&gt;&gt; And welcome to my world.\n\n338\n00:18:00.845 --> 00:18:04.257\n[LAUGH] But\nit's doing it automatically for\n\n339\n00:18:04.257 --> 00:18:07.910\nus when we did that space, hyphen, space.\n\n340\n00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:12.780\nAnd it made it into that dash, and\nnotice it's just automatically doing\n\n341\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.510\nit as a dash,\nnot a en dash because that's the length.\n\n342\n00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.950\nBut at least you know\nwhat is going on there.\n\n343\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.835\nSorry that's little hiccup I have\nthis random hiccups that come out of,\n\n344\n00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:24.556\nit's weird.\n\n345\n00:18:24.556 --> 00:18:26.470\nOkay, so [LAUGH].\n\n346\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.080\nLists, it will automatically\nstart doing lists,\n\n347\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.110\nwe're talking about this hyphen and\ndashes.\n\n348\n00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:35.680\nIf I started out by doing that hyphen\nspace, it's automatically gonna\n\n349\n00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.548\nstart making it like a dashed list,\n&gt;&gt; Right, a dashed list,\n\n350\n00:18:39.548 --> 00:18:44.540\nI was just gonna say bulleted list but\nbullets are different.\n\n351\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.127\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n&gt;&gt; They're similar, but different, right?\n\n352\n00:18:46.127 --> 00:18:49.300\nCuz of those little-\n&gt;&gt; It would be considered a bulleted list\n\n353\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.740\nis just what character is being\nrepresented for that unordered list.\n\n354\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.611\nWhen you start getting into HTML, you\nhave unordered lists and ordered lists,\n\n355\n00:18:58.611 --> 00:18:59.260\nOLs and ULs.\n\n356\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.026\nIf you think un-\n&gt;&gt; Ordered lists would be like 1, 2, 3,\n\n357\n00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:02.990\nand 4, or a, b, c, and\nd, that kind of thing?\n\n358\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.330\n&gt;&gt; And otherwise known as\nnumbered lists here in Word.\n\n359\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.619\nSo there you go.\n\n360\n00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:07.953\nSo now you've been\nlearning about HTML too.\n\n361\n00:19:07.953 --> 00:19:11.597\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I already knew what that was,\njust now I know the name of it.\n\n362\n00:19:11.597 --> 00:19:13.423\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I start typing and\n\n363\n00:19:13.423 --> 00:19:14.959\nI'm doing something wrong,\n\n364\n00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:18.160\nnotice that it's gonna keep\nstaying in that automatic list.\n\n365\n00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.940\nBut I don't necessarily want\nit to automatically indent and\n\n366\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.890\ndo the spaces between the bullet\ncharacter and the letters.\n\n367\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.831\nWell you could tell it to\nstop that if you wanted to.\n\n368\n00:19:27.831 --> 00:19:29.930\nAnd it's the same way, I just hit enter.\n\n369\n00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.445\nIf you hit enter twice,\nit takes you out of the listing and\n\n370\n00:19:33.445 --> 00:19:36.899\nputs you back out into what\nis known as the normal style.\n\n371\n00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:39.402\nWe'll have a whole episode\nabout styles later but\n\n372\n00:19:39.402 --> 00:19:41.077\njust know it goes out to the left.\n\n373\n00:19:41.077 --> 00:19:45.821\nIf I started typing 1, period, space,\nit's doing that automatic numbering for\n\n374\n00:19:45.821 --> 00:19:46.760\nme as well.\n\n375\n00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.310\nThat smart tag comes up.\n\n376\n00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.250\nDo you want me to stop doing this?\n\n377\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.210\nDo you want me to stop creating\nnumbered lists automatically?\n\n378\n00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.500\nDo you want to go in to\nthe whole auto format options,\n\n379\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.870\nthat dialog box that we got to before?\n\n380\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.152\nSo all of these options here.\n\n381\n00:20:01.152 --> 00:20:06.722\nWhat are some other things that it will\nautomatically change for us, ordinals.\n\n382\n00:20:06.722 --> 00:20:08.570\nDo you know what an ordinal is, Daniel?\n\n383\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.990\n&gt;&gt; Man, you've used this before and\nI should know this but\n\n384\n00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.830\nit's not coming to me so, expound.\n\n385\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.267\n&gt;&gt; Well first, let me tell you what it is.\n\n386\n00:20:16.267 --> 00:20:17.976\nAnd second, I'll-\n&gt;&gt; It's\n\n387\n00:20:17.976 --> 00:20:19.159\nkilling me that I can't remember this.\n\n388\n00:20:19.159 --> 00:20:20.846\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; First,\n\n389\n00:20:20.846 --> 00:20:23.020\nI will tell you that is an ordinal.\n\n390\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.518\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was so close, right there.\n\n391\n00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:31.477\n&gt;&gt; So, I typed in the number one and\nthen S-T,\n\n392\n00:20:31.477 --> 00:20:36.726\nit's automatically going to\nsuperscript the S and the T.\n\n393\n00:20:36.726 --> 00:20:41.622\nIf I did second, and in typography\nthis is known as an ordinal, first,\n\n394\n00:20:41.622 --> 00:20:43.840\nsecond, third, fourth.\n\n395\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.620\nThat super script that's going to happen.\n\n396\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.010\nSo, that does things automatically.\n\n397\n00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.840\nAnother thing that it auto\ncorrects is fractions.\n\n398\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.460\nSo if I did one-half,\n\n399\n00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.470\nnotice it actually changes it\ninto that if I did three-fourths.\n\n400\n00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.493\nOkay, I don't know if does like 78-100ths.\n\n401\n00:21:02.493 --> 00:21:04.309\nHow about we go ahead and\ntype that in right.\n\n402\n00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:06.757\nSee it's gonna do like common ones.\n\n403\n00:21:06.757 --> 00:21:08.981\nMaybe seven-eighths, nope.\n\n404\n00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:11.631\nOkay, so halves, quarters, maybe.\n\n405\n00:21:11.631 --> 00:21:16.162\n&gt;&gt; It looks like it's about the size\nof one character, like one maybe,\n\n406\n00:21:16.162 --> 00:21:18.020\nno larger than.\n\n407\n00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, because I'm looking at one\n\n408\n00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:25.250\nin first above it and one half is about\nthe same width as the one, in first.\n\n409\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.150\n&gt;&gt; You know what, I like that observation.\n\n410\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.829\nYou know what, we're gonna go with it.\n\n411\n00:21:29.829 --> 00:21:33.133\n[LAUGH] Even if it's wrong,\nwe're gonna go for it.\n\n412\n00:21:33.133 --> 00:21:35.260\nI don't think it's completely wrong.\n\n413\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.912\nI would say it's half right.\n\n414\n00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:38.883\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that, I like that.\n\n415\n00:21:38.883 --> 00:21:42.601\nI see what you did there, you, you.\n\n416\n00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:47.408\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so you can see that\nit will do these automatic features.\n\n417\n00:21:47.408 --> 00:21:51.484\nSometimes and sometimes not, but\nat least we know that it happens and\n\n418\n00:21:51.484 --> 00:21:53.500\nthat's what it does.\n\n419\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.160\nOther things, it will correct or\nautomatically stop\n\n420\n00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.330\ncapitalizing words if you're holding\ndown your shift for too long.\n\n421\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:06.284\nIf I typed in, hello again,\nyou see how, oops, hello.\n\n422\n00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:08.337\n[LAUGH] Forgot the O.\n\n423\n00:22:08.337 --> 00:22:10.353\n&gt;&gt; Whole different meaning\nwithout that O left off.\n\n424\n00:22:10.353 --> 00:22:13.906\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you keep on typing.\n\n425\n00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:18.150\nSo you can see that it automatically took\nof the capitalization of that second\n\n426\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.810\nletter, that E, because that was\nholding down that shift key.\n\n427\n00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.376\nI do this a lot and\nI'm glad that Word fixes it for me.\n\n428\n00:22:25.376 --> 00:22:31.210\nBut there might be certain words or\nwords that I don't want it to, like id's.\n\n429\n00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:34.560\nMaybe I don't want it\nto stop changing that,\n\n430\n00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.882\nand it didn't do it for right here either.\n\n431\n00:22:36.882 --> 00:22:42.010\nBut, [LAUGH] I know I actually had this\nin my list of exceptions of what to do.\n\n432\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:48.763\nSo if I did maybe ITProTV, ITPro,\nwell, it's doing that too.\n\n433\n00:22:51.234 --> 00:22:56.310\nOkay, so really wants to show\nme that I'm wrong right now.\n\n434\n00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.060\nWhat I'm getting at is that it will\nchange that two letter capitalization.\n\n435\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.660\nBut if you do need things that have to\nhave the first two letters capitalized,\n\n436\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.140\nyou can go into and add your exceptions.\n\n437\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.630\nI'll show you where that is.\n\n438\n00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.230\nWe'll go into our options.\n\n439\n00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.170\nWe'll go into the proofing.\n\n440\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:19.080\nAnd then into here notice it\nsays ignore words in upper case.\n\n441\n00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.352\nSo if I go into the auto\ncorrect options and\n\n442\n00:23:22.352 --> 00:23:27.354\nthen go into the auto-format\nas I type auto-corrections.\n\n443\n00:23:27.354 --> 00:23:27.909\nHere we go.\n\n444\n00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:31.290\nI was trying to find it\ncuz I knew it was in here.\n\n445\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.190\nSo we went into there,\n\n446\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.230\nwe're gonna do the auto-correct tab,\nit's right here, exceptions.\n\n447\n00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.230\nIn this correct to initial capitals and\n\n448\n00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.240\nthen I could add,\nthat's why I already had it added.\n\n449\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.764\nI thought I have removed this,\nhonestly, before we started.\n\n450\n00:23:45.764 --> 00:23:48.320\nThat was when I was, Lance.\n\n451\n00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.870\nI was Lance earlier and\nI removed it from Lance's computer but\n\n452\n00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.600\nnot Justin's computer.\n\n453\n00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.158\nBut you can see that this is a perfect\nexample of where you would want to not\n\n454\n00:23:58.158 --> 00:24:02.885\ncorrect that double capitalization\nthat automatically happens in here.\n\n455\n00:24:02.885 --> 00:24:07.080\nAnd so you can see it's already done for\nus and that's why it didn't let me do it.\n\n456\n00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.098\nSo I was having a little bit of\nan identity crisis, right there.\n\n457\n00:24:09.098 --> 00:24:10.185\n&gt;&gt; It's happens, it happens.\n\n458\n00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:14.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] and that is pretty\nmuch all of the different auto\n\n459\n00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:18.830\ncorrect options that I\nwanted to demonstrate.\n\n460\n00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.564\nAs you can see, there's a lot of them in\nthere, and it can be very, very helpful.\n\n461\n00:24:22.564 --> 00:24:27.139\nBut, you know, sometimes we just\ngotta say, hey chill, chill,\n\n462\n00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:29.060\nlet's back it on up.\n\n463\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.550\nAnd make sure you do it the way\nthat I want to do it and so\n\n464\n00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:32.590\nnow you know where to go.\n\n465\n00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.707\n&gt;&gt; Now we understand our well-meaning\nfriend a little bit better and hopefully,\n\n466\n00:24:36.707 --> 00:24:39.418\nwe can employ them in a better,\nmore effective way.\n\n467\n00:24:39.418 --> 00:24:41.602\n[LAUGH] Having said,\nVonne, thanks so much for\n\n468\n00:24:41.602 --> 00:24:44.410\nshowing us how to use\nautocorrect inside of Word 2016.\n\n469\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.260\nLike I said,\nnow you should have a better grasp of\n\n470\n00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.260\nunderstanding why it's doing\nthe things it's doing and\n\n471\n00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.180\nmaybe even changing the way that\nit's working to your benefit.\n\n472\n00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.500\nThat being said we are out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n473\n00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.950\nSigning off for OfficeProTv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n474\n00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:58.769\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n475\n00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:00.895\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n476\n00:25:00.895 -->

OfficeProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.823\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode.\n\n4\n00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:16.798\nWe are continuing on with more in\nour Word 2016 series and of course,\n\n5\n00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:18.767\njoining us in the studio yet again.\n\n6\n00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:22.562\nTo just lend herself to us, so that we can\nlearn from her, Ms Vonne Smith, Vonne,\n\n7\n00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:24.710\nglad to have you back,\nhow's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.970\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, it's always good to be back,\nand we're gonna talk about cut, copy,\n\n9\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.690\nand paste, yes, the basics of\neverything in computers, really.\n\n10\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.122\nAnd just learning how to do this, and\nreally just maybe a little bit more than,\n\n11\n00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:42.165\nhey, I know how to copy and paste,\nbut what about using within Word?\n\n12\n00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:47.797\nAnd all of the wonderful paste\noptions that it will give you so\n\n13\n00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:54.213\nwe're gonna get into smart tags and\nsee when we might want to have it.\n\n14\n00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:58.896\nNot copy it exactly where it came from,\nbecause I don't need all that\n\n15\n00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:03.600\nextra stuff and just strip it all out\nof there and get me just the text.\n\n16\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.550\nSo love those smart options,\nlet's get to it, I have a few files opened\n\n17\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.690\nup on my computer already just\nto let you know where I'm at.\n\n18\n00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.468\nI have a file called copy paste,\nthat is just a simple word document\n\n19\n00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:20.470\nwhich is a little bit because I\nwanted to kind of keep it small.\n\n20\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.275\nTo just go ahead and\ndemonstrate these concepts,\n\n21\n00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:26.298\nI have another file that's\ncalled formatted texts.\n\n22\n00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:30.116\nAnd this is where we're going\nto get into when we want to\n\n23\n00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:32.360\nretain the source formatting.\n\n24\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.816\nOr we want it to match the destination\nformatting when we start talking about\n\n25\n00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:38.148\nthose paste options.\n\n26\n00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:41.542\nI also have an Excel file opened up\nin here, very simple one with just\n\n27\n00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:44.965\na little bit of functionality,\nI don't wanna say functionality.\n\n28\n00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:49.115\nFormatting is the word I was looking for,\nthe other f, and so I wanna\n\n29\n00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:54.340\nbe able to go ahead and copy stuff out\nof an Excel document, get it into Word.\n\n30\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.560\nAnd I also have a couple of websites\nopened up here, I have our ITProTV\n\n31\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.310\nwebsite and I also have something\nknown from the Gutenberg Project.\n\n32\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.067\nAnd it is a specific book of the Treasure\nIsland and that way you can read, and\n\n33\n00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.740\nif you don't know about Project Gutenberg-\n&gt;&gt; It is very nice.\n\n34\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty cool, so check it\nout, go ahead and search for that and\n\n35\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.770\nyou can find books like Treasure Island or\nlike Alice in Wonderland.\n\n36\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.064\nWhich we've been using all the text from,\nso you can go ahead and\n\n37\n00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:28.346\nfind that yourself, so, let's jump back\ninto Word and start from the beginning.\n\n38\n00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:33.837\nCut, copy and paste, so what is\nthe difference between cut and copy?\n\n39\n00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:38.107\nWell, if you think about what you're\ndoing when you cut something out,\n\n40\n00:02:38.107 --> 00:02:41.887\nyou're cutting it out,\nyou're removing it from that space and\n\n41\n00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:42.551\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n42\n00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:44.215\nit's not gonna stay there\nif you cut it out [LAUGH].\n\n43\n00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:47.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's one of those,\n\n44\n00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:52.923\nI feel like I'm doing my circular\nreasoning again, cut means to cut.\n\n45\n00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.705\n&gt;&gt; Not always fallacious [LAUGH].\n\n46\n00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:57.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nit's just one of those,\n\n47\n00:02:57.075 --> 00:03:00.652\nhow do I even describe this more\nthan just in this situation?\n\n48\n00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:05.646\nWe are going to be taking information\nout of its current location and\n\n49\n00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:08.370\nthen pasting it into another place.\n\n50\n00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.710\nNow, I guess you don't always have to\npaste but if you're gonna cut something,\n\n51\n00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.650\nyou normally want to follow up with paste.\n\n52\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.250\nOtherwise, you're just deleting it,\n\n53\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.480\nso what's the difference between that and\ncopy?\n\n54\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.954\nCopy means to copy [LAUGH].\n\n55\n00:03:20.954 --> 00:03:25.025\n&gt;&gt; What's interesting is that with both\nof these things it is putting them into\n\n56\n00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:26.950\nthe clipboard, correct?\n\n57\n00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.798\nLike if I cut something it\nis saved to the clipboard,\n\n58\n00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:33.184\nit's removed from wherever it was but\nit is in the clipboard.\n\n59\n00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:38.820\nWhere if I do a copy it stays where it is\nand it's also in the clipboard, right?\n\n60\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do bring up the part of\nthe copying, wait no, the clipboard.\n\n61\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.171\n&gt;&gt; Clipboard.\n\n62\n00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:46.396\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] When we use the copy, yes,\ncuz there's this like magical behind\n\n63\n00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:47.471\nthe stage-\n&gt;&gt; The clipboard.\n\n64\n00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.345\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n65\n00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:49.096\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, remember Clippy?\n\n66\n00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:50.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes.\n\n67\n00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:52.326\n&gt;&gt; Totally unrelated, honestly [LAUGH].\n\n68\n00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:54.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It used to be a part of Word.\n\n69\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.601\n&gt;&gt; It did yes, he was this little paper\nclip guy that came up, and anybody who\n\n70\n00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:04.755\nused to use Office products way back\nin the day like, I remember Clippy.\n\n71\n00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:07.139\nThere's this, I think a whole website\ndedicated to the death of Clippy or\n\n72\n00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:07.840\nsomething, [LAUGH].\n\n73\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.793\n&gt;&gt; I think there is, yeah.\n\n74\n00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:16.510\n&gt;&gt; So check him out if you want a little\nbit of a Word and Office history.\n\n75\n00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.146\nBut, yes, the clipboard is a place\nthat it's really across your entire\n\n76\n00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:24.110\ncomputer necessarily, it's not just Word.\n\n77\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But since we're in Word,\n\n78\n00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.361\nwe're focusing on it because, of course,\nwhen we're copying like from a website and\n\n79\n00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:32.040\nputting it into Word,\nit's still going on to the clipboard.\n\n80\n00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.500\nAnd just think about a physical clipboard\nthat you put paper and you clip it\n\n81\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.200\non to it and it would hold it altogether,\nthen you can take it off when you want to.\n\n82\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.133\nAnd so it acts like that repository\nof all the different things that\n\n83\n00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:47.171\nit is copying and pasting.\n\n84\n00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:50.243\nAnd if you're like me,\nI do a lot of copy and pasting, and\n\n85\n00:04:50.243 --> 00:04:54.150\nI'll go to select something and\nthen come wherever I'm at and paste it.\n\n86\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.846\nAnd it's remembering the last\nthing that I copied cuz I\n\n87\n00:04:57.846 --> 00:05:02.679\nhad forgotten to actually copy,\nI selected it but forgot a step [LAUGH].\n\n88\n00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:08.378\nSo it's always remembering that last thing\nyou did, that last thing you cutted,\n\n89\n00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:13.510\ncutted wow, yep, I just said that,\nor copied from wherever you're at.\n\n90\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.966\n&gt;&gt; Editing Wikipedia right now,\nadding an entry [LAUGH].\n\n91\n00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:17.518\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cutted it.\n\n92\n00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:18.824\n&gt;&gt; Cutted it.\n\n93\n00:05:18.824 --> 00:05:24.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So if I wanted to\ncut this part right here out,\n\n94\n00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.310\nlet's actually take this paragraph.\n\n95\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.740\nSo I selected the information\nthat I wanted to get rid of or\n\n96\n00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.872\nin this sense, I needed to move it down.\n\n97\n00:05:31.872 --> 00:05:37.120\nI wanna take it out of this location and\nput it after this paragraph here,\n\n98\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.560\nso once it's selected, now how can I cut?\n\n99\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.369\nYou can either come up to the ribbon and\nclick the little scissors,\n\n100\n00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:48.942\nyou could also right here in that tool\ntip, you could do Control X, cuz X, why?\n\n101\n00:05:48.942 --> 00:05:53.980\nCause it looks like X, Y,\nthat was W H Y [LAUGH].\n\n102\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.140\n&gt;&gt; Not the letter Y.\n\n103\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I totally didn't mean to do that,\nthat was pretty funny, wasn't it?\n\n104\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.472\nOkay, so X looks like scissors or\nyou could also right-click, if you\n\n105\n00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:08.534\nare a right-clicker you could go ahead and\ntake this and cut it from that place.\n\n106\n00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:12.172\nSo we are gonna cut it out and\nwe are gonna take it and\n\n107\n00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:16.429\nnow it is in my clipboard,\nit's remembering what we did.\n\n108\n00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:21.083\nI am gonna come down here and hit Enter,\nPaste, you can right-click and\n\n109\n00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.160\nyou can hit the Paste button.\n\n110\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.970\nYou can hit the Paste up here or\nyou could do Control V, now why is it V?\n\n111\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.880\nWell, P is taken by print, I always tell\npeople it's like giving you Elmer's glue,\n\n112\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.190\nlike the glue that comes to a point.\n\n113\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I always tell people\n\n114\n00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:41.570\nof how to remember it,\nglue comes to a point and there you go.\n\n115\n00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.550\nSo, I will click the Paste button and\nit pasted this text,\n\n116\n00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.054\nmoving stuff around from\none location to another.\n\n117\n00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:52.544\nI'm going to point out that this\nlittle guy just popped up over here,\n\n118\n00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:53.878\nthis is our paste option.\n\n119\n00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:58.713\nThis is our smart tag that comes up\nanytime that we paste something into it,\n\n120\n00:06:58.713 --> 00:07:01.210\nit will bring up this little guy.\n\n121\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.296\nRight now, it doesn't mean anything for\n\n122\n00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:05.748\nus cuz it's just moving\ntext within a document.\n\n123\n00:07:05.748 --> 00:07:09.730\nIt looks all the same, so\nwe're good, if I wanted to copy,\n\n124\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.768\nlet's say I wanna take this here, and\ninstead of typing it all over again.\n\n125\n00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:18.879\nCuz I'm just gonna change it to chapter 2\nand one word or something like that, and\n\n126\n00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:22.580\nit's like, just get me started and\nI'll change what I need.\n\n127\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.370\nCopying, select it first,\nControl C is for copy, right-clicking, or\n\n128\n00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.550\nyou can click the Copy\nbutton up at the top.\n\n129\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.840\nSo now it's on that clipboard,\ncome down to where I want it to be,\n\n130\n00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.150\nI've clicked my cursor here.\n\n131\n00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.370\nI had already made some enter marks,\nremember that show/hide in here.\n\n132\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.110\nSo I had a couple of enter marks and\n\n133\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.160\nthat was why I was able to click\nunderneath that paragraph.\n\n134\n00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.034\nIf you were doing this and it's not\nworking, you gotta hit that enter,\n\n135\n00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:51.275\nso now I will do a Control V to paste and\nit brings it into there.\n\n136\n00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:55.832\nSo very basic stuff, select it,\nmake sure you select it,\n\n137\n00:07:55.832 --> 00:07:58.906\ndo your copy or cut, and then paste it.\n\n138\n00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:04.710\nMake sure your cursor is in the place\nwhere you want it to be pasted into.\n\n139\n00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.999\nBut now several of those options.\n\n140\n00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:11.939\nSo I have a specific format if you wanna\nsay here in this document to where it's\n\n141\n00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:14.648\na certain font, a certain color.\n\n142\n00:08:14.648 --> 00:08:18.300\nNow we've talked a lot about formatting or\ntexts in other episodes,\n\n143\n00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.470\nbut right now we're just talking\nabout it matching when we paste.\n\n144\n00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.819\nI'm going to switch over down in here to,\nwe'll come on, there we go,\n\n145\n00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:29.584\nwe come over to our\nformatted text document.\n\n146\n00:08:29.584 --> 00:08:32.607\nNot the same font,\nnot the same colors, but\n\n147\n00:08:32.607 --> 00:08:37.781\nI really need this information from\nthis document into my other document.\n\n148\n00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:39.800\nSo I'm gonna take from the bottom and\nwell,\n\n149\n00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.036\nit really does not matter if I go from\nthe bottom let's go from the top.\n\n150\n00:08:43.036 --> 00:08:48.255\nOkay, so I'm gonna say suddenly from\nthat paragraph down to fitted, and\n\n151\n00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:53.307\nI'm selecting not just the text but\nI'm also selecting this picture,\n\n152\n00:08:53.307 --> 00:08:58.293\nso this image has been inserted into\nhere and it has text wrap options.\n\n153\n00:08:58.293 --> 00:09:01.990\nThis is gonna be another example, but\nI don't really want the picture either.\n\n154\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.496\nLet's copy first, let's go with copy.\n\n155\n00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:10.270\nWe'll switch on over\nto our other document.\n\n156\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.762\nAnd we will get our cursor in to the place\nwhere we want it to be, and we will paste.\n\n157\n00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:18.095\nI'm gonna just straight\nup paste with Ctrl+V and\n\n158\n00:09:18.095 --> 00:09:21.030\nthen get into that paste\noptions from here.\n\n159\n00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:26.150\nIf you had right clicked before you\nlike actually hit the paste button,\n\n160\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.790\nall these same options are gonna come up.\n\n161\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.250\nSo they're in a couple different places.\n\n162\n00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.870\nSo you have your different options here,\nthis is keep source formatting.\n\n163\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.080\nIt's not doing the hover to discover right\nnow, so I'm just gonna tell you that this\n\n164\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.650\nis saying keep the formatting from\nthe source in which I copied it from.\n\n165\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.270\nThe next one is merge formatting,\nthere we go.\n\n166\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.050\nMerge formatting is saying, all right, I'm\ngonna take the formats that it has, and\n\n167\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.910\nI'm merging it into the document that\nis whatever formats is going on.\n\n168\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.430\nMaybe you have different styles and\nyou can see, that when I'm hovering,\n\n169\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.170\nit's actually showing me the previous\nof what that's gonna look like.\n\n170\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.090\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty sweet.\n\n171\n00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.231\n&gt;&gt; It is, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n172\n00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:06.527\n&gt;&gt; I use this a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot.\n\n173\n00:10:06.527 --> 00:10:09.800\nNow, this one over here\nis paste as a picture.\n\n174\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.662\nIf sometimes you're pasting things\nfrom a source that is just,\n\n175\n00:10:13.662 --> 00:10:18.233\nthe formatting is just so wonky that you\ncould try a lot to try to get it to where\n\n176\n00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:22.111\nit looks like but sometimes I just\nneed it to look like a picture.\n\n177\n00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:24.812\nNow, of course this is a picture,\nit's not text.\n\n178\n00:10:24.812 --> 00:10:30.450\n&gt;&gt; Even though we're seeing text, its\nnot actual text, it's a picture of text.\n\n179\n00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, and\nthis would be an image.\n\n180\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.340\nNow I could format it as an image,\nI could put like a border around it and\n\n181\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.240\nthings like that.\n\n182\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.790\nIf I was wanting to select that text,\nit's not, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.590\nIt is just pixels,\nit is not actual text anymore.\n\n184\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:49.078\nBut it would retain all of the visual\naspects of what you have selected,\n\n185\n00:10:49.078 --> 00:10:52.290\nso it could be an option\nfrom time to time.\n\n186\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.319\nAnd then over here, keep text only.\n\n187\n00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:59.279\nI used this one a lot because I'm copying\nfrom websites a lot of times, and\n\n188\n00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:04.410\nespecially with websites, is going to\nretain all of that HTML formatting.\n\n189\n00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.120\nSometimes it gets these weird tables and\n\n190\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.790\nthese weird character looking things,\nyou're like, I just want the text\n\n191\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.520\ncuz that's the most important thing\nof what I need into my document.\n\n192\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.460\nSo using this option is always a good one.\n\n193\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.470\nYou can see that it took away the picture\nin this example that I had copied\n\n194\n00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.040\nfrom there.\n\n195\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.210\nSo what do you wanna do with it?\n\n196\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.790\nHow do you want to look like into\nthe place where it's going to now live?\n\n197\n00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.410\nIt's up to you.\n\n198\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:32.140\nSo I'm gonna take this Keep Text Only\noption, and now I just have the text.\n\n199\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.130\nAnd there we go.\n\n200\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.580\nWonderful, few other examples now\nthat we have this information of\n\n201\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.320\nwe know what these paste options will do.\n\n202\n00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.968\nSometimes pasting from Excel, you don't\nneed to, when you paste over from Excel,\n\n203\n00:11:45.968 --> 00:11:51.180\nI select these, the cells that I want\nfirst, let's go ahead and copy it.\n\n204\n00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.340\nLet's switch back over to my Word\ndocument and I will then paste.\n\n205\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.035\nI'll right click first to show you\nthat when you have Excel files,\n\n206\n00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:03.570\nor Excel information,\nall those options are still there,\n\n207\n00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.260\nkeeping the source formatting where it's\nall blue and we have the banded columns.\n\n208\n00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.990\nMerge format, it doesn't have all\nthe blue and the different colors,\n\n209\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.920\nbut it is retaining it as a table,\nwhich is fine,\n\n210\n00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.290\nif you want the information\nto stay as a table in Word.\n\n211\n00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.690\nKeeping on coming over here, there's\nthis linking keep source formatting,\n\n212\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.490\nthis is creating link information\nto that source document.\n\n213\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.110\n&gt;&gt; So if you make a change in\nthe document, will it change here?\n\n214\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.290\nLike in Excel will it change it on\nthe Word document because it's linked?\n\n215\n00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n216\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.502\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; In theory,\n\n217\n00:12:36.502 --> 00:12:38.436\nthat's exactly what it's suppose to do and\n\n218\n00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:42.254\nwhen we get into collaborating when you\nstart getting into where you can, well,\n\n219\n00:12:42.254 --> 00:12:44.556\nI'm putting it in the collaboration\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n220\n00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:45.299\n&gt;&gt; Set.\n\n221\n00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:48.602\nIt's really more of my organization, you\ncan just find the episode that talks about\n\n222\n00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:50.380\nlinked information from other sources.\n\n223\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.259\nI don't really know what\nI'm titling it yet, but\n\n224\n00:12:52.259 --> 00:12:53.659\nit will be something to that effect.\n\n225\n00:12:53.659 --> 00:12:54.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where, yes,\n\n226\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:00.160\nif you place copied information\nfrom Excel into Word, and you\n\n227\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.970\nwant that information to be changed, you\nchange it in Excel and it changes in Word.\n\n228\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.540\nThen you would want to create a link and\n\n229\n00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.510\nhow you would then automatically or force\nthe updates to that it's pretty cool.\n\n230\n00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:18.149\nI would say it's a little, this\nwouldn't be in the essentials show, it\n\n231\n00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:24.448\nwould be more in the advanced or even the\nexpert level of Word in our Office ProTV.\n\n232\n00:13:24.448 --> 00:13:27.300\nAnd then the same with the other options\ndown where you can just go ahead and\n\n233\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.760\ndo the picture, or the text.\n\n234\n00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.070\nNotice with the text and I use that option\nhere, doesn't retain it as a table but\n\n235\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.380\nit does put in tabs.\n\n236\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.980\nWe know that they're tabs because I've got\nmy handy dandy show hide character marks\n\n237\n00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.580\nand then once it's in tabs,\nI could format the tab stops and\n\n238\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.590\nI could do all sorts of\nfun stuff with that.\n\n239\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.887\nCheck out that episode on formatting\ntab stops within this series as well.\n\n240\n00:13:49.887 --> 00:13:50.580\nI love tabs.\n\n241\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n242\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay so the other ones with the HTML,\nlet's switch out over into a website.\n\n243\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.570\nI think you've probably\ngetting the idea here.\n\n244\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.210\nThis is where doing some of your,\nlook, there you are Daniel.\n\n245\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.650\n&gt;&gt; There's me and Mikey.\n\n246\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we can move back over.\n\n247\n00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:08.458\nI wanted to get back over\nto this particular one.\n\n248\n00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:13.034\nAnd if I select this text here,\nbecause I'm making a brochure or\n\n249\n00:14:13.034 --> 00:14:16.384\nmaybe a little thing\nabout what is ITProTV.\n\n250\n00:14:16.384 --> 00:14:17.180\nThat's perfect.\n\n251\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.210\nSo I'll take that and I'll copy it.\n\n252\n00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.079\nI did a Ctrl+C there.\n\n253\n00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:25.290\nI switch back over to my document.\n\n254\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:30.580\nI'll hit Enter a couple times to\nget us down, and I will paste.\n\n255\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.370\nThen, it's thinking.\n\n256\n00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.227\nIt's thinking.\n\n257\n00:14:32.227 --> 00:14:34.417\nIt's thinking.\nIt's like, that is not what I copied.\n\n258\n00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:36.323\n&gt;&gt; Whoa.\nGoing crazy.\n\n259\n00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:43.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a good example of it is\nnot showing me what I thought I copied.\n\n260\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.380\nThis is where that,\nhow they're making that rotating banner.\n\n261\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.220\nLike what, HTML or JavaScript or\n\n262\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:54.370\nwhatever language they're using to\nactually display to us when we copy it.\n\n263\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:59.540\nIt doesn't see it as text because it might\nbe some dynamic content that we're not\n\n264\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.680\nseeing but using that show as text.\n\n265\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.180\nThere's the text.\n\n266\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.810\nLots of times,\nthe keep text options is really good.\n\n267\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.120\nPasting or copying from other sources and\nI wanna specifically talk about PDFs and\n\n268\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.000\nI might have mentioned this in some other\nepisodes, but this is where trying to get\n\n269\n00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.190\nthings out of a PDF and putting it into\nWord can sometimes be really problematic.\n\n270\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.495\nEspecially where you're thinking it just\nlooks straight like just as text, and\n\n271\n00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:33.040\nit's flowing as paragraphs,\nand it comes in, and its not,\n\n272\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.390\nand that can be really interesting.\n\n273\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.140\nIf you want,\nI'll show you a really cool trick\n\n274\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.030\nin the next episode watching in\nsuccession, the find or replace.\n\n275\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.160\nWatch our episode and I'll show you how\nyou can fix what I'm about to show you.\n\n276\n00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.000\nAnd I'm using the Gutenberg project.\n\n277\n00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.302\nBecause this, to me, this just looks like\nparagraphs that we would have that uses,\n\n278\n00:15:55.302 --> 00:15:58.897\njust like in Word, if I was over here,\nwe have Word Wrap.\n\n279\n00:15:58.897 --> 00:16:01.735\nWord Wrap is on by default, when we just\nstart typing it comes to the end of a line\n\n280\n00:16:01.735 --> 00:16:03.032\nand it goes ahead and wraps around.\n\n281\n00:16:03.032 --> 00:16:05.415\nAnd so this is one paragraph.\n\n282\n00:16:05.415 --> 00:16:08.238\nFlowing text all the way through that.\n\n283\n00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:10.420\nThe website looks just like that.\n\n284\n00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.950\nIt's not cuz if I go ahead and\nselect this text here I go ahead and\n\n285\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.720\ncopy and it a lot of times happens\nfrom pdf, well this is not a a pdf,\n\n286\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.840\nokay this is a website,\nlet me clarify that.\n\n287\n00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.320\nThis happens a lot of times when you copy\ntext out of a pdf especially if it was not\n\n288\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.750\ncreated from a Office\nproduct to begin with.\n\n289\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.950\nComing back over to Word, coming down to,\nwhoops, let's scroll back up little bit.\n\n290\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.380\nThere, here and we paste, same.\n\n291\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.640\nThese are the paragraph marks.\n\n292\n00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.794\nAnd it's using the same font and\neverything, so I'll go ahead and\n\n293\n00:16:45.794 --> 00:16:47.440\njust merge it so it looks the same.\n\n294\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.070\nEvery end of the line\nthere is a paragraph.\n\n295\n00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.900\nNow if you have a large amount of text.\n\n296\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.900\nIf you got a little bit you can just come\nhere and go to the end of the broken,\n\n297\n00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.600\nhit the backspace and\nhit the space then do the same thing.\n\n298\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.620\nOr if you have the delete key,\nyou could come in front of the paragraph,\n\n299\n00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.300\ndo the delete,\nhit the space bar and go ahead and\n\n300\n00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.525\nkinda make it do the word wrap\nlike you would want it to do.\n\n301\n00:17:09.525 --> 00:17:12.200\nOr what you thought it would do and\nthen we changed that.\n\n302\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.100\nBut if you have six or seven pages of\nthis that's not gonna be so much fun.\n\n303\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.295\n&gt;&gt; That cannot be fun.\n\n304\n00:17:16.295 --> 00:17:19.860\n&gt;&gt; No,no so we're going to use find and\n\n305\n00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.430\nreplace to say,\nany time you see a paragraph go ahead and\n\n306\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:28.160\nreplace it with a space and then you\ncan make it, your life a lot easier.\n\n307\n00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.840\nSo find and replace can be used for\n\n308\n00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.380\na lot more than just finding characters\nlike texts and replacing it with texts.\n\n309\n00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.070\nYou can use it for\nthese hidden characters,\n\n310\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.420\nthose special characters\nthat we have in Word.\n\n311\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.290\nAnd be able to do some really cool stuff.\n\n312\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.220\nBut I will tell you that\nexample in the next one.\n\n313\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.070\nGotta leave you with a cliff hanger.\n\n314\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.750\nGotta keep you coming back for more.\n\n315\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.610\nSo stay tuned and come back for more.\n\n316\n00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.900\nBut I am done with copy and paste for\nthe most part here in Word.\n\n317\n00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.730\nAs soon as I said that I said the most\npart because I said you know what,\n\n318\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.000\nI didn't forget one small little thing.\n\n319\n00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.070\n&gt;&gt; One little itty bitty thing.\n\n320\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.120\n&gt;&gt; One itty bitty little thing.\n\n321\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.700\nLet me show you.\n\n322\n00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.930\nLet's just jump back down into here.\n\n323\n00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.210\nAll these options, right,\nof why it's always going to retain\n\n324\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:13.060\nmy formatting to start with and\nwhy does it do all the things it does.\n\n325\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.080\nIf I didn't want it do, Daniel,\nwhere do you think we're gonna go to\n\n326\n00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.200\nchange our options for\nour pasting in Word options?\n\n327\n00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.905\n&gt;&gt; It's probably in the options area.\n\n328\n00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:25.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I saw your face\n\n329\n00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.110\ngot a little like\n&gt;&gt; I'll say.\n\n330\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.010\n&gt;&gt; She's asking me a question.\n\n331\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know\n\n332\n00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.728\nif I'm missing the bus on this.\n\n333\n00:18:30.728 --> 00:18:32.804\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:18:32.804 --> 00:18:35.268\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna guess in the options area.\n\n335\n00:18:35.268 --> 00:18:37.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, so I realized.\n\n336\n00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.702\nI'm like,\nlet me try to give him the answer there.\n\n337\n00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:40.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\n\n338\n00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.160\ncoming back over into our file options.\n\n339\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.045\n&gt;&gt; I just had General Akbar in\nmy head going, it's a trap!\n\n340\n00:18:46.045 --> 00:18:49.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, so\n\n341\n00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.160\nI was helping you out there, so sorry.\n\n342\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:57.420\nSo if I'm coming into the advanced section\nin my options, the cut, copy and paste.\n\n343\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.260\nSo you can see pasting\nwithin the same document.\n\n344\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.040\nSource formatting, between documents,\nsource formatting.\n\n345\n00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.570\nBetween documents and\nstyle definitions conflict.\n\n346\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:11.320\nYou might not now what a style is\njust yet, it says use destination.\n\n347\n00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.120\nBut you can see mostly it's all\nsource formatting for the most part.\n\n348\n00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.690\nBut you could, if you needed to,\nyou could change some of these.\n\n349\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.640\nI've even contemplated putting\nthis into always do text only.\n\n350\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.640\nBut there are many other times there's\nplenty of other times where I need to do\n\n351\n00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.790\nthat match destination.\n\n352\n00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.370\nLike that works perfectly, so\n\n353\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.360\nI don't have to worry about putting\nit in as text and reformatting it.\n\n354\n00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.100\nIt does a lot of it for me anyway.\n\n355\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.080\nSo just wanted to throw\nthat out to you and\n\n356\n00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:43.160\nthat the paste option buttons always, the\npaste button whoa, that always shows up.\n\n357\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:43.732\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n\n358\n00:19:43.732 --> 00:19:46.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Show paste options.\n\n359\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.605\n&gt;&gt; It's so funny, when we start talking\nabout grammar, our grammar gets horrible.\n\n360\n00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:50.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n361\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.695\nour ability to communicate through\nspeech just goes right out the window.\n\n362\n00:19:53.695 --> 00:19:54.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] l know, right?\n\n363\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.480\nSo read that sentence, and\nyou can check it on and off.\n\n364\n00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.170\n[LAUGH] So it's the little\nsmart tag that always comes up,\n\n365\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.390\nwe always do want that and\nthat is by default, okay.\n\n366\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.610\nSo now that I've shown you where\nthe options are, I am done.\n\n367\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.482\n&gt;&gt; You are done and seen.\n\n368\n00:20:09.482 --> 00:20:10.420\n&gt;&gt; And seen.\n\n369\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:10.948\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n370\n00:20:10.948 --> 00:20:13.207\nThere you go.\nWell, now we've seen the venerable cut,\n\n371\n00:20:13.207 --> 00:20:17.091\ncopy and paste, this is something that if\nyou've been around for any length of time\n\n372\n00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:21.103\nand computers have been and you've worked\nwith them, you've probably heard them.\n\n373\n00:20:21.103 --> 00:20:23.217\nYou've probably even used it but\n\n374\n00:20:23.217 --> 00:20:26.849\nyou might not have understood\nthe nuances of cut vs copy.\n\n375\n00:20:26.849 --> 00:20:29.191\nWhat's happening when you do that and\n\n376\n00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:34.590\nthen some of the issues that might arise\nfrom copying from one source to another.\n\n377\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.580\nCan definitely have it's\nown little set of quirks.\n\n378\n00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.540\nAnd now we know how to navigate that and\nmake it work for\n\n379\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.730\nus as we need it to in our environments.\n\n380\n00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.310\nThat being said,\nVon I think you did do a very good job\n\n381\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.500\nof showing us how we can do that.\n\n382\n00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.725\nLooking forward to what\nelse you have on the plate,\n\n383\n00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:52.510\nwhen it comes to this lovely Word 2016\nproduct that we're trying to use.\n\n384\n00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.045\n[LAUGH] That being said, I'm looking\nat our clock and we are out of time for\n\n385\n00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:55.695\nthis episode.\n\n386\n00:20:55.695 --> 00:20:57.825\nWe do appreciate your viewership, though.\n\n387\n00:20:57.825 --> 00:21:00.625\nSigning off for OfficeProTV I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n388\n00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:01.405\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Von Smith.\n\n389\n00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:03.374\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n390\n00:21:03.374 -->

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.656\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:16.610\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more in our Word 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.482\nJoining us yet again, the man,\nthe myth, the legend.\n\n7\n00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:22.977\nWell, the woman, the myth,\nthe legend, that is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:23.927\nVonne, welcome back how's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:28.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was like, I know I have\nthis identity crisis in these series.\n\n10\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.490\n&gt;&gt; You're Justin Timberlake half the time,\nso it was apropos.\n\n11\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.522\n&gt;&gt; You know,\nI will give that to you, so yes.\n\n12\n00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:40.766\nAs this woman will tell you that I have\nsometimes a hard time finding things.\n\n13\n00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.708\nAnd then I lose them and\nthen I need to replace them.\n\n14\n00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:48.329\nAnd we're not exactly talking about\nthat directly today we are gonna\n\n15\n00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.328\ntalk about find and replace.\n\n16\n00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:54.330\nTo where if I have a document that\nhas a bunch of things that say Alice,\n\n17\n00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.901\ntalking about identity crisis here right.\n\n18\n00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:58.401\n[LAUGH] And I, Alice.\n\n19\n00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.890\n&gt;&gt; We've got a real\ntheme going on [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We do.\n\n21\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.194\nAlice needs to be replaced with Jane.\n\n22\n00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:08.489\nThen I don't want to have to go through\n150 pages of my Word document and\n\n23\n00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.738\nsay, there's another one,\nthere's backspace and type in Jane.\n\n24\n00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:14.750\nBackspace, type in Jane.\n\n25\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.010\nWell we have the wonderful\nfind feature and\n\n26\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.070\nthen we can also replace\nit with something else.\n\n27\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.398\nI love this feature, use it a lot.\n\n28\n00:01:23.398 --> 00:01:26.551\nAnd as a cliffhanger from the copy and\npaste episode,\n\n29\n00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.542\nI'm going to show you how you can\nget rid of all those extra paragraph\n\n30\n00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:34.206\nmarks at the end of line when\ncopying something that has that.\n\n31\n00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:38.536\nSo, here you are,\nwhy don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n32\n00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:41.116\nI have a document called Find and replace.\n\n33\n00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:45.319\nAnd I've got a couple, some paragraphs\nin here, nothing too crazy so\n\n34\n00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.355\nkeep it small for our examples.\n\n35\n00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:48.555\nAnd like if I'd said,\n\n36\n00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:52.758\nwhat if I wanted to find everywhere\nwhere the word Alice is located.\n\n37\n00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:57.806\nOr what about if I wanted to find rabbit\nor book or any of those different things.\n\n38\n00:01:57.806 --> 00:02:02.282\nLet's just start with find by\nitself cuz maybe I do I have\n\n39\n00:02:02.282 --> 00:02:06.853\n150 pages in here or\na list of the board of directors and\n\n40\n00:02:06.853 --> 00:02:11.537\nI know I need to go ahead and\nedit the part that is about Bob.\n\n41\n00:02:11.537 --> 00:02:15.259\nAnd I don't remember what\npage Bob is located on.\n\n42\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.460\nWell, if I say find every instance of Bob,\nlet me navigate to where that is.\n\n43\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.920\nWell, that'll take me to it.\n\n44\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.758\nAnd it's going to bring\nup the Navigation pane.\n\n45\n00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:28.518\nBut how we get there is on the Home tab,\n\n46\n00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:31.981\nall the way over at the end,\nthere's the Find.\n\n47\n00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:35.942\nAnd there's a little drop down next to\nFind that shows me that I can do the Find,\n\n48\n00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:36.914\nthe Advance Find.\n\n49\n00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:40.498\nAnd that's also where we did that Go To\nwhen we were talking about navigating in\n\n50\n00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:41.818\na document, we saw it here.\n\n51\n00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:43.833\nLet's go with just this first one and\n\n52\n00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:48.420\nFind and brings up the Navigation pane\nlike I told you over here in the left.\n\n53\n00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.829\nAnd we're not looking for\nheadings or pages,\n\n54\n00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.064\ncuz that's other ways we can find things.\n\n55\n00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:57.670\nI'm navigating based on the results\nof what I'm looking for.\n\n56\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.430\nSo I'm gonna type in what I want to find.\n\n57\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.430\nSo I will type in Alice.\n\n58\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.233\nAnd notice as soon as I started typing,\nlet me do that a little bit slower,\n\n59\n00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:11.734\nso A-L, you see how it's\nhighlighting along the way.\n\n60\n00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:14.907\nIf I just type in the letter A,\nits gonna show me and\n\n61\n00:03:14.907 --> 00:03:19.079\nhighlight in my document every\nplace where there is the letter A.\n\n62\n00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.000\nAnd in the results, it says there're\ntoo many results to show here.\n\n63\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.176\nOkay, I understand let's keep on going.\n\n64\n00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:30.924\nSo we'll say A-L and now you can see some\nof the results that are coming down into\n\n65\n00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:35.033\nthis task pane, and listing all\nthe places where it's seeing A-L.\n\n66\n00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:40.461\nIt's not distinguishing between\nA-L in Alice or shall or\n\n67\n00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:46.788\nall or natural so it's just seeing\nthe letters as what you typed in.\n\n68\n00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:49.641\nSo if I keep on going let's type in Alice.\n\n69\n00:03:49.641 --> 00:03:50.660\nHere we are.\n\n70\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.139\nIt is showing me all the different places\nwhere Alice is located in this document.\n\n71\n00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.136\nAnd the cool thing is, is that these\nbecome navigation points to where,\n\n72\n00:03:58.136 --> 00:03:59.719\nthat's the one I wanted to.\n\n73\n00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.950\nAnd I like that it gives you like,\nthe text around it.\n\n74\n00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.749\nBecause if I was trying to find,\nin the example I said before about Bob and\n\n75\n00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.643\nthe board of directors,\nthat I wanted to get to his bio.\n\n76\n00:04:09.643 --> 00:04:14.499\nI could tell by the little blocks of text\naround the word of what place in that\n\n77\n00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.460\ndocument I need to go to.\n\n78\n00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.442\nSo if I click it,\n\n79\n00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:21.802\nyou see it actually jumps down to that\nplace within the document where this\n\n80\n00:04:21.802 --> 00:04:25.832\nparticular instance of Alice was\nbeing displayed in the document.\n\n81\n00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:29.465\nSo it's a really cool way to find and\nthen navigate and\n\n82\n00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:32.060\njump to the places that you want to go.\n\n83\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.158\nAnd that's just Find as Find,\nnothing else.\n\n84\n00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:37.238\n&gt;&gt; Pretty straightforward.\n\n85\n00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:39.844\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah exactly,\nso tell me where it is.\n\n86\n00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:43.197\nAnd now let's add on that replace.\n\n87\n00:04:43.197 --> 00:04:48.353\nAnd then we'll get into some of\nthe options that we want to get into,\n\n88\n00:04:48.353 --> 00:04:51.614\nwhen we are doing just\na more advance Find.\n\n89\n00:04:51.614 --> 00:04:54.052\nSo let's get to that dialog box too,\n\n90\n00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:57.678\nwe're gonna go into the Advance Find dot,\ndot, dot.\n\n91\n00:04:57.678 --> 00:05:00.642\nAnd then when you get to\nthis dialogue box, and\n\n92\n00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:05.060\nas you have those three tabs across\nthe top, the Find, the Replace.\n\n93\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.202\nAnd notice as soon as you click Replace,\n\n94\n00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:10.616\nit just adds like another field to\nthis area that l am looking at.\n\n95\n00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:14.140\nAnd on the Go To that we had covered\nbefore of jumping down in to different\n\n96\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.635\nplaces within our document.\n\n97\n00:05:15.635 --> 00:05:19.187\nSo, Find and Replace.\n\n98\n00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:22.783\nWe'll keep them both, we'll just keep\non the Replace, because if l don't put\n\n99\n00:05:22.783 --> 00:05:25.693\nanything in the Replace field\nthen it's not gonna do anything.\n\n100\n00:05:25.693 --> 00:05:29.140\nBut I wanna get into the More options,\nthe More button right here and\n\n101\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.020\nit gives you all of these things here.\n\n102\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.645\nIt is remembering Alice from when I typed\nit in over here in our navigation pane.\n\n103\n00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:39.500\nAnd the option that it has is Search Down.\n\n104\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.480\nSo it's gonna start from\nwherever my cursor is.\n\n105\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.267\nThat's another thing,\nif you're looking for\n\n106\n00:05:44.267 --> 00:05:47.406\nsomething from the beginning\nput your cursor there.\n\n107\n00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:50.514\nBecause if your cursor's in\nthe middle of the document,\n\n108\n00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:53.820\nit's gonna start from there and\nthen search down.\n\n109\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.620\nIt will give you a warning\nonce you go down to the end,\n\n110\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.380\nit'll say hey I've gotten\nto the end of the document.\n\n111\n00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.763\nYou want me to go back to beginning?\n\n112\n00:06:01.763 --> 00:06:06.077\nSo, it's not that it won't find\nthe stuff in the beginning.\n\n113\n00:06:06.077 --> 00:06:11.129\nIt just needs to kinda loop back, and\nthen go back down to were you started.\n\n114\n00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:17.180\nSo, that's why the option of\nSearch Down is showing right now.\n\n115\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.673\nI told you I was gonna stay on\nthe Replace tab, but you know what?\n\n116\n00:06:19.673 --> 00:06:20.853\nLet me go back here to Find for a second.\n\n117\n00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:22.077\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:23.572\n&gt;&gt; Because I wanted to show you\n\n119\n00:06:23.572 --> 00:06:24.940\nthe Reading Highlight.\n\n120\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.256\nWhen we had gone through\nthe Navigation pane results,\n\n121\n00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:30.719\nit was highlighting it automatically.\n\n122\n00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:35.257\nBut if I was using this dialog\nbox the Reading Highlight will do\n\n123\n00:06:35.257 --> 00:06:36.920\nexactly what it says.\n\n124\n00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.930\nIt will highlight within the document\nwhere those different parts are located.\n\n125\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.368\nSo if I did say, Alice, and\nI said let's highlight them all, and\n\n126\n00:06:45.368 --> 00:06:47.409\nI move this over a little bit.\n\n127\n00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.090\nAnd I'm just using my scroll wheel.\n\n128\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.500\nSo, my scroll wheel can stay with the\ndialogue box and move the document around,\n\n129\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.223\nwhich a lot of times it doesn't do that.\n\n130\n00:06:54.223 --> 00:06:57.856\nLike when you're in a dialogue box,\nyou're in there and\n\n131\n00:06:57.856 --> 00:07:02.867\nyou can't really get out of it, but\nin this particular command it will let me.\n\n132\n00:07:02.867 --> 00:07:06.980\nAnd it shows me all of the different\nthings that are for Alice.\n\n133\n00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:14.282\nIf I typed in the word rabbit, and\nI say find those and let's Highlight All.\n\n134\n00:07:14.282 --> 00:07:18.160\nAnd it will give me all of them,\nwell it's also seeing Alice.\n\n135\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.544\nSorry I forgot one little point.\n\n136\n00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:24.382\nWhat's the other option that's right\nhere in the Reading Highlight?\n\n137\n00:07:24.382 --> 00:07:25.008\n&gt;&gt; Clear Highlighting.\n\n138\n00:07:25.008 --> 00:07:26.559\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:28.700\nBecause I was like why, I forgot.\n\n140\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.892\nSee, I was seeing if you\nwere paying attention,\n\n141\n00:07:32.892 --> 00:07:35.224\nand turn this into a teachable moment.\n\n142\n00:07:35.224 --> 00:07:40.150\nSo we're going to clear all that\nhighlighting, and make that go away.\n\n143\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.499\nSo let's start that again.\n\n144\n00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:45.600\nLet's say, Find what and\nwe will Highlight All of them and\n\n145\n00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.208\nit is showing me all the places\nwhere I have rabbit.\n\n146\n00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:52.531\nNow this is an example that I\nwant to get into some of these\n\n147\n00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:54.239\ndifferent search options.\n\n148\n00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:59.185\nBecause you could see is highlighting\nthe word rabbit, lowercase, and\n\n149\n00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:02.266\nit also is highlighting\nthe word rabbit Upper\n\n150\n00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:05.768\ncase because I did not\ndesignate to match the case.\n\n151\n00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:11.416\nIf I turn on Match Case,\nlet's clear first and then highlight.\n\n152\n00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:15.250\nNow you can see that\nthe ones that are not better\n\n153\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.230\ncapitalized like the one in the chapter\ntitle, it's not bringing it up.\n\n154\n00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.990\nThis does make a difference when\nyou're going to get into that replace,\n\n155\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:29.030\nbecause if you're saying well, I only\nwant to replace the word rabbit only\n\n156\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:34.170\nif it's lower case, because RABBIT\nuppercase is a name or something.\n\n157\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.917\nCuz I wanna replace rabbit with bunny,\n\n158\n00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:41.588\nmatching case might be something\nthat you need to put up on to here.\n\n159\n00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:45.990\nSome of the other ones that are down\nhere in these search options.\n\n160\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:51.580\nIf I have the word let's go with\nAL that we had shown before.\n\n161\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.480\nAnd we went to highlight all of them, it\nis going to find like the work, actually\n\n162\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.050\nor maybe I was looking for the name a,\nlike Al, and I want it to be capitalized.\n\n163\n00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.590\nWell Al is gonna be part of a few words.\n\n164\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.620\nSo, telling it to find whole words only,\nI don't have any Als in here, so\n\n165\n00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.810\nthis might not be the best\nexample of showing yo.\n\n166\n00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.050\nBut just to kinda demonstrate that\nconcept of what does that mean for\n\n167\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.260\nwhole words only.\n\n168\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.950\nSo, these options that you want to do.\n\n169\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.090\nOur match prefix or suffix.\n\n170\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.180\nThat's where if you have like\nsomething that ends in LY.\n\n171\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:34.560\nYou know like actually and I wanted\nthe LY to be found I could do that.\n\n172\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.295\nOr the prefix, P-R-E.\n\n173\n00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:36.795\n&gt;&gt; Pre.\n&gt;&gt; Pre, yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:36.795 --> 00:09:40.230\nSo just match that prefix.\n\n175\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.702\nYou gotta understand that it\n\n176\n00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:43.903\nonly is looking for those letters.\nSo,\n\n177\n00:09:43.903 --> 00:09:48.989\nif you have words that might have\nthe word P-R-E to start with, but\n\n178\n00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:53.045\nit's not an actual prefix, it's the word.\nSo just\n\n179\n00:09:53.045 --> 00:09:56.455\nkeep that in mind that it's just really\nlooking for the beginning of a word or\n\n180\n00:09:56.455 --> 00:10:00.740\nthe ending of the word and whatever\nletters you are telling it to find.\n\n181\n00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.840\nIt's really smart but\nit's still a computer.\n\n182\n00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.370\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, which are sometimes a little\n\n183\n00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.630\nsmarter than us sometimes.\n\n184\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it doesn't have the ability\nto figure out the nuances and\n\n185\n00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.120\nwhat we are looking for.\n\n186\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.610\nWe had to be extremely specific in\nwhat we are trying to tell it and\n\n187\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.170\nwe also have to work within in\nits boundaries and capabilities.\n\n188\n00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I mean it's one of those things\nthat if you ever see websites where\n\n189\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.125\nthe CAPTCHA where you have to-\n&gt;&gt; I hate that thing.\n\n190\n00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know and I'm looking at and\nit's like you're wrong and\n\n191\n00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.510\nI'm like is that an eight?\n\n192\n00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.060\n&gt;&gt; I can't see what that says.\n\n193\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.076\nI'm so glad that they put the just click\nthe thing and it tells you what it says.\n\n194\n00:10:35.076 --> 00:10:37.163\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a life saver [LAUGH].\n\n195\n00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:41.105\n&gt;&gt; But that part of where like our\ncomputers are really smart but\n\n196\n00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:43.795\nthey still don't have\nthe brainpower that we have.\n\n197\n00:10:43.795 --> 00:10:44.465\n&gt;&gt; Not even close.\n\n198\n00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:47.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, but\nthen on some days I don't even have\n\n199\n00:10:47.535 --> 00:10:50.635\nthe right brain power, but- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wouldn't want to go up\n\n200\n00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:51.285\nagainst one.\n\n201\n00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:56.135\n&gt;&gt; Right, so all these different search\noptions of what you need to do and\n\n202\n00:10:56.135 --> 00:10:59.955\nthe reading highlights go ahead and\nshow you where they're are at.\n\n203\n00:10:59.955 --> 00:11:04.820\nBut let's move over to bringing\nthis on for replacing.\n\n204\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.080\nI want to replace Alice with Jane.\n\n205\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.810\n&gt;&gt; Pizza.\n&gt;&gt; Pizza.\n\n206\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.045\nYes, we could go with pizza.\n\n207\n00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:12.657\n[LAUGH] We could say pizza.\n\n208\n00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:14.205\n&gt;&gt; That would make,\nit's like a mad lib now.\n\n209\n00:11:14.205 --> 00:11:16.488\n[Laughter] Make it really fun.\n\n210\n00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:18.660\n&gt;&gt; Those are so great.\n\n211\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah love those.\n\n212\n00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:21.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah those were awesome so.\n\n213\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.630\nI hope some of y'all know\nwhat Mad Libs are I mean.\n\n214\n00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's true.\n\n215\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.840\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen them in forever.\n\n216\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.605\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's been a while, kids nowadays,\n\n217\n00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:29.455\nhopefully you still\nunderstand what a Mad Lib is.\n\n218\n00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.055\nIf you don't, look them up and buy them.\n\n219\n00:11:31.055 --> 00:11:32.065\nThey are tons of fun.\n\n220\n00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:34.785\nIf you're an adult, look them up and\nbuy them, they are tons of fun.\n\n221\n00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:36.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThere was one for\n\n222\n00:11:36.235 --> 00:11:39.355\nmy sister's baby shower that\nthey had a baby specific one.\n\n223\n00:11:39.355 --> 00:11:41.660\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n&gt;&gt; It was really cute, so.\n\n224\n00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.610\n&gt;&gt; But, I didn't get it for\nher, so [LAUGH]\n\n225\n00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.218\n&gt;&gt; She bought it.\n\n226\n00:11:45.218 --> 00:11:46.306\nShe just didn't get it for her sister.\n\n227\n00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.609\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, for\n\n228\n00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:51.590\nthe next friend that has a baby,\nI'm like that's gonna be my present.\n\n229\n00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.650\nSo, we have find what, and we're going to.\n\n230\n00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.510\nI have match case on this.\n\n231\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:02.490\nSo, we'll type in rabbit as lower case,\nand we will replace this with bunny.\n\n232\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.020\nWhere am I gonna go through my document?\n\n233\n00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.270\nI could do replace and find each one.\n\n234\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.020\nSo if I said find next,\nnotice in my document it's\n\n235\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.180\ngoing to the next instance that it found\ncause I didn't start at the beginning.\n\n236\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.290\nRemember I told you that?\n\n237\n00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.700\nIt's okay though cause it'll wrap around.\n\n238\n00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.520\nAnd I could say replace that one.\n\n239\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.070\nAnd it replace.\n\n240\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.780\nIt jump down to the next one.\n\n241\n00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.420\nIt's probably behind my head but\n\n242\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.190\nthe next instances there says the large\nrabbit hole says finding the next one.\n\n243\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.110\nSo, it's kind of like letting\nme choose each one because maybe\n\n244\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.980\nI don't want to just hit Replace All.\n\n245\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.290\nCuz there might be places where,\ntalking about how we can\n\n246\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:47.130\ndifferentiate what's going on\nin the context of our language.\n\n247\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:52.190\nThis is a nice feature, but let's say I\nknow without a shadow of a doubt that\n\n248\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.570\nI just need to replace them all.\n\n249\n00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.150\nI've done my match case I know\nthe uppercase won't be changed,so go ahead\n\n250\n00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.310\nand click it.\n\n251\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.086\nWe've made to replaces,\nthere's that warning.\n\n252\n00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:03.750\nDo you want to continue\nsearching from the beginning?\n\n253\n00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.950\nYes I do because I wasn't in\nthe right place to start with.\n\n254\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.100\nWell I'm all done.\n\n255\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.200\nI went ahead and\nmade my three replacements for you.\n\n256\n00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.390\nAnd then I will go ahead and\nsay thank you.\n\n257\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.030\nI'll close this just to demonstrate.\n\n258\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.230\nThere is bunny and\nthere's another bunny over here.\n\n259\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.173\nThat way everything that I wanted\nto find has now been replaced with\n\n260\n00:13:23.173 --> 00:13:27.763\nsomething else based on those\ndifferent search criteria that\n\n261\n00:13:27.763 --> 00:13:31.130\nI wanted it to Remember and\napply those to it.\n\n262\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.330\nBut you can use find and replace for\na couple of other things.\n\n263\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.980\nYou're probably wondering why do I\nhave all these random words in red\n\n264\n00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.608\nthroughout here and\nsome that are in black?\n\n265\n00:13:39.608 --> 00:13:42.400\nCuz you can replace formatting.\n\n266\n00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.910\nI can say hey, find every word\nthat is red and make it green or\n\n267\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:53.090\nevery word or every place that I have\na specific font and size and color.\n\n268\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.370\nYou can go through all those\nspecific formatting details and\n\n269\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.488\nthen replace it with something else.\n\n270\n00:13:58.488 --> 00:14:01.990\nCuz maybe there's a whole bunch of\nstuff throughout here that it's all\n\n271\n00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.030\nmarked up in red.\n\n272\n00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.740\n&gt;&gt; So, or like the chapter part, right?\n\n273\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.680\nMaybe you just type the document up really\nquickly into chapter, chapter, chapter and\n\n274\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.530\nit's all in the same text and then you\nchange one, copy that formatting and\n\n275\n00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.440\nthen make everybody where it needs to be.\n\n276\n00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthis is where if you were using\n\n277\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.430\nstyles-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n278\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.605\n&gt;&gt; Which I would highly suggest\nwatching that episode too,\n\n279\n00:14:21.605 --> 00:14:23.062\nthen you would just change the style.\n\n280\n00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.170\nBut along that same line.\n\n281\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.310\n&gt;&gt; It's, okay, so the formatting and\nstyles are different.\n\n282\n00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.752\n&gt;&gt; Correct, well, it's,\nI wanna say it's the same, but different.\n\n283\n00:14:29.752 --> 00:14:30.264\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:14:30.264 --> 00:14:31.404\n&gt;&gt; You're on the right track,\n\n285\n00:14:31.404 --> 00:14:32.024\nin a sense.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n286\n00:14:32.024 --> 00:14:34.214\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, this is an excellent example of\n\n287\n00:14:34.214 --> 00:14:37.880\nhey, all my headings are blue\nI wanna make them all blue.\n\n288\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.070\nBut of course, me in my mind of how I,\nsince I'm so into typesetting.\n\n289\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would have used the styles so\n\n290\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.940\nwe change the styles.\n\n291\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.360\nI mean we are not there yet.\n\n292\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.150\nSo let's keep going on that one.\n\n293\n00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.010\n&gt;&gt; They don't know that yet Vaughn.\n\n294\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.815\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, yes.\n\n295\n00:14:54.815 --> 00:14:57.206\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, perfect.\n\n296\n00:14:57.206 --> 00:15:02.380\n&gt;&gt; I wanna make all the red text into\nblack text or green or what have you.\n\n297\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.510\nGo back to our Advanced Find,\nbecause in our search options,\n\n298\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.780\nif it was on the More button, you'd have\nto make sure you see all the options.\n\n299\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.000\nYou have Find the Format.\n\n300\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.580\nI want to, let me go ahead close this out.\n\n301\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.120\nOr, take that out first and\n\n302\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.750\ntake that search off, cuz I don't\nwant to get myself kind of messed up.\n\n303\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.880\nSo I wanna find a specific font color.\n\n304\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.033\nAnd I know it's this particular\nred because I applied it.\n\n305\n00:15:27.033 --> 00:15:27.572\n&gt;&gt; You chose it.\n\n306\n00:15:27.572 --> 00:15:28.072\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n307\n00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:29.325\n&gt;&gt; And keeping it simple but\n\n308\n00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:33.383\nyou can see all the different options that\nyou could have with what formatting am I\n\n309\n00:15:33.383 --> 00:15:34.780\nlooking for.\n\n310\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.350\nI wanna find the font color red.\n\n311\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.080\nI want to replace it.\n\n312\n00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.710\nAnd I actually could replaced\nit with the word bunny,\n\n313\n00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.090\nbut I'm not going to\nactually change that word.\n\n314\n00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.774\nI'm going to make sure.\n\n315\n00:15:44.774 --> 00:15:49.557\nAnd this is the other part, when you're\ndoing the Find and Replace within this\n\n316\n00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:53.848\ntab, make sure your cursor is in the Find,\nor sorry, Replace field.\n\n317\n00:15:53.848 --> 00:15:55.611\nIf you wanna make sure\nyou're finding something,\n\n318\n00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:56.882\nmake sure you're in the Find field.\n\n319\n00:15:56.882 --> 00:15:59.510\nI've done that a couple\ntimes where I'm in the Find.\n\n320\n00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.450\nBut I'm really supposed\nto be in the Replace.\n\n321\n00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.672\n&gt;&gt; You get everything backwards and you're\nlike, what has happened to my document?\n\n322\n00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.079\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I was going too fast.\n\n323\n00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:06.782\n&gt;&gt; And then Ctrl+Z.\n\n324\n00:16:06.782 --> 00:16:08.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n325\n00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.430\nCancel, let's start over.\n\n326\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.235\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n327\n00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, and let's go to Format.\n\n328\n00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.980\nWe'll find Font and we will change this\ncolor to, well, let's go with green.\n\n329\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.530\nAnd click OK.\n\n330\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.920\nAnd then I could find the next,\nnotice it is, yup,\n\n331\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.860\nyou could see that, you can see that it's\nshowing the next one and I could replace.\n\n332\n00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.180\nAnd then it's gonna find the next\ntime that it has red text.\n\n333\n00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.090\nI know that, I want all of them so\nI will click the replace all.\n\n334\n00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:38.250\nIt's done its two replacements and\nnow everywhere where it was red it is now.\n\n335\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.380\nIt says Accent 6 because\nthat's what they've named it,\n\n336\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.890\nbecause it's really part of the theme.\n\n337\n00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.640\nWe'll talk about themes later, too.\n\n338\n00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.160\nBut for the night now, it's green.\n\n339\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.340\nCool.\n\n340\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.920\nNow, those special characters\nthat I wanted to show you.\n\n341\n00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.160\nI have a document over here.\n\n342\n00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.310\nLet's go with this one.\n\n343\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.629\nNope, that is the same document.\n\n344\n00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:01.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How about we go with this one?\n\n345\n00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.480\nBig thing for me,\nwhen I get text from people, sometimes,\n\n346\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.400\nI mean, this was more on the back in\nthe day than maybe more in the present.\n\n347\n00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.890\nA lot of people would send\nme their text documents and\n\n348\n00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.870\nI would be using that to create the flyer\nor the brochure or the book that\n\n349\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.370\nI was laying out for them because I do a\nlot of freelance design work, on the side.\n\n350\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:31.190\nI would get a lot of texts with this,\nEnter, Enter, Enter, Enter.\n\n351\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.270\nThis is me the curse of the double Enter.\n\n352\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:39.893\nFor somebody like me that uses styles and\nI use paragraph spacing, anytime that I\n\n353\n00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:45.372\nhave a paragraph I have a specific amount\nof space after each change in paragraph.\n\n354\n00:17:45.372 --> 00:17:47.539\nWell if I have double enters in here and\n\n355\n00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:51.942\nI have 60 pages in here that I'm going\nto format into my in design document,\n\n356\n00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:55.906\nI have to come in through here and\ntake out every single double Enter.\n\n357\n00:17:55.906 --> 00:18:00.413\nBecause of the old formatting in Word,\nwhere it wouldn't make space after\n\n358\n00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.362\nautomatically until they hit do Enter,\nEnter.\n\n359\n00:18:03.362 --> 00:18:07.531\nOoh, [LAUGH] don't worry,\nit's okay if people are like, I did that.\n\n360\n00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:11.340\n[LAUGH] I know, it's all right, I totally-\n&gt;&gt; It's a common practice.\n\n361\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I totally get it.\n\n362\n00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.640\nBut for me, I would need to get rid of it.\n\n363\n00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.270\nSo instead of finding a word or\nfinding a font,\n\n364\n00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:24.500\nI could say find every instance\nwhere you see Enter, Enter,\n\n365\n00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.260\nthere's nonprinting characters and\nthen replace it with a single Enter.\n\n366\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.760\nOoh, let's see that.\n\n367\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.760\nLet's go to our Advanced Find.\n\n368\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.300\nAnd I've come over to replace.\n\n369\n00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.360\nBefore we get into this,\nI wanna make sure you understand.\n\n370\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.000\nKind of like when I was doing the find and\nI forgot to tell you to clear\n\n371\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.360\nthe highlighting and it was showing Alice\nand rabbit and I'm like, forgot that part.\n\n372\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.610\nThe same will go from here of where\nI was using the replace before and\n\n373\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.200\nit's remembering the font colors\ncuz I'm not using characters.\n\n374\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.460\nYou gotta clear that out.\n\n375\n00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.710\nYou gotta say, hey,\nI'm done with the whole formatting thing,\n\n376\n00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.620\nI need to go back to finding words or\ncharacters.\n\n377\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.040\nSo the no formatting button down\nat the bottom, that's important.\n\n378\n00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.390\nWe click no formatting,\nit gets rid of that.\n\n379\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.340\nRemember what I said before though,\nit only did the find.\n\n380\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.440\nBecause my cursor needs\nto be in the Replace too.\n\n381\n00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.520\nSo get into the Replace field and\n\n382\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.300\ntake out that formatting to clear out that\nspecial stuff that I was looking for.\n\n383\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.090\nSo back in the cursor in the Find,\nI'm not finding formats,\n\n384\n00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:35.220\nI'm not finding words,\nI'm finding special characters.\n\n385\n00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.480\nAnd here's a list of the different\nspecial characters that I need to do.\n\n386\n00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.430\nWe're doing a paragraph mark,\nnot a paragraph character.\n\n387\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:50.810\nThis would be like it's a printed symbol\nof a character not an actual enter mark.\n\n388\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.020\nAnd when I choose that,\nnotice it does this like carrot P.\n\n389\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.390\nLike a little, well that's a carrot.\n\n390\n00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.110\nCarrot P.\n\n391\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.910\nAnd that's what I wanted to find but\nwait, you know what I wanted to find?\n\n392\n00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.350\nI wanted to find two of them.\n\n393\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:06.950\nSo typing in again or\ntyping in paragraphs,\n\n394\n00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.240\nI have Enter, Enter, find that,\n\n395\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:16.810\nreplace with a single Enter,\nI only want one paragraph.\n\n396\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:21.890\nThis could also be maybe where you\nwanted to find every place for\n\n397\n00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.000\nany time you had a paragraph,\nyou wanted to put a space.\n\n398\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.480\nInstead of using like\nthe special character,\n\n399\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.340\nyou could hit the actual\nSpace bar like the space.\n\n400\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.450\nEven though you don't see it,\nyou're typing that in.\n\n401\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:38.880\nSo it does that, so just remember that\nwhen you're trying to think about,\n\n402\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.710\nif I could just take everything of\nthis and then replace it with a space,\n\n403\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.780\njust type in the Space bar.\n\n404\n00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.760\nSo what are we gonna do here,\nthere we go I've got my search criteria.\n\n405\n00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.110\nI'm going to replace all.\n\n406\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.530\nIt says we've done six replacements,\nthank you very much.\n\n407\n00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.510\nAnd to me, this would make my life so\nmuch easier.\n\n408\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:02.246\nCuz now I can take it, I can do all my own\nformattings that I'm going to do in my\n\n409\n00:21:02.246 --> 00:21:05.948\nprogram and I don't have to\nworry about the double Enters.\n\n410\n00:21:05.948 --> 00:21:07.868\nYay me, well.\n\n411\n00:21:07.868 --> 00:21:08.987\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\n\n412\n00:21:08.987 --> 00:21:10.530\n[LAUGH] yay word, so\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n413\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.736\n&gt;&gt; And then the other one,\nthis is where, same idea, but\n\n414\n00:21:13.736 --> 00:21:16.190\nI wanted to just take it one step further.\n\n415\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:21.016\nBecause a lot of times when you copy text\nout of a PDF or maybe somewhere else where\n\n416\n00:21:21.016 --> 00:21:25.051\nyou're doing those hard returns\nwhen you really wanna word wrap,\n\n417\n00:21:25.051 --> 00:21:27.810\nyou really want a space between he and\ncried.\n\n418\n00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.695\nAnd I'm sorry [LAUGH] so\nsad, [LAUGH] don't cry.\n\n419\n00:21:31.695 --> 00:21:36.815\nBut I need to say if I did this say,\nchange all paragraphs to a space,\n\n420\n00:21:36.815 --> 00:21:40.040\nthen what happens when there is\nan actual change in paragraph?\n\n421\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.900\nThat wouldn't be very good.\n\n422\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.262\nSo, there's a little trick that you could\ndo that if you make another paragraph and\n\n423\n00:21:47.262 --> 00:21:49.899\nput like a character,\nlet's say, like a tilde.\n\n424\n00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:53.805\nI think when one of the examples or\na tutorial online it said replace\n\n425\n00:21:53.805 --> 00:21:57.524\nwith a tilde or you could put like\na slash or something in there.\n\n426\n00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:58.644\n&gt;&gt; A caret, nobody uses a caret.\n\n427\n00:21:58.644 --> 00:22:00.869\n&gt;&gt; You could put a caret,\nyou could totally use a caret.\n\n428\n00:22:00.869 --> 00:22:03.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, that way I know, here's one,\n\n429\n00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.940\nokay let me go ahead and hit Enter and\nthen put a tilde in there.\n\n430\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.110\nAnd I only have two just for this example.\n\n431\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.010\nAnd then what you can do and\nyou're gonna do it twice,\n\n432\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.727\nyou're gonna say,\nchange every paragraph to a space.\n\n433\n00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:23.930\nChange everything, then go back and\nsay change every tilde to\n\n434\n00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:28.830\na paragraph because this would\nbe changed as a space too.\n\n435\n00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.260\nSo it's a double find and replace.\n\n436\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.310\nSo let's move over to advance find.\n\n437\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.845\nLet's do that really quick.\n\n438\n00:22:35.845 --> 00:22:39.150\nWe're going to find everywhere\nwhere there is what,\n\n439\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.370\nI should have just kept that [LAUGH]\ncuz there's already one in there.\n\n440\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:48.000\nWe're going to replace it with a space,\nclicking the Space bar.\n\n441\n00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.690\nReplace all.\n\n442\n00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.130\nMade 41 replacements.\n\n443\n00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.957\nYey, got all of those in there,\nbut now when I go back in here and\n\n444\n00:22:55.957 --> 00:23:01.660\nsay go ahead and find, oops that's the\nwrong one how about we do advanced find.\n\n445\n00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:06.452\nReplace the tilde with a paragraph mark.\n\n446\n00:23:06.452 --> 00:23:08.736\nSorry I'm going a little fast but\nI'm getting excited.\n\n447\n00:23:08.736 --> 00:23:10.908\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We replace all there,\n\n448\n00:23:10.908 --> 00:23:13.161\nthere should be two replacements done.\n\n449\n00:23:13.161 --> 00:23:18.684\nAnd now you can see I have a Word\nwrapped flowing text document\n\n450\n00:23:18.684 --> 00:23:24.870\nwith the paragraphs where I need it\nto be and that is pretty awesome.\n\n451\n00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Jaw on the floor,\nI love this kind of stuff right,\n\n452\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.500\nbecause you're kind of like, you're\nfiguring how the system works and then how\n\n453\n00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.950\nto use the system to your advantage to\nmake it do the things you want to do.\n\n454\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.730\nBecause a lot of times, we're going to\nreceive or gonna get a document from\n\n455\n00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.150\nsomeone and the formatting is\nnot gonna be the way we need it.\n\n456\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.180\nWe need to change that formatting but\n\n457\n00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.800\nit could be a lot of work if\nwe try to do that manually.\n\n458\n00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.240\nLearning tricks like what\nVonne is showing us today\n\n459\n00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.960\nis gonna drastically reduce\nour time in doing that.\n\n460\n00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.158\nAnd make our job,\nmake us more efficient at our job.\n\n461\n00:23:54.158 --> 00:23:54.998\nThat was amazing stuff.\n\n462\n00:23:54.998 --> 00:23:55.662\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n463\n00:23:55.662 --> 00:23:57.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n464\n00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.800\n&gt;&gt; I like it too.\n\n465\n00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.180\n&gt;&gt; Anything else you wanna show us for\ntoday or\n\n466\n00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.560\nare we-\n&gt;&gt; Just think about all the different\n\n467\n00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.900\ncombinations that you can do.\n\n468\n00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.325\nLike, if you needed to take, hey, there's\nplaces where people have done a bunch of\n\n469\n00:24:07.325 --> 00:24:09.530\nspace, space, space, space, space.\n\n470\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.460\nAnd I want to replace it with tabs.\n\n471\n00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.140\nLike say hey, everywhere where there's\nfour spaces, replace it with a tab.\n\n472\n00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.390\nSo that could be a huge difference for\nif you wanted to use formatted tab stops.\n\n473\n00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.170\nCan't do it with spaces, but\nI could do it with tabs.\n\n474\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.300\nSo you can think about all\nthe different combinations and\n\n475\n00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.700\nways that you can use find and\nreplace to just make it a little,\n\n476\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.110\nsometimes you might have to\ngo through a couple trials.\n\n477\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyeah kinda work with it a little bit.\n\n478\n00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.040\nYeah and like that worked,\nmaybe just take a little bit and\n\n479\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.706\nnot do it to the whole document.\n\n480\n00:24:38.706 --> 00:24:41.680\nDo a File &gt; Save as, make sure you change\nit and don't change the other one,\n\n481\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.780\nthose kinds of things.\n\n482\n00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.371\n&gt;&gt; Get ready to hit undo a lot.\n\n483\n00:24:44.371 --> 00:24:45.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n484\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.714\njust think of all the different\ncombinations that you can do and\n\n485\n00:24:48.714 --> 00:24:51.900\njust have some fun with it and\nmake your life a lot easier.\n\n486\n00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nVonne, thanks so much for\n\n487\n00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200\njoining us today,\nit's been a great pleasure.\n\n488\n00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.330\nHopefully you guys have gotten a lot\nout of this episode, I know I sure did.\n\n489\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.570\nBut that being said, looks like\nwe've come to the end yet again.\n\n490\n00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.300\nDon't worry, we got more to come,\njoin us then, until then.\n\n491\n00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.820\nSigning off from Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n492\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.615\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n493\n00:25:07.615 --> 00:25:09.380\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n494\n00:25:09.380 -->

Hello, it's good [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You like how I get all dramatic there?\n\n9\n00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.450\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.986\n&gt;&gt; I was like, it's really quiet.\n\n11\n00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:26.740\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n12\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.590\n&gt;&gt; Let's bring it down.\n\n13\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.680\nAnd then try and move on.\n\n14\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well we're gonna bring it down to\n\n15\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.510\nproofing our document, and\nwe're going to be printing.\n\n16\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.825\nThe elusive print.\n\n17\n00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.020\n[LAUGH] The printers.\n\n18\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.982\n&gt;&gt; Listen, working in as a technician for\n\n20\n00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:45.656\n15 years or whatever it's been now,\nprinters are the bane of my existence.\n\n21\n00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:47.204\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n22\n00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:51.680\nthere is that wonderful scene in that\none movie that is [LAUGH] just amazing.\n\n23\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.410\n&gt;&gt; Immortalized forever on film, isn't it?\n\n24\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's how you fix a printer [LAUGH].\n\n25\n00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.780\n&gt;&gt; You take it out back [LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.180\nSo what we are going to talk about\nprinting while we have no printers\n\n27\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.110\nconnected, actually I am connected\nto our printer in the other room, so\n\n28\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.668\npeople might get some random\nwords about Alice in Wonderland.\n\n29\n00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:12.800\nWell we are gonna go over\njust some of the basics of\n\n30\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.520\nprinting in a print dialogue box and\nbe able to get familiar with it.\n\n31\n00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.600\nBut before we print a document, cuz\nusually printings like the last thing you\n\n32\n00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.428\nwant to do cuz you're finished,\nyou're ready to print the report out,\n\n33\n00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:28.668\nor you give it to your boss, or I have my\nnotes for my show that I've printed out.\n\n34\n00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:32.060\nBut before I print I proof my document.\n\n35\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.600\nI want to make sure that I've\nchecked all of my spelling mistakes,\n\n36\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.490\nI have the correct grammar.\n\n37\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.740\nI've actually read the document\nto see did I use the word from or\n\n38\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.750\ndid I use the word form.\n\n39\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.790\nBecause they are two very different words,\nbut\n\n40\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.130\nis never gonna be checked in the spell\ncheck, so you got to watch for that.\n\n41\n00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.869\n&gt;&gt; I noticed that I do all my\nbest proof texting after I've\n\n42\n00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.274\nsent the document [LAUGH].\n\n43\n00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:55.052\n&gt;&gt; Totally, yeah, and\n\n44\n00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:56.540\nwhen you've added the attachment-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n45\n00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.270\n&gt;&gt; And you've sent it to\neverybody in the company-\n\n46\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.130\n&gt;&gt; And then you're like, let me look at\n\n47\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.130\nthat real quick.\n\n48\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.986\nNo, what have I done?\n\n49\n00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:02.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n50\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.450\n&gt;&gt; So this is the cart\nbefore horse kind of thing.\n\n51\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.400\nWe need the proof before we send it,\nright.\n\n52\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.900\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nwhether you're printing or\n\n53\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.260\nsending an email, read it twice,\nread it three times, and\n\n54\n00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.770\nthen you'll still probably miss it and\n[LAUGH] you have somebody else read it.\n\n55\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n56\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.120\nwhy don't we get into Justin's computer,\nand we have a file called 'spelling and\n\n57\n00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.970\nproofing' and\nfirst of all what do we see here?\n\n58\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.930\nWe see all sorts of red squiggly's,\nred squiggly's indicate spelling mistakes.\n\n59\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.180\nThe blue double underlines,\nthat's indicating some type of grammar\n\n60\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.110\nproblem because your Word is\nchecking your spelling and\n\n61\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.680\ngrammar as you type and\nas we go through everything.\n\n62\n00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.210\nSo those are some of the things\nthat you will see visually.\n\n63\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.290\nThere's a couple more in here\nthat I found interesting, right?\n\n64\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.200\nNelt down.\n\n65\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.730\nIt's almost like a brown dotted line, and\n\n66\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.940\nthen over here there's\nanother brown dotted line.\n\n67\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.620\nAnd I actually had to step back for\n\n68\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.610\na second cuz I hadn't\nreally seen those before.\n\n69\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is brown dots.\n\n70\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.280\n&gt;&gt; And this is text that is copied from a\nbook that was written quite some time ago.\n\n71\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.280\nAnd of course our English language\nhas evolved and if we read some of\n\n72\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.270\nthose old text that go back, way,\nway back, it's kind of hard to\n\n73\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.620\nread because that's how people talked and\nhow they communicated that point.\n\n74\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.330\nSo I thought, maybe,\nthat's where this was coming from.\n\n75\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.200\nAnd then, I had to figure out,\nwell, what is that doing?\n\n76\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.470\nSo why don't I show you\nwhat Word is looking for\n\n77\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.430\nus as we go through our proofing.\n\n78\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.260\nSo we're going to go back into our\noptions, where we go to a lot.\n\n79\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.290\nSo we'll go to File.\n\n80\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.480\nWe'll go to Options.\n\n81\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.110\nAnd we're going to go into Proofing.\n\n82\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.340\nWe're not going to do the auto-correct\noptions and the uppercase,\n\n83\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.240\nwe're coming down here.\n\n84\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.440\nWhen correcting spelling and grammar in\nWord, we are checking for grammar and\n\n85\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.200\nspelling.\n\n86\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.780\nWe're also going to talk about\nwhat this readability and\n\n87\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.660\nstatistics thing is,\nI think it's pretty cool.\n\n88\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.980\nThe check grammar with spelling and\nthen the grammar options,\n\n89\n00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.740\nthe settings that it's finding\nwith the grammar and more.\n\n90\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.420\nSo let's go through the and more,\nI'm gonna scroll up to the beginning.\n\n91\n00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.090\nSo it's going to do things like the\ncapitalization, it's gonna do things like\n\n92\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.970\nsubject verb agreement, the hyphenation,\ncommonly confused phrases.\n\n93\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.026\n&gt;&gt; Can we look at a list of these things,\nthat would be awesome [LAUGH].\n\n94\n00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:29.742\nI'd spend time just running through that.\n\n95\n00:04:29.742 --> 00:04:32.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we keep on going down through here,\n\n96\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.380\nthis is where it has the jargon,\nwhat is it considered jargon?\n\n97\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Like slang terms?\n\n98\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, complex words.\n\n99\n00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.525\nWhat does it think is complex?\n\n100\n00:04:42.525 --> 00:04:44.060\nNow these are not checked on.\n\n101\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.670\nSo these are options that are off.\n\n102\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.240\nThe use of will and would and\ntoo many determiners.\n\n103\n00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.960\nI don't even know what that means.\n\n104\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.770\nWhat is a determiner?\n\n105\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.590\nSo, I'd probably to go up and look.\n\n106\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.140\nAnd again,\nI'm sure if you're an English teacher,\n\n107\n00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.595\nyou're probably cringing\na little bit with me.\n\n108\n00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:03.820\n[LAUGH] With both of us actually, right?\n\n109\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.562\n&gt;&gt;

Yes that's right.\n\n113\n00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.090\n&gt;&gt; So you can see and\nthe passive voice and\n\n114\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.680\nthen this is something that's gonna\ncome up in that readability statistic.\n\n115\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.430\nThis is something that I brought up\nbecause it's one of those where I\n\n116\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.370\nthought like you're talking in\na passive voice versus an active voice.\n\n117\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.750\nActive is I want to do this.\n\n118\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.270\n&gt;&gt;

Turn that on.\n\n128\n00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:46.594\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the Oxford comma is near and\n\n129\n00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:48.190\ndear to my heart.\n\n130\n00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.090\nI like it, and\nthere's all sorts of different things.\n\n131\n00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.670\nThe space between sentences.\n\n132\n00:05:53.695 --> 00:05:56.210\nSingle space or\ndouble space there, Daniel?\n\n133\n00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.700\n&gt;&gt;

It's like who wants\nto hit the space twice?\n\n137\n00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.070\nForget that noise.\n\n138\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.230\nI can still remember being taught, you do\nperiod, space, space, period space space.\n\n139\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.560\nAnd it comes back from the type writers.\n\n140\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.540\n&gt;&gt; I think it does read better,\nfloating when you're looking at the text.\n\n141\n00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.200\nIt does read a whole lot better with\ndouble spacing, but, hey, who's got time.\n\n142\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.890\n&gt;&gt; Well if you look this up, it's one of\nthose, it depends on who you talk to.\n\n143\n00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah schools of thought.\n\n144\n00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.897\n&gt;&gt; Yes there's another one syllabuses or\nsyllabi, right?\n\n145\n00:06:33.897 --> 00:06:35.846\n&gt;&gt; I would say syllabi is correct.\n\n146\n00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:38.460\n&gt;&gt; I would say syllabuses.\n\n147\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.730\n&gt;&gt; You don't say octopuses.\n\n148\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:48.430\n&gt;&gt; They use that in part of the rational\nbehind, that's not how you do it.\n\n149\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.770\nBut, it's like, they're both correct, it's\nnot that one's more right than the other.\n\n150\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.010\nIt's just who you talk to.\n\n151\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just common language.\n\n152\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.270\n&gt;&gt; And if you have somebody that says no\nits syllabuses, and somebody that says no,\n\n153\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.520\nit's syllabi, it's like World War III.\n\n154\n00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.360\n&gt;&gt; Is there like an actual grammar\nrule that says it must be this or\n\n155\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.220\nthis in case of such context?\n\n156\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.280\nThat would be whether someone\ncould actually say I am correct,\n\n157\n00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.010\nthere is a grammar rule that states\nyou must change the Ss to Is.\n\n158\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's one of those,\nI before E except after C-\n\n159\n00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.525\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's a rule.\n\n160\n00:07:21.525 --> 00:07:24.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There is a rule,\nthe neighboring way.\n\n161\n00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.490\nI don't know specifically what the syllabi\nand syllabuses but it was one of those,\n\n162\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.910\nsince I was working at university it was\nlike a common like no this how you use it.\n\n163\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.660\nBut then it's we're both right,\nit's just kind of a thing.\n\n164\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.120\nI digress, why did I start talking about\nsyllabuses, see I even said it that way,\n\n165\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.320\nis because the space between sentences.\n\n166\n00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.830\nSingle or double.\n\n167\n00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.260\nAs long as you use one correctly\nthat's what you should stick with.\n\n168\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.070\nAnd this was by somebody\nwho was publishing books.\n\n169\n00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.187\nThey said,\nas long as you're consistent you're fine.\n\n170\n00:07:57.187 --> 00:08:00.795\nBut the double space versus single space\nwas back in the typewriter days of your\n\n171\n00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:01.677\nmonospace fonts.\n\n172\n00:08:01.677 --> 00:08:03.953\nYou needed to make sure you\nhad a specific separator.\n\n173\n00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:05.694\nAnd all the readability.\n\n174\n00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:06.797\nLike you said readability.\n\n175\n00:08:06.797 --> 00:08:09.870\nBut again, long definition.\n\n176\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.560\nDefinition?\n\n177\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.800\nOr explanation.\n\n178\n00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.520\n&gt;&gt;

Thought, so\n\n296\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.650\nI said, am I using this word correctly\nwithin the context of the sentence?\n\n297\n00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.666\nYes, I am, so I will say perfect,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n298\n00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:22.359\nchange that and\nthen we can go ahead and move on.\n\n299\n00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:26.155\nYou can see here that we now\nwe're getting to she thinks, and\n\n300\n00:13:26.155 --> 00:13:31.230\nas doing a subject verb agreement, and\nI will go through and change this, okay?\n\n301\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.860\nThere's a grammar right here.\n\n302\n00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.000\nThis is the extra spaces between words.\n\n303\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.200\nSo I could go ahead and change that.\n\n304\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.230\nIT Pro TV, we're not doing improv here.\n\n305\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.767\nWell, we are [CROSSTALK]-\n&gt;&gt; We can do improv.\n\n306\n00:13:41.767 --> 00:13:42.299\nYeah.\n\n307\n00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:42.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n308\n00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:44.975\n&gt;&gt; This is not scripted, folks.\n\n309\n00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:47.732\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n310\n00:13:47.732 --> 00:13:49.820\nSo we have some notes, that's all we got.\n\n311\n00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.670\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n312\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.474\n&gt;&gt; But IT Pro TV is the correct spelling\nof the parent company that I work for, so\n\n313\n00:13:55.474 --> 00:13:58.868\nI would want to go ahead and\nadd that to my dictionary.\n\n314\n00:13:58.868 --> 00:14:02.580\nAnd it will not and this is for\nother word documents, too.\n\n315\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.956\nIt's not going to say that that\nis spelled incorrectly anymore.\n\n316\n00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:10.976\nSentair and this of course is\nthe more English version or\n\n317\n00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:12.850\nthe British version of this word.\n\n318\n00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.520\nBut I'm going to change it.\n\n319\n00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.680\nAnd we keep on going through the changes.\n\n320\n00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.450\nThe nice thing is if you get to put,\nyou're just like, change, change, change,\n\n321\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.517\nchange, change, change, change.\n\n322\n00:14:20.517 --> 00:14:22.201\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And something like Dimal,\n\n323\n00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:27.140\nDimal that's where you'd be saying\n&gt;&gt; Dyna all miss and\n\n324\n00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.510\nthis is one of those stylistic words\nwithin the context of the story.\n\n325\n00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:38.500\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like writing southern type of\nbrogues and things within to the text.\n\n326\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah or this is just the author's\nstylistic choice of kinda\n\n327\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.370\ncombining two words into there but yes\nit's definitely along those same lines.\n\n328\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.650\nSo I would say ignore once for this time.\n\n329\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.800\nOr if I know I'm going to be using\nthis again, I would do the ignore all.\n\n330\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.980\nSo there are reasons why you\nwant to use that ignore.\n\n331\n00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.850\nThis is where it's changing\nto the space for here.\n\n332\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.710\nI'm going to space that word out.\n\n333\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.930\nThis is that knelt down again.\n\n334\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:10.638\nIt's repeating, if you want to say, the\nconsistency, the, I can't say that word.\n\n335\n00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:11.852\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n336\n00:15:11.852 --> 00:15:12.510\n&gt;&gt; The clarity.\n\n337\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.206\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with the clarity, okay.\n\n338\n00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:17.509\nAnd I'm gonna ignore that,\ntoo because that is again,\n\n339\n00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:21.800\na stylistic of the author's Writing,\nand we'll go with ignore once.\n\n340\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.680\nIt get's to the very end, and\nhas completed my spell check and\n\n341\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.200\ngrammar, and I am done.\n\n342\n00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.890\nComing back to the readability statistics.\n\n343\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.750\nI forgot to check that on when we\nwere back in those options because\n\n344\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.770\nthe readability statistics is kinda neat,\nand I wanna show you it.\n\n345\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:39.790\nLet's go back to file.\n\n346\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.170\nLet's go back to options.\n\n347\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:47.050\nLet's go back to proofing, and we will\ngo to our show readability statistics.\n\n348\n00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.431\nI will check that on, now I've already\ndone my spell check cuz that's where your\n\n349\n00:15:51.431 --> 00:15:55.565\nreadability statistics will come up\nis after you've run that spell check.\n\n350\n00:15:55.565 --> 00:15:58.589\nSo let's go ahead and\nrecheck this document and say, hey,\n\n351\n00:15:58.589 --> 00:15:59.989\ndo you wanna do this again?\n\n352\n00:15:59.989 --> 00:16:00.987\nYes, I would.\n\n353\n00:16:00.987 --> 00:16:03.332\nAnd I will click OK.\n\n354\n00:16:03.332 --> 00:16:05.851\nAnd I will recheck the document.\n\n355\n00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:09.425\nI just realized when I just did that,\nit did all the things that I had ignored.\n\n356\n00:16:09.425 --> 00:16:11.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay that's okay well and\n\n357\n00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.740\nthis is actually all around, this is\na place that we should have that hyphen.\n\n358\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.240\n&gt;&gt; The hyphen.\n\n359\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay so we'll change that, and\n\n360\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.030\nthen we'll ignore all of those, and\nI believe we'll ignore and we will ignore.\n\n361\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.640\nThis is what I was getting at, okay?\n\n362\n00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.310\nThe readability statistics.\n\n363\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.310\nSo if you have that already\nchecked on in your options,\n\n364\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.470\nit would do this after\nyou do your spellcheck.\n\n365\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.900\nIt's kind of neat where it's\ntelling me how many characters,\n\n366\n00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.510\nhow any paragraphs do I have,\nhow many sentences.\n\n367\n00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.990\nThe average words per sentence.\n\n368\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.310\nAnd then the flesh kincade grade level.\n\n369\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.600\nThe reading level of what this is at,\nthat is at 6.5 grade level.\n\n370\n00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.866\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, I guess.\n\n371\n00:16:48.866 --> 00:16:49.738\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:16:49.738 --> 00:16:52.032\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually had somebody that work\n\n373\n00:16:52.032 --> 00:16:53.523\nfor the Navy at one point.\n\n374\n00:16:53.523 --> 00:16:58.073\nThis was years ago but\nhe's like I know all about this,\n\n375\n00:16:58.073 --> 00:17:03.443\nbecause his job was to proof and\nwrite manuals for the procedures, and\n\n376\n00:17:03.443 --> 00:17:09.010\nit had to be, I believe, at an eighth\ngrade level or a ninth grade level.\n\n377\n00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.900\nThere's a specific level that he said\n\n378\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.480\nwe had to make sure that all\nof our manuals are written at.\n\n379\n00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.850\nAnd if you think about- if you're writing\nthis at a college level, you're going to\n\n380\n00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.300\nuse really complex words and different\nthings that you need a procedure.\n\n381\n00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.786\nAnd so, you don't want to go too\ncrazy beyond this is what you do.\n\n382\n00:17:26.786 --> 00:17:28.330\nSo I just thought that was interesting.\n\n383\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.700\nBut he says it's- he also went\nthrough this whole formula.\n\n384\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.210\nWhat they use to determine what the grade\nlevel is, and you have to count the words,\n\n385\n00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.300\nand you have to count them over six\ncharacters, and I was like, okay.\n\n386\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:38.800\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.304\n&gt;&gt; It's nice that Word will do it for us.\n\n388\n00:17:40.304 --> 00:17:42.698\nSo the grade level, and the reading, and\n\n389\n00:17:42.698 --> 00:17:45.230\nthe passive sentences, how many passive or\n\n390\n00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.480\nactive sentences do we\nhave in the document?\n\n391\n00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.240\nSo pretty cool if you like\nsome statistics like that and\n\n392\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.660\njust about grammar and words in general.\n\n393\n00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.990\nSome other things about words,\nthe thesaurus.\n\n394\n00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.880\n&gt;&gt; Love it, best feature ever.\n\n395\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.020\n&gt;&gt; It definitely is.\n\n396\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:10.630\nSo if I needed to make another word for\nlet's say, doors?\n\n397\n00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.120\nWe'll go with doors.\n\n398\n00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.950\nYou have the source up here in the ribbon.\n\n399\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.360\nPersonally, I don't particularly like\nthis reading or this task pane over here.\n\n400\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.070\nIt doesn't do a great job of what\nare some other words for doors?\n\n401\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.950\nCuz these would be\nsynonyms of the word door.\n\n402\n00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.870\nWell it says entrances,\ngates, okay exits, accesses.\n\n403\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.790\nCool, well if I'm the way my brain works,\nI'll say,\n\n404\n00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.840\nalright well I would like to\nreplace this with the word gate.\n\n405\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.280\nSo you click on gates and\n\n406\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.440\nthen it switches to where gates becomes\nthe words that we're looking for.\n\n407\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.050\nNo, I want entries so just clicking\non it doesn't change the word.\n\n408\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.610\n&gt;&gt; It just suggests the words.\n\n409\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.700\n&gt;&gt; And it suggests more words for you.\n\n410\n00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.290\nAnd what I really wanna do.\n\n411\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Is swap them out.\n\n412\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.710\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so what you have to do is, you\nhave to come over here to hovering over\n\n413\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.586\nthe word that you want and\nyou have to click the drop down.\n\n414\n00:19:02.586 --> 00:19:04.820\nAnd then you have to say Insert and\n\n415\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.660\nit will change nothing wrong with it\nits just there's too many clicks.\n\n416\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.050\n&gt;&gt;

Yes, we do.\n&gt;&gt; So you could go find them and\n\n572\n00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.850\nthen know that you can print them out.\n\n573\n00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.470\nThe last thing I wanted to leave\non would be print selection.\n\n574\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.090\nThis is another thing that\nI get from a lot of people.\n\n575\n00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:51.920\nThe print out the whole page.\n\n576\n00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.270\nLike, I really only wanted that\none paragraph to be printed out.\n\n577\n00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.296\nWell, select to effect and\nthen choose the print option.\n\n578\n00:26:57.296 --> 00:27:00.110\nWell that sounds pretty handy,\nlet me zoom out of here.\n\n579\n00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.670\nI only want to print out\nthese two paragraphs.\n\n580\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.940\nYou make a selection,\nthis is big in websites, right?\n\n581\n00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:13.060\nAnd this is again across all platforms,\nprograms,\n\n582\n00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.910\nselect what you want first,\ndon't just print the whole thing out.\n\n583\n00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.560\nMake a selection,\ncome into your print options and\n\n584\n00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.010\ntell it to only print the selection.\n\n585\n00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.930\nI don't want everything else,\njust give me that what I have selected and\n\n586\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.420\nit'll print it out.\n\n587\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.770\nYou get it with emails and it prints out\nthe whole page and then we had frames.\n\n588\n00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:35.870\nFrames.\n\n589\n00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.490\nThen it would print out all sorts of\nweird things, so just select to effect.\n\n590\n00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.920\nChange it and there you go.\n\n591\n00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.370\nSo that is all I have for you today.\n\n592\n00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.330\nLot's of different things to make\nsure you proof your document,\n\n593\n00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.710\nproof read your document.\n\n594\n00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.806\nNot just do a spell check, and\nthen how to get that printer to work.\n\n595\n00:27:52.806 --> 00:27:54.636\nAnd if you don't, call Daniel,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n596\n00:27:54.636 --> 00:27:55.188\n&gt;&gt; And he'll fix it for you.\n\n597\n00:27:55.188 --> 00:27:57.524\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'll do it very surly.\n\n598\n00:27:57.524 --> 00:27:59.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'll have to listen to me moan and\n\n599\n00:27:59.202 --> 00:28:00.165\ncomplain the entire time.\n\n600\n00:28:00.165 --> 00:28:01.000\nIt'll be fun.\n\n601\n00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.930\nBe a good time.\n\n602\n00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.260\nAll right Vonne, thanks so much for\n\n603\n00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.830\nexplaining how we should be proofreading\nand doing our proofing of our documents.\n\n604\n00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.730\nAnd then how we can print them effectively\nin the way that we want them to do.\n\n605\n00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.900\nThat being said, looks like we\nare out of time for our episode.\n\n606\n00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.740\nWe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n607\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.340\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n608\n00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.190\n&gt;&gt;

another great\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:11.964\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\n\n5\n00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:16.080\nand today's episode we're continuing\non with more on our Word 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.370\nAnd, of course, joining us yet\nagain in the studio our good friend,\n\n7\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.300\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.090\nVonne?\n\n9\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.370\nGlad to have you again,\nhow is it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.805\n&gt;&gt; It's always good to be here, and\n\n11\n00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:25.015\nwe are going to be making\nstuff look pretty today.\n\n12\n00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:26.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going to be doing some\n\n13\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.270\ncharacter formatting and we're gonna\nmake our words different colors,\n\n14\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.630\nmaybe make them bold and\nitalic, talk about some fonts.\n\n15\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.010\nAnd not just applying it.\n\n16\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.360\nI can't get away from giving you\na little bit of a history lesson\n\n17\n00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360\non some of these things.\n\n18\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.650\nWe'll so discuss some of the basics of\ntypography and fonts and font family.\n\n19\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.290\nAnd we can make things bold but\n\n20\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.930\nit's not really bold if you're talking to\nan actual font person, but that's okay.\n\n21\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.590\nWe can let Word do its thing and\nmake things look pretty cool.\n\n22\n00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.820\nSo why don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n23\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.930\nI have some files ready for us to go and\nI have a file called Character Formatting.\n\n24\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.720\nI have it in my Word 2016\nfolder on my desktop, so\n\n25\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410\nI'm just gonna go ahead and open that up.\n\n26\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.185\nAnd, open up the file, and\nlet's see what we've got.\n\n27\n00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:13.180\nWe've got character formatting.\n\n28\n00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.530\nWater is H2O.\n\n29\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.380\nFantastic.\n\n30\n00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.559\nOkay, so.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n31\n00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:18.926\n&gt;&gt; We're not really reading\n\n32\n00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:19.794\nthe text here but\n\n33\n00:01:19.794 --> 00:01:24.028\nI wanted to just show you that we don't\nhave anything really fancy going on here.\n\n34\n00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:27.371\nEverything's just in what's known\nas the normal style, and while\n\n35\n00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:31.491\nwe're not concentrating on styles in this\nepisode I just wanted to point that out.\n\n36\n00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:35.941\nBecause it will come into play later\nwhen we start talking about how to\n\n37\n00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:37.476\nuse styles properly and\n\n38\n00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:42.480\nhow we're going to be formatting our\ncharacters ties right into all of that.\n\n39\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.245\nNow there's two levels of formatting.\n\n40\n00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:51.015\nWhen you're talking about formating or\nmodifying changing our text.\n\n41\n00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.065\nWe have our character level format and\n\n42\n00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:57.740\nthat is in the Font group on\nthe Home tab of our ribbon.\n\n43\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.240\nCharacter level formattings includes font,\nsize,\n\n44\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.735\ncolor, emphasis, strikethroughs,\nI already said color.\n\n45\n00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:06.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Small caps.\n\n46\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.818\n&gt;&gt; Strikethroughs [LAUGH].\n\n47\n00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:11.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yes, we'll just say\nthat again, and some strikethroughs.\n\n48\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.875\nWhich you don't really use a lot, but hey-\n&gt;&gt; Did I mention color?\n\n49\n00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we're gonna talk\n\n50\n00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:20.577\nabout what it actually means to be\nin an RGB color mode versus the HSL.\n\n51\n00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:24.431\nWe won't go too deep into that because\nthat's another tangent that I could go off\n\n52\n00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:25.800\non and talk for hours about.\n\n53\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.340\nSo the character level formatting is what\nwe're concentrating on in this episode.\n\n54\n00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.303\nThere is paragraph level\nformatting as well, and\n\n55\n00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:37.601\nthose would be things like alignment, the\ncenter, right line, fully justified text.\n\n56\n00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:40.600\nOur line spacing, but\nI've saved that for another episode,\n\n57\n00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.340\nI wanted to split them apart.\n\n58\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.243\nSo we can really concentrate on\neach side if you wanna say, and\n\n59\n00:02:47.243 --> 00:02:53.178\nreally go through all of the options and\ngive it it's due time to process.\n\n60\n00:02:53.178 --> 00:02:56.540\nSo, if you're doing\ncharacter level formatting\n\n61\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.880\nyou need to make sure you select all\nthe text that you want to effect.\n\n62\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.850\nBack to our rules of computing.\n\n63\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.980\nSo you need to have all words\non to make that change.\n\n64\n00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.960\nSo, why don't we take and click hold and\n\n65\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.300\ndrag across our text here\nin our character format.\n\n66\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.850\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit so\n\n67\n00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.870\nyou can see this a little clearer\ncuz I wanna make this different.\n\n68\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.080\nLet's start with changing the font.\n\n69\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.000\nAnd if we click this drop-down right here,\nthis is where we can go ahead and\n\n70\n00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.030\nselect our different fonts that\nare loaded on our computer.\n\n71\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.474\nNow, this window right here,\n\n72\n00:03:32.474 --> 00:03:37.832\nthis drop-down sometimes it's\ngonna show you like previewing but\n\n73\n00:03:37.832 --> 00:03:42.360\nI can't see what I'm formatting\nin cuz it's in the way.\n\n74\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.030\nIf you come down here to the very,\n\n75\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.830\nvery bottom you get the two pointed\nwhite arrows on the three little dots.\n\n76\n00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.240\nAnd you can click hold and drag this\nup to make this drop down window not so\n\n77\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.890\ndropped down, so it's not covering\nover the text that you want to apply.\n\n78\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.530\nBecause when you have your font picker\nup and you start scrolling through and\n\n79\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.900\nhovering, you get that live\npreview that comes on to let you\n\n80\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.930\nsee what it's gonna look like\nbefore you actually commit to this.\n\n81\n00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.780\nThis is something they added,\nI think, back in 2003-\n\n82\n00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.910\n&gt;&gt; It's a great feature though.\n\n83\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n84\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.050\n&gt;&gt; I love that live preview type of look,\ncuz that way, I'm the kind of person,\n\n85\n00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.440\nI've got to see it.\n\n86\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.580\nYou can't just show me, yes Ariel Black.\n\n87\n00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.060\nI could go to Ariel Black.\n\n88\n00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.320\nEven with that preview up in\nthe picking section, that's nice, but\n\n89\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.280\nI'm the kind of person I\nhave to see it applied.\n\n90\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.620\nSo I would apply it.\n\n91\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.348\nLike it or love it, no, go back,\npick a few different ones,\n\n92\n00:04:36.348 --> 00:04:38.780\nbeing able to do that on\nthe fly is a whole lot nicer.\n\n93\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they used to have\nI believe before 2003 is where,\n\n94\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.840\nyou didn't know what it looked like.\n\n95\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.862\nSo, click nope, click nope,\njust like you were talking about.\n\n96\n00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:49.244\nClick nope [LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:50.920\n&gt;&gt; Click maybe [LAUGH].\n\n98\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.859\n&gt;&gt; So live preview and like he's saying\nwhen you have the name of the font\n\n99\n00:04:55.859 --> 00:05:01.054\nthat's in that font, but it doesn't\nshow the letters that I'm using,\n\n100\n00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:04.051\nand there's a lot that goes on with font.\n\n101\n00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:08.266\nAnd what you really need to look for\nare how it formats your As, your Gs,\n\n102\n00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.197\nthose things.\n\n103\n00:05:09.197 --> 00:05:14.167\nSo right now in this Arial Black see\nthe A is like the the little circle with\n\n104\n00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:17.240\nthe little kinda hook on top as I call it.\n\n105\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.340\nBut if I come down to some other fonts,\nthis one's still doing that.\n\n106\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.702\nThat one's doing it to,\nthat one's doing at as well.\n\n107\n00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:27.352\n&gt;&gt; Everybody uses that one [LAUGH].\n\n108\n00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:29.510\n&gt;&gt; I think we're going to Century.\n\n109\n00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.757\nWell, I'm trying to find a font that makes\nit where the A looks just like an actual\n\n110\n00:05:33.757 --> 00:05:35.073\nlike circle with a line.\n\n111\n00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:36.008\n&gt;&gt; Comic Sans does it?\n\n112\n00:05:36.008 --> 00:05:36.908\n&gt;&gt; Is it Comic Sans?\n\n113\n00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:39.063\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just saw it.\n\n114\n00:05:39.063 --> 00:05:42.580\n&gt;&gt; Let's wow come on, let's go up.\n\n115\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.710\nComic Sans.\n\n116\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.230\nThere.\n\n117\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.945\nYes, thank you.\n\n118\n00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:48.990\n[LAUGH] So\nhere's where you start looking at the A.\n\n119\n00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.060\nThe Es are another one that\nmakes a big difference.\n\n120\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.360\nAnd you just kind of go through and\npreview which one.\n\n121\n00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.910\nNow these are all fonts like I said\nthat are loaded on our machine.\n\n122\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.470\nNow there's a whole wide world\nof fonts and what type of fonts.\n\n123\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.310\nYou have things known as open type fonts.\n\n124\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.070\nAnd you also have things that\nare known as true type fonts.\n\n125\n00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.250\nAnd you also have post script fonts,\nbut that's way old.\n\n126\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.280\nMost fonts are going to be open\ntype fonts for the most part,\n\n127\n00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.820\nand what does open type mean?\n\n128\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.390\nIf you think about open, it's open to\nall platforms because back in the day,\n\n129\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.650\nand you still have this in present day.\n\n130\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.730\nBut there was a big\ndiscrepancy between using fonts\n\n131\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.210\non a Macintosh operating system and\na Windows operating system.\n\n132\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.120\nAnd going back and forth through them.\n\n133\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.940\nWe've talked a lot about languages and\ncharacter sets, and\n\n134\n00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.270\nthings along that line throughout\nthese different episodes.\n\n135\n00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.540\nBut you can think that the Mac\nfonts talked in a certain language,\n\n136\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.540\nand the PC fonts talked\nin a certain language.\n\n137\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.570\nAnd trying to go back and forth to them,\nit was a little cluster for\n\n138\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.390\na lot of designers that use fonts a lot.\n\n139\n00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.830\nSo it was one of those\nthings that Microsoft.\n\n140\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.710\nI believe there's an open\npartnership between Microsoft and\n\n141\n00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.780\nApple or Apple and another company.\n\n142\n00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.490\nThat basically made this format\nof how fonts are coded and\n\n143\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.340\nused on computers to where\nthey're cross platform.\n\n144\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.440\nAnd more than just that,\nyou have it to where open type fonts can\n\n145\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.654\nsupport a whole bunch more\ncharacters than a true type font.\n\n146\n00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:29.289\nTrue font types and those are mostly\nspecifically for Windows operating system.\n\n147\n00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:32.341\nAnd this is where we talked a lot\nabout what the input characters and\n\n148\n00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:33.386\nspecial characters.\n\n149\n00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:38.819\nWatch that episode it's a lot of fun\nto talk about the byte levels and\n\n150\n00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.830\nbyte depth or bit depth?\n\n151\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.750\n&gt;&gt; Bit depth I think, yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.960\n&gt;&gt; Where we have how many things can\nbe supported within that character set,\n\n153\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.920\nthe same thing with the fonts as well.\n\n154\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.030\nIt goes right along kinda hand in\nhand with that to where you can\n\n155\n00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.590\nsupport fonts that will do the Umlauts and\nthe Tildes.\n\n156\n00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.500\nAnd all the different things that are on\nyour letters because that's what's all\n\n157\n00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.815\nwithin our characters and\nour character sets.\n\n158\n00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:08.737\nSo Little bit of history on there, if you\nwant to go down some more rabbit holes\n\n159\n00:08:08.737 --> 00:08:11.940\njust go ahead and\nsearch for open type fonts.\n\n160\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.780\nAnd you can see a whole world of, and\n\n161\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.430\nalso typography, you can learn\nabout what are extenders, and\n\n162\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.860\ndescenders, and bridges, and noses,\nand all sorts of different things.\n\n163\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.650\nEars, they have those, yes.\n\n164\n00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.312\n&gt;&gt; These things are completely\nanthropomorphized.\n\n165\n00:08:27.312 --> 00:08:30.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pretty much, yeah, you start\nlooking at it and they talk about legs and\n\n166\n00:08:30.803 --> 00:08:31.941\nstuff like this, okay.\n\n167\n00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:35.640\nBut they're talking about\nthe anatomy of a font and\n\n168\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.910\nabout a character, so it's kind of fun.\n\n169\n00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:42.020\nIt's good stuff for\ndorks like me that like to go ahead and\n\n170\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.265\ntalk about typesetting and and\nwonderful things like fonts.\n\n171\n00:08:45.265 --> 00:08:48.985\nOkay, so long story short, pick a font\nthat you like, and it's like, yay,\n\n172\n00:08:48.985 --> 00:08:50.175\nlet's go with Comic Sans.\n\n173\n00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:51.586\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with Comic Sans.\n\n174\n00:08:51.586 --> 00:08:55.435\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] so I went ahead and\nformatted this in Comic Sans.\n\n175\n00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:58.705\nRight next to it would be our font size,\nand\n\n176\n00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:03.445\nif you click this drop-down,\nbigger is bigger, smaller is smaller, yup.\n\n177\n00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:04.879\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So bigger the number,\n\n178\n00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:08.328\nbigger the font size, smaller the number,\nsmaller the font size.\n\n179\n00:09:08.328 --> 00:09:12.302\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, and\nwe have our live preview here to where,\n\n180\n00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:17.240\nlet's see, 28 versus 22,\nmaybe I'll go with 26, the middle.\n\n181\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.860\nNow font size is not, I would say,\nuniversal across all fonts.\n\n182\n00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.461\nBecause if I picked another\nfont in that same size,\n\n183\n00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:29.765\nsay the Agency,\nnotice this is a lot smaller.\n\n184\n00:09:29.765 --> 00:09:30.390\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n185\n00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.110\nin Comic Sans, then that's a lot bigger.\n\n186\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.620\nAnd that just comes by what are known\nas the X heights, the X height is,\n\n187\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.680\nthink about the height of an X and\nthen like the extended characters.\n\n188\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.610\nAll these fonts have different base sizes,\nif you wanna say.\n\n189\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.560\nSo 26 point font is not\nthe same across all fonts.\n\n190\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.510\nNot a big deal, just something to\nknow about, and when you pick it and\n\n191\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.940\nit changes, but I thought it was 26,\nyeah, but that's for that particular font.\n\n192\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.790\nThey also have these little bumpy arrows,\nI call them bumpy arrows,\n\n193\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.770\nto where you can bump it up a little bit.\n\n194\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.613\nWhoop, that's a little too big.\n\n195\n00:10:05.613 --> 00:10:07.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and bump it down and so\n\n196\n00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:09.890\nyou can kinda go in those increments.\n\n197\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.800\nAnd I guess I should tell you\nthat you don't have to go by what\n\n198\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.570\nthey're giving you.\n\n199\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.180\nIf I wanted that to be 21.5 point font,\n\n200\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.050\nyou could go ahead and click it in there\nand type 21.5, and you can hit Enter or\n\n201\n00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:27.010\nthe Tab and\nit will make that particular measurement.\n\n202\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.100\nAnd might as well throw out\na couple more terminology for you.\n\n203\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.841\nPoints, all of our fonts\nare measured in points.\n\n204\n00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.290\nIt's kind of how 12 inches\nthat are in a foot.\n\n205\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.871\nAnd, we have our whole measurement system\nin the United States that's not like\n\n206\n00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:40.893\nthe rest of the world.\n\n207\n00:10:40.893 --> 00:10:43.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But,\nwe have a certain, what is it?\n\n208\n00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.777\nEight ounces in a cup and\nwe just know these, I think it is, right.\n\n209\n00:10:47.777 --> 00:10:48.547\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n210\n00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.410\nAnd then there's 16 ounces in a pound.\n\n211\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd I always have to look it up.\n\n212\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.678\n&gt;&gt; So it's just like the fluids\nverses solids and then it gets crazy.\n\n213\n00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:57.432\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n214\n00:10:57.432 --> 00:10:58.843\nwell I'll throw another one in there for\nyou.\n\n215\n00:10:58.843 --> 00:11:03.213\nSo if we have fonts, and measures,\nand points, well what's a point?\n\n216\n00:11:03.213 --> 00:11:07.213\nWell points, you also have\nthings that are known as picas,\n\n217\n00:11:07.213 --> 00:11:12.013\nand then you have 12 points in 1 pica and\nyou have 6 picas in 1 inch and\n\n218\n00:11:12.013 --> 00:11:14.800\nyou're like-\n&gt;&gt; Now it starts to get to where you're\n\n219\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.625\nfiguring it out.\n\n220\n00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:17.606\n&gt;&gt; That's where you have,\n\n221\n00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:20.793\nthree feet are in a yard, it's the same\nthing when you are measuring with fonts.\n\n222\n00:11:20.793 --> 00:11:27.442\nAnd it goes back in the history of\nwhen you had the printing press and\n\n223\n00:11:27.442 --> 00:11:33.162\nyou had letters and\nhow they measured fonts on the paper.\n\n224\n00:11:33.162 --> 00:11:36.681\nGo another, down a rabbit hole,\nlook up picas and points and\n\n225\n00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:38.140\nyou can see what that is.\n\n226\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.950\nAnd there's 72 points in an inch.\n\n227\n00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.021\nJust go, sounds great.\n\n228\n00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:44.078\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:46.340\n&gt;&gt; So these numbers that we're looking at\n\n230\n00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.244\nin that drop down, the size,\nthe font size, is in points so\n\n231\n00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:53.080\nif you say 21.5, that's 21.5 points.\n\n232\n00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.330\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\n\n233\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.800\nAnd just to get that terminology,\ncuz I'm just using it like yeah.\n\n234\n00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.402\n&gt;&gt; Assuming that we get this.\n\n235\n00:11:59.402 --> 00:12:02.135\n&gt;&gt; Fonts are measured in points, and\nthat's what we really need to know.\n\n236\n00:12:02.135 --> 00:12:03.883\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; There you go, [LAUGH].\n\n237\n00:12:03.883 --> 00:12:08.163\nAnd let's move down here\nbecause now we have what our\n\n238\n00:12:08.163 --> 00:12:12.554\ncharacter emphasis, bold,\nitalic and underline.\n\n239\n00:12:12.554 --> 00:12:16.332\nAnd this is where I went, well bold\nis just bold, what does that mean?\n\n240\n00:12:16.332 --> 00:12:23.511\nIt makes the weight of your font\nthicker and wider to where it's bolder.\n\n241\n00:12:23.511 --> 00:12:26.861\nIt puts more emphasis on that text,\nso if I click on the bold,\n\n242\n00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:30.800\nsee all the letters just get\na little thicker and fatter.\n\n243\n00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.210\nThat's how I could explain what bold does.\n\n244\n00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.378\n&gt;&gt; It's your fonts after\nThanksgiving dinner.\n\n245\n00:12:35.378 --> 00:12:35.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n246\n00:12:35.898 --> 00:12:36.575\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n247\n00:12:36.575 --> 00:12:37.265\n&gt;&gt; After the holidays.\n\n248\n00:12:37.265 --> 00:12:37.863\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n249\n00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:39.661\nand your laying on the couch\njust stuffed from turkeys.\n\n250\n00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:40.676\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n251\n00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:43.292\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we have [LAUGH] bold is stuffed\n\n252\n00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:44.130\nturkey.\n\n253\n00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.026\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n254\n00:12:45.026 --> 00:12:45.602\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n255\n00:12:45.602 --> 00:12:50.089\n[LAUGH] We also have Italic which will\nmake it to where it slants a little bit,\n\n256\n00:12:50.089 --> 00:12:52.809\nso where it's like the oblique formatting.\n\n257\n00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:54.757\n&gt;&gt; That's after New Year's eve, right?\n\n258\n00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:56.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's kinda leaning to the side.\n\n260\n00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:00.635\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n261\n00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:02.094\n&gt;&gt; I'm great with analogies [LAUGH].\n\n262\n00:13:02.094 --> 00:13:04.364\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nItalics is New Year's Eve text.\n\n263\n00:13:04.364 --> 00:13:07.812\n[LAUGH] And then we have underline.\n\n264\n00:13:07.812 --> 00:13:12.106\nUnderline will makes a line that goes\n\n265\n00:13:12.106 --> 00:13:15.199\nunder the text and-\n&gt;&gt; I got nothing for you.\n\n266\n00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:17.268\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz we were.\n\n267\n00:13:17.268 --> 00:13:18.456\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to take it my\n\n268\n00:13:18.456 --> 00:13:19.070\nmind some like.\n\n269\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, none, none, none.\n\n270\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n271\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, done, yeah.\n\n272\n00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.790\n&gt;&gt; Under the mistletoe?\n\n273\n00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.868\n&gt;&gt; It's just underlined.\n\n274\n00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:29.039\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n275\n00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:31.710\nSo we have a line that\ngoes under our text.\n\n276\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.010\nAnd notice that all the buttons are on.\n\n277\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.130\nCuz I get a lot of people say well I made\nit bold, but how do I make it not bold?\n\n278\n00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.810\nThere's not like an unbold button.\n\n279\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.090\nBut it is like a light switch,\nyou turn it on or you turn it off.\n\n280\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.110\nSo I have the text selected.\n\n281\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.650\nTurn it off, turned off?\n\n282\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.760\nTurned off.\n\n283\n00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.610\nTurn them on.\n\n284\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.880\nAnd then you keep going.\n\n285\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.872\nYou have a little drop down next to\nthe underline because you don't just have\n\n286\n00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:52.723\na single underline.\n\n287\n00:13:52.723 --> 00:13:54.690\nYou have some double underlines.\n\n288\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.624\nYou got some wavy underlines,\nooh, that's cute, so.\n\n289\n00:13:57.624 --> 00:14:00.520\nBut now it looks like\na spelling mistake [LAUGH].\n\n290\n00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.354\n&gt;&gt; Can you make it red?\n\n291\n00:14:01.354 --> 00:14:03.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yes, we can,\n\n292\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.267\nwe can totally change the font to be red.\n\n293\n00:14:05.267 --> 00:14:09.460\nSo the other thing that I think\nabout if I have text underlined.\n\n294\n00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.330\nI usually give it as hyperlink.\n\n295\n00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.571\nNow within Word, since we're usually\ndoing this on like a printed page.\n\n296\n00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:18.036\nBut a lot of times we're doing so\nmuch stuff electronically now,\n\n297\n00:14:18.036 --> 00:14:21.249\nif I sent somebody with a document\nwith underlined text, and\n\n298\n00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:24.845\nespecially if it's blue they might\nthink that they can click on it.\n\n299\n00:14:25.855 --> 00:14:28.736\nSo I'm not saying you don't use\nunderlining, but maybe throw it as a,\n\n300\n00:14:28.736 --> 00:14:30.232\nwhoops, that's a strike through.\n\n301\n00:14:30.232 --> 00:14:32.351\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe throw it in as a double or\n\n302\n00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:36.855\na dotted line to kind of get it just\na little bit of differentiation.\n\n303\n00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:37.715\nTotally up to you.\n\n304\n00:14:37.715 --> 00:14:40.435\nWe'll keep it as a squiggly underline and\nwe'll make it bold.\n\n305\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.160\nMoving over through some\nof these other ones there,\n\n306\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.440\nthere's that strikethrough\nthat I wanted to click.\n\n307\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.860\nWhat does Strikethrough do?\n\n308\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:54.038\nIt's actually a visual indication that\nyou're putting a line through the text.\n\n309\n00:14:54.038 --> 00:14:57.000\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, cuz people use\nthis creatively I've noticed in,\n\n310\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.640\nespecially when it comes to blogs and\nwebsites of that nature.\n\n311\n00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.690\nWhere they wanna say something but\nit's probably rude to say it.\n\n312\n00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.870\nSo they write it, put a strikethrough and\nthen put the nice thing.\n\n313\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.723\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've seen that.\n\n314\n00:15:07.723 --> 00:15:10.395\nIt's cute,\nI mean I think it's pretty cute.\n\n315\n00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:11.609\n&gt;&gt; Yeah It is, it is very funny.\n\n316\n00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:14.121\n&gt;&gt; I get a chuckle, it's-\n&gt;&gt; Very facetious, yeah.\n\n317\n00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:17.463\n&gt;&gt; Especially when some of the words\nare like not very politically correct.\n\n318\n00:15:17.463 --> 00:15:20.142\n&gt;&gt; Appropriate [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or like it's kinda cursey,\n\n319\n00:15:20.142 --> 00:15:21.406\nI'm like yes good job.\n\n320\n00:15:21.406 --> 00:15:24.030\n[LAUGH] So but that's just me.\n\n321\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.520\nI just think it's kind of entertaining.\n\n322\n00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.225\nSo yes.\n&gt;&gt; Vonne's a potty mouth sailor,\n\n323\n00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:27.896\nthat's why.\n\n324\n00:15:27.896 --> 00:15:29.463\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm, kind of.\n\n325\n00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:32.855\n[LAUGH] So we have our strikethroughs and\n\n326\n00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:38.521\nour different buttons that go\nthrough here, the supper script!\n\n327\n00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:42.825\n[LAUGH] The subscript and the superscript-\n&gt;&gt; We got you on food, that's the problem.\n\n328\n00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:43.878\nYou know, just thinking about\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n329\n00:15:43.878 --> 00:15:44.894\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Thinking of pizza!\n\n330\n00:15:44.894 --> 00:15:50.469\n[LAUGH] So we have water as H2O,\nthere's a reason why I wrote this,\n\n331\n00:15:50.469 --> 00:15:55.163\nbecause the two in our hydrogen\nshould be subscripted.\n\n332\n00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:59.389\nSo when I select that one character and\nI click the subscript, it goes, well,\n\n333\n00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:03.549\ndown below the baseline, where all of\nyour text Six is known as the baseline,\n\n334\n00:16:03.549 --> 00:16:05.743\nwhen we're talking about typography.\n\n335\n00:16:05.743 --> 00:16:12.050\nAnd 128 is not 28,\nit's actually 2 to the 8th power.\n\n336\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.398\nSo, if I wanted to make this an exponent\nand make this a superscript,\n\n337\n00:16:15.398 --> 00:16:18.284\nthen I go ahead and select that\ncharacter and make it go up and\n\n338\n00:16:18.284 --> 00:16:22.100\nmake it a little smaller, and\nthat would be our superscript font.\n\n339\n00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.994\nNow one thing to know, when I click off\nto here, if I wanted to keep typing and\n\n340\n00:16:26.994 --> 00:16:31.679\nI start typing from here, notice\nit's still in that superscript font.\n\n341\n00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:35.371\nAnd so a lot of times,\nif you're formatting as you go,\n\n342\n00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:40.269\nlike if I typed in 2 to the 8th and\nimmediately selected the number 8 and\n\n343\n00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:44.636\nsuperscripted it, kept going,\nit's gonna stay within that.\n\n344\n00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:49.254\nSo I like to give the suggestion\nof typing all of your text out and\n\n345\n00:16:49.254 --> 00:16:52.510\nthen formatting afterwards.\n\n346\n00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.890\nYou can format as you go,\nbut it stays with it.\n\n347\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.610\nAnd so if you made it bold and pink and\nunderlined, and then you keep typing,\n\n348\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.510\nit stays with that.\n\n349\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.870\nSo try to just get the text in clean,\n\n350\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.180\nas I call it, and\nthen do all of your formatting afterwards.\n\n351\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.590\nIt's hard to kind of train\nyourself to do that,\n\n352\n00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:14.100\nbut it will make your\nlife a little bit easier.\n\n353\n00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.082\nBut now here, If I didn't want\nany of this superscripted, but\n\n354\n00:17:17.082 --> 00:17:19.347\nnotice it's trying to\nselect all of that text.\n\n355\n00:17:19.347 --> 00:17:22.522\nSo I'd probably just go ahead and just\nbackspace, oops, that's a little too much.\n\n356\n00:17:22.522 --> 00:17:23.513\n&gt;&gt; You went backspace crazy.\n\n357\n00:17:23.513 --> 00:17:29.396\n&gt;&gt; Undo, [LAUGH] we'll go ahead and\nbackspace all the way to here,\n\n358\n00:17:29.396 --> 00:17:32.980\nand now I'm on the space after the 8.\n\n359\n00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:39.426\nI turn off the superscript, and now I can\nspace and keep on typing in regular land.\n\n360\n00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:43.291\nAnd I'm good to go, so\nturning things on and off,\n\n361\n00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:46.890\nknowing how to and\nwhen to do it is pretty good.\n\n362\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.325\nThere's some other buttons along\nhere that we haven't covered.\n\n363\n00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:53.452\nWe have our change case button.\n\n364\n00:17:53.452 --> 00:17:58.230\nI love the change case button so much,\nbecause if I have typed something in\n\n365\n00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.237\nall caps and realized I didn't\nwant that in all caps anymore,\n\n366\n00:18:02.237 --> 00:18:04.645\nI just want it to be in sentence case.\n\n367\n00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:07.535\nOr maybe I want to capitalize every word.\n\n368\n00:18:07.535 --> 00:18:08.746\nThat's what this button does.\n\n369\n00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:11.752\nSentence case, click it.\n\n370\n00:18:11.752 --> 00:18:14.790\nChanges just where we capitalize\nthe first letter of the sentence.\n\n371\n00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.150\nWhoops, that's the wrong button,\nlet's go here.\n\n372\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.840\nThere's the lowercase, there's upper case.\n\n373\n00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.903\nNow you don't get the hovering and\nthe live preview here, but it is a nice\n\n374\n00:18:23.903 --> 00:18:29.139\nway to kind of switch back and forth\nquickly without having to re-type it.\n\n375\n00:18:29.139 --> 00:18:34.020\nSo I use this button quite frequently,\nand I think it's wonderful.\n\n376\n00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.500\nSo that's why I said,\nchange case is a great button.\n\n377\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.027\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n378\n00:18:37.027 --> 00:18:39.504\n&gt;&gt; It is, so where else are we gonna go?\n\n379\n00:18:39.504 --> 00:18:41.214\nLet's go to this highlighter.\n\n380\n00:18:41.214 --> 00:18:45.903\nThe highlighter is just like if you\nhad a highlighter in your hand, and\n\n381\n00:18:45.903 --> 00:18:48.215\nyou wanted to make some emphasis.\n\n382\n00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:51.032\nYeah, we'll use the emphasis\nto go ahead and\n\n383\n00:18:51.032 --> 00:18:56.017\nhighlight [LAUGH] now I'm circling again,\nselect the text, click the button.\n\n384\n00:18:56.017 --> 00:18:59.036\nYay, [LAUGH] and I just made it yellow.\n\n385\n00:18:59.036 --> 00:19:02.415\n&gt;&gt; Now you can also just click the button,\nand then select the text as well, correct?\n\n386\n00:19:04.234 --> 00:19:06.512\n&gt;&gt; You can, it's like yeah, if I'm gonna\ntake the cap off the highlighter and\n\n387\n00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:08.720\ngo through my document,\nand highlight things up.\n\n388\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.200\nThe only thing there would be that you\njust have to double click the button.\n\n389\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:11.720\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n390\n00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that keeps it on, so\n\n391\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:18.090\nif I double-click this button, notice\nthat, well, here, let me try that again.\n\n392\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.730\nLet's go and double-click it,\nthere we go, and it's not doing it.\n\n393\n00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:22.450\nLet's try it again.\n\n394\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.620\nWhy don't we select some text first?\n\n395\n00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.840\nNow double-click it, there we go.\n\n396\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.770\nOkay, so key is,\nyou have to have something selected first.\n\n397\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.240\nYou have to make your first highlighter,\nand then it will stay on.\n\n398\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.310\nOkay, perfect, good.\n\n399\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.440\nSo it's kinda like you\nhave to take the cap off,\n\n400\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.000\nthen draw, and then keep the cap off?\n\n401\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.535\nI don't know what analogy I'm\ntrying to go with [LAUGH].\n\n402\n00:19:43.535 --> 00:19:48.015\nSelect the text first, double-click it,\nand then I can go through and\n\n403\n00:19:48.015 --> 00:19:52.283\nstart highlighting the different\npieces that I want to highlight.\n\n404\n00:19:52.283 --> 00:19:55.380\nNow just like, if it's on,\nI've gotta turn it off.\n\n405\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.361\nYou can come back up here and\nturn the button off,\n\n406\n00:19:58.361 --> 00:20:01.503\nyou click it, and\nnow it's in my regular eye beam.\n\n407\n00:20:01.503 --> 00:20:05.560\nBecause if you noticed, here, let me do it\none more time, I select the text first.\n\n408\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.420\n&gt;&gt; Just hold on, try one thing for me.\n\n409\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:12.587\nCuz I use this, unselect your text, and\nnow just click the highlighter button.\n\n410\n00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:13.894\nAnd now select text.\n\n411\n00:20:13.894 --> 00:20:17.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, look at there, you know what?\n\n412\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.397\nI just learned something, Daniel.\n\n413\n00:20:18.397 --> 00:20:19.103\n&gt;&gt; I have my moments.\n\n414\n00:20:19.103 --> 00:20:21.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think that's fantastic.\n\n415\n00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:24.377\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna call it a day,\nthanks for watching, everyone,\n\n416\n00:20:24.377 --> 00:20:25.524\ncuz that was my one I had.\n\n417\n00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:28.894\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Daniel's gone forever.\n\n418\n00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.486\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah, I'm tuning out now.\n\n419\n00:20:30.486 --> 00:20:32.381\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's awesome,\n\n420\n00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:36.330\ncuz I've always selected the text\nfirst and then double-clicked it.\n\n421\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.657\nAll right, I was trying.\n\n422\n00:20:37.657 --> 00:20:40.288\nCuz I was going along your way,\nI'm like, does this work?\n\n423\n00:20:40.288 --> 00:20:41.700\nIt does.\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n424\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.740\n&gt;&gt; You single click it if you have nothing\nselected, if you have something selected,\n\n425\n00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.770\nthen you double-click it.\n\n426\n00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.437\nSo there we go.\n\n427\n00:20:47.437 --> 00:20:50.028\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, three different ways in\nwhich to work with the highlighter,\n\n428\n00:20:50.028 --> 00:20:51.353\nchoose the one that works for you.\n\n429\n00:20:51.353 --> 00:20:53.514\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which way are we gonna go?\n\n430\n00:20:53.514 --> 00:20:54.180\nAre we gonna go this way?\n\n431\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.059\nAre we gonna go that way?\n\n432\n00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:56.493\nWe'll end up in the same place.\n\n433\n00:20:56.493 --> 00:20:58.422\n&gt;&gt; Here's three different\nskinners right here.\n\n434\n00:20:58.422 --> 00:21:00.135\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n435\n00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:02.840\nNow what if I don't wanna\nhighlight in yellow?\n\n436\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.960\nWell, you drop this down,\nand you can pick your color.\n\n437\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.382\nSo maybe I wanna highlight in pink,\ninstead of yellow, click that.\n\n438\n00:21:09.382 --> 00:21:12.710\nNow I know to single, well, it's already\non now since I single clicked it.\n\n439\n00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.010\nAnd then I can go ahead and\nstart highlighting in different colors.\n\n440\n00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.740\nTurn off the highlighter when I'm done,\n\n441\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.550\nand now I have highlighted my text,\nwhich is wonderful.\n\n442\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:23.580\nLet's keep on going.\n\n443\n00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.570\nLet's change the color of the font.\n\n444\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:32.230\nLet's select our text, move over to the\nA with the line underneath it, the color.\n\n445\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.035\nThis is our font color, drop it down.\n\n446\n00:21:35.035 --> 00:21:38.995\nThese are the colors that it's giving\nbased on the theme that is selected right\n\n447\n00:21:38.995 --> 00:21:41.425\nnow, by default, that is the Office theme.\n\n448\n00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:43.967\nWe will talk about how we\ncan change our themes and\n\n449\n00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:46.795\nwhat it actually means to be a theme.\n\n450\n00:21:46.795 --> 00:21:49.545\nBut for now, let's just use\nwhat we have available to us.\n\n451\n00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:54.040\nBecause if I really wanted pink,\nI don't see any pink on here.\n\n452\n00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.980\nThen I go to more colors, because this\nis where I can pick any of my colors.\n\n453\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.890\nNow in the standard tab,\n\n454\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.060\nthis is where it's kinda like\npicking crayons out of a box.\n\n455\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.230\nMaybe I like this color, or\nmaybe I like that crayon,\n\n456\n00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.590\nand there's some pretty pinks.\n\n457\n00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.430\nBut there's not enough shades of pink for\nme out there, and\n\n458\n00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.660\njust what I've got in the standard tab,\nyou also have a custom tab.\n\n459\n00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.370\nIn this custom tab,\nnow you have the entire RGB spectrum.\n\n460\n00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.046\nNow what does RGB mean?\n\n461\n00:22:20.046 --> 00:22:23.262\nIt means red, green, and blue.\n\n462\n00:22:23.262 --> 00:22:28.020\nAnd red, green, and blue is known as\nan additive color mode that works on\n\n463\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.297\na scale of 0 to 255 for\nred, green, and blue.\n\n464\n00:22:31.297 --> 00:22:35.360\nAnd you're measuring light or\nall of the light together.\n\n465\n00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.273\nIf you put all of the whites on,\nit makes white.\n\n466\n00:22:39.273 --> 00:22:43.300\nIf you put all of the whites off,\nyou're making black.\n\n467\n00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.670\nAnd so that is the color\nmode that you have in here.\n\n468\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.406\nNow if you're like, I have no idea\nwhat you're talking about right now,\n\n469\n00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:50.420\nthat's okay.\n\n470\n00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.730\nYou don't have to, you can just click\naround this little square in here.\n\n471\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:58.284\nAnd you can move your mouse around,\nnoticing down here that it's going to give\n\n472\n00:22:58.284 --> 00:23:02.562\nyou the new color and the current color\nthat you have applied to your text or\n\n473\n00:23:02.562 --> 00:23:05.140\nthat is in the color picker right now.\n\n474\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.700\nAnd then you can use it to contrast there.\n\n475\n00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.068\nBut just to give you a little bit\nmore on some of these colors, see,\n\n476\n00:23:12.068 --> 00:23:15.032\nif you'll look at this one,\nyou see how RGB,\n\n477\n00:23:15.032 --> 00:23:19.647\nred, green, blue, all the red is on,\nbut the green and blue are off.\n\n478\n00:23:19.647 --> 00:23:22.941\nNow this doesn't work like how\nwe normally think of color.\n\n479\n00:23:22.941 --> 00:23:26.125\nRed and blue make, wait,\nred and blue make purple.\n\n480\n00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:28.826\n[LAUGH] I was gonna say yellow and\nblue make green.\n\n481\n00:23:28.826 --> 00:23:31.528\nYes, cuz those bags.\n\n482\n00:23:31.528 --> 00:23:34.558\n&gt;&gt; And red and yellow make orange and\nso on and so forth.\n\n483\n00:23:34.558 --> 00:23:36.394\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthose are our primary colors and\n\n484\n00:23:36.394 --> 00:23:40.150\nhow we mix our primary colors to make our\nsecondary colors and your tertiary colors.\n\n485\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.187\nAgain, this is where I need to stop-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n486\n00:23:42.187 --> 00:23:43.659\n&gt;&gt; Because I know a lot about color theory\n\n487\n00:23:43.659 --> 00:23:46.040\nand all of that, so\nI'm gonna just leave it at that.\n\n488\n00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.015\nBut how designers and\npeople measure colors when working in\n\n489\n00:23:50.015 --> 00:23:54.469\ncomputer-based systems,\nif you wanna say, or applications and\n\n490\n00:23:54.469 --> 00:23:59.494\ncolor modes and whether it's going to\nbe on a printed page versus a screen.\n\n491\n00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:04.055\nYou have RGB, CMYK,\nyou also have Pantone, you have some HSL,\n\n492\n00:24:04.055 --> 00:24:09.220\nwhich is another color mode,\nwhich is hue, saturation and luminance.\n\n493\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.830\nIt's really all what is green, and you can\nmeasure it in a couple of different ways.\n\n494\n00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.005\nIt's kinda like saying\nhow do you say hello?\n\n495\n00:24:16.005 --> 00:24:17.830\nWe can say hola, you can say yassou,\n\n496\n00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.910\nyou can say all sorts of different words\nthat mean hello in different languages.\n\n497\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:28.671\nColors come in different languages as well\nor numerical values, just pick a color.\n\n498\n00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:32.168\n[LAUGH] But if you are a designer or\ndoing word,\n\n499\n00:24:32.168 --> 00:24:37.782\nif your company color is Pantone 187 and\nyou need to know what the RGB or\n\n500\n00:24:37.782 --> 00:24:43.140\nCMYK equivalence is, in Word you\ndon't have the CMYK color values.\n\n501\n00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.780\nYou would have to find the RGB value of\nwhatever color you're trying to match.\n\n502\n00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.800\nLike company logos and\nthe things along that line.\n\n503\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.924\nSo, that's why you might want to use this,\nif you know where it is.\n\n504\n00:24:55.924 --> 00:25:02.430\nWe click OK and now I have got my color\nand I have applied the color to this text.\n\n505\n00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.231\nAnd that will cover our fonts, color.\n\n506\n00:25:05.231 --> 00:25:06.941\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n507\n00:25:06.941 --> 00:25:09.492\n&gt;&gt; There's a few more formats that you can\n\n508\n00:25:09.492 --> 00:25:13.673\ndo with your text that's not in\nthis little menu right now here.\n\n509\n00:25:13.673 --> 00:25:16.100\nCuz we've covered almost\nall of these buttons.\n\n510\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.425\nWe have a couple,\nwe have this little guy over here, and\n\n511\n00:25:18.425 --> 00:25:21.313\nwe also have this little guy and\nthose will be the last of the buttons.\n\n512\n00:25:21.313 --> 00:25:24.875\nBut what if I wanted to make\nmy text into small caps?\n\n513\n00:25:24.875 --> 00:25:28.320\nThe other thing, if I come back to that\nunderline, if I choose my underline,\n\n514\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.130\nmaybe I'll do like a double underline.\n\n515\n00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:37.189\nAnd I change the font color to green,\nit's changing the underline color as well.\n\n516\n00:25:37.189 --> 00:25:41.190\nWhat if I wanted to have green text but\npink underlines?\n\n517\n00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.426\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say red.\n\n518\n00:25:43.426 --> 00:25:44.415\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was going with pink,\n\n519\n00:25:44.415 --> 00:25:46.551\ncuz we did have that color\ncombination yesterday.\n\n520\n00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:48.200\n&gt;&gt; Green and red is very festive,\nlike Christmas.\n\n521\n00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.460\n&gt;&gt; It is, and you know those\nare complimentary colors as well.\n\n522\n00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.260\n&gt;&gt; That's why they look so good together.\n\n523\n00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.466\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; Like yellow and blue, right?\n\n524\n00:25:53.466 --> 00:25:55.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Green and purple as well.\n\n525\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n526\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:56.996\n&gt;&gt; Or was it yellow and purple?\n\n527\n00:25:56.996 --> 00:25:58.760\nNo, I think it's yellow and purple.\n\n528\n00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.570\nYou know what, there is a color chart,\nand they are complimentary colors so\n\n529\n00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.610\nwe're close enough.\n\n530\n00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n531\n00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:06.970\ntake this text.\n\n532\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.550\nI want the underline to be different,\nand I also wanna make it in small caps.\n\n533\n00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.750\nThis button right here, the more button or\n\n534\n00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.860\nthe dialogue box launcher\nbutton is it's technical name.\n\n535\n00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.400\nI click on that and it brings me to the\nfont dialogue box where I do have a couple\n\n536\n00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.860\nother options in here.\n\n537\n00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:27.000\nSo font color, underlined color,\nthat's the style sorry.\n\n538\n00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.650\nUnderline color is the one to the right.\n\n539\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:32.820\nSo I could go ahead and choose there to\nwhere, and you can see the little preview\n\n540\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.620\nwindow down here that I'll have\ngreen text, pink underlines.\n\n541\n00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.350\nAnd I could also come in here and\nchange the font of the underlined style,\n\n542\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.380\nwhich isn't any different from\nthe drop down that I saw,\n\n543\n00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.380\nI was just being able to change it here.\n\n544\n00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.970\nYou could also do the font and the size\nand the style where we had that bold and\n\n545\n00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:53.190\nbold italics,\ndepending on what font you are choosing.\n\n546\n00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.501\nBut they do use regular italic,\nbold and bold italic.\n\n547\n00:26:57.501 --> 00:27:00.585\nI will tell you as somebody\nthat does know typography,\n\n548\n00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:02.808\nthere is no such thing as bold curls MT.\n\n549\n00:27:02.808 --> 00:27:09.870\nIt doesn't technically exist\nwithin that font family.\n\n550\n00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:17.600\nBut Word doesn't follow the strict\nletter of the law for typography laws.\n\n551\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.539\nIt just says I'm making\nthis visually thicker text.\n\n552\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.890\nBut if you were to bring this into\na program such as In Design it would give\n\n553\n00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:31.143\nyou a warning like this font is not found,\ncuz it really doesn't exist.\n\n554\n00:27:31.143 --> 00:27:34.678\nCuz every font has different families and\n\n555\n00:27:34.678 --> 00:27:38.524\ndifferent stylistic sets\nif you want to say.\n\n556\n00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:42.682\nAnd certain fonts will have like\nnarrow and semi bold and bold and\n\n557\n00:27:42.682 --> 00:27:46.770\nbook and light and, for\npeople like me that work a lot of fonts.\n\n558\n00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:52.179\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying I can go and get\nme like a Pantone patent on Curls Bold.\n\n559\n00:27:52.179 --> 00:27:54.320\n&gt;&gt; I think you're crossing\nsome streams there.\n\n560\n00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.160\n&gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about, right.\n\n561\n00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's colors, right, yeah.\n\n562\n00:27:58.716 --> 00:28:00.990\nBut you know what I mean.\n\n563\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.940\nGet a patent on that cuz all these\nfonts are arbitrarily created\n\n564\n00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.230\nby somebody who said here's my font.\n\n565\n00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Correct?\n\n566\n00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.533\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n567\n00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:10.425\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if you want to become\n\n568\n00:28:10.425 --> 00:28:11.510\na font creator\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n569\n00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.100\n&gt;&gt; And-\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome.\n\n570\n00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.761\n&gt;&gt; And put this into a what are known\nas font foundries, and there are, for\n\n571\n00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:20.728\ndesigners, I know one of my designer\nfriends for Christmas, her boss got her\n\n572\n00:28:20.728 --> 00:28:24.590\na set of new fonts, cuz you have to\npay for them because they're licensed.\n\n573\n00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.735\nJust like you're buying-\n&gt;&gt; Right, just like a book, or a movie, or\n\n574\n00:28:26.735 --> 00:28:27.640\nanything like that.\n\n575\n00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.934\nThey are proprietary and\nowned by someone who created them.\n\n576\n00:28:29.934 --> 00:28:31.420\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; It's creative content.\n\n577\n00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.232\n&gt;&gt; And so she bought her $200\nworth of new fonts and she's like,\n\n578\n00:28:34.232 --> 00:28:36.855\nit was Christmas, this amazing,\nit's the best gift ever.\n\n579\n00:28:36.855 --> 00:28:38.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was Christmas.\n\n580\n00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and those fonts have more\noptions available to them and\n\n581\n00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.010\nthe different subsets that they can do.\n\n582\n00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.740\nSo that's always a fun thing.\n\n583\n00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.560\n&gt;&gt; Seems like there's enough controversy\nbehind that to make me really wanna do it.\n\n584\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.195\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, there's also licenses.\n\n585\n00:28:52.195 --> 00:28:53.964\nThere's a big warning in In Design,\n\n586\n00:28:53.964 --> 00:28:56.987\nwhen you're ready to publish this\nout as a PDF or if it's like,\n\n587\n00:28:56.987 --> 00:29:00.540\nyou better make sure you have the licenses\nto actually to use these fonts.\n\n588\n00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.940\nBecause they-\n&gt;&gt; They'll come after you.\n\n589\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's intellectual property.\n\n590\n00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.226\n&gt;&gt; They're like the mafia,\nwhen it comes to that stuff.\n\n591\n00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:06.272\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n592\n00:29:06.272 --> 00:29:09.300\nthey have a guy with a tire\niron come to your house.\n\n593\n00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.427\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that's why we,\nI got off the rails a little bit here.\n\n594\n00:29:13.427 --> 00:29:17.461\nBut why we were talking about it was\ncoming into this font dialog box to get\n\n595\n00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:19.980\ninto the ways that you\ncan format your text.\n\n596\n00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.887\nAnd the underlying, and\nthere's that small CAPS.\n\n597\n00:29:21.887 --> 00:29:25.771\nSo that's something that is not available,\nthat's scary looking,\n\n598\n00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:29.300\ncuz I'm in the chiller font,\nI'm like why does that look so scary?\n\n599\n00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.055\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's awesome.\n\n600\n00:29:30.055 --> 00:29:30.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's go back to comic sans.\n\n601\n00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I can have this small caps, and\n\n602\n00:29:33.073 --> 00:29:34.765\nsome of the other things.\n\n603\n00:29:34.765 --> 00:29:38.160\nWe could have a double strike through,\nwhich we didn't have on that button.\n\n604\n00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.150\nSo we click ok and now you can see\nthat I have formatted that text.\n\n605\n00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.410\nA few more little things.\n\n606\n00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.190\nSo I know we're getting toward the end,\nyou're giving me the signal,\n\n607\n00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.760\nlet's wrap it up.\n\n608\n00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.534\nSo I wanted to go over letter spacing,\n\n609\n00:29:51.534 --> 00:29:55.795\nwhich is also technically\nknown as tracking and kerning.\n\n610\n00:29:55.795 --> 00:29:59.260\nThose are the technical terms of\nthe space between the letters.\n\n611\n00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.450\nTracking means the space\nbetween all of the letters.\n\n612\n00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:07.199\nAnd kerning is specifically between\ntwo letters that are measured in Ms,\n\n613\n00:30:07.199 --> 00:30:11.500\nwe talked about that measurement\nsystem in one of these episodes.\n\n614\n00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.186\nThey're starting to bleed together for\nme but I know we talked about Ms, and\n\n615\n00:30:15.186 --> 00:30:17.547\nit's just a measurement\nthat you see in fonts and\n\n616\n00:30:17.547 --> 00:30:20.770\nyou also see it in web design as well,\nlike that.\n\n617\n00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.750\nLet's go back and select this text.\n\n618\n00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.224\nWhere you can get to that letter spacing,\ntracking and\n\n619\n00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:31.050\nkerning is in that more button, the dialog\nbox launcher in the Advanced tab.\n\n620\n00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:35.125\nWhen we come over into this Advanced,\nnotice you have the spacing and\n\n621\n00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:35.875\nit does say kerning.\n\n622\n00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:39.765\nAnd even if you didn't know what kerning\nmeant, it does say four fonts and\n\n623\n00:30:39.765 --> 00:30:42.035\nyou can change all of\nthese different things.\n\n624\n00:30:42.035 --> 00:30:47.245\nThey don't have nearly the functionality\nas InDesign or Illustrator, to\n\n625\n00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:52.060\nwhere you can really get into formatting\nyour fonts a lot more than just Word.\n\n626\n00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.800\nBut it gives us enough, we have spacing,\n\n627\n00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.010\nexpanded, versus, condensed,\ndid you see how down in the preview.\n\n628\n00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.210\nLet me show you I went a little fast.\n\n629\n00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.310\nSo if I go with expanded it just gives\nmore space between all the letters\n\n630\n00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.760\nwhich is technically known as tracking.\n\n631\n00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.420\nYou could also do a scale of the font.\n\n632\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.950\nAnd you can see expanded by however many\npoints and if you just start bumping it up\n\n633\n00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:21.260\nit's just gonna go ahead and\nspace out the characters a little more.\n\n634\n00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.837\nSo you can kind of play around with\nthese advanced features of your font\n\n635\n00:31:25.837 --> 00:31:29.561\ndialogue box and\njust stretch your text out a little bit,\n\n636\n00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:32.522\ngive it a little breathing\nroom right there.\n\n637\n00:31:32.522 --> 00:31:37.922\nAnd the last thing would be our text\neffects where I could take this,\n\n638\n00:31:37.922 --> 00:31:42.240\nlet's take this and\nmake it pretty fancy in here.\n\n639\n00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.090\nThis is also kind of,\n\n640\n00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.960\nit's known as word art,\nif you go over to insert and word art.\n\n641\n00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.070\nYou can see the same gallery\nof what it can look like.\n\n642\n00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.562\nBut in Word Art, if you're actually just\nmaking it into its own text box, and\n\n643\n00:31:55.562 --> 00:31:56.875\nthen you can move it around.\n\n644\n00:31:56.875 --> 00:32:01.006\nBut the same formatting\nfeatures are available.\n\n645\n00:32:01.006 --> 00:32:05.560\nNow you have some of these galleries that\nhave the gradients and the outlines, but\n\n646\n00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.270\nthen you can break it down\ninto each one of these.\n\n647\n00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.864\nAnd I'm not gonna go over every single\none individually because what does\n\n648\n00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:13.690\na shadow do?\n\n649\n00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:17.508\nPuts a shadow on it, reflection, glow,\nand the nice thing is it gives you\n\n650\n00:32:17.508 --> 00:32:20.178\nthose previews as to what\nit's going to look like.\n\n651\n00:32:20.178 --> 00:32:24.750\nSo if I wanted my letters to glow,\nI have a minimum glow and\n\n652\n00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:28.540\na maximum glow, and\ndifferent colors, and it changes.\n\n653\n00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.957\nAnd these other ones, the number styles,\nligatures, and style sets,\n\n654\n00:32:31.957 --> 00:32:35.277\nthat's where you start getting into\ntypography a little bit deeper.\n\n655\n00:32:35.277 --> 00:32:37.176\nAnd if you're like,\nwell, what's a ligature?\n\n656\n00:32:37.176 --> 00:32:40.290\nLigatures are where it actually\ncreates two letters that combine into\n\n657\n00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.880\none character, like the F and\nthe I and F and\n\n658\n00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.680\nL's and certain fonts you can go ahead and\nhave that.\n\n659\n00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.300\nThis gets into more very stylistic\nspecifications where that's\n\n660\n00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.610\nwhere you want it to look like.\n\n661\n00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:57.220\nYou also have things known as glyphs,\nand swatches.\n\n662\n00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:02.270\nMore different, more terminology\nthat is associated with typography.\n\n663\n00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:07.262\nBut for now, we're just gonna go ahead and\njust show that it is available for\n\n664\n00:33:07.262 --> 00:33:08.354\ncertain fonts.\n\n665\n00:33:08.354 --> 00:33:12.260\nIf these are grayed out,\nit means a font doesn't support ligatures.\n\n666\n00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.790\nBack to that whole open type and\n\n667\n00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.890\ntrue type fonts, true type fonts\ndon't support all of this stuff.\n\n668\n00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:21.387\nOpen types can support all of these\ndifferent characters in there, and so\n\n669\n00:33:21.387 --> 00:33:24.443\nthat's why they have\na little bit of typography.\n\n670\n00:33:24.443 --> 00:33:29.200\nAnd the last one is I wanted to\nshow you about clearing formats.\n\n671\n00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.820\nThis is a big thing for me, because I\nget a lot of stuff where it's got so\n\n672\n00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:37.350\nmuch of this in a document,\nI just can't work with this.\n\n673\n00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:41.318\nI wanted to strip it all out,\nI just want the text as text.\n\n674\n00:33:41.318 --> 00:33:44.657\nSo I wanna get rid of all\nof the formatting, and\n\n675\n00:33:44.657 --> 00:33:47.440\nI can then format it how I need it.\n\n676\n00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.090\nSo I am gonna do, I'm going to scroll out\njust a little bit so you can see this.\n\n677\n00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:51.281\nI am gonna do a Ctrl+A.\n\n678\n00:33:51.281 --> 00:33:55.190\nCtrl+A is for select all, so\nI am gonna take all of this out.\n\n679\n00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.490\nTake away the highlighting,\ntake away the fonts.\n\n680\n00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:01.680\nYou click this button and it takes it\nall away and you're like wait, but\n\n681\n00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.040\nI said the highlights.\n\n682\n00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.970\nThis is one of those little kind\nof caveats of the highlight.\n\n683\n00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.630\nIt's cool, and it's nice to highlight, but\n\n684\n00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:12.570\nit doesn't clear when you clear\nthe formats, but that's okay.\n\n685\n00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:16.120\nIf you wanted to get rid of all\nthe highlighting, you just come back and\n\n686\n00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.060\nyou highlight it in no color.\n\n687\n00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.180\nYou wanna say stop the highlighting.\n\n688\n00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:26.770\nSo that's the only thing that\nthe clear format does not clear out.\n\n689\n00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:30.718\nJust take the highlights off by\nhighlighting it all with nothing.\n\n690\n00:34:30.718 --> 00:34:35.690\nSo just a little trick, little tidbit for\nyou because that always threw me off.\n\n691\n00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:36.831\nIt's a formatting,\nwhy isn't it going away?\n\n692\n00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:39.426\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So just clear it and\n\n693\n00:34:39.426 --> 00:34:42.758\nremove the formatting,\nremove the highlighting.\n\n694\n00:34:42.758 --> 00:34:44.819\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff on character formatting.\n\n695\n00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:47.310\nObviously that's something\nthat can be a lot of\n\n696\n00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.480\nfun if you do a lot of really\ncool stuff within your documents.\n\n697\n00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.600\nMake them jazzed up a little bit,\nhave a little fun with them, but\n\n698\n00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.120\nif you get off the rails you\ngot the clear formatting thing.\n\n699\n00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.410\nBecause I don't know about you,\nbut I tend to do that.\n\n700\n00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.906\nI tend to, if one's good, 1,000's better.\n\n701\n00:35:01.906 --> 00:35:03.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n702\n00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:07.100\nso thank goodness that clear formatting\nthing is there and we can tone it back,\n\n703\n00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.740\nbring it back to where it needs to be.\n\n704\n00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.650\nAll right, everyone,\nthanks for joining us, Vonne.\n\n705\n00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:11.890\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n706\n00:35:11.890 -->

I'm glad that we are here too.\n\n10\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.630\n[LAUGH] And we're gonna continue\non our journey in formatting.\n\n11\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.480\nWe talked about character formatting\nin the previous episode, and\n\n12\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.640\nnow we're gonna be talking\nabout paragraph formatting.\n\n13\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.830\nDifferent levels and this is where, hmm,\n\n14\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.590\nwhat do you think the formatting is\ngoing to be applied to there, Daniel?\n\n15\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.620\n&gt;&gt; Paragraphs maybe?\n\n16\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; Just guessing, shot in the dark.\n\n17\n00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.870\n&gt;&gt; Possibly, maybe you are correct.\n\n18\n00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.420\nIt is going to apply for\nthe entire paragraph\n\n19\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.070\nas opposed to the character formatting,\nwhich was applying to the words.\n\n20\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.960\nSo you are like, well the words\nare part of the paragraph but\n\n21\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.440\nthere's different levels.\n\n22\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.540\nCharacter level, paragraph level.\n\n23\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.620\nSo we're going to dive\ninto paragraph formatting.\n\n24\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.660\nI've actually already got a file\nopened up for us, ready to go.\n\n25\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.320\nIt is\n&gt;&gt; Aptly named.\n\n26\n00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.300\n&gt;&gt; Aptly, there you go.\n\n27\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.050\nThat's the name of the file and\nwe're going to go with it,\n\n28\n00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.210\nbecause we're going to do\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n29\n00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.590\nSo, when we are in\ncharacter level formatting,\n\n30\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.460\nwe needed to select all of the text for\nthe formatting to apply.\n\n31\n00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.920\nWhen you're in paragraph level formatting,\nyou can go ahead and select it.\n\n32\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.770\nIf it makes you feel better,\ngo right ahead.\n\n33\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.630\nBut all you need to do is have your\ncursor within the paragraph, and\n\n34\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.820\nthat level of formatting will apply to the\nwhole paragraph that your cursor is in.\n\n35\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.080\nNow if you're selecting\nmultiple paragraphs and\n\n36\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.260\nneed to, well then you would\nobviously select multiple paragraphs.\n\n37\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.030\nBut if it's just one or the other,\n\n38\n00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.260\nthat's where it makes a little bit of a\ndifference of selecting or not selecting.\n\n39\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.460\nNow, I do have my show high\ncharacter marks on here,\n\n40\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.710\nto where we can see\nthe change in each paragraph.\n\n41\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.030\nHere's a paragraph, here's a paragraph,\nhere's a paragraph.\n\n42\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.690\nWe've got all those, but\n\n43\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.850\nI wanted to throw in a couple ones\nthat have some line breaks in them.\n\n44\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.590\nThis little character right here.\n\n45\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.930\nWhile we see it as maybe an enter mark,\nit's not an enter, it is a line break.\n\n46\n00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.920\nAnd we talked about this in\nthe input text episode in\n\n47\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.040\nreally clarifying what that means,\nsoft returns versus hard returns.\n\n48\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.390\nAnd when you apply\nparagraph level formatting,\n\n49\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.000\nIt will apply to the whole paragraph, not\nparts of it, even if you wanted it to be.\n\n50\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.210\nSo if you wanted this text to be\nformatted differently than this text\n\n51\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.730\nin the paragraph level,\n\n52\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.140\nyou would need to make sure that you had\na Enter mark there and not a line break.\n\n53\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.350\nAnd you know, there is actually\nsomething that just popped up that I\n\n54\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.510\nactually kind of forgot to mention\nin the character level formatting.\n\n55\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.370\nLet me select that text again,\nthere is this little guy, and\n\n56\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.739\nI know I've covered it in\na couple of the episodes.\n\n57\n00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.290\n&gt;&gt; Underlining [LAUGH].\n\n58\n00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes so we have the Mini tool bar\nthat comes up to be able to quickly\n\n59\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.990\ncome up and format the selected text.\n\n60\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.720\nSo we could go ahead and\ndo things like bold and underline.\n\n61\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.130\nAnd I do have a couple of those paragraph\nlevel formattings that is available right\n\n62\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.370\nnow to me, with our bullets and numbering.\n\n63\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.010\nThat is a paragraph level\nformatting that we will get into.\n\n64\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.950\nBut I've actually separated that out\ninto an entire separate episode.\n\n65\n00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.630\nNamed lists, because there were lots\nof talk about with list formattings.\n\n66\n00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.900\nSo I wanted to keep that separate.\n\n67\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.500\nOkay, perfect, so\nmini tool bar, select effect or\n\n68\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.000\njust put your cursor into the paragraph\nthat you want to apply the formatting.\n\n69\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.410\nOne of the first things,\nthe first item that we address in\n\n70\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.400\nparagraph level formatting is alignment,\nthis is also known as justification.\n\n71\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.090\nNow a lot of times when people hear\njustification they think justified text,\n\n72\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.800\nyes, I can totally see the correlation.\n\n73\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.650\nAlignment or justification,\nthose are both words that\n\n74\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.988\ncan be used to talk about left aligned,\ncenter aligned or right aligned.\n\n75\n00:04:12.988 --> 00:04:16.930\nLeft-justified, center-justified,\nright-justified.\n\n76\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.180\nCursor is in the paragraph that I want,\nthere is the Enter mark,\n\n77\n00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.420\nthe little buttons up here of Left,\nCenter, Right, and Justified.\n\n78\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.100\nSince this is a single line paragraph,\n\n79\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.310\nthe justified's not going\nto make any difference.\n\n80\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.070\nBut the center will.\n\n81\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.030\nI went ahead and centered it.\n\n82\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.000\nCentering it where?\n\n83\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.930\nBetween the margins,\nbecause this is a paragraph,\n\n84\n00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.270\nit is on the page that has margins.\n\n85\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.480\nIt's going to go in\nthe middle of the page.\n\n86\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.630\nIf I click the right,\nit's gonna go to the right of the margin.\n\n87\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.090\nNotice it doesn't go all the way\nto the edge of the page,\n\n88\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.030\ncuz that's not how it really\nworks in Word, you have Margins.\n\n89\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.030\nSo there's the margin and that's what I\nwanted to hit towards, and that where,\n\n90\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.660\nthat's what we got.\n\n91\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.690\nDoing the whole, whole paragraph\nformatting, if I selected this text,\n\n92\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.200\nmade that center, the entire paragraph\nis going to become centered.\n\n93\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.380\nOr right or left, because that's the whole\nidea of paragraphical formatting.\n\n94\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.230\nLet's go to this paragraph down here,\nthe third one.\n\n95\n00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.140\nI guess this would be the fourth one,\ntechnically.\n\n96\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.600\nCursor in the paragraph,\nclick the Justify.\n\n97\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.250\nJustify is where text goes all\nthe way to the ends of the margins.\n\n98\n00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.150\nLet's take another one.\n\n99\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.610\nWhoops, you know what I just did?\n\n100\n00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.010\nI scrolled when my ribbon was activated,\nand so\n\n101\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.010\nit's actually just scrolling\nthrough the tabs of the ribbon.\n\n102\n00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.580\n&gt;&gt; That's a nice little trick to know.\n\n103\n00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.840\n&gt;&gt; It is, and\nit's a trick that always throws me.\n\n104\n00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.510\nBecause I'm like, no,\nI wanted to scroll in the document.\n\n105\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.920\nBut I'm not following my own Rules.\n\n106\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Be in the place you wanna be.\n\n107\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.710\nYes.\n\n108\n00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.945\nThere you go, words of wisdom.\n\n109\n00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:58.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Be in a place you wanna be.\n\n110\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.650\nIf I come over to this paragraph,\nyou can really see it here.\n\n111\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.930\nThere's something known in topography or\ntype settings.\n\n112\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.050\nThis is known as the right rag, and\nactually a little bit is behind my head.\n\n113\n00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.460\nI can just scroll up a little bit.\n\n114\n00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.000\nSo I can go ahead and see there.\n\n115\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.050\nsee that this right side, it's kind of\njagged, it's ragged, and so the right rag.\n\n116\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.740\nAnd depending on your different\nformatting options in the paragraph\n\n117\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.040\nlevel sometimes that\nright rag is too much.\n\n118\n00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.460\nIt's too jagged.\n\n119\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.720\nSo there's things you can do with\nhyphenations, for one thing, which we will\n\n120\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.790\naddress towards the end of this episodes,\nor you could make it fully justified text.\n\n121\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.870\nIt's justified text with a left, a first,\n\n122\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.470\nwait, Left last line formatting.\n\n123\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.900\nThat is the only option you get in Word,\nbut if you were in\n\n124\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.980\nInDesign you have options of how it\ntreats that last line differently.\n\n125\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.570\nSo, if I click on the justified\nnotice that now all the text goes\n\n126\n00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.060\nto the very left hand side of the margin\nand the right hand side of the margin.\n\n127\n00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.420\n&gt;&gt; You have just changed my life forever,\nbecause the OCD part of my brain\n\n128\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.300\nhates that there is that ragged edge.\n\n129\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.940\nI hate that.\n\n130\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.150\nI can't stand it and\nnow I can make it blocks of text.\n\n131\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.890\nThis is gonna be on all\nof my stuff from now on.\n\n132\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm so glad I could help\nyou with that, because I know those\n\n133\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.580\nlittle things that just kind of-\n&gt;&gt; The splinters in your mind that, yeah-\n\n134\n00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so and\n\n135\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.930\nthe nice thing is that Word treats your\njustified text Pretty decently in a sense.\n\n136\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.890\nBecause if you have other programs,\n\n137\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.478\nsometimes it will stretch out all the\nletters and the spacing gets all weird.\n\n138\n00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:45.440\nSo it does a really good job of like\ninternally making the spacing look nice.\n\n139\n00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.883\nYou know when you see a lot of these,\nif you read newspapers.\n\n140\n00:07:49.883 --> 00:07:54.090\nNow, I've, talking about today,\nI love old newspapers.\n\n141\n00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.848\nMy dad would read it everyday and\nmy grandfather bring them on a Sunday and\n\n142\n00:07:57.848 --> 00:08:01.172\nwe want Look at the comments together,\nso I still have that, but\n\n143\n00:08:01.172 --> 00:08:04.230\nmaybe I'm also showing\nmy age a little bit too.\n\n144\n00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.880\nBut in newspapers, you can see that\nthis is where you see this all the time,\n\n145\n00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.550\nand that one sentence that has like,\nthree letters, or three words,\n\n146\n00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.580\nbut they're spaced so far out apart,\nbecause it's gotta stay in the justified.\n\n147\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.640\nYeah, so that's just one of those things.\n\n148\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.120\nBut now we know what this is,\nand how you could do it.\n\n149\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.520\nAnd I'm glad I could help you out.\n\n150\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.365\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n151\n00:08:24.365 --> 00:08:29.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So the alignment and difference\nbetween hard returns and soft returns.\n\n152\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.050\nLet's go on to, one of my favorites,\nline and paragraph spacing.\n\n153\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:40.830\nThis is our technical words known as\nleading, and space before and space after.\n\n154\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.430\nYou're probably not gonna see\nthe word leading anywhere in Word,\n\n155\n00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.170\nI might have seen it somewhere down, like,\n\n156\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:53.335\nin like a dialogue box, but\nthe technical term of line spacing.\n\n157\n00:08:53.335 --> 00:08:55.140\nDouble-space.\n\n158\n00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.190\nNow as soon as I say that,\npeople are like, I know what that is.\n\n159\n00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.210\nBecause a lot of times in school, remember\nwhat our papers were always required to\n\n160\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.130\nhave the 8-1/2 x 11,\nten-point font, double-spaced, so\n\n161\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:10.090\nthey can go ahead and then write above\neach line of all your mistakes, and\n\n162\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:15.565\ntake that red pencil or red pen out and-\n&gt;&gt; And murder your work, your life's work.\n\n163\n00:09:15.565 --> 00:09:17.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bleed all over it.\n\n164\n00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and supposedly I guess\nthey went towards green pens.\n\n165\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.640\n&gt;&gt; Did they really?\n\n166\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\ncuz green has a different connotation.\n\n167\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.315\n&gt;&gt; Calming effect.\n\n168\n00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:25.050\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n169\n00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.410\nGreen is positive, go.\n\n170\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.015\nGo back and\nchange everything that you just wrote.\n\n171\n00:09:30.015 --> 00:09:32.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No wonder red lights make me angry.\n\n172\n00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.020\nHm.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, that's.\n\n173\n00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.531\nThere's a whole psychology around colors,\nlet's not get me off track.\n\n174\n00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:40.513\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But supposedly I've heard that a lot of\n\n175\n00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:45.940\nteachers going towards green pencils or\npens for editing rather than red,\n\n176\n00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.920\nbut back to why we're\neven talking about this.\n\n177\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.960\nLine spacing and\nparagraph spacing as well.\n\n178\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.760\nI will select this paragraph and\n\n179\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.100\nI'm just selecting it by\nputting the cursor in here.\n\n180\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.400\nThis button, next to the alignments,\nis the line and\n\n181\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.040\nparagraph spacing and\nthe numbers 1.0, 1.5, 2,\n\n182\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.149\nyou get the idea to where if I hover,\nthe preview happens here.\n\n183\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.471\nThat is making more\nspace between each line.\n\n184\n00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:20.430\nThat's the leading, or line spacing.\n\n185\n00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.340\nI'm going to keep it back at one for now.\n\n186\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.110\nNotice that it's a little\nbit smaller than this one.\n\n187\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.250\nSee that?\n\n188\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.580\nLet me redo.\n\n189\n00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.490\nIt's tiny.\n\n190\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.130\n&gt;&gt; Just a bit\n&gt;&gt; Just a bit.\n\n191\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.260\nOkay, why?\n\n192\n00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.430\nWell, remember I said something in\nthe character formatting, if you watch,\n\n193\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.320\nI said about the normal style.\n\n194\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.590\nThe normal is the default style\nthat everything in Word is created,\n\n195\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.240\nif you start typing,\nyou're typing in the normal style.\n\n196\n00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.570\nThe normal style has,\nI believe it's 1.08 line.\n\n197\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.290\nYou don't have to know\nwhere I'm going right now.\n\n198\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.080\nYes, it is 1.08 line spacing.\n\n199\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:05.195\nSo it's not 1.0, it's just that one\nhundredth of an inch, I believe.\n\n200\n00:11:05.195 --> 00:11:09.180\nOr whatever measurement system it is\nworking in, which is usually points.\n\n201\n00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.580\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, probably points.\n\n202\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.360\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say points, but\nthen as soon as I said it,\n\n203\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.660\nit was probably not gonna be that,\nbecause it's Word.\n\n204\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.000\n[LAUGH] Not that it's bad,\n\n205\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.410\nremember I work in other programs that\nwork it a little bit differently.\n\n206\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.280\nSo you can see that it has a specific\nline spacing of multiple lines at 1.8\n\n207\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.150\nwith space after eight points,\nthat's another big one.\n\n208\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.360\nWhen you start typing and you hit enter,\ndo you see there is specific space\n\n209\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.780\nbetween this paragraph and this paragraph,\nthe third and the fourth paragraph.\n\n210\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.840\nI love this.\n\n211\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.320\nThis is something that warms\nmy heart as a type setter.\n\n212\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.530\nBut for some people that have been\nworking in Word for a long time,\n\n213\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.400\nI believe they started this in 2003,\nmaybe in 2007,\n\n214\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.270\nto where they went to the normal style to\ndefault to have space after paragraph.\n\n215\n00:11:59.525 --> 00:12:02.815\nWell, back in the day, for\nyou to get space between the paragraphs,\n\n216\n00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:03.905\nyou did the Enter+Enter.\n\n217\n00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:05.401\nWhen we talked about the Find+Replace?\n\n218\n00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:05.966\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know it will take some time, but\n\n229\n00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:31.945\nyou will.\nAnd that's what the normal style is, so\n\n230\n00:12:31.945 --> 00:12:36.327\nwhen I, back to why we started talking\nabout this, is when I went to this\n\n231\n00:12:36.327 --> 00:12:40.420\nparagraph here and changed it to a single,\na 1.0 line spacing,\n\n232\n00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.050\nit did kind of like, condense it down\na little bit because of that styling.\n\n233\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:51.480\nNow, if you do have paragraphs that you\nwanted to change the space between them.\n\n234\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.300\nLike, maybe I don't want so much space\nbetween each change in paragraphs.\n\n235\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.100\nYou can change that.\n\n236\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.960\nIf I select, I'm going to select\nmultiple paragraphs here.\n\n237\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.940\nI'm going to go all the way down to here,\nmaybe that one so\n\n238\n00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.240\nwe can see it on one screenshot.\n\n239\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.830\nAll the way at the bottom,\nremove space after.\n\n240\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.460\nAnd a lot of times I show people this, and\nthey're like, that's exactly what I need!\n\n241\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.030\nI'm like okay, there more.\n\n242\n00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.320\n&gt;&gt; You're wrong.

00:13:24.270\nThat's okay.\n\n245\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.120\nThe remove space asterisk,\ntaking off the space.\n\n246\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.310\nAdd the space before, now this is where\nyou have space before and space after.\n\n247\n00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.140\nYou can have both, but think about it.\n\n248\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.500\nIf there's a change between\nparagraph one and paragraph two,\n\n249\n00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:44.060\nand paragraph one has a space after, and\nthis paragraph two has space before.\n\n250\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.010\nYou're basically doubling up the space.\n\n251\n00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:46.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n252\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.820\n&gt;&gt; I don't, me personally,\n\n253\n00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.610\nI don't choose any of my\nformattings to have space before.\n\n254\n00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.180\nBecause we go down, we don't go up.\n\n255\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.450\nSo I always do after.\n\n256\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.880\nIt's always after as\nthe progression of the page.\n\n257\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.130\nSo just a personal preference.\n\n258\n00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.130\nBut you can have both.\n\n259\n00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.930\nAnd some of the styles that we're going\nto get into when we get into the styles\n\n260\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.820\nepisode, they might have\nsome space before as part\n\n261\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.580\nof the formatting that\nis making up that style.\n\n262\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.390\nAnd a lot of times, I'll get rid of it and\nreformat the way I want it to.\n\n263\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.800\nBut that's what it means, before or\nafter and you can have both.\n\n264\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.440\nBut you can also go into\nthe line spacing options.\n\n265\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.486\nWhen I go into the line spacing options,\n\n266\n00:14:34.486 --> 00:14:37.990\nhere you have the spacing of before and\nafter.\n\n267\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.240\nNow why are they grayed out?\n\n268\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.090\nRemember when I changed the line spacing\nof this particular paragraph right\n\n269\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.040\nover here?\n\n270\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.730\nWell, now they're different.\n\n271\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.140\nI've selected multiple paragraphs\nthat have multiple settings.\n\n272\n00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.440\nAnd so it's not gonna give me the 1.08 or\n\n273\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.740\nthe lines spacing it multiples\nwith that particular measurement.\n\n274\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.060\nBecause it doesn't see them the same.\n\n275\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:06.950\nSo that's why these fields are grayed out,\nand why the after is not the same either.\n\n276\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.670\nBut if I go through here and\nsay, how many spaces after?\n\n277\n00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.560\nI'm gonna do this in 24 points.\n\n278\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.560\nI'm just using the bumpy\nbuttons up there and\n\n279\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.920\nthey will go, as you can see,\nin increments of six.\n\n280\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.580\nSix points, 12 points.\n\n281\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.660\nI don't know if you remember me saying\n\n282\n00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.770\nin the character there\nis six points in a pica.\n\n283\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n284\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.650\nthat's why they measured it this way.\n\n285\n00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.970\nSo if I bump this up to, let's go with 18,\n\n286\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.460\nand let's change the line\nspacing to single.\n\n287\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.120\nAnd at one.\n\n288\n00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.503\nSo I will actually,\nit puts to multiples, so\n\n289\n00:15:38.503 --> 00:15:40.840\nwhy don't we go ahead and\nmake that single.\n\n290\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.581\nSo single line spacing,\n18 point active paragraphs and\n\n291\n00:15:45.581 --> 00:15:51.385\nwatch what happens is that now the space\nhappens between each paragraph\n\n292\n00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:56.415\nafter each paragraph, and\nthe lines have single spacing So,\n\n293\n00:15:56.415 --> 00:16:01.443\nit's part of Word's DNA, and\nit can drive you kind of crazy if\n\n294\n00:16:01.443 --> 00:16:06.376\nyou don't really know what's\nkind of going on by default and\n\n295\n00:16:06.376 --> 00:16:11.019\nthat there is a style that is\ncontrolling that spacing and\n\n296\n00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:14.927\nif you wanted to get rid of it or\nnot get rid of it.\n\n297\n00:16:14.927 --> 00:16:15.985\nIt's up to you.\n\n298\n00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:20.180\nNow you also have some stuff\nover here on the Design tab.\n\n299\n00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.755\nWhen we get into the style sets and the\nthemes, we'll come back over to this tab,\n\n300\n00:16:23.755 --> 00:16:25.346\nand you can see it a little bit more.\n\n301\n00:16:25.346 --> 00:16:28.390\nBut I wanted to throw over here\nlike the paragraph spacing.\n\n302\n00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.555\nAnd this is another place where I tell\npeople once they find that I can get rid\n\n303\n00:16:32.555 --> 00:16:36.492\nof all that space between the paragraphs,\nthat makes my life a lot easier.\n\n304\n00:16:36.492 --> 00:16:39.780\nSo I could go in here to\nNo Paragraph Spacing.\n\n305\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.500\nNow, because I went and\nI locally formatted,\n\n306\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.810\nI selected these other paragraphs and\nthen made some changes.\n\n307\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.248\nThat's why it's not doing it for\nthe entire document, but\n\n308\n00:16:51.248 --> 00:16:55.663\nif I had gone back to and, even though\nyou, whoops, hello, okay, sorry.\n\n309\n00:16:55.663 --> 00:16:57.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just jumped down.\n\n310\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.369\nYou don't know exactly what I'm doing now,\nbut\n\n311\n00:17:00.369 --> 00:17:02.787\nI'm throwing it all back\ninto the normal style.\n\n312\n00:17:02.787 --> 00:17:04.541\nJust go, uh-huh, that sounds great.\n\n313\n00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:06.846\nI'm putting it back to\nits default setting.\n\n314\n00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:07.645\n&gt;&gt; That sounds great, Vonne.\n\n315\n00:17:07.645 --> 00:17:08.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n316\n00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:13.805\nIf I come back over here to Design,\nnow you'll be able to see if I\n\n317\n00:17:13.805 --> 00:17:18.742\ncome over here to paragraph spacing,\nyou see how I can change it\n\n318\n00:17:18.742 --> 00:17:23.704\non the fly of making those\ndifferent types of spacing options.\n\n319\n00:17:23.704 --> 00:17:28.600\nAnd if I hover over it,\nlike if I go to Height, it has before,\n\n320\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.208\n0 points, before space,\nbefore paragraphs, after,\n\n321\n00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:36.410\n6 points, line spacing, 1.15.\n\n322\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.990\nAnd it's allowing me to\ndo this because I have\n\n323\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.760\ncleared out all of the local overrides.\n\n324\n00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.512\nYou will hear me say this a lot in styles.\n\n325\n00:17:44.512 --> 00:17:47.944\nAny time that you select text and\nmake any type of formatting,\n\n326\n00:17:47.944 --> 00:17:52.102\nwhether it be character level formatting\nor paragraph level formatting,\n\n327\n00:17:52.102 --> 00:17:55.339\nyou are overriding the default style,\nthe normal style.\n\n328\n00:17:55.339 --> 00:17:56.700\nAnd so it remembers and\n\n329\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.252\nthere's always this saying that I\nhave of local overrides global.\n\n330\n00:18:01.252 --> 00:18:03.397\nAnything that's closer\nto it is going to win,\n\n331\n00:18:03.397 --> 00:18:05.877\nrather than something that's\nfurther away from it.\n\n332\n00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:10.129\nSo here I'm doing a global formatting or\nglobal setting, but if there is something\n\n333\n00:18:10.129 --> 00:18:14.198\nattached to that text that's not letting\nme do it, it will stay, just like that\n\n334\n00:18:14.198 --> 00:18:18.115\nexample I saw before where it wasn't\nletting me do those other paragraphs.\n\n335\n00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:20.571\nSo just keep that in mind,\nif you're coming to here and be like,\n\n336\n00:18:20.571 --> 00:18:21.346\nit's not working.\n\n337\n00:18:21.346 --> 00:18:24.103\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's probably because\n\n338\n00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:29.285\nsomething in the document has been\noverridden with those styles.\n\n339\n00:18:29.285 --> 00:18:31.885\nSo, how many times have I\nsaid styles in this episode?\n\n340\n00:18:31.885 --> 00:18:35.575\nThat means you need to watch the styles\nepisode [LAUGH], it's very important.\n\n341\n00:18:35.575 --> 00:18:37.390\nSo, all right,\n\n342\n00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.550\nlet's move onto a couple other things that\nwe can do in paragraph level formatting.\n\n343\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.130\nLet's go to indents,\nlet's take a paragraph.\n\n344\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.884\nWhat does an indent mean?\n\n345\n00:18:46.884 --> 00:18:47.634\nIt indents.\n\n346\n00:18:47.634 --> 00:18:49.804\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is something like,\n\n347\n00:18:49.804 --> 00:18:53.257\nI've been finding it interesting\nthat they aren't there by default,\n\n348\n00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:56.740\nbecause I was taught as a kid,\nyou always indent a paragraph.\n\n349\n00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.770\nSo that everyone knows what\nthe beginning of your paragraph is.\n\n350\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.250\nNot that it would be that difficult,\n\n351\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.885\nbut the indention was like\na stylistic thing, I guess.\n\n352\n00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:05.830\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, you would hit that Tab\nkey before you start typing,\n\n353\n00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.410\nyes, to indent your paragraph,\nthe first line indent.\n\n354\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.254\nI was taught the same way.\n\n355\n00:19:11.254 --> 00:19:16.251\nI've heard now that just like\nthe whole one space versus two spaces,\n\n356\n00:19:16.251 --> 00:19:20.400\nit's more of a preference to\ndo it fully left justified.\n\n357\n00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.924\nThat first line is always gonna\nbe flush with the left margin.\n\n358\n00:19:22.924 --> 00:19:26.556\n&gt;&gt; I wonder if that came out from\njust electronic format for typing.\n\n359\n00:19:26.556 --> 00:19:28.540\nThat would be my guess that\nthat's where that came from.\n\n360\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.180\nOr we lost that, should I say.\n\n361\n00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.510\n&gt;&gt; I think that's where it goes towards.\n\n362\n00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:37.127\nAt least some of the articles and\nthe things I've read about it,\n\n363\n00:19:37.127 --> 00:19:41.572\nit's yes, the way of computers\nhas made all those things that\n\n364\n00:19:41.572 --> 00:19:44.067\nolder-ish people [LAUGH] like me.\n\n365\n00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:45.291\nWhen we were taught one way,\n\n366\n00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:48.050\npeople in school are not being\ntaught necessarily the same way.\n\n367\n00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.718\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But I also don't have any children in\n\n368\n00:19:49.718 --> 00:19:51.010\nschool, so I really don't know.\n\n369\n00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:58.054\n[LAUGH] So we have the indents, first line\nversus the entire left or right indent.\n\n370\n00:19:58.054 --> 00:20:02.762\nAnd I remember writing term papers and\nif you were quoting something of more than\n\n371\n00:20:02.762 --> 00:20:07.199\nfour lines, that you had to indent it\non each side, you remember that one?\n\n372\n00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:10.000\nMm-hm, so we have that here.\n\n373\n00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.821\nI'm in the paragraph, I think the easiest\nway to do it is in your ruler,\n\n374\n00:20:15.821 --> 00:20:21.460\nyou do have up here, you have\nan increase indent or decrease indent.\n\n375\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.130\nSo if I have my cursor,\nI'll select the paragraph for\n\n376\n00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.650\nyou just to make it a little easier for\nyou to see.\n\n377\n00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:32.990\nI can bump that in, and it just takes\nin the indent to where in each kind of\n\n378\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.310\nincrement or I can outdent it or\ndecrease the indent.\n\n379\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.480\nBut there is some other things\nthat you can do on the ruler.\n\n380\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.290\nIt's kind of small, but\ndo you see that there's this ruler here?\n\n381\n00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.931\nThere is a top triangle pointing down,\nwhich indicates your first line indent.\n\n382\n00:20:48.931 --> 00:20:53.758\nYou have a white triangle pointing up,\nthat is your hanging indent.\n\n383\n00:20:53.758 --> 00:20:57.373\nAnd then you have the rectangle\nunderneath, which is your left indent,\n\n384\n00:20:57.373 --> 00:20:58.710\nthe whole thing.\n\n385\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.420\nThe rectangle moves both\ntriangles together.\n\n386\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.515\nIf you take either triangle by itself,\n\n387\n00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:09.150\nyou can move those independently because\nyou're talking about the whole paragraph,\n\n388\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.960\nthe whole indent versus how\nit treats the first line.\n\n389\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.765\nLet's do this, and so I can show you.\n\n390\n00:21:15.765 --> 00:21:21.157\nYou take the rectangle, move the whole\nthing in, and I can then indent that\n\n391\n00:21:21.157 --> 00:21:27.450\nparagraph to whatever level or however\nmuch I want it to indent to the left.\n\n392\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.730\nIf I take the top triangle and\nthese are very close together, so\n\n393\n00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.240\nyou gotta be very careful\nabout where your cursor is.\n\n394\n00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.397\nTop triangle, click and hold the first\nsign, that's what we used to do, right?\n\n395\n00:21:36.397 --> 00:21:37.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n396\n00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.560\n&gt;&gt; So the first line would need\nto go ahead and be indented.\n\n397\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.630\nOr you could do what I\ncall a first line outdent,\n\n398\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.130\nwhich is really what we were taught in\nschool is that this is a hanging indent.\n\n399\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:54.157\nTo where the first line is out further\nthan the rest of the entire left indent.\n\n400\n00:21:54.157 --> 00:21:56.402\nNow if I take the rectangle and move this,\n\n401\n00:21:56.402 --> 00:21:59.740\nyou see how now they're\nnow both moving together?\n\n402\n00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.070\nSo you can move them independently or\ntogether.\n\n403\n00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.690\nAnd how it treats that first line\nseparate than the whole thing.\n\n404\n00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.770\nAnd that's how you can control\nthe indents on your paragraph.\n\n405\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.180\nI have one selected.\n\n406\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.560\nThe other thing you could do on the ruler\nis then over here, let's move over,\n\n407\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.240\nlet me scroll out and\n\n408\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.650\nthen zoom in a little bit, is the right\nindent, that little guy right there.\n\n409\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.980\nTake that triangle,\nmove it in, pull it in there.\n\n410\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.260\nAnd then I could go ahead and\npull the right indent in there.\n\n411\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.280\nThe thing you do need to be a little\ncareful about when you're working with\n\n412\n00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:39.350\nthe ruler is getting into this area,\nbetween the white and the gray.\n\n413\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:43.636\nWhen you get the two arrows pointing left\nand right, that means you're actually\n\n414\n00:22:43.636 --> 00:22:47.811\nchanging your margin, which is different\nthan paragraph level formatting.\n\n415\n00:22:47.811 --> 00:22:52.140\nNow you get into page formatting and\npage layout, so just be careful.\n\n416\n00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.255\nIt's a cute little trick if you\ndo wanna change your margins, but\n\n417\n00:22:55.255 --> 00:22:56.965\nwe're not at that level right now.\n\n418\n00:22:56.965 --> 00:23:00.047\nAnd so\njust be aware that you don't wanna get\n\n419\n00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:05.810\nthe two-pointed arrows on your\nmargins when you're on this ruler.\n\n420\n00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.400\nLet me go ahead and\nzoom back out a little bit.\n\n421\n00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.780\nAnd this is for\neach paragraph level of formatting.\n\n422\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.470\nAnd that's something like if I came down\nhere to this last paragraph, notice, look\n\n423\n00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.850\nat how the buttons, or the little things\non the rulers, they moved, didn't they?\n\n424\n00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.410\nBecause I'm in a different paragraph.\n\n425\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.864\nEvery paragraph has an independent\nformatting from the other paragraph.\n\n426\n00:23:25.864 --> 00:23:31.561\nIf I take this and I move this left indent\nin, this is the last paragraph that I\n\n427\n00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:37.721\nhave, I click after the word evidence,\nand I hit Enter, I'm still indented in.\n\n428\n00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:42.517\nAnd I've done this myself, and I've had\npeople that come to me, they're like,\n\n429\n00:23:42.517 --> 00:23:45.450\nI can't get back to the left\nhand side of the page.\n\n430\n00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.752\nI'm like, what?\n\n431\n00:23:46.752 --> 00:23:49.540\nYou formatted it or\nhad a paragraph that had an indent,\n\n432\n00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.630\nkept hitting Enter and kept going,\nand it kept doing it, and\n\n433\n00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.750\nyou didn't even realize that\nthere was a ruler there.\n\n434\n00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.765\nBut you could bring it back out.\n\n435\n00:23:57.765 --> 00:24:01.376\nAnd so if I needed that to come\nback out you just take that and\n\n436\n00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:04.056\nmove that on over so\nyou can get it back out.\n\n437\n00:24:04.056 --> 00:24:08.970\nSo that whole way try not to\nformat as you go, it's hard,\n\n438\n00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.390\nI've had to train myself to not do it.\n\n439\n00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:17.129\nJust get the text in, come back and\nformat afterwards so you don't have that\n\n440\n00:24:17.129 --> 00:24:21.441\nkind of legacy if you wanna say as\nyou keep going through everything.\n\n441\n00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:25.858\nSo all of the different things\nthat you can do on your ruler\n\n442\n00:24:25.858 --> 00:24:28.627\nwith the indents in the first line.\n\n443\n00:24:28.627 --> 00:24:30.383\nAnd it's all about what you select,\n\n444\n00:24:30.383 --> 00:24:34.122\ncuz if I wanted all of these paragraphs to\nhave that first line indent that we had\n\n445\n00:24:34.122 --> 00:24:37.120\ntalked about in the old school\ndays you take all of them.\n\n446\n00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.017\nYou put that first line and\nthen you go ahead and move it in.\n\n447\n00:24:40.017 --> 00:24:42.896\nSo what, you wanna have it to where\nit is already formatted that way?\n\n448\n00:24:42.896 --> 00:24:47.463\nYou select it all and\nput it back to the new school way and\n\n449\n00:24:47.463 --> 00:24:49.762\nyou move on with your life.\n\n450\n00:24:49.762 --> 00:24:52.351\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Few more things before we\n\n451\n00:24:52.351 --> 00:24:54.970\nend this episode, a few others.\n\n452\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.871\nLet's go back here to the paragraph\nformatting at the top.\n\n453\n00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:04.130\nYou have your shading and borders, this\nwill apply for the entire paragraph again.\n\n454\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.316\nIf I take this,\nit kinda like highlighting but it is not.\n\n455\n00:25:08.316 --> 00:25:10.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's the purpose of it?\n\n456\n00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.444\n&gt;&gt; It's just to change the background\ncolor of that paragraph.\n\n457\n00:25:13.444 --> 00:25:14.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n458\n00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda why\nwould we highlight the text?\n\n459\n00:25:17.147 --> 00:25:21.420\nNow one way that I can differentiate\nwhat the highlighter versus the shading\n\n460\n00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.029\nwould do.\n\n461\n00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:26.110\nIf I selected this text the highlighter\nonly puts the coloring,\n\n462\n00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.949\nif you wanna say, the shading behind it or\non top of it whichever we wanna go,\n\n463\n00:25:30.949 --> 00:25:31.826\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n464\n00:25:31.826 --> 00:25:35.110\n&gt;&gt; On the characters, just the characters.\n\n465\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:39.080\nIf I take and do the shading, notice\nthe shading, well I gotta pick a color for\n\n466\n00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.620\nyou to see it, see the shading\ngoes across the whole thing.\n\n467\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.200\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n468\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.020\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n469\n00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.715\nAnd I believe if I started changing\nmy spacing it might go ahead and\n\n470\n00:25:47.715 --> 00:25:50.730\nactually apply to where\nall the spacing applies.\n\n471\n00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.993\nActually nope, I take that back.\n\n472\n00:25:51.993 --> 00:25:54.700\nBecause I can see\nthe spacing is not working.\n\n473\n00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.396\nBut it does go across\nthe entire paragraph.\n\n474\n00:25:56.396 --> 00:25:57.878\nSo if I did that here and\n\n475\n00:25:57.878 --> 00:26:02.102\nchose the yellow you see how it\nis highlighting all of that area.\n\n476\n00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:06.031\nAnd now when I actually get to other\ncolors now I can see that the shading is\n\n477\n00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:10.220\nkinda getting below because I have\na different color on the next one.\n\n478\n00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.637\nIt does accommodate for the space after.\n\n479\n00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:16.174\nYou just have to have something after it,\nif that make sense, yeah.\n\n480\n00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:17.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It make sense?\n\n481\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.020\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n482\n00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.170\nthat's what the shading does.\n\n483\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:24.995\nYou also have the borders, so\nthe borders would be for the paragraph.\n\n484\n00:26:24.995 --> 00:26:28.724\nI'm selected in this first paragraph\nby the way and I'll select it so\n\n485\n00:26:28.724 --> 00:26:29.570\nyou can see it.\n\n486\n00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.777\nI can add a bottom border.\n\n487\n00:26:30.777 --> 00:26:35.419\nI can add an all border so it just goes\nahead and puts it all the way around,\n\n488\n00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:36.420\nleft, right.\n\n489\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.975\nSo some different stylistic\nthings that you could do here.\n\n490\n00:26:39.975 --> 00:26:43.555\nLet's go with all borders cause this\ndoes give it a little bit of a different\n\n491\n00:26:43.555 --> 00:26:46.495\npiece of flair,\nif you wanna say how I want this to look?\n\n492\n00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.010\nI don't like the border color or\nthe border thickness with the text or\n\n493\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.560\nthe paragraph selected really.\n\n494\n00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.197\nI can come into the borders and\nshading dialog box.\n\n495\n00:26:57.197 --> 00:27:01.355\nAnd then this gets into how I\ncan preview view it over here.\n\n496\n00:27:01.355 --> 00:27:05.435\nHere are my borders,\nI can pick which one I would want.\n\n497\n00:27:05.435 --> 00:27:09.100\nLet's say I'll go with the box, and then\nmaybe I can go with like, let's go for\n\n498\n00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:09.613\nsome fun.\n\n499\n00:27:09.613 --> 00:27:15.110\nLet's see we got a double underline,\nand then I will choose a color.\n\n500\n00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.345\nLet's go with that, let's go with blue.\n\n501\n00:27:16.345 --> 00:27:17.644\nWe'll go with orange and blue.\n\n502\n00:27:17.644 --> 00:27:20.857\nThose are complimentary colors, so.\n\n503\n00:27:20.857 --> 00:27:23.544\nAnd yes purple and\nyellow are complimentary colors.\n\n504\n00:27:23.544 --> 00:27:24.904\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it wasn't purple and\ngreen, it's- [CROSSTALK]\n\n505\n00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:25.596\n&gt;&gt; Purple and blue.\n\n506\n00:27:25.596 --> 00:27:27.012\n&gt;&gt; Purple-\n&gt;&gt; Not purple and blue,\n\n507\n00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:27.976\nI said yellow and blue.\n\n508\n00:27:27.976 --> 00:27:30.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well that's actually orange and\nblue.\n\n509\n00:27:30.663 --> 00:27:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n510\n00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.830\nSo orange and blue are complementary.\n\n511\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.981\nRed and green are complementary and\npurple and yellow.\n\n512\n00:27:35.981 --> 00:27:38.207\nAnd that is, I was like wait,\nno, is it the other one?\n\n513\n00:27:38.207 --> 00:27:41.855\nAnd then I started to,\nI was trying to visualize the wheel.\n\n514\n00:27:41.855 --> 00:27:43.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, doing the wheel.\n&gt;&gt; So I just looked it up.\n\n515\n00:27:43.927 --> 00:27:45.057\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's good when you have\n\n516\n00:27:45.057 --> 00:27:46.097\na reference in front of you.\n\n517\n00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:46.890\n&gt;&gt; Old Internet.\n\n518\n00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.083\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n519\n00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:53.084\nI've applied the border to my paragraph,\nI can see it right in here.\n\n520\n00:27:53.084 --> 00:27:57.155\nAnd I can come over here into\nthe shading if I wanted to.\n\n521\n00:27:57.155 --> 00:28:01.580\nBut I do like the orange and blue with\nour complementary colors, we click OK.\n\n522\n00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.260\nAnd now I have changed that formatting,\ncool.\n\n523\n00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.347\nBorders and shading,\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n524\n00:28:07.347 --> 00:28:11.444\nNow the last two I wanna point out\nthey are technically paragraph level\n\n525\n00:28:11.444 --> 00:28:16.463\nformatting's but you're not gonna find it\nin the paragraph section of our home tab.\n\n526\n00:28:16.463 --> 00:28:19.460\nThose are drop cups and hyphenation.\n\n527\n00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.643\nBecause hyphenation, we discussed a little\nbit about that on the right rag when we\n\n528\n00:28:23.643 --> 00:28:26.020\nwere talking about\nthe justification there.\n\n529\n00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.400\nHyphenations are not on by default,\n\n530\n00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.440\nthat's something that you have\nto tell it to do automatically.\n\n531\n00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.350\nIt is something that you can't\njust apply to one paragraph,\n\n532\n00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.760\nyou have to do a hyphenation for\nthe entire document.\n\n533\n00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.475\nAnd that's over in the review tab,\nand that's where you can,\n\n534\n00:28:43.475 --> 00:28:47.983\nactually I'm sorry it's on the layout tab,\nmy bad I had to look in my notes.\n\n535\n00:28:47.983 --> 00:28:50.291\nI'm like, that's not the right one.\n\n536\n00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:51.483\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n537\n00:28:51.483 --> 00:28:52.866\n&gt;&gt; If you go over to the Layout tab,\n\n538\n00:28:52.866 --> 00:28:56.490\nthe Hyphenation is right here, and\nnotice that it is not on my default.\n\n539\n00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.608\nBut if you wanted it to and\nyou should be able.\n\n540\n00:28:58.608 --> 00:28:59.739\nLet me scroll up a little bit,\n\n541\n00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:02.373\nyou should be able to see some of it\nhappening on that right hand side.\n\n542\n00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:03.980\nSo pay attention to the right rag.\n\n543\n00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.777\nIf I go to automatic,\nthere did you see some of them?\n\n544\n00:29:07.777 --> 00:29:09.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, suddenly.\n\n545\n00:29:09.145 --> 00:29:13.158\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, it went ahead and\nchanged as start a break so\n\n546\n00:29:13.158 --> 00:29:16.727\nthat way your right rag\nmight not be as ragged.\n\n547\n00:29:16.727 --> 00:29:20.376\nBut sometimes with hyphenation,\nif you have like four or\n\n548\n00:29:20.376 --> 00:29:25.140\nfive hyphens in a row in each line\nthat might get a little distracting.\n\n549\n00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.453\nSo you can set the hyphenation\noptions to where you can make a limit\n\n550\n00:29:30.453 --> 00:29:36.261\nof consecutive hyphens to where I could\nsay only do two hyphens in a row.\n\n551\n00:29:36.261 --> 00:29:39.150\nAnd do you want to\nhyphenate capital words?\n\n552\n00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.889\nSometimes you might not wanna do that.\n\n553\n00:29:40.889 --> 00:29:44.940\nAnd yes, automatically hyphenate\nthe document is because I chose that.\n\n554\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.246\nSo those are some things that you\ncan do to control your hyphenation.\n\n555\n00:29:48.246 --> 00:29:53.077\nThat's all you can do, you have a lot more\noptions in other programs, but hey for\n\n556\n00:29:53.077 --> 00:29:56.500\nWord, this is awesome that I\ncan hyphenate my document.\n\n557\n00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.421\nThen the other thing is drop caps,\nlittle bit of a more stylistic approach.\n\n558\n00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:04.470\nDrop caps is how it\ntreats that first letter.\n\n559\n00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:09.369\nYou see this a lot in books, like the very\nfirst page, like if its the word who,\n\n560\n00:30:09.369 --> 00:30:14.209\nlike the W is really big and it drops down\na certain amount of lines in the text.\n\n561\n00:30:14.209 --> 00:30:16.080\nThat's what a drop caps is.\n\n562\n00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.170\nSo cursor in this paragraph\nthat starts with either,\n\n563\n00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.360\ncoming over into the insert\ntab is where it's at.\n\n564\n00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.052\nAll the way over here in the text group,\n\n565\n00:30:26.052 --> 00:30:29.570\nthere is this button right here of Add,\nDrop Caps.\n\n566\n00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:33.666\nYou click on that one and\nif I choose drop, isn't that cute?\n\n567\n00:30:33.666 --> 00:30:34.625\n&gt;&gt; So cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n568\n00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:37.710\nthe E goes down across three lines.\n\n569\n00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.230\nNow keeping it in the margin\nversus out of the margin.\n\n570\n00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.897\nThe margins are where I wanna\nkeep my printable area, so\n\n571\n00:30:43.897 --> 00:30:46.793\nI personally would choose dropped within.\n\n572\n00:30:46.793 --> 00:30:51.000\nAnd so that's where I could go ahead and\nmake that letter.\n\n573\n00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.637\nNice and big for my drop caps.\n\n574\n00:30:52.637 --> 00:30:57.105\nIt does create this into a inline\ngraphic a little bit there, but\n\n575\n00:30:57.105 --> 00:31:00.930\nyou can see there's a little\ndotted box around there.\n\n576\n00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.419\nBut that's okay it's an inline\ntext box you could go ahead and\n\n577\n00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:06.442\nchange the letter if you needed to.\n\n578\n00:31:06.442 --> 00:31:09.435\nDon't let that dotted line confuse you.\n\n579\n00:31:09.435 --> 00:31:11.932\nJust click it, select it, and\nget there, and it should be fine.\n\n580\n00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:14.755\nBut you notice how I can't,\nwell I can select the whole word.\n\n581\n00:31:14.755 --> 00:31:17.257\nOkay perfect, so I thought it would and\nit wouldn't let me but\n\n582\n00:31:17.257 --> 00:31:19.004\nthat's all right, it did, we're good.\n\n583\n00:31:19.004 --> 00:31:20.288\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n584\n00:31:20.288 --> 00:31:23.269\nthat is everything I wanted to tell\nyou about paragraph formatting for\n\n585\n00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.932\nthis episode.\n\n586\n00:31:23.932 --> 00:31:27.265\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, thanks for showing\nus how to properly format our document\n\n587\n00:31:27.265 --> 00:31:29.431\nparagraphs that's what we\nneed to know how to do.\n\n588\n00:31:29.431 --> 00:31:32.897\nAnd if you want to make your documents\nlook a little bit better maybe a little\n\n589\n00:31:32.897 --> 00:31:36.434\nmore properly formatted Brown has given\nus the skills to do that very thing.\n\n590\n00:31:36.434 --> 00:31:39.977\nWe've been so looking at our clerk and\nwe have run out of time in this episode.\n\n591\n00:31:39.977 --> 00:31:41.851\nWe do thank you for\njoining us for ITPRO.TV,\n\n592\n00:31:41.851 --> 00:31:43.390\nI've

Thank you very much.\n\n11\n00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.919\nI'm ready to tell you\nabout the Format Painter.\n\n12\n00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.182\nI love the Format Painter, I was going to\ntry and put it into one of the character\n\n13\n00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:34.620\nformatting, or\neven the paragraph formatting episode.\n\n14\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.790\nBut I had to just keep it separate because\nit is something that's good to know about\n\n15\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.878\nonce you've watched the character and\nparagraph formatting episodes.\n\n16\n00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:48.860\nSo you could go ahead and see what this\nFormat Painter is going to be copying and\n\n17\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.800\npasting.\n\n18\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.760\nBut we're not copying and pasting text,\nwe're copying and pasting formats.\n\n19\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.755\n&gt;&gt; The heck you say.\n\n20\n00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I swear.\n\n21\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.250\n&gt;&gt; I don't believe it.\n\n22\n00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.570\nI don't think it can be done.\n\n23\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.390\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you.\n\n24\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.555\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then I will amaze you with it.\n\n25\n00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:05.056\n[LAUGH] So\n\n26\n00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:09.861\nI'm actually back down into the paragraph\nformatting document that I actually\n\n27\n00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:14.315\nleft off right from when we stopped\nin the paragraph formatting episode.\n\n28\n00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:17.980\nSo I've still got the borders and\nthe shading for the paragraphs.\n\n29\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.769\nI also did that drop caps\nhere with the either and\n\n30\n00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:25.303\nI was getting a little confused about it\nmade it an inline graphic almost, but\n\n31\n00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:29.570\nthen it was text, and then I was like,\nno you can select it.\n\n32\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.430\nBut you'll see a second where it might\nget a little weird in, well, three,\n\n33\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.660\ntwo, one, now.\n\n34\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.130\nSo we're going to select all this text and\nwe're gonna clear the formatting.\n\n35\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.237\nThis is something that I covered in\nthe character formats episode, and\n\n36\n00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:44.118\nI said that it removes character formats.\n\n37\n00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:47.220\nWell it also removes\nparagraph formatting as well.\n\n38\n00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.500\nSo if I clear all those formats,\nit's gonna take it off.\n\n39\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580\nBut then look at what it\ndid to the e in either.\n\n40\n00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.160\nIt did treat it separate.\n\n41\n00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.262\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n&gt;&gt; It did, yes.\n\n42\n00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:02.314\nBecause there's something known as\nan inline graphic that even though it's\n\n43\n00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:07.610\ndoing it and you didn't really tell it to\ndo it, I kinda know that it was doing it.\n\n44\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.210\nAnd that's why it threw me off so much.\n\n45\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.920\nBut you can see once I clear it that\nit did treat that character as like\n\n46\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.990\na separate entity.\n\n47\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.845\nAnd so that's why when I cleared it,\nit's making it its own\n\n48\n00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:26.200\nparagraph rather than just\na continuous letter within a word.\n\n49\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.005\nBut that's okay, we can always go ahead\nand just put our cursor in there,\n\n50\n00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:31.170\ngo ahead and click our Delete key.\n\n51\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.980\nGet rid of that forward deleting,\nor forward back spacing.\n\n52\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.540\nWow, that's a-\n&gt;&gt; Forward backspacing [LAUGH].\n\n53\n00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.083\nSo it doesn't move at all [LAUGH].\n\n54\n00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:45.268\n&gt;&gt; That's a weird double negative\nmove that I just made so, but\n\n55\n00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:47.260\nwe're moving forward.\n\n56\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.170\nPerfect, so\nnow I've got all the text as text so\n\n57\n00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.876\nI can tell you about the Format Painter.\n\n58\n00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:56.820\nNow I'm just gonna take this one,\nfirst of all and do some formatting.\n\n59\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.060\nLet's make it a blue, let's make it bold,\n\n60\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.410\nlet's make it a little bit bigger,\nlet's make it centered.\n\n61\n00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.730\nSo, I applied two different\nlevels of formatting.\n\n62\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.990\nI did the character formatting\nwith the font color and the size.\n\n63\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.530\nAnd I did the alignment\nwhich is the center,\n\n64\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.120\nthat's a paragraph level formatting.\n\n65\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.390\nWell maybe there's some other words or\n\n66\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.430\nparagraphs that I want to apply\nthe same level of formatting.\n\n67\n00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.250\nAnd just for fun I'm gonna\nmake this a paragraph here and\n\n68\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.320\nthen I'll make this a paragraph.\n\n69\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.575\nAlmost like I wanted to\nhave each one of these,\n\n70\n00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:34.500\nwe'll call them a heading, that I\nwanted it to format just like this one.\n\n71\n00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.376\nWell I could have selected all\nof those paragraphs first and\n\n72\n00:03:38.376 --> 00:03:41.640\nthen made the formats and\nthen they'd all apply.\n\n73\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.030\n&gt;&gt; But you don't always think to do that\ncuz you never know, you're writing and\n\n74\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.470\nyou're like this would be great as\nit's own section or something and\n\n75\n00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.920\nthen you gotta come back\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n76\n00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.310\nexactly, and that's what I was saying.\n\n77\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.430\nAs our train of thought we might\nnot go to think that far ahead, so\n\n78\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.050\nif I wanted to say, I wanna make\nall those other paragraphs, or\n\n79\n00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.670\nwords, look exactly like this one,\nI just wanna copy the formats.\n\n80\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.060\nIn walks the Format Painter.\n\n81\n00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.200\nSo this is where it says it looks\nlike you could go ahead and\n\n82\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.020\nit says, to get started select\ncontent with the format that you like,\n\n83\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.410\nclick the Format Painter, select something\nelse to automatically apply that format.\n\n84\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.260\nSo this is where I always tell people,\nhow do I explain the Format Painter?\n\n85\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.855\nIt’s like painting a house, or painting\na wall, it’s like you have a can of paint,\n\n86\n00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:30.155\nyou take your brush,\nyou dip the brush into the can of paint,\n\n87\n00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:34.076\nthe paint is now on the brush, and\nthen you go over and paint on the wall.\n\n88\n00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:36.156\nAnd so you have to have something,\n\n89\n00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:40.027\nto get the paint on the wall you\nhave to get the paint on the brush,\n\n90\n00:04:40.027 --> 00:04:43.710\nyou have to have that source to\nsay this is what I want to copy.\n\n91\n00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.430\nSo you do need to make sure that\nyou have the thing that you want\n\n92\n00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.530\nto copy the formatting out of\nselected and, in this case,\n\n93\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.250\nI am selecting the whole paragraph here.\n\n94\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.610\nSo the paragraph level formatting\nis what I'm trying to retain.\n\n95\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.530\nSo that's a little asterisk\non there it's like, hey,\n\n96\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.130\nmake sure you get\neverything that you want.\n\n97\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.710\nIf I click the Format Painter once,\nsingle-click, notice my cursor.\n\n98\n00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.100\nI'm putting it off over here so\nyou can see it.\n\n99\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.040\nIt looks like an I-beam with a brush on\nit, so it's got the paint on the brush.\n\n100\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.666\nI come over here, click, hold, and\ndrag across that text, and then, poo poo.\n\n101\n00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:21.435\nPoop, poop?\n\n102\n00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:22.954\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:05:22.954 --> 00:05:23.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Tada.\n\n104\n00:05:23.682 --> 00:05:24.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Poor choice of words, love.\n\n105\n00:05:24.972 --> 00:05:29.215\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was trying to like pizow or\nsomething, and it just came out weird.\n\n106\n00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:31.920\n[LAUGH] So now you can see that I\n\n107\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.810\nhave copied the format from\none place to the other.\n\n108\n00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.809\nPretty cool, but\nI need it a couple more times.\n\n109\n00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.540\nThat was like a one time application.\n\n110\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.750\nBut if I wanted to keep the formatting,\nlike the copy and\n\n111\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.920\npainting it on multiple places, it's kinda\nlike instead of using a brush using those\n\n112\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.290\nspray-\n&gt;&gt; Those power rollers?\n\n113\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.370\nYeah, that hooks up, yeah, and\nit's go the tube and the whole nine yards.\n\n114\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.970\nI love those things.\n\n115\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.185\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or those guns that\nthe super professionals [SOUND].\n\n116\n00:05:58.185 --> 00:05:59.265\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you just spray across.\n\n117\n00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:00.150\n&gt;&gt; Those are awesome.\n\n118\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.948\nYeah, so we want to have the spray gun,\nnot just the paint brush,\n\n119\n00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:08.480\nso I'm gonna undo that just for\nwe can see this.\n\n120\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.380\nIf you have it,\n\n121\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.278\nyou have to be in selecting in\nwhat the paint is coming from.\n\n122\n00:06:13.278 --> 00:06:18.120\nSelect the format,\ndouble-click the Format Painter.\n\n123\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.850\nSo if I click click, now it will stay on,\nso I can select this, yay.\n\n124\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.230\nI come down here and I select this,\nyou can see that it's gonna keep on going.\n\n125\n00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.750\nAnd it's just like if I had the hand\non the trigger of the spray gun,\n\n126\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.130\nfor me to stop it, I'd have to let go.\n\n127\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.130\nI would have to turn\nthe Format Painter off for\n\n128\n00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.900\nit to stop the painting, cause then it's\nlike it's kinda getting all out of hand.\n\n129\n00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.040\nIt's like gosh everywhere I click, so\nif I click here, it's like, no wait no, no\n\n130\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.103\ndon't do that, no, stop and so it's kinda-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're holding\n\n131\n00:06:49.103 --> 00:06:52.786\nthe trigger down on the gun at this point\nright, because it's always inactive.\n\n132\n00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:53.842\n&gt;&gt; That's right trey, trey?\n\n133\n00:06:53.842 --> 00:06:55.914\n&gt;&gt; Trey?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, true\n\n134\n00:06:55.914 --> 00:06:59.300\n&gt;&gt; And yes and yay.\n\n135\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.094\n&gt;&gt; True and yay but at the same time,\nI'm going to Wikipedia right now.\n\n136\n00:07:03.094 --> 00:07:07.198\n&gt;&gt; Von Smith terminology and dictionary.\n\n137\n00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:09.052\n&gt;&gt; Von-isms we call them.\n\n138\n00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:11.371\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\nwell actually it's called Von-glish.\n\n139\n00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:12.378\n&gt;&gt; Von-glish, I like that.\n\n140\n00:07:12.378 --> 00:07:14.714\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthat has been coined by my friends.\n\n141\n00:07:14.714 --> 00:07:15.706\n&gt;&gt; Going to Wikipedia.\n\n142\n00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:18.396\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now just one other point that I wanted\n\n143\n00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.190\nto make is here.\n\n144\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.320\nIf I click hold and\ndrag just a couple words,\n\n145\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.530\nnotice that it did not make the whole\nparagraph centered, did it?\n\n146\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.960\nNo, because it all depends on\nwhat you're selecting when you're\n\n147\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.210\npainting of whether it's going to only\napply the character level formatting or\n\n148\n00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.580\nthe paragraph level formatting.\n\n149\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.470\nWhen I selected this whole paragraph,\nclick, hold, and\n\n150\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.150\ndrag across the whole thing.\n\n151\n00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:52.090\nNotice it centered it, selecting just\nthese few words within the paragraph,\n\n152\n00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.210\nis only going to copy out\nthe character level formatting.\n\n153\n00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.560\nSo just being slightly aware or\nmostly aware of,\n\n154\n00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.410\nwhat I am selecting to apply that copied\nformatting does make a difference and\n\n155\n00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.545\nthat's where some people are why\nisn't it doing everything?\n\n156\n00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:15.160\nIt's all about what you've clicked and if\nI come down to here and if I single click.\n\n157\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.665\nNotice that it single clicked and\n\n158\n00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:22.090\napplied the centering,\nthe paragraph level formatting.\n\n159\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.110\nBut it only applied the character\nlevel formatting to that one word.\n\n160\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.440\nSo this is kinda half and half.\n\n161\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.390\nAnd it was like the same that happened up\nhere, I just didn't verbalize what was\n\n162\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:36.910\nhappening cuz I wanted to demonstrate this\ncharacter vs paragraph level formatting\n\n163\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:42.760\nwhen using the Format Painter and\nwhat you select is what you will affect.\n\n164\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.910\nSo let me turn off\nthe Format Painter right there.\n\n165\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.254\nAnd so that is my demonstration\nof the Format Painter,\n\n166\n00:08:49.254 --> 00:08:51.446\nI gave it it's own little episode.\n\n167\n00:08:51.446 --> 00:08:56.486\nI will make one small addendum to this, in\nthe sense that I love the Format Painter,\n\n168\n00:08:56.486 --> 00:08:59.235\ndon't get me wrong I think it's fantastic.\n\n169\n00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:05.730\nBut if I'm going to be using this kind\nof procedure of taking something and\n\n170\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.770\nformatting multiple things the same way,\nI'm gonna use this style.\n\n171\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.510\nBecause styles give you a lot more\nflexibility cuz what if like,\n\n172\n00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.910\nin this example, we we're using blue text.\n\n173\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.500\nAnd maybe, I applied it to 15 headings or\nheadings that I wanted throughout\n\n174\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.470\nmy entire document and I come back I'm\nlike, I don't want that centered anymore.\n\n175\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.881\nAnd I don't want that to be green, well\nI'd change, and then what am I gonna do?\n\n176\n00:09:27.881 --> 00:09:29.577\nManually change every single one of them.\n\n177\n00:09:29.577 --> 00:09:33.345\nYes, the Format Painter makes it\na lot faster, but if you use a style\n\n178\n00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:38.180\nall you have to do is change the style and\nit will automatically change everything.\n\n179\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.380\nSo styles is the way to go, I love them.\n\n180\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.670\nI promise I will show you\neverything I know about them and\n\n181\n00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.950\nhopefully you will learn to love them as\nmuch as I do because it's everything.\n\n182\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.350\n&gt;&gt; Quick question about the Format\nPainter, does it only work inside\n\n183\n00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:00.970\nof that specific document or\ncan I format paint across documents?\n\n184\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.440\nCan I grab formatting from one\ndocument and apply to another?\n\n185\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.210\n&gt;&gt; Well actually Daniel,\nyes you can, you can do that.\n\n186\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.366\n&gt;&gt; This is good because\nI am super lazy [LAUGH].\n\n187\n00:10:09.366 --> 00:10:11.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The whole while you're showing this,\n\n188\n00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:16.023\nI'm thinking to myself, man if I could\nhave one document open as like a cheat\n\n189\n00:10:16.023 --> 00:10:19.151\nsheet with all the common\nformatting things that I do,\n\n190\n00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:23.680\njust kinda like basically lay it out,\nI could just copy that in the tool.\n\n191\n00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.003\nAnd then apply it to my other\ndocuments that I'm creating,\n\n192\n00:10:26.003 --> 00:10:27.912\nmake my life a whole lot\neasier if I could do that.\n\n193\n00:10:27.912 --> 00:10:31.387\n&gt;&gt; That actually sounds like a really\ngood idea, [LAUGH], I'm like,\n\n194\n00:10:31.387 --> 00:10:32.950\nI might be able to do that too.\n\n195\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.030\n&gt;&gt; Slackers of the world unite!\n\n196\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.204\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, exactly.\n\n197\n00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:36.836\nSo why don't we try it?\n\n198\n00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:40.809\nSo why don't we come down in here and\nlet me make a new document and\n\n199\n00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:44.330\nI'm gonna do a control n right now for\nFile &gt; New.\n\n200\n00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:49.840\nGot it here, and we'll just put in some\ntext here, and just enter just because.\n\n201\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.410\nAnd let's come back over to\nthe paragraph formatting.\n\n202\n00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.120\nWe're gonna do the same procedure\nwhere we select the text, and\n\n203\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.780\nwith the paragraph selected\ndouble click on that format pane.\n\n204\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.252\nOr just to go ahead and keep it engaged,\nwe will come back over to our Document2.\n\n205\n00:11:04.252 --> 00:11:07.210\nNotice that as soon as I\nget into there you can see.\n\n206\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:07.970\n&gt;&gt; There's the paint brush.\n\n207\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.160\n&gt;&gt; There's the icon.\n\n208\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.696\nSo then I can click, hold, and drag\nacross that, and then I've got it, and\n\n209\n00:11:12.696 --> 00:11:15.880\nif I had more text, I could keep\non painting, keep on painting.\n\n210\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.781\n&gt;&gt; Man, I can see ease of use\nin my life up ahead [LAUGH].\n\n211\n00:11:19.781 --> 00:11:21.919\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\nWell, I'm glad I can help there, Daniel.\n\n212\n00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:22.800\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go to just the regular bullet\n\n187\n00:10:17.203 --> 00:10:18.040\nbutton.\n\n188\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.810\nI'll give a couple spaces between here.\n\n189\n00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.740\nI'm just entering twice just to\ngive a little bit more visual\n\n190\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.030\nseparation between here.\n\n191\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.820\nAll these are on the same level, but\n\n192\n00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:34.510\nmay be tea party is like\na sub-level of pig and pepper.\n\n193\n00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.996\nHow do I get my list to go in one?\n\n194\n00:10:36.996 --> 00:10:38.510\nYou just hit the tab key.\n\n195\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.340\nSo, if I hit the tab key, it goes in and\nnotice that the bullet characters changes.\n\n196\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.630\nSo, makes it too like a hollow circle\ninside of like a filled in circle here.\n\n197\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.450\nAnd if I wanted to take this one,\nI can Tab again.\n\n198\n00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.581\nNow if I wanted to make another level,\nI can Tab in again, and\n\n199\n00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:58.526\nI can go ahead and nest down.\n\n200\n00:10:58.526 --> 00:11:00.330\nAnd so like, my show notes.\n\n201\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.890\nMy show notes are exactly like that.\n\n202\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.347\nThey're all in bulleted lists.\n\n203\n00:11:03.347 --> 00:11:06.438\nAnd I make, okay,\nthis is like the main topic and then\n\n204\n00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:11.133\nthese are like the sub-topics and then\nmaybe the sub, sub-topics of each one.\n\n205\n00:11:11.133 --> 00:11:15.597\nAnd so it's all about how I'm organizing\nand yeah, just organizing and\n\n206\n00:11:15.597 --> 00:11:18.330\ncataloging all of this information.\n\n207\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:26.152\nBut what if I'm here on this, the Queen's\ncroquet grounds, It's pronounced croquet.\n\n208\n00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.001\n&gt;&gt;

That is not how you spell.\n\n213\n00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:35.736\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No it's not [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:37.536\n&gt;&gt; Although,\nit might be all be oddly tasty.\n\n215\n00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:41.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right, so\nI wanna take it out one level,\n\n216\n00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:45.853\nit doesn't need to be a sub it needs to\nbe on the same level as the mad tea party\n\n217\n00:11:45.853 --> 00:11:50.960\ninstead of tab you use shift tab, so\nhold the shift key, click the tab key.\n\n218\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.480\nMaybe it needs to be a main topic level,\nhold the shift again and then you can go.\n\n219\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.144\nAnd so if I was typing like okay\nthe next part of the lobster and\n\n220\n00:11:59.144 --> 00:12:03.970\nthen I can tab in and\nthen I can just say text type.\n\n221\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.260\nAnd then hit enter.\n\n222\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.730\nHit tab again to go in, more and\nthen enter, need to go back out,\n\n223\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.990\nshift tab type and then enter\nshift tab again, you go back out.\n\n224\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.250\nSo you can use that tab and\n\n225\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.390\nshift tab to go in and\nout of your list levels as you go along.\n\n226\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.722\nAnd with your bullet characters,\nif I did it with the cats, notice,\n\n227\n00:12:23.722 --> 00:12:29.560\nit's going to just default back\ninto like the next defined list\n\n228\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:35.290\nlevel of a multi level list, it's gonna go\nahead and put that next bullet character.\n\n229\n00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.781\nNow if you're thinking but\nwhat if I wanted to have cats and\n\n230\n00:12:38.781 --> 00:12:41.496\nthen dogs be my second\nlevel when I indent in.\n\n231\n00:12:41.496 --> 00:12:45.420\nAnd then the third level I have birds or\nwhat have you.\n\n232\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:50.320\nThis is where you can start getting into\nhow you can format multilevel lists and\n\n233\n00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.390\nchoose each list level to have\na different bullet character.\n\n234\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.960\nWe'll circle back around\nthere in just a second.\n\n235\n00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.030\nBut, let's move on to numbered list.\n\n236\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.340\nI'm gonna undo it few times just\nto kind of get our text back.\n\n237\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.070\nUndo, undo, undo, undo, undo.\n\n238\n00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.485\nThat's good enough.\n\n239\n00:13:09.485 --> 00:13:11.256\nCuz I could take this.\n\n240\n00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:12.648\nBefore we turn it into numbers,\n\n241\n00:13:12.648 --> 00:13:15.490\nwhat if I just don't want\nthis to be bulleted any more?\n\n242\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.497\nIt's just like having a bold or\nitalic, if you turn it on.\n\n243\n00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:19.621\n&gt;&gt; You turn it off.\n\n244\n00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:20.837\n&gt;&gt; You can turn it off exactly.\n\n245\n00:13:20.837 --> 00:13:21.773\n&gt;&gt; There's a switch for that.\n\n246\n00:13:21.773 --> 00:13:24.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They can be, yes.\n\n299\n00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:55.486\n&gt;&gt; Yes they are.\n\n300\n00:15:55.486 --> 00:15:57.224\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly what it does.\n\n301\n00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:00.711\nIt's going to give you\nthe continued numbering option.\n\n302\n00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:03.748\nCuz it saw that, hey,\nyou had some numbers before.\n\n303\n00:16:03.748 --> 00:16:06.956\nAnd I can see that you're throwing\nme back in the numbers again.\n\n304\n00:16:06.956 --> 00:16:08.390\nHey, you wanna do that?\n\n305\n00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.360\nYes, I do, I like that.\n\n306\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.715\n&gt;&gt; I do like that feature,\ncuz a lot of times,\n\n307\n00:16:12.715 --> 00:16:15.006\nif I am doing a step-by-step tutorial,\n\n308\n00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:19.272\nI need to throw in some extra information\nwithin step five, or what have you.\n\n309\n00:16:19.272 --> 00:16:22.641\nAnd I'm still just typing as,\nI'm formatting as I go,\n\n310\n00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:24.587\nwhich I kinda told you not to do.\n\n311\n00:16:24.587 --> 00:16:27.663\nBut there are reasons,\nto where you can kinda bend.\n\n312\n00:16:27.663 --> 00:16:30.850\n&gt;&gt; They're not hard and fast rules,\nthey're more like guidelines, right?\n\n313\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.714\n&gt;&gt; It's really just a suggestion, and\ncertainly there's always reasons and\n\n314\n00:16:35.714 --> 00:16:38.301\ntime for you to do certain suggestions.\n\n315\n00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:41.826\nSo it applies when you need to,\nso that change numbering and\n\n316\n00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:44.350\ncontinue numbering is pretty nice.\n\n317\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.580\nNow let's talk about\nthat multiple-level list.\n\n318\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.676\nCuz we said, I want to make a list where\nwe have, what'd I say, cats, dogs,\n\n319\n00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.319\nand birds?\n\n320\n00:16:51.319 --> 00:16:55.483\nI'm pretty sure, yes,\nthere is a parrot there in your Wingdings.\n\n321\n00:16:55.483 --> 00:16:58.638\nNow before I even get started,\nI don't have anything selected.\n\n322\n00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:03.343\nIn my multi-level list, you can see,\nthis would be really good for an outline.\n\n323\n00:17:03.343 --> 00:17:08.012\nSo remember, if you're doing an outline,\nyou might wanna start with 1, and\n\n324\n00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:10.226\nthen an a, and then a Roman numeral.\n\n325\n00:17:10.226 --> 00:17:14.056\nSo there's some kind of\ncommonly used outline, or\n\n326\n00:17:14.056 --> 00:17:19.237\nmulti-level list formats for\nyou to choose from, but I want my own.\n\n327\n00:17:19.237 --> 00:17:23.898\nSo I think I'm gonna go to find a new\nmulti-level list, just like we did before.\n\n328\n00:17:23.898 --> 00:17:27.765\nYou just have to make sure that you\nknow which level that you're in, and\n\n329\n00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:29.680\nhow you want to format it.\n\n330\n00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.585\nSo I'm in level one here, and\nI want to enter the format for the number.\n\n331\n00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:37.280\nWell, I don't really\nwant it to be a number.\n\n332\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.476\nSo if I scroll down through here,\nI can see, scroll down, there we go.\n\n333\n00:17:41.476 --> 00:17:45.908\nIt seems some of the bullets that I've\nalready chosen, like there's Fuego, and\n\n334\n00:17:45.908 --> 00:17:46.945\nthere's the cat.\n\n335\n00:17:46.945 --> 00:17:50.311\nSo it's great here,\nsince I want the cat to be the first one,\n\n336\n00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:52.650\nI'll go ahead and click on it.\n\n337\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.960\nAnd it is remembering that I\nmade it green and everything.\n\n338\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:02.220\nSo I could come in here, and format the\ncolor and size of the bullet character.\n\n339\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.300\nFor fun, lets just keep it green for\nnow, but\n\n340\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.470\nyou can see that each level\nhas all of these options.\n\n341\n00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.734\nAnd you can even get into the spacing,\n\n342\n00:18:11.734 --> 00:18:17.763\nhow much space is between the bullet or\nnumber character and the text.\n\n343\n00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:21.520\nNow you can do it numerically,\nthrough the dialogue box.\n\n344\n00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.600\nI will show you once we get\nback out into the document how\n\n345\n00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.350\nyou could space those bullets and text\ndifferently, and I'll show you on that.\n\n346\n00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.390\nSo I'm glad this dialogue box,\nthat you reminded me to show you that.\n\n347\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I actually do have it in my notes.\n\n348\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just skipped on over that.\n\n349\n00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.850\nSo let's keep going on our multi-level\nlist, click on the second level.\n\n350\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.710\nSo I'm in the second, it's kinda\nbolted over to the right-hand side.\n\n351\n00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.274\nI'm gonna come down into here,\nI do not want this to be a letter or\n\n352\n00:18:48.274 --> 00:18:51.248\na number, I want a new bullet character.\n\n353\n00:18:51.248 --> 00:18:55.136\nAnd it brings you right back in\nto this Insert Symbol dialog box,\n\n354\n00:18:55.136 --> 00:19:00.520\nand I can choose, there's a dog, so\nlet's go ahead and click on that dog.\n\n355\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.219\nThere's our dog, well, let's go with red.\n\n356\n00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:07.530\nYay, get a little colorful.\n\n357\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.116\n&gt;&gt; Nothing like a red dog.\n\n358\n00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:09.637\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n359\n00:19:09.637 --> 00:19:10.952\n&gt;&gt; We did say we were going to gussy.\n\n360\n00:19:10.952 --> 00:19:11.685\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n361\n00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:16.860\n&gt;&gt; Let's go on to level three, and\nthen the level three new bullet character.\n\n362\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.120\nAnd I will choose a bird,\nI know there is a bird somewhere in here.\n\n363\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:21.960\n&gt;&gt; Last one.\n\n364\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.608\n&gt;&gt; Is it the last one?\n&gt;&gt; It's the very last one.\n\n365\n00:19:23.608 --> 00:19:24.576\n&gt;&gt; That's a dove, perfect.\n&gt;&gt; A dove, right, that's a bird.\n\n366\n00:19:24.576 --> 00:19:25.939\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, we can use that.\n\n367\n00:19:25.939 --> 00:19:28.206\nI thought there was a parrot somewhere,\nbut\n\n368\n00:19:28.206 --> 00:19:30.362\nmaybe I'm crossing my emojis in my phone.\n\n369\n00:19:30.362 --> 00:19:31.542\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All these symbols.\n\n370\n00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:32.685\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] they're everywhere now.\n\n371\n00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:35.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Going back to hieroglyphics, almost.\n\n372\n00:19:35.719 --> 00:19:38.022\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n373\n00:19:38.022 --> 00:19:42.646\nThere's some times where I just send\nemojis, and I'm wondering sometimes.\n\n374\n00:19:42.646 --> 00:19:47.068\nIf my mom sends some weird emojis,\nI'm like, why did, all right,\n\n375\n00:19:47.068 --> 00:19:48.655\nI'll go with it, mom.\n\n376\n00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:52.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'll go here, I have my list levels.\n\n377\n00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:57.675\nAnd now you can see, if I took and\nselected, let's say, this one.\n\n378\n00:19:57.675 --> 00:20:02.090\nWhoops, I just did this selection\nthe wrong way, let's select the text.\n\n379\n00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.196\nI do my multi-level list into\nthe one that I had, and right now,\n\n380\n00:20:06.196 --> 00:20:08.338\nit doesn't really do anything.\n\n381\n00:20:08.338 --> 00:20:13.562\nBut if I start making my different levels,\nyou can see that it's\n\n382\n00:20:13.562 --> 00:20:19.197\ngoing to apply what I had set in my\nnew multi-level list formatting.\n\n383\n00:20:19.197 --> 00:20:24.830\nSo pretty fun, let me undo that,\njust to go over the spacing.\n\n384\n00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.999\nThis is where, watching the episode\non the paragraph formatting, and\n\n385\n00:20:29.999 --> 00:20:34.922\nwe talked about the ribbon and\nthese different icons on the ribbon.\n\n386\n00:20:34.922 --> 00:20:37.007\nNo, this would be the ruler, the other R.\n\n387\n00:20:37.007 --> 00:20:38.474\nMan, I'm mixing my R's now.\n\n388\n00:20:38.474 --> 00:20:41.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have your first-line indent,\n\n389\n00:20:41.197 --> 00:20:44.430\nyour hanging indent, and your left indent.\n\n390\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.580\nAnd if you look at this,\nlet's zoom in a little bit,\n\n391\n00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.000\nso you can kind of see\nwhere it's lining up.\n\n392\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.806\nWhere do you think this\ntop triangle is lining up?\n\n393\n00:20:51.806 --> 00:20:53.690\nThat is where your bullet starts.\n\n394\n00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.640\nWhere does this bottom\ntriangle pointing up?\n\n395\n00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.450\nThat is where your text sits.\n\n396\n00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.640\nAnd this would move them both together.\n\n397\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.728\nSo if I wanted to have the bullets go\nin a little bit more, the whole thing?\n\n398\n00:21:05.728 --> 00:21:08.346\nI don't mind the spacing between\nthe character and the text, but\n\n399\n00:21:08.346 --> 00:21:10.440\nit just needs to come\nin a little bit more?\n\n400\n00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.346\nMove the rectangle, the whole left indent.\n\n401\n00:21:13.346 --> 00:21:16.803\nMaybe I wanna pull it in a little\nbit more, but the first line,\n\n402\n00:21:16.803 --> 00:21:21.290\nthat bullet character needs to come\nout a little bit, pull the bullet out.\n\n403\n00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:25.599\nOkay, so these different triangles,\nwell yes, they are tab stops, and\n\n404\n00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:28.808\nwe're not gonna talk about\ntab stops in this episode.\n\n405\n00:21:28.808 --> 00:21:32.804\nBut those first-line indents and\nhanging indents,\n\n406\n00:21:32.804 --> 00:21:37.170\nthat's where the text is\naligned within a bulleted list.\n\n407\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.172\nAnd just to show you with\nmulti-level-paired, or\n\n408\n00:21:40.172 --> 00:21:41.840\nmulti-lined paragraphs.\n\n409\n00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.710\nIf I choose this bullet,\nthe same thing applies here,\n\n410\n00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:51.320\nis that the text is gonna come\nout more than the bullet.\n\n411\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.990\nCuz normally this is a first-line indent,\nor how it treats a first-line.\n\n412\n00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.477\nSo you would think that the first\nline would come with it, it doesn't.\n\n413\n00:22:00.477 --> 00:22:03.747\nNot with bullets,\ncuz it's a little bit different,\n\n414\n00:22:03.747 --> 00:22:07.620\nbecause you have that specific\ncharacter attached to it.\n\n415\n00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.710\nSo you could go through\nthe dialog box if you wanted to,\n\n416\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.646\ninto the fine list levels, and go there.\n\n417\n00:22:13.646 --> 00:22:17.506\nTo me, I'm a much more of a visual\nperson than a numerical person.\n\n418\n00:22:17.506 --> 00:22:23.470\nAnd I don't know what is .75 or 1 inch on\nthe ruler, in relationship to my document.\n\n419\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.730\nSo being able to control it here on the\nruler will give you a lot more control.\n\n420\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.540\nAnd that way, you can make your\nbullets to your heart's content.\n\n421\n00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.745\nYou can put pictures of Fuego and clovers\nthat I didn't have in this computer.\n\n422\n00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:39.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you could go out and find one.\n\n423\n00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:42.440\nAnd of course, that's why that Bing\nimage search is really good, so\n\n424\n00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.730\nyou can find pictures that you don't have.\n\n425\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.848\nAnd I think that is everything that\nyou could do with lists within Word,\n\n426\n00:22:49.848 --> 00:22:51.224\nfor this episode.\n\n427\n00:22:51.224 --> 00:22:55.687\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Vonne, now we can all\ngo forth and start the gussetting process.\n\n428\n00:22:55.687 --> 00:22:56.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n429\n00:22:56.867 --> 00:22:58.020\nat least one using bulleted lists.\n\n430\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.260\nVery cool stuff, bulleted lists,\nnumbered lists, ordered lists,\n\n431\n00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.470\nhowever you wanna call them.\n\n432\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.280\nThey've got a lot of cool\nfeatures available to us.\n\n433\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.070\nSo now that you know how to get to them,\n\n434\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.180\nyou can make them look just like you'd\nalways hoped, in your dreams of dreams.\n\n435\n00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.800\nSo definitely go out there and\ndo that, play with Word and\n\n436\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:18.010\nmake it have crazy icons and stuff, or\nsymbols, outside of your ordered lists.\n\n437\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.075\nVonne, thank you so much for\nshowing us how we can do that.\n\n438\n00:23:20.075 --> 00:23:22.945\nMake crazy stuff that people are going,\nwhat was this person thinking?\n\n439\n00:23:22.945 --> 00:23:25.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That sounds about right.\n\n440\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.020\n&gt;&gt; It's what we needed in our lives.\n\n441\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.171\nBut I'm looking at our clock,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n442\n00:23:29.171 --> 00:23:32.314\nWe do thank you for joining us for\nOfficeProTV, I've been your host,\n\n443\n00:23:32.314 --> 00:23:33.140\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n444\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:33.784\n&gt;&gt;

See?\n\n17\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.404\nI can predict the future.\n\n18\n00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:34.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a gift.\n\n19\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.264\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\n\n20\n00:00:36.264 --> 00:00:40.821\nyes, maybe not the bar tabs\nthat we might be used to.\n\n21\n00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:41.693\n&gt;&gt; Close enough.\n[LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:42.316\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n23\n00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:46.955\n[LAUGH] Right, we're gonna be talking\nabout tabs inside of Word, of course, and\n\n24\n00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:50.573\nhow we can format our tab stops to\nnot do the default tab stops and\n\n25\n00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:55.415\nget away from you doing that space, space,\nspace, space, or the tab, tab, tab,\n\n26\n00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:56.764\ntab, tab-\n&gt;&gt; That is annoying.\n\n27\n00:00:56.764 --> 00:00:59.050\n&gt;&gt; When you really only need one.\nYeah, yes.\n\n28\n00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.470\nI mean, well,\nit's annoying since I know about it, but\n\n29\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.800\nwhen I didn't know anything about it\nI was like, what's wrong with that?\n\n30\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.780\nThere's nothing wrong with it,\nI'm just gonna move on over.\n\n31\n00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.270\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know anything about it,\nit's still annoying.\n\n32\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Doesn't line up, hold on,\n\n33\n00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.334\nback up, one too many.\n\n34\n00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:13.636\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I see.\n\n35\n00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:17.200\nIt's just the actual time it takes to\nhit the space bar that many times.\n\n36\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.265\n&gt;&gt; Listen, lazy.\n\n37\n00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:20.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've seemed to have already picked up\n\n38\n00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:23.855\non this, I'm all about figuring\nways around doing actual work.\n\n39\n00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:24.748\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, here,\n\n40\n00:01:24.748 --> 00:01:27.350\nwhy don't I show you how to format tabs,\nand it might show you.\n\n41\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.130\n&gt;&gt; Continue.\n\n42\n00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n43\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.723\nlet's just go ahead and jump on in.\n\n44\n00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:34.846\nI have a document named Tabs for\nthis example.\n\n45\n00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:39.539\nAnd I do have my show hide character marks\non so you can see every enter mark, and in\n\n46\n00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.389\nthis case, every time we hit the tab key,\ncuz it's very important to have that on.\n\n47\n00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:47.793\nNow I'm going to zoom in\na little bit on here.\n\n48\n00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:51.446\nAnd we have talked about this in some\nof the other episodes about some\n\n49\n00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:55.670\nof the default things Word does for\nus when we're inputting in text.\n\n50\n00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.278\nAnd we talked about that tab,\nwe equated it with the five spaces.\n\n51\n00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:02.765\nOr at least back in the day when we were\nlearning how to type on old typewriters\n\n52\n00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:05.450\nand everything,\nthe tab would move you five spaces.\n\n53\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.210\nWell, in Word, what it does is\nit's every half inch on the ruler.\n\n54\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.312\nSo you do need to make sure that you have\nthe ruler on when you're going to be\n\n55\n00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:18.966\nformatting tab sets because it's\nthe easiest way to go about it.\n\n56\n00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:23.194\nSee, cuz every half inch on the ruler,\nnot five spaces and\n\n57\n00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:26.051\nI did sp there, there is a tab in there.\n\n58\n00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:27.650\nAnd you're like what?\n\n59\n00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.240\nThere is.\n\n60\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.580\nIf I zoom in a little bit more and\nif I change the font size here to,\n\n61\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.300\nlet's bump it down a little bit,\nlook at that, there is.\n\n62\n00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.129\nThere is a hidden tab in there.\n\n63\n00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.721\n&gt;&gt; Hiding.\n\n64\n00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:45.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is,\nit's very sneaky and that's where-\n\n65\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.222\n&gt;&gt; Insidious even.\n\n66\n00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:47.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n67\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.370\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that sometimes\n\n68\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.200\nthere are things that are lurking in\nthe corners right there because in\n\n69\n00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.360\nthat font size that we had,\nin the Calibri, was it 11?\n\n70\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.338\nYes, the Calibri 11 size font,\n\n71\n00:03:01.338 --> 00:03:07.120\nit bumped tab right up against\nthat half inch mark on the ruler.\n\n72\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.120\nSo when I hit that tab key,\n\n73\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.750\nI thought it would go to the next one,\nbut it didn't and I'm like.\n\n74\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.240\nIt's just so hidden in there,\nbut there are tab softs and\n\n75\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.270\nthat might be sometimes why,\nwhy isn't this doing this?\n\n76\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.520\nWhy is it moving over?\n\n77\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.480\nYou might actually see it.\n\n78\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.430\nEven if you see the, or have the show\nhidden characters on, it's just so\n\n79\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.910\nclose, you don't see it.\n\n80\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.480\nSo just throwing that out there for you.\n\n81\n00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.940\nAnd I'll undo that, there we go.\n\n82\n00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.540\nOne more time, see now it's gone,\nyou can't even see it.\n\n83\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.030\nSo having to use the ruler to format your\ntab stops are going to be very important.\n\n84\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.000\nI'm gonna start with a very basic example\nof how we can format our tab stops.\n\n85\n00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.040\nSo let's say, I remember when we\nwere composing letters in school.\n\n86\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.721\nYou always had to have a certain\naddress block at the top.\n\n87\n00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:04.456\nAnd then you had to have the salutation\nand how you were doing a business letter,\n\n88\n00:04:04.456 --> 00:04:05.760\na formal business letter.\n\n89\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.460\nYou had to put the name, and\nthe regarding, and you had the colon, and\n\n90\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.160\nyou had the spaces, and\nall of that kind of stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.040\nSo I'm kind of going along with that.\n\n92\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.160\nSo I'm gonna go with name and\nI'm gonna hit the tab key.\n\n93\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.532\nI'm gonna say Vonne and I'll say date and\nI'll hit the tab key and I'll say today.\n\n94\n00:04:22.532 --> 00:04:24.826\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz yeah, well, it's June 16th.\n\n95\n00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:25.737\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n96\n00:04:25.737 --> 00:04:27.794\n&gt;&gt; So I can go ahead and put today.\n\n97\n00:04:27.794 --> 00:04:33.806\nNow, because the words name and date\ndidn't go past the half inch on the ruler,\n\n98\n00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:38.405\nwhen I hit the tab once,\nthey both ended up in the same place.\n\n99\n00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:42.404\nNow if I hit enter, and\nI type in Regarding, now you can already\n\n100\n00:04:42.404 --> 00:04:47.470\nsee that the word Regarding has gone\npast the half inch mark on the ruler.\n\n101\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.870\nSo with the one tab,\nit's going to the next one.\n\n102\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.530\nAnd so I say Tabs or Tabs, there you go.\n\n103\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.160\nNow, before I learn how to format\ntab stops I would do this.\n\n104\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.860\nWell, let me go ahead and\n\n105\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.290\njust put a double tab stop,\nand now everything is aligned.\n\n106\n00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.920\nBut now you can see here with\nvarying amounts of text and\n\n107\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.980\nhow much space it's accompanying.\n\n108\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.416\nWell, one line might have two tabs,\nanother line might have three tabs,\n\n109\n00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:18.157\nsomebody might have one tab, just you can\ntry to get all of it and force it over.\n\n110\n00:05:18.157 --> 00:05:21.347\nI would say there's nothing\nreally wrong with this, but\n\n111\n00:05:21.347 --> 00:05:23.650\nthere's a much better way to do it.\n\n112\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.019\nYou could,\nlet's take those other tabs out,\n\n113\n00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:28.945\ncuz there's only tab in between\neach one of these words.\n\n114\n00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:34.136\nYou can format this tab stop to say, hey,\ninstead of stopping at the half inch or\n\n115\n00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:37.468\nthe inch,\nmaybe I wanted to put it at the 0.75,\n\n116\n00:05:37.468 --> 00:05:41.570\nI combined three-fourths and\nthe decimal all together.\n\n117\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.340\nAnd now, we have it at the three-quarter\ninch mark of the ruler.\n\n118\n00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.690\nSo if you're formatting\nmultiple paragraphs,\n\n119\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.160\nyou do need to select it cuz tabs\nare a paragraph level formatting.\n\n120\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.150\nThey are not a character level formatting,\n\n121\n00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.530\nso each paragraph can\nsupport its own formatting.\n\n122\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.290\nSo you need to make sure you\nget all of them that have\n\n123\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.580\nthe things that you want\nto format selected first.\n\n124\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.620\nNow, this ruler up here,\nand it's kinda hard to see,\n\n125\n00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.880\nbut in this upper left-hand\ncorner where your vertical and\n\n126\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.770\nhorizontal rulers meet,\nthere's this little square in here.\n\n127\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.750\nIt looks like it has a little L.\n\n128\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:24.360\nWell, that little L indicates what type of\ntab stop you will be putting on the ruler.\n\n129\n00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.550\nThe way I talk about tab substance ruler,\n\n130\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.980\nit's like magnets on a refrigerator and\nyou can pick which magnets you want.\n\n131\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.771\nAnd then you go ahead and just put it on\nthe ruler, or well, I guess the fridge.\n\n132\n00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:34.603\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n133\n00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:37.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Crossing my references here.\n\n134\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.890\nYou go ahead and\nput it on the refrigerator.\n\n135\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.860\nAnd then, if you want to take it off,\nyou pull it off and\n\n136\n00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.490\nsometimes you have to jerk it off because\nsome magnets are really strong, right?\n\n137\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.243\nSo but you could also kind of like\nmove them around the refrigerator.\n\n138\n00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:51.350\nOr I'm sure maybe Daniel,\nI know you have small girls.\n\n139\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.318\nDo you have the letters?\n\n140\n00:06:52.318 --> 00:06:54.134\n&gt;&gt; I do, I do, of course.\n\n141\n00:06:54.134 --> 00:06:56.914\nIt's like you can't have small kids and\nnot have the cool little letters and\n\n142\n00:06:56.914 --> 00:06:58.312\nteach them their alphabets, right?\n\n143\n00:06:58.312 --> 00:06:58.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n144\n00:06:58.866 --> 00:06:59.415\n&gt;&gt; On the refrigerator?\n\n145\n00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:01.676\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthey move them all around and everything.\n\n146\n00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:04.750\nWell, that's exactly what I equate\ntab stops on the rules with.\n\n147\n00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.940\nYou can put them on there,\nyou can move them around, and\n\n148\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.110\nthen you could take them off.\n\n149\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.826\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n150\n00:07:08.826 --> 00:07:11.746\nyou're gonna pick which letter you're\ngonna put on the refrigerator, right?\n\n151\n00:07:11.746 --> 00:07:16.080\nIn here, we're gonna go ahead and pick\nwhich tab stop, what type of alignment,\n\n152\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.440\nI should be more specific, what alignment\nthat I want to have when that text\n\n153\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.490\ndoes the tab, where does it stop and\nhow does it test a line?\n\n154\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.232\nSo the left tab stop would\nbe left line tab stop, wow.\n\n155\n00:07:30.232 --> 00:07:33.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, click it one time, though, so\n\n156\n00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:37.350\nhow we can cycle through picking our\nletters to put on our refrigerator.\n\n157\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.470\nClick it once,\nyou have a centered tab stop.\n\n158\n00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.430\nSo the text will stop and\ncenter itself at that point.\n\n159\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.540\nClick it one more time, that is a\nbackwards L, so that would be a right tab.\n\n160\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.812\n[LAUGH] Dan is like going woop.\n\n161\n00:07:50.812 --> 00:07:52.297\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm off camera.\n\n162\n00:07:52.297 --> 00:07:54.797\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's kinda\ncute where I'm watching.\n\n163\n00:07:54.797 --> 00:07:57.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's the right tab stop.\n\n164\n00:07:57.842 --> 00:08:01.098\nClick it one more time,\nthis would be a decimal tab software and\n\n165\n00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:02.920\nmy decimal points line up.\n\n166\n00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.680\nClick, there's that bar tab.\n\n167\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.710\nSo we have, and it actually says bar tab.\n\n168\n00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.060\nSo when I hit the tab key,\nit's gonna make an actual printable line,\n\n169\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.460\nlike a bar there, and\nso we go keep on going.\n\n170\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.834\nNow this is where you could go ahead and\nformat the first line indent, and\n\n171\n00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:22.153\nwe talked about that in the indents\nepisode of where we could go ahead and\n\n172\n00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:25.418\ncontrol the first line and\nthe whole indent, and the hanging indent,\n\n173\n00:08:25.418 --> 00:08:27.385\nnotice that would be the hanging indent.\n\n174\n00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:29.740\nClick it one more time,\nand you're back to the L.\n\n175\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.170\nSo you're basically just\nkind of clicking through\n\n176\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.860\nto cycle through which one you want.\n\n177\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.691\nSo if you miss it, that's okay,\njust keep on clicking, and\n\n178\n00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:38.925\nthis is where being\na Jiminy Click-it is okay.\n\n179\n00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:40.157\n&gt;&gt; Kind of pays off for you, yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:40.157 --> 00:08:41.503\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz that's how you get\n\n181\n00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:42.210\nthrough it.\n\n182\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.232\nSo we go ahead and click on through.\n\n183\n00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:49.360\nI'm gonna zoom out of the whole\ncomputer so you can see that.\n\n184\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.610\nI have the L in that place, so I'm\ndesignated that I'm going to be putting in\n\n185\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.700\nleft align tabs up on the ruler.\n\n186\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.277\nI have my text or\nparagraphs that I wanna format selected.\n\n187\n00:08:58.277 --> 00:09:02.420\nAll I got to do is just click on\nthe ruler and boom there you go.\n\n188\n00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:09.970\nNotice that I have now said, hey first\ntab, when you stop you're gonna be\n\n189\n00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.840\nleft aligned at this particular point on\nthe ruler which is about 0.75 inches.\n\n190\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.345\nSweet.\n\n191\n00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:19.349\nNow, just like moving around\nthe letters on the refrigerator,\n\n192\n00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:21.026\nyou wanna move it over a little bit.\n\n193\n00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:26.328\nYou grab the little L and you move\nit over, but you got to be careful.\n\n194\n00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:30.540\nYou got to stay on the ruler,\nbecause if you go too far up, or\n\n195\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.703\ntoo far down, it's like your pulling\nthe magnet off the refrigerator.\n\n196\n00:09:35.703 --> 00:09:38.834\nYou're pulling that tab\nstop off of the ruler so\n\n197\n00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:42.825\nyou can see how easy it is to\nactually remove a tab stop, and so\n\n198\n00:09:42.825 --> 00:09:48.485\nit's very simple, but it's so small that\nsometimes it can be a little challenging.\n\n199\n00:09:48.485 --> 00:09:51.793\nSo you got to be very particular about\nwhere your mouse is and you have to kind\n\n200\n00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:55.536\nof come towards the, almost towards like\nthe bottom half of this tiny little ruler.\n\n201\n00:09:55.536 --> 00:09:58.950\nYou can't go to far up,\nit's got to be kind of towards the bottom.\n\n202\n00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.250\nSo if i click again, there we go, and\nthis is one where sometimes you're\n\n203\n00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:08.170\nnot grabbing right on the ruler or on\nthe tab stop, so you click about here and\n\n204\n00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.930\nstart dragging, and what did I just do?\n\n205\n00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.060\nI just made another tab stop and\n\n206\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.402\nthen why isn't it moving over\nto the one that I put here?\n\n207\n00:10:17.402 --> 00:10:19.967\nWell because this is\nwhere the tab stop is.\n\n208\n00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:26.000\nThe amount of tabs stops correlates to the\namount of times that you hit the tab key.\n\n209\n00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.590\nSo if I had two tab stops then that would\nbe the first one here, second one here.\n\n210\n00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:37.392\nSince there's only one it's only going\nto obey by the first one it sees.\n\n211\n00:10:37.392 --> 00:10:42.270\nBut if I pull this off, notice then\nit jumps to the next defined tab stop\n\n212\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.258\non the ruler because I\ntold it where it was.\n\n213\n00:10:45.258 --> 00:10:50.522\nSo that's how you can start\nadding tab stops on the ruler.\n\n214\n00:10:50.522 --> 00:10:53.493\nNow this is a very simple\nexample with just a single tab.\n\n215\n00:10:53.493 --> 00:10:58.741\nLet me zoom out just a little bit and\nwe have some other examples here.\n\n216\n00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:03.644\nSo this is where I have first last\ndepartment and when you start doing\n\n217\n00:11:03.644 --> 00:11:08.548\ntabs you can start using them to\ncreate faux columns I'm gonna say,\n\n218\n00:11:08.548 --> 00:11:13.652\ncuz when you say columns you're\nusually associating it with tables.\n\n219\n00:11:13.652 --> 00:11:15.740\nSo, it looks like columns to us and\n\n220\n00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.052\nthere's nothing wrong with\nusing that terminology,\n\n221\n00:11:19.052 --> 00:11:23.453\nI was just trying to be specific to\ntables and this isn't really a table.\n\n222\n00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:24.085\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n223\n00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:26.770\n&gt;&gt; But-\n&gt;&gt; Being technically speaking, right?\n\n224\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.238\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz I'm so good at that so,\n\n225\n00:11:28.238 --> 00:11:29.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.050\n&gt;&gt; So good at clarifying stuff.\n\n227\n00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.590\nBut I have first, last, department,\nand I have Marisha, and\n\n228\n00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.750\nthen I have DeJesus, and\nthere is a tab in there, so\n\n229\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:42.310\nthat's where we have that, like it's kind\nof hiding cuz it's right on that mark, and\n\n230\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.730\nthen I have the career concierge because\nthat's the department that she works in,\n\n231\n00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.566\nand if you know people at\nITProTV you've seen her.\n\n232\n00:11:49.566 --> 00:11:54.530\n[LAUGH] So we have here, if I wanna\nformat those, I can go ahead and\n\n233\n00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.510\nselect them, get the paragraphs that I\nwant selected, because remember I have\n\n234\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.450\nformatted these paragraphs, so all those\ntab stops that I did here they don't\n\n235\n00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.930\napply to these cuz well I didn't have\nthem selected, so I've selected them.\n\n236\n00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.720\nSo let's take the first\ntime that we hit the tab,\n\n237\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.360\nI wanna make a centered align tab stop.\n\n238\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.940\nSo I'm going to cycle through, whoops.\n\n239\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.840\nI clicked too many times,\nlet me cycle back one click.\n\n240\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.800\nThere, one more time after the L,\nthere we go.\n\n241\n00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.260\nSo I have like the perpendicular mark or\nthe upside down T for\n\n242\n00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.020\nit centering and\nI'm gonna put it out, let's put\n\n243\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.350\nit out kind of towards the middlish of the\npage and notice that now I'm formating,\n\n244\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.910\nand I'll move it over so you can\nkind of see it a little bit better.\n\n245\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.780\nThat this is where the text is going to\nstop and you can see it especially when\n\n246\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.390\nI hold down, you can see that line\nthat line that goes all the way down.\n\n247\n00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.145\nIt is centering, stop and center.\n\n248\n00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:45.950\nNext one I wanna do,\nI might have varying amounts of text, so\n\n249\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.360\nI don't necessarily want to go ahead and\nleft align it because I could have\n\n250\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.501\nreally long departments or\nI could have a really short department.\n\n251\n00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:58.092\nSo let me cycle through and\nthrow on a right aligned tab stop,\n\n252\n00:12:58.092 --> 00:13:04.070\nso the second tab will be here and\nit will be right aligned.\n\n253\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.750\nSo now, I've set up columns and\nit's easy once I go ahead, now once I've,\n\n254\n00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.140\nI'm in this paragraph that has\nformatted tab stops, when I hit enter,\n\n255\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.911\nit's gonna remember that.\n\n256\n00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:19.683\nSo you can see, on the ruler now, it still\nhas, in this new paragraph, the center and\n\n257\n00:13:19.683 --> 00:13:21.274\nthe right align tab stop, so\n\n258\n00:13:21.274 --> 00:13:24.413\nit's gonna remember from when\nyou hit enter from that.\n\n259\n00:13:24.413 --> 00:13:28.465\nSo if I type in Vonne tab,\nSmith tab, and I am a host,\n\n260\n00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:34.270\nyou can see that I can just quickly\ngo over and just boom, boom, boom.\n\n261\n00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.218\nType, tab, type, tab,\nenter and keep on going,\n\n262\n00:13:37.218 --> 00:13:39.700\nyou can make some pretty awesome columns.\n\n263\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.600\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff.\n\n264\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.444\nI didn't even know that tabs were so\ncomplex.\n\n265\n00:13:44.444 --> 00:13:47.283\nThat you have these abilities\nlurking behind the scenes.\n\n266\n00:13:47.283 --> 00:13:48.819\nI've been over here hitting\nspace bars my whole life.\n\n267\n00:13:48.819 --> 00:13:51.802\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vaughn's empowering me as a person\n\n268\n00:13:51.802 --> 00:13:54.469\nto use Word in ways that\nI never thought possible.\n\n269\n00:13:54.469 --> 00:13:57.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I first learned about tab stops,\n\n270\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.829\nI was kind of like.\n\n271\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.520\n&gt;&gt; But then you start using this and\nyou're like,\n\n272\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.255\nhow did I ever live without this?\n\n273\n00:14:04.255 --> 00:14:08.590\nAnd try to go back, and trying to take\nthat out of your life for a minute.\n\n274\n00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.850\nAll of a sudden they become\nextremely valuable to you.\n\n275\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n276\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.835\nYeah it's like if you're working with two\n\n277\n00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:14.013\nmonitors.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n278\n00:14:14.013 --> 00:14:15.324\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.647\n&gt;&gt; Well because it's going to\n\n303\n00:15:07.647 --> 00:15:10.450\nthe next one.\nI have two formatted tab stops and\n\n304\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.920\nonce you format one it's gonna remember.\n\n305\n00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.452\nNow if I only had it to here,\nlet me move this back over, oops hold on,\n\n306\n00:15:17.452 --> 00:15:22.218\nlet me go ahead and select all the\nparagraph that I want to format first and\n\n307\n00:15:22.218 --> 00:15:23.651\nthen move that over.\n\n308\n00:15:23.651 --> 00:15:27.280\nSo just a little bit and\nmaybe we'll move over to this one too.\n\n309\n00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.960\nWhen I'm back to here if I start\ntabbing from here it's gonna go back to\n\n310\n00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.350\nthe default ones because it's\nsaying first tab is formatted here,\n\n311\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.400\nsecond tab is formatted here.\n\n312\n00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.585\nEverything else we're just\ngoing back to the defaults.\n\n313\n00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:44.374\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nOkay so that's where,\n\n314\n00:15:44.374 --> 00:15:48.355\nif it's all correlated to\nthe amount of tabs you have, and\n\n315\n00:15:48.355 --> 00:15:51.048\nwhere you tell them to be on your ruler.\n\n316\n00:15:51.048 --> 00:15:55.287\nSo once I kind of got that it made sense,\nand I had an example where I was,\n\n317\n00:15:55.287 --> 00:16:00.235\nI couldn't use a bulleted list in this one\nformatting I was doing, I had to make Like\n\n318\n00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:04.862\nindividual letters that were corresponding\nto different parts of anatomy.\n\n319\n00:16:04.862 --> 00:16:08.846\nCuz I was laying out an anatomy and\nphysiology textbook,\n\n320\n00:16:08.846 --> 00:16:12.922\nso I was like, AOP for origin,\nthey stood for something.\n\n321\n00:16:12.922 --> 00:16:17.018\n[LAUGH] I don't know anything about\nanatomy, really, I learned a lot but,\n\n322\n00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.980\nI was just there to format the text.\n\n323\n00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.020\nSo I had to make sure that there\nwas enough space between that\n\n324\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:28.010\nnumbered character, and then the next line\nof text, but then how the line formatted.\n\n325\n00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.708\nSo I had tab stops,\nI had first line indents,\n\n326\n00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:35.470\nI had hanging indents because I wanted to\nmake sure it was all kind of moved over.\n\n327\n00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:40.991\nAnd so that was something that I really\nappreciated knowing about indents,\n\n328\n00:16:40.991 --> 00:16:42.292\nabout tab stops.\n\n329\n00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:46.039\nBecause otherwise, I would have just\nbeen pulling my hair out trying to\n\n330\n00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.755\nget the format the way I want it.\n\n331\n00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:51.901\nThe space, you hit Enter and then space,\nspace, space, to get that thing over.\n\n332\n00:16:51.901 --> 00:16:53.921\n&gt;&gt; You're like, I know it's 32 spaces,\none, two, three, four, five,\n\n333\n00:16:53.921 --> 00:16:54.470\nsix, seven [LAUGH].\n\n334\n00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then you delete a space on\nthe top line and it throws everything off?\n\n335\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.480\nIt's like, wait,\n\n336\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.850\nif you just learn about indents and\ntabs, it'll make your life a lot easier.\n\n337\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.780\nBut there does have to be\nsomething to apply it to, so\n\n338\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.548\nI get you, if you're just like, okay.\n\n339\n00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:10.908\n[LAUGH] You'll get there, I promise.\n\n340\n00:17:10.908 --> 00:17:14.060\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nlet's give it a couple more examples.\n\n341\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.266\nSo down in here,\nI wanted to talk about leaders.\n\n342\n00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:24.430\nI'm a leader, I'm gonna lead you to\nsomewhere, and it's the same idea here.\n\n343\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.190\nAs soon as I show you what this does,\nyou're gonna be, I see this all the time.\n\n344\n00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:34.305\nI want to say, take this tab, go ahead and\nstop, and put actual leader marks,\n\n345\n00:17:34.305 --> 00:17:38.750\ndots, all the way, and\nwhere do you see this?\n\n346\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.478\n&gt;&gt; In a table of contents.\n\n347\n00:17:39.478 --> 00:17:42.470\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, now,\nthere is table of contents\n\n348\n00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:46.010\nin Word that does all this automatically\nfor you, but that's a whole other lesson.\n\n349\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:51.068\nAnd that's more on the formatting\nlong documents in the expert series.\n\n350\n00:17:51.068 --> 00:17:53.992\nBut for here we're going\nto select all the text, and\n\n351\n00:17:53.992 --> 00:17:59.450\nI'm gonna use the Shift-click method, so\nI'm clicking first where I wanna start.\n\n352\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:04.350\nHold my Shift key, click at the end,\nget everything selected in this chunk.\n\n353\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.420\nNow I'm going to go up to my ruler,\n\n354\n00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.030\nand I'm going to put\na right aligned tab style.\n\n355\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.630\nBecause you can see the pages,\nit's a really long book.\n\n356\n00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's 5,000 pages,\n\n357\n00:18:13.618 --> 00:18:14.650\n[LAUGH] hopefully that's all.\n\n358\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.485\n&gt;&gt; That's a thick manual right there.\n\n359\n00:18:17.485 --> 00:18:21.374\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, and I did this for\nthe example in the sense that if I left\n\n360\n00:18:21.374 --> 00:18:24.390\naligned them,\nthen it just wouldn't work as much.\n\n361\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.710\nSo if I right align,\n\n362\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.260\nthen the varying amounts of\ncharacters will stay to the right.\n\n363\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.252\nSo I go ahead and\nput on the right align tab style.\n\n364\n00:18:30.252 --> 00:18:33.720\nAnd you're like, okay, well that's great,\nwell, what about leaders?\n\n365\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.661\nThis is where all the things I've been\nshowing you right now have just been\n\n366\n00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:39.470\nclicking on the ruler and moving them\naround and doing all that stuff.\n\n367\n00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.160\nWell there is a whole tabs\ndialog box that you can get to.\n\n368\n00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.990\nAnd one of the options that you can\nhave on that tab stop would be,\n\n369\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.870\nadd a leader mark.\n\n370\n00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:55.090\nHow do you get to that, you double\nclick on the tab stop on the ruler.\n\n371\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.122\nSo if I click, click, right here,\nI'm hovering over that one.\n\n372\n00:18:58.122 --> 00:19:02.223\nIt brings up my tabs dialogue box,\nand now I can go ahead and\n\n373\n00:19:02.223 --> 00:19:05.760\ndo the things like,\nlet's format this tab stop.\n\n374\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.980\nAnd this is the only one I have in here,\nI go ahead and click the number 2.\n\n375\n00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.640\nAlways get in the habit of clicking set,\nbecause sometimes it doesn't always get\n\n376\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.340\nthat, especially when you have multiples\nwhich I'll go back and show you.\n\n377\n00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:23.250\nYou click OK, and look at that,\nisn't that cute, ta-da, table of contents.\n\n378\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.093\n&gt;&gt; Very cool!\n&gt;&gt; So your leader marks,\n\n379\n00:19:25.093 --> 00:19:27.990\nyou definitely see this\nin things like that.\n\n380\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.520\nAnd you can see that there was other\ncharacters in there if you wanted to do\n\n381\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.334\nunderscores, so\nthat it made a straight line.\n\n382\n00:19:34.535 --> 00:19:36.545\nSo then you could go ahead and do this.\n\n383\n00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:39.045\nLet's say if you had sub-chapters,\n\n384\n00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:43.165\nif I wanted to move this in,\nthen you just move in the left indent.\n\n385\n00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:48.900\nI'm kind of combining lessons, this is\na tabs episode, but indents can be good.\n\n386\n00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.493\nMaybe I'll make this part bold and\nwhatnot, okay, that's perfect.\n\n387\n00:19:52.493 --> 00:19:56.046\nAnd I'm also giving you\na little taste for, hey,\n\n388\n00:19:56.046 --> 00:19:58.510\nI wanna do this across all of this.\n\n389\n00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.960\nStyles, styles, styles,\nstyles, I love styles,\n\n390\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.905\nit's coming up next if you're\nwatching in succession.\n\n391\n00:20:05.905 --> 00:20:08.050\n[LAUGH] And in the order that\nI'm filming them right now.\n\n392\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.311\n[LAUGH] But we have that,\nand just remember that,\n\n393\n00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:15.608\nI could make this into a style,\ncuz styles get all of your formatting.\n\n394\n00:20:15.608 --> 00:20:17.310\nBut cool thing with tab leaders,\n\n395\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:22.480\nlet me go back to that example that\nwe did with the three tabs here.\n\n396\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.830\nBecause I could use the dialog\nbox to format those,\n\n397\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.290\nbecause maybe I realize\nthat this second column,\n\n398\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.716\nthis photo column, I have it centered, but\nI would really like that left aligned.\n\n399\n00:20:34.716 --> 00:20:40.480\nI could pull this off the ruler, I could\ndo this, I could pull it off the ruler.\n\n400\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.440\nIt's okay,\ndon't worry if it's freaking out.\n\n401\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.140\nGo ahead and\ncycle through to my left align tab,\n\n402\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.620\nstop, that's the right, click it again,\nkeep going, one more, there.\n\n403\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.279\nI could then say, there you go, and\nnow I've got the left align tab stop, and\n\n404\n00:20:53.279 --> 00:20:54.083\nI could do that.\n\n405\n00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:57.638\nNo problem, but I could have,\nI just undoed it.\n\n406\n00:20:57.638 --> 00:20:58.630\n&gt;&gt;

You're trying to tell me,\nVonne, that after we do this,\n\n423\n00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:52.479\nthere will be a fully cooked turkey?\n\n424\n00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:55.289\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there will, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n425\n00:21:55.289 --> 00:22:00.597\nSo you select the tabs that I want,\nI will change it from center to left,\n\n426\n00:22:00.597 --> 00:22:04.680\nclick Set, click OK, and\nnow I've changed it there.\n\n427\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.400\nSo if you wanna use the dialog box\nthrough all of this, go right ahead.\n\n428\n00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.886\nIf you wanna just use the ruler,\nand then pulling them on and\n\n429\n00:22:12.886 --> 00:22:17.446\npulling them off again, and changing and\nmoving around, that's fine too.\n\n430\n00:22:17.446 --> 00:22:22.240\nSo we did the leaders,\nlet's move on to the bar [LAUGH].\n\n431\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.976\nWe have our bar tabs, so you can see here,\nlet me turn show/hide characters.\n\n432\n00:22:26.976 --> 00:22:31.683\nIt's very similar to what we\ndid in that first example, but\n\n433\n00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:37.000\nhere I have it to where there is a bar,\na physical bar, at each one.\n\n434\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.810\nNow let me turn these back on, to show you\nthat these paragraphs, let me zoom in too.\n\n435\n00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:50.480\nThe first one right here, see,\nthere's my first tab, and it shows a bar.\n\n436\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:57.360\nThen the next tab, so that's tab one,\ntab two, this is the left aligned,\n\n437\n00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:03.170\nthen there's tab three, and\nthen there is tab four.\n\n438\n00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:07.814\nSo there are multiples in here,\nit wasn't just like one, two,\n\n439\n00:23:07.814 --> 00:23:12.636\nfirst last department,\nit is first bar, last bar, department.\n\n440\n00:23:12.636 --> 00:23:18.668\nSo you have to have some other tab stops\nin there along the way to get you there.\n\n441\n00:23:18.668 --> 00:23:24.010\nSo I'm in this paragraph, there's nothing\nin there, so it's just like we did before.\n\n442\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.270\nNow, I'm actually starting from,\nI don't have any text type in, and\n\n443\n00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.100\nyou could do this.\n\n444\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.810\nCuz all the other examples,\nI had everything already there,\n\n445\n00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.290\nyou could format beforehand,\nget to where your tabs want to be.\n\n446\n00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.800\nAnd then start typing, hit the Tab, and\n\n447\n00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.440\nit's just gonna stop\nright where you want it.\n\n448\n00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.378\nSo whether you wanna type first,\nor not type first, it's up to you.\n\n449\n00:23:42.378 --> 00:23:46.473\nBut I'm going to format this to where\nI'm going to find, let's cycle through,\n\n450\n00:23:46.473 --> 00:23:50.630\nfind that bar, go ahead and put it, and\nI'll move it over just a little bit.\n\n451\n00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:55.393\nThere's my first bar tab,\nand you can see the line.\n\n452\n00:23:55.393 --> 00:24:00.402\nThen I'm going to tab again, and\nI'm going to make it centered,\n\n453\n00:24:00.402 --> 00:24:05.886\nso I'll put that there Cycle through\nagain, go to the bar again [LAUGH].\n\n454\n00:24:05.886 --> 00:24:09.834\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, okay [LAUGH].\n\n455\n00:24:09.834 --> 00:24:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Queue the piano music,\nSam and Norm [LAUGH].\n\n456\n00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:20.091\n&gt;&gt; Norm, wow, that brings back memories,\nI used to watch that with my dad.\n\n457\n00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:20.619\n&gt;&gt; I loved that show.\n\n458\n00:24:20.619 --> 00:24:21.777\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Loved that show.\n\n459\n00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:26.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So now, I have a right-align\ntab stop and then I'm going to click\n\n460\n00:24:26.895 --> 00:24:32.290\nit here, so, I've got tab one,\ntab two, tab three, tab four.\n\n461\n00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.970\nHere's my flashing cursor in this\nparagraph, so I type in Norm,\n\n462\n00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:41.041\nI don't remember what his\nlast name was Norm, Norm?\n\n463\n00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.790\n&gt;&gt; Peterson.\n\n464\n00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.134\n&gt;&gt; There you go, Peterson-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Woody always called him\n\n465\n00:24:45.134 --> 00:24:45.653\nMr Peterson.\n\n466\n00:24:45.653 --> 00:24:50.739\n&gt;&gt; That's right, okay, so we have Norm,\nnotice I tabbed and then tabbed again.\n\n467\n00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:54.019\nSo now I've got it here,\nand so now I go ahead and\n\n468\n00:24:54.019 --> 00:24:56.657\ntype in that he was the regular [LAUGH].\n\n469\n00:24:56.657 --> 00:24:57.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n470\n00:24:57.674 --> 00:25:03.289\n&gt;&gt; And there you go,\nso I've made bar tabs,\n\n471\n00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:08.720\nokay, and then we had a Woody, what?\n\n472\n00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.211\n&gt;&gt; I do not know his\nlast name from the show.\n\n473\n00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:11.438\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't either.\n\n474\n00:25:11.438 --> 00:25:12.759\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we could always do Sam.\n\n475\n00:25:12.759 --> 00:25:13.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Sam Malone.\n\n476\n00:25:13.674 --> 00:25:14.254\n&gt;&gt; Sam Malone.\n\n477\n00:25:14.254 --> 00:25:18.951\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] And so you can see I've\nmade the bar tab where it is a stop and\n\n478\n00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:21.469\nit's going to go ahead and move over.\n\n479\n00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:24.974\nSo pretty cute little thing\nif you wanted to do this,\n\n480\n00:25:24.974 --> 00:25:30.180\nnow I will say right here if I wanted\nseparations between my columns.\n\n481\n00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.130\nAnd then really if you\nwanted to say your rows,\n\n482\n00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.099\nthis is where, should I use a table or\nshould I use tab stops?\n\n483\n00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.450\nIt depends,\nin the example that I gave earlier\n\n484\n00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:44.150\nwhen I was laying out that textbook, there\nwas no way I was ever gonna use tables.\n\n485\n00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.157\nBecause it was all text as text format and\nof where I needed to start and\n\n486\n00:25:48.157 --> 00:25:52.597\nmove around within the lines, so the tabs\nwith the indents was the way to go.\n\n487\n00:25:52.597 --> 00:25:57.120\nBut if I am making a tabular\nform of data here with rows and\n\n488\n00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:03.010\ncolumns, you might wanna go ahead and\njust throw it into a table.\n\n489\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.013\nThere's pluses and minuses here,\nand if you have a table,\n\n490\n00:26:06.013 --> 00:26:08.956\nyou can do some really cool\nformats with table styles, and\n\n491\n00:26:08.956 --> 00:26:12.078\nhow you can format the whole row, and-\n&gt;&gt; You can link it to Excel and\n\n492\n00:26:12.078 --> 00:26:15.495\nthen make a change in Excel and it shows\nup, that was insane, that was awesome.\n\n493\n00:26:15.495 --> 00:26:19.388\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we can do that here,\nyeah, we can do all of that,\n\n494\n00:26:19.388 --> 00:26:24.650\nit's just really, what is the best\nsolution for your particular needs?\n\n495\n00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.970\nAnd, just to let you know,\nthere is a convert text table command,\n\n496\n00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.030\nthere's also a convert\ntable to text command.\n\n497\n00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:40.067\nIf you're thinking about if I was\nto make a table out of lets say,\n\n498\n00:26:40.067 --> 00:26:43.052\nthis example, right?\n\n499\n00:26:43.052 --> 00:26:45.490\nIf I convert the text to table,\n\n500\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:50.960\nI'm saying that at every delimiter,\nnow, what is a delimiter?\n\n501\n00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.890\nIt's a separator, so at every\n\n502\n00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:04.200\ntab, make a column,\nat every enter, make a row, so\n\n503\n00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.810\nif you have a delimiter character and\nthis could even be spaces.\n\n504\n00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.695\nYou could use it like, add every space,\nbut if you had multiple spaces,\n\n505\n00:27:11.695 --> 00:27:14.935\nlike two spaces, then it's gonna make two\ncolumns and it can get a little wonky.\n\n506\n00:27:14.935 --> 00:27:17.340\nBut if I have tab, tab, tab,\n\n507\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.970\nthat delimiter creates\nthe different columns and rows.\n\n508\n00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.540\nBut, it could be a tab, it could be\na comma, it could be a semicolon,\n\n509\n00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.110\nit could be a space, and\nyou can choose that.\n\n510\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:31.758\nThis isn't the tables episode, but I\nfigured I would show you really quick and\n\n511\n00:27:31.758 --> 00:27:32.964\nthrow it out there.\n\n512\n00:27:32.964 --> 00:27:37.299\nConvert text to tables,\nits gonna automatically find that there is\n\n513\n00:27:37.299 --> 00:27:41.874\na separate or a delimiter with tabs and\nit will go ahead and create that.\n\n514\n00:27:41.874 --> 00:27:46.221\nThe same way is if you take a table and\nconvert it to text, it'll ask you,\n\n515\n00:27:46.221 --> 00:27:50.660\nwell then, what do you want me to create\nas a delimiter for those columns?\n\n516\n00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.545\nAnd if you chose tabs then you'd have tabs\nand then you can format with tab stops and\n\n517\n00:27:54.545 --> 00:27:56.590\nthen do all sorts of\nfun stuff with that so.\n\n518\n00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:03.482\nSomething for me, I'm a geek, I'm like,\nthat's so neat, but just wanted\n\n519\n00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:08.443\nto throw that out there for you,\nthe last one would be our decimal tabs.\n\n520\n00:28:08.443 --> 00:28:12.538\nSo I have some sales here, and this is\nwhere if you're gonna be doing a lot of\n\n521\n00:28:12.538 --> 00:28:14.946\nnumber crunching and formatting numbers.\n\n522\n00:28:14.946 --> 00:28:20.264\nAnd/or just keeping things in a tabular\ntype of format, I would probably\n\n523\n00:28:20.264 --> 00:28:26.120\ngo over to Excel, Word is a word processor\nbut if you're doing an annual report.\n\n524\n00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:30.811\nFor your company of where it's gonna\nbe a lot of text and pictures and\n\n525\n00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:36.176\ncharts and data, Excel is not a word\nprocessor and Word is not a spread sheet.\n\n526\n00:28:36.176 --> 00:28:40.578\n&gt;&gt; It just comes down to,\nis the juice worth the squeeze,\n\n527\n00:28:40.578 --> 00:28:43.220\ndo I need to go fully into Excel?\n\n528\n00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.040\nI'm gonna be doing a lot of number\ncrunching and math and spreadsheet type of\n\n529\n00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.830\nstuff or am I gonna have a little bit\nof it and Word can handle it for me?\n\n530\n00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.603\n&gt;&gt; Is the juice worth the squeeze,\nI don't think I've ever heard that,\n\n531\n00:28:53.603 --> 00:28:54.357\nthat's awesome.\n\n532\n00:28:54.357 --> 00:29:00.494\nAnd I was like yeah, totally, I got you\nthere, or just buy it from the store.\n\n533\n00:29:00.494 --> 00:29:01.113\n&gt;&gt; In a carton.\n\n534\n00:29:01.113 --> 00:29:04.861\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I have my paragraphs\n\n535\n00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:11.040\nselected with decimals in there,\nI think you know what's coming.\n\n536\n00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:17.252\nI choose the decimal tab stop on my\nruler or select our area over there,\n\n537\n00:29:17.252 --> 00:29:24.010\nI click and notice that now the decimals\nare what is lining up after that tab.\n\n538\n00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:29.731\nSo it's stopping at the decimal,\nlining up so that if I have $12,\n\n539\n00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:35.273\n$123, or $1204 it will go ahead and\nseparate at the tab.\n\n540\n00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:39.377\nAnd so that concludes everything that\nI would like to show you about tabs,\n\n541\n00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:42.880\nthe easiest thing to do is just\nget in there and play with it.\n\n542\n00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.350\nAnd you have to go ahead and\njust try it, go ahead and use tabs,\n\n543\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:50.340\nstop doing those spaces, stop doing the\nmultiple tabs when you can just have 1.\n\n544\n00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:55.133\nJust tell them all to stop at a certain\nplace because you are the ruler,\n\n545\n00:29:55.133 --> 00:29:56.441\nyou like that pun?\n\n546\n00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:57.500\nTa-da.\n\n547\n00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.731\n&gt;&gt;

another great\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:12.810\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.290\nwe are coming back with more\nin our Word 2016 Series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.746\nAnd of course joining us yet again,\nour good friend Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:20.770\nVonne, we're so glad to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.274\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:22.106\n&gt;&gt; I'm so excited.\n\n10\n00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:24.082\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you just can't hide it.\n\n11\n00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.300\n&gt;&gt; I can't.\n\n12\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.695\n&gt;&gt; You're about to lose control.\n\n13\n00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:28.741\n&gt;&gt; And I think I like it.\n\n14\n00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:30.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Probably a little royalty now.\n\n15\n00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:34.229\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm so excited about styles.\n\n16\n00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:38.797\nStyles is probably one of my favorite\nthings to talk about in Word\n\n17\n00:00:38.797 --> 00:00:42.110\nbecause it's one of\nthe best things about it.\n\n18\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.090\nAnd I think it's one of those things\nthat gets so overlooked so many times.\n\n19\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.840\nAnd once you understand styles,\nI think it's again,\n\n20\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.940\none of those things like,\nonce I know this I know what I'm doing.\n\n21\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.067\nAnd I'm gonna use these styles and\nI'm gonna use them efficiently and\n\n22\n00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:01.330\nit's gonna make my life so much easier.\n\n23\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.775\nAnd it's because everything\nin Word is based on a style.\n\n24\n00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:08.591\nWhether you know it or not,\nyour based off that normal style and\n\n25\n00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:13.700\nif you've never even touched them before,\nyour still using them.\n\n26\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.171\nSo in this episode, I want to go and\n\n27\n00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:20.450\njust explain about styles\ninstead of actually doing them.\n\n28\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.904\nThe next episode,\nthere's a styles applied.\n\n29\n00:01:22.904 --> 00:01:26.535\nThat's where you're gonna learn\nhow to make that a heading one.\n\n30\n00:01:26.535 --> 00:01:28.780\nHow do I remove the local overrides?\n\n31\n00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.510\nHow do I create my own styles?\n\n32\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.800\nThat's in the next episode.\n\n33\n00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.860\nThis is like, let's just get our base,\nlet's get our foundation and\n\n34\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.100\nthen we'll go ahead and\nlearn how to do it.\n\n35\n00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.870\nWe have an example ready to go for\nyou here called, well,\n\n36\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.540\nStyles Example and\nI have a nicely formatted document.\n\n37\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.670\nAnd if I scroll through here,\n\n38\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.222\nthis is a very nice looking document,\nisn't it, right?\n\n39\n00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:52.620\nI have some very nice,\n\n40\n00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.980\ndefined headings and I can see that\nAlice in Wonderland is the title.\n\n41\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.810\nThen the next main heading\nwould be Down the Rabbit Hole.\n\n42\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.940\nAnd you see how this one,\nthis Advice from a Caterpillar,\n\n43\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.800\nthis is a little bit smaller and\na slightly different color.\n\n44\n00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.555\nSo it means that indicates something like,\n\n45\n00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:14.380\nwell then this must be like a sub\nheading of Down the Rabbit Hole.\n\n46\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.280\nAnd when you start using headings and\nthe heading levels appropriately,\n\n47\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.390\nit may still like ease of readability,\nif you wanna say.\n\n48\n00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.890\nWhat am I looking at in my document?\n\n49\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.730\nAnd if you start looking at this,\nlook at textbooks,\n\n50\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.770\nlook at the newspaper,\nthey have headings where ,okay,\n\n51\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.350\nthis part of the article is going to\nbe titled, you know, bunnies on a log.\n\n52\n00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.832\nI have no idea where that came from.\n\n53\n00:02:40.832 --> 00:02:42.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to pull something out but,\n\n54\n00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.292\n[LAUGH] hey, there you go,\nbunnies on a log.\n\n55\n00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:45.122\n&gt;&gt; This is what you get sometimes right?\n\n56\n00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:46.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n57\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.650\nWhen your brain's like,\nyou're just you're talking and\n\n58\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.930\nyou're thinking about what can I think\nabout a really cool title and it just?\n\n59\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Bunnies on a log?\n\n60\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.664\nI can't wait to see that movie.\n\n61\n00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:55.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so, but\n\n63\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.500\nyou get the idea like I have\nlike it's an organizing\n\n64\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.830\nmechanism of your information.\n\n65\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.740\nAnd so, you see this.\n\n66\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.580\nYou see it all the time.\n\n67\n00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.330\nBut maybe what you've been doing for your\nheadings is selecting the text, change\n\n68\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.690\nthe font, change the size, change the\ncolor, maybe making it centered in there.\n\n69\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.550\nTotally fine because I\nshowed you how to do that.\n\n70\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.510\nI showed you how to format your text,\nwe did character formatting,\n\n71\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.001\nwe did paragraph formation.\n\n72\n00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:27.885\nYeah, I'm gonna go ahead and\ngo crazy in my document.\n\n73\n00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:30.652\nWell, there's an easier way to do it,\nstyles.\n\n74\n00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:31.246\n&gt;&gt; Styles.\n\n75\n00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:32.560\n&gt;&gt; Yes, styles.\n\n76\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.000\nSo, what is a style?\n\n77\n00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.620\nA style is,\nit's a named group of formatting and\n\n78\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.540\nthat could be character level formatting\nand or paragraph level formatting.\n\n79\n00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.950\nSo everything that I want\nto do to format my text,\n\n80\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.600\nI put it under like a named style and\nthen I can go ahead and apply it.\n\n81\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.700\nNow, there are default styles and\nthere are created styles.\n\n82\n00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.270\nNow, ones that come with the program or\nones that I can create.\n\n83\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.890\nI can make my own style.\n\n84\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.130\nSo you can see here, I have up at the top,\nso we're on the home tab of\n\n85\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.010\nour ribbon and then in the home tab,\nwe have the group name styles.\n\n86\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.390\nAnd so, with these styles you could\nsee that I have a couple now.\n\n87\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.830\nYou could probably notice.\n\n88\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.610\nSo Danny, do you think that Vonne styles\nis something that's part of Word?\n\n89\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.282\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with\nabsolutely positively no.\n\n90\n00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:24.132\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so I created it.\n\n91\n00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:27.710\nYes, so I can control making\nmy own styles in here.\n\n92\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.010\nSo if you open up Word and be like,\n\n93\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.900\nI don't see this like pink cooper\nblack text, that's because I did that.\n\n94\n00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.900\nOops I just showed you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n95\n00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.600\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of how you\n\n96\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.920\ncan kind of apply it, but\nwe're just explaining right now.\n\n97\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.360\nSo this group right here and\nyou might even see more,\n\n98\n00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.790\nbecause your ribbon might show more\nthan what I have displayed, but\n\n99\n00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.130\nthere is the little drop down,\nthe more button.\n\n100\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.800\nThey actually call it the more button and\nyou can drop this down and\n\n101\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.680\nsee that these are the ones.\n\n102\n00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.950\nSo, Normal, the Heading 1,\nthe Heading 3, the Title,\n\n103\n00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.938\nthese are all parts of\nWord that comes with it.\n\n104\n00:04:56.938 --> 00:05:02.900\nAnd we're gonna get into some style sets,\nthis is the default Office style set.\n\n105\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.660\nDon't worry about that for right now,\njust know they live in Word.\n\n106\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.715\nSo, when I'm looking through Word, how do\nI know what style is applied in the text.\n\n107\n00:05:13.715 --> 00:05:16.610\nWell,you can probably start\nlooking at it like, right now,\n\n108\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.110\nas I'm explaining this, if I click\nmy cursor in Down the Rabbit Hole.\n\n109\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.230\nJust clicking the cursor in the text,\nlook what pops up over here.\n\n110\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.600\nThis little box around, Heading 1.\n\n111\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.040\nIf I click on Advice from a Caterpillar,\nthis is Heading 2.\n\n112\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.150\nI click on Alice in Wonderland and\nit's like, there's no style applied.\n\n113\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.070\nIt is, it's just hiding.\n\n114\n00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.775\nAnd there is like a little bump down,\n\n115\n00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:42.770\ncuz there are multiple rows within\nthis style gallery, as it's called.\n\n116\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.920\nSo, if I bump it down, there it is.\n\n117\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.000\nIt's just I wasn't being able to see it.\n\n118\n00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.530\nSo, if I drop that down,\nyou can see it here, as well.\n\n119\n00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.390\nSo, you can find out what style is\n\n120\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.510\napplied to your text by just clicking on\nit and looking at what's going on in here.\n\n121\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.820\nIf I click my cursor here,\n\n122\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.750\nthis is, let me go back up one row,\nthis is the Normal style.\n\n123\n00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.250\nYou might've heard me say this before\nin some of my other episodes because\n\n124\n00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.930\neverything, everything is based\noff of the Normal style in Word.\n\n125\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.660\nWhen you start a new document and\n\n126\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.930\nyou start typing,\nyou're typing in the Normal style.\n\n127\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.020\nWhether or not you've highlighted it and\nchange the color and everything,\n\n128\n00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.990\nit's still Normal, so\nthat's the default thing in all of Word.\n\n129\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.860\nWhen I come down here, oops sorry.\n\n130\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.750\nYou see this one where it says, she found\nherself falling down a very deep well.\n\n131\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.370\nThat just looks like we\napplied the bold and\n\n132\n00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.680\nthe italic character level\nformatting on there.\n\n133\n00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.100\nYes, but,\nit's actually all wrapped up into a style.\n\n134\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.060\nIf I scroll down or drop this down,\nthis is known as the Book Title.\n\n135\n00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.830\nWell that's not the book title.\n\n136\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.324\nAnd that's okay,\nthat's just what they named it, okay.\n\n137\n00:06:53.324 --> 00:06:55.840\nIt's still just a named\ngroup of formatting.\n\n138\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.370\nNow, I could rename that\nstyle if I really wanted to.\n\n139\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.690\nAnd you're like well, why wouldn't I just\ngo ahead and just mark it up as bold and\n\n140\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.780\nI tab when needed?\n\n141\n00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.350\nSee right there and\nright there and right there.\n\n142\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.150\nWe know about how to select multiple lines\nof texts or multiple variables of texts.\n\n143\n00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.210\nAnd I could just click the buttons.\n\n144\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.300\nNo problem, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.210\nBut, the real power of\nusing a style is that\n\n146\n00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.640\nwhen you apply a style to your text,\nit's all connected to that source.\n\n147\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.051\nYou change the source, you change\neverything of where it's applied.\n\n148\n00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:33.316\nSweet, so if I had 150 pages and I made\neverything bold and italic by the old\n\n149\n00:07:33.316 --> 00:07:37.850\nschool way, well, it's not old school but-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the normal ways.\n\n150\n00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.490\nThe manual.\n\n151\n00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.596\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; We'll say the manual way,\n\n152\n00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:41.030\nI'm not using a style.\n\n153\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.530\nWell then I'm like, you know what,\nI want them all to be green now, okay, or\n\n154\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.150\nI really want then all\nto be a different font.\n\n155\n00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.998\nHow do I change it?\n\n156\n00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:50.525\nI know we've talked about using find and\nreplace,\n\n157\n00:07:50.525 --> 00:07:53.659\nwe've talked about selecting\nall of these different pieces.\n\n158\n00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:56.413\nAnd I might as well go ahead and\nthrow this in there right now,\n\n159\n00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:59.657\nthere is this select and I haven't\npointed this out in other episodes,\n\n160\n00:07:59.657 --> 00:08:01.136\nis you have something known as.\n\n161\n00:08:01.136 --> 00:08:05.249\nSelect all text with similar formatting,\nthat could be really,\n\n162\n00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:09.310\nreally handy for the manual way\nof applying something, right.\n\n163\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.930\nI know I made them all bold, or\nI know I made them all italic, so\n\n164\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.280\nyou click on the text where\nyou want to then say select\n\n165\n00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.810\neverything with that formatting and\nit will select it.\n\n166\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.530\nThat's super handy.\n\n167\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.480\n&gt;&gt; That is very nice.\n\n168\n00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n169\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.590\nSo, yes, you can totally do this and\nthen say now I wanna make it green.\n\n170\n00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.100\nSo, why use the style?\n\n171\n00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.860\nBut, it's just another way of doing it.\n\n172\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.690\nIt's just another way to\nkinda get to the same point.\n\n173\n00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.160\nIt just has that extra level to where\nmodify the style, everything changes.\n\n174\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.710\nSweet, so that's the whole like\nreason why you want to use styles.\n\n175\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.520\nAnd then how to identify the styles\nwill be through clicking on it and\n\n176\n00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.060\ngoing up to the styles and\nseeing what it looks like.\n\n177\n00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.010\nNow, and\nyou can also see that if you pause it,\n\n178\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.364\nwell then how do I apply a style?\n\n179\n00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:53.100\nIt's pretty easy,\nyou actually just do click it, okay.\n\n180\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.600\nSo that's it.\n\n181\n00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.695\nYou're gonna make a whole episode on that.\n\n182\n00:08:55.695 --> 00:08:57.367\nThere is all the things I am going\nto include in there [LAUGH].\n\n183\n00:08:57.367 --> 00:09:00.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You do have that previewing going on.\n\n184\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.270\nBut there is also something known as, I am\ngonna say a lot, local overrides, okay.\n\n185\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.280\nThe local overriding the global style.\n\n186\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.060\nLocal, whatever is closest wins.\n\n187\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.511\nAnd this is the whole,\nhey I went ahead and took my text,\n\n188\n00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.410\nselected it and made it a certain color.\n\n189\n00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.230\nWell if I click on here,\nsee, it says normal.\n\n190\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.900\nThis is the normal style.\n\n191\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.330\nAnd if I select this and\nmake it red and I make it centered,\n\n192\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.140\nit still says that it's normal, okay?\n\n193\n00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.230\nIf I click on this where it says,\nI actually typed in,\n\n194\n00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.682\nthis is not a heading 1.\n\n195\n00:09:33.682 --> 00:09:36.131\nStyle overrides, this is a heading 1.\n\n196\n00:09:36.131 --> 00:09:40.451\nSo we're formatting as a heading 1, but\nthis is like I copied the formatting to\n\n197\n00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:44.834\nmake it look like it, but it's really just\nthe normal style with a local override\n\n198\n00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.625\nto make it look like\nthe formatting of a heading 1.\n\n199\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.570\nSo, this is what a lot\nof people do in Word.\n\n200\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:58.030\nAgain, nothing wrong with it, but just\nknowing what it's doing and why sometimes\n\n201\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.130\nif you go and change the normal style\nthen why is everything else changing.\n\n202\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.810\nI thought I selected it and\nmade it different.\n\n203\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.530\nWell, you changed that style,\nit's still the base.\n\n204\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.314\nChange the base, change it all.\n\n205\n00:10:08.314 --> 00:10:11.440\nSo that's where, I think,\nit's like, why is it doing this?\n\n206\n00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.855\nWhy is this formatted as a heading too?\n\n207\n00:10:14.855 --> 00:10:17.780\nAnd why is there a triangle\nthing right next to it?\n\n208\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.554\nWell, that's because this is just like\na default formatting with the show high\n\n209\n00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:22.440\ncharacters.\n\n210\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.992\nAnd really just and also, it's not even\ngonna show high characters necessarily,\n\n211\n00:10:26.992 --> 00:10:31.160\nit's just kinda showing you that\nthis is a formatted heading level.\n\n212\n00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.591\nAnd when you're using heading levels,\n\n213\n00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:37.951\nyou're using that organization of\nyour document to say that the title,\n\n214\n00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:41.825\nthen the heading 1, then the heading 2,\nthen the heading 3.\n\n215\n00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:45.190\nAnd this is where, if you're thinking\nabout, it's an outline, right?\n\n216\n00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.414\nI'm outlining that these are the major\npieces and this is all the details and\n\n217\n00:10:49.414 --> 00:10:54.171\nso you can actually use these to collapse\nthem because I'm structuring my document.\n\n218\n00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:57.917\nThey're structure tags, and actually\nin HTML all of these H1, I'm sorry,\n\n219\n00:10:57.917 --> 00:10:59.760\nheading 1s, which is an H1 and H2.\n\n220\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.789\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They're known as structure tags cuz\n\n221\n00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:03.718\nyou're structuring up whats on the page.\n\n222\n00:11:03.718 --> 00:11:07.104\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's why it's like hey, this\n\n223\n00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:13.510\nis all heading 2 but it really looks like\nit's like a normal text, but it's not.\n\n224\n00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.700\nSo just knowing I got\nsome things going on and\n\n225\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.690\nthis is like it's base formatting,\nis good to help you.\n\n226\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:27.840\nNow, there are a lot of different places\nthat you can go for people like me,\n\n227\n00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.310\nthat I wanna know what's going on\nwith all this text and to really see\n\n228\n00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.980\nunder the hood, I see what it looks like,\nbut what's the formatting underneath it?\n\n229\n00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.060\nYou have something known\nas the style inspector.\n\n230\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.390\nNow the style inspector is where you\nget through from the styles panel, so\n\n231\n00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.720\nthere's a lot of these the styles panel,\nthen there's the styles gallery, and then\n\n232\n00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.970\nthere's, they all have a lot of the same\nnames, but they have different features.\n\n233\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.690\nLet me show you.\n\n234\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.520\nIf I drop this down here,\nyou can go to apply styles.\n\n235\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.980\nAnd if I click on that, it brings\nup the supply styles dialogue box.\n\n236\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.970\nWell, that's not much\ndifferent than this thing.\n\n237\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.990\nThis is where I can go and apply styles.\n\n238\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.190\nOkay, so I don't use this\none too much honestly, but\n\n239\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.520\nI do get to the styles pane from here.\n\n240\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.850\nI click on this, and it brings up.\n\n241\n00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.670\nAnd now this is not a docked panel by the\nway, so notice I can drag this around so\n\n242\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.220\nit's free floating.\n\n243\n00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.620\nAnd I have the styles panel, and\nactually it's behind my head, so\n\n244\n00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.540\nlet's go ahead and take me out.\n\n245\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.800\nAnd down here, there is a, not that one,\nit's that one, you see it's really small.\n\n246\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.010\nThat's the wrong key.\n\n247\n00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.400\nIt is two little a's with a magnifying\nglass on it, that is the style inspector,\n\n248\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.160\nand it will inspect your styles.\n\n249\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.872\nSo if I click on the More Examples\nof Styles, this is a title.\n\n250\n00:12:43.872 --> 00:12:47.551\nAnd it's kind of like instead I can\nsee it from up here in the gallery,\n\n251\n00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:51.549\nI can come over here to see that this\nis the paragraph level formatting, and\n\n252\n00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:55.357\nthen any type of overrides,\nthe second column, that's not a column,\n\n253\n00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:59.720\nthat's the second row, second field,\nthat tells me the different overrides.\n\n254\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.590\nIf I clicked here, ooh,\nI can see that this is a normal style,\n\n255\n00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.930\nbut then look at the stuff that is\noverriding it on the text level.\n\n256\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.810\nIt is doing a Calibri font,\nit is 16 points and it's accent one.\n\n257\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.380\nSo I know that this is not the source.\n\n258\n00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.096\nIf there's,\nif both of these fields were blank,\n\n259\n00:13:19.096 --> 00:13:23.080\nthen I know that is like\nthe true essence of the style.\n\n260\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.240\nThere is no overrides going on in here.\n\n261\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.439\nIf I click here, this is a normal\nparagraph style, and now they put the,\n\n262\n00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:37.250\nred and the font, those are character\nlevel formats, that would be text level.\n\n263\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.060\nSo why is it not put it on down here?\n\n264\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:46.620\nThis kinda correlates with what\ntypes of styles you have in Word.\n\n265\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.410\nIn regular typography,\nyou can have character styles and\n\n266\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.140\nyou can have paragraph styles.\n\n267\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.700\nSo, Word's not a regular?\n\n268\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.410\nIt is.\n\n269\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.671\nBut I'm just trying to get to where\na paragraph style is going to have all\n\n270\n00:14:02.671 --> 00:14:07.657\nparagraph level formatting and text\nformat, character formatting inside of it.\n\n271\n00:14:07.657 --> 00:14:12.712\nIf it's just character level formatting,\nor character level style, just a character\n\n272\n00:14:12.712 --> 00:14:17.356\nstyle, the only thing it's going to hold\ninto itself is going to be any character\n\n273\n00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:22.342\nlevel formatting, like the font, the size,\nthe color and everything like that, and\n\n274\n00:14:22.342 --> 00:14:26.126\nit does not have anything to do\nwith paragraph level formatting.\n\n275\n00:14:26.126 --> 00:14:30.254\nParagraph, or paragraph styles,\nis just one up, so\n\n276\n00:14:30.254 --> 00:14:36.151\nthat's why this isn't here,\nbecause normal is a paragraph-only style.\n\n277\n00:14:36.151 --> 00:14:41.091\nA lot of the styles in Word are what\nare known as linked styles,\n\n278\n00:14:41.091 --> 00:14:47.090\nthat they are character and paragraph,\nwhich is like well, I can do both.\n\n279\n00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:48.410\nLet me show you.\n\n280\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.690\nSo, I'm going to scroll on\nup to this one right here.\n\n281\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.088\nHow do I know that this is a linked style?\n\n282\n00:14:53.088 --> 00:14:58.115\nWell, I know styles pretty well in Word,\nbut let me show you where I can find it.\n\n283\n00:14:58.115 --> 00:15:01.980\nIf you right-click, so I'll,\nmake sure always that your cursor is in\n\n284\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.350\nthe style before you start going and\nmodifying and going into these places.\n\n285\n00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.320\nIf I right-click on Heading 1,\nand I go into Modify,\n\n286\n00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.240\nit brings me into, this is the source,\nthis is the behind the scenes of,\n\n287\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:21.140\nthis is the level at where\nHeading 1 gets its formats.\n\n288\n00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.890\nAnd I can see that it is right here,\nlinked,\n\n289\n00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:29.280\nwhich is paragraph and character okay.\n\n290\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.416\nJust say okay for now [LAUGH].\n\n291\n00:15:31.416 --> 00:15:32.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect [LAUGH].\n\n292\n00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:37.563\nIf I come over to Normal, let me click\nmy cursor into the Normal paragraph that\n\n293\n00:15:37.563 --> 00:15:41.570\nhas it applied, right-click,\nand go to Modify paragraph.\n\n294\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.770\nThis is a paragraph level formatting.\n\n295\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:49.424\nThe only way that you can apply this\nstyle would be to the entire paragraph,\n\n296\n00:15:49.424 --> 00:15:52.316\nnot just one word within a paragraph.\n\n297\n00:15:52.316 --> 00:15:54.140\nLet's go one more.\n\n298\n00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.950\nThis one.\n\n299\n00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.880\nThe one that we said was a book title.\n\n300\n00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.288\nAnd notice by the way, you see this style\ninspector in the stylist panel over here?\n\n301\n00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:01.344\nIt's behind my head, but\n\n302\n00:16:01.344 --> 00:16:04.622\nit is highlighting in all those different\nplaces, see there's the book title.\n\n303\n00:16:04.622 --> 00:16:07.288\nIf I clicked here See there,\nit takes Heading 1,\n\n304\n00:16:07.288 --> 00:16:09.825\nso all these different\nplaces where I say you can\n\n305\n00:16:09.825 --> 00:16:14.280\nfind these different dialogue boxes\nto display what's going on here.\n\n306\n00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.736\nBack over into here, book title.\n\n307\n00:16:16.736 --> 00:16:20.779\nClick this, drop this down,\nright click, go to modify.\n\n308\n00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:26.440\nThis is a character because it's only\ngoing to be applying bold and italic.\n\n309\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.570\nThere's nothing else in there.\n\n310\n00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.720\nSo it doesn't need to be a linked or\na paragraph level style.\n\n311\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.370\nSo that's all it is.\n\n312\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.160\nNow, because link,\n\n313\n00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.000\nI'm just gonna go ahead and give you\na little preview of the episode coming up.\n\n314\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.330\nIf I selected just these\nwords in this one paragraph,\n\n315\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.290\nand I clicked on heading one,\nit will apply that\n\n316\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.180\nwhich is strange because usually heading\none is only a paragraph level style.\n\n317\n00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:55.640\nBut in Word, they kind of say well-\n&gt;&gt; They're blurring the lines there for\n\n318\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.340\nyou, yeah.\n\n319\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.531\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly and since a lot,\na lot of people which is completely fine.\n\n320\n00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:03.958\nThey don't know all\nthe nuances of type setting and\n\n321\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:07.553\nlike the hard line rules of paragraph and\ncharacter.\n\n322\n00:17:07.553 --> 00:17:10.583\nIt's like well hey if somebody\nwants to have that formatting.\n\n323\n00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:11.532\n&gt;&gt; Why not let them?\n\n324\n00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, applied to some parts of\nthe text and not the whole paragraph.\n\n325\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.780\nCuz think about it if somebody selected\nthat it's like why is it changing\n\n326\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.260\nthe whole paragraph?\n\n327\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.224\nIt's like, I just want that.\n\n328\n00:17:20.224 --> 00:17:22.244\nSo they just kind of, okay,\nwe'll let people do it.\n\n329\n00:17:22.244 --> 00:17:22.820\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n330\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.913\n&gt;&gt; Why not, so.\n\n331\n00:17:23.913 --> 00:17:26.864\nBut if I took this, and\ntried to, if I went to here,\n\n332\n00:17:26.864 --> 00:17:28.600\nif I selected just this text.\n\n333\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.890\nNow, remember, it's already formatted,\nit's a heading one.\n\n334\n00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.930\nIf I click on normal,\ndo you see how it's no, no,\n\n335\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:40.330\nno like I can't make just those\nwords of a heading one normal.\n\n336\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:46.270\nBecause normal is a strict character\nlevel, no paragraph style.\n\n337\n00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.750\nSo it's gotta apply to the whole side.\n\n338\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.890\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, what happens if you\nselect text from one style and\n\n339\n00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.795\nanother at the same time?\n\n340\n00:17:53.795 --> 00:17:54.387\n&gt;&gt; Well, wait what?\n\n341\n00:17:54.387 --> 00:17:55.204\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n342\n00:17:55.204 --> 00:17:58.980\nsay you had some character formating or\nsomething to do with the style.\n\n343\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.120\nAnd you have one style like you\nhave before she found herself.\n\n344\n00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.650\nWhat if did before she found herself she\nselected that, and you inspected that,\n\n345\n00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.300\nwhat would you get?\n\n346\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:09.860\n&gt;&gt; What's before?\n\n347\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.540\n&gt;&gt; It's in the last sentence in the-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n348\n00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Down one more paragraph.\n\n349\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n350\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.244\nSee it says,\nshe found herself in a very deep well.\n\n351\n00:18:18.244 --> 00:18:19.091\n&gt;&gt; This one.\n\n352\n00:18:19.091 --> 00:18:19.614\nThis one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n353\n00:18:19.614 --> 00:18:22.090\nwhat if you selected\nbefore she found herself?\n\n354\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.750\n&gt;&gt; Before, okay.\n\n355\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.430\n&gt;&gt; See,\nyou've got two different things going on.\n\n356\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.030\n&gt;&gt; That.\n\n357\n00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:26.697\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n358\n00:18:26.697 --> 00:18:27.616\n&gt;&gt; I got you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n359\n00:18:27.616 --> 00:18:28.304\nWhat happens?\n\n360\n00:18:28.304 --> 00:18:29.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, it depends on what you click.\n\n361\n00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because if I selected heading one--\n\n362\n00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.150\n&gt;&gt; It just changed.\n\n363\n00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.430\n&gt;&gt; Now, all of them have heading one.\n\n364\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.990\nYeah, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n365\n00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:39.840\n&gt;&gt; And so it doesn't, and\nthat's where Word is being quite helpful.\n\n366\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.030\nBecause, again,\nif you are in other programs,\n\n367\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.115\nit's following like\nthe strict letter of the law.\n\n368\n00:18:45.115 --> 00:18:46.560\n[LAUGH] It wouldn't let you.\n\n369\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.730\nIt would have that inside of that and\nit would be kind of weird.\n\n370\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.610\nAnd that also depends on what\ntype of style you were choosing,\n\n371\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.380\nwhether a character style or a paragraph.\n\n372\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.925\nHere it's like, okay,\nwe'll just go ahead and, there you go.\n\n373\n00:18:57.925 --> 00:18:58.441\n&gt;&gt; Do whatever you want.\n\n374\n00:18:58.441 --> 00:18:59.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n375\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.450\nAnd I'm gonna take off any style\nthat was associated with the like,\n\n376\n00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.730\nshe found herself falling\ndown a deep well.\n\n377\n00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.600\nThat's all gone, now only this.\n\n378\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.220\nIt doesn't stay with it.\n\n379\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:11.731\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n380\n00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:14.818\nI totally understand what you're saying,\nand that is the answer.\n\n381\n00:19:14.818 --> 00:19:17.824\n[LAUGH] It does what you want it to.\n\n382\n00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:18.970\n&gt;&gt; That's always nice.\n\n383\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like I understand wanting to\n\n384\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.260\nfollow this strict.\n\n385\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.311\nIf we were doing publishing,\nthat would be a different story.\n\n386\n00:19:24.311 --> 00:19:27.906\nYou'd want to stick to the strict letters\nbecause people need to be able to know\n\n387\n00:19:27.906 --> 00:19:31.186\nwhat you have done or apply it or\nprint it or whatever they're gonna do.\n\n388\n00:19:31.186 --> 00:19:33.891\nBut when you're doing\nit on a Word document,\n\n389\n00:19:33.891 --> 00:19:36.249\nthis is more of a guideline than a rule.\n\n390\n00:19:36.249 --> 00:19:38.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's not in design.\n\n391\n00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.520\nI know I've used that correlation quite\na few times, but in design is great, but\n\n392\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.670\nit gives me a lot more but\nit;s gonna be very specific.\n\n393\n00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Strict.\n\n394\n00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you need to understand\nif you have nested styles and\n\n395\n00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.020\nall this kinda stuff.\n\n396\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.630\nWith here,\n\n397\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:58.340\nthey don't go that far because not\neverybody is a designer or type setter.\n\n398\n00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.550\n&gt;&gt; So this will a be really good, well,\n\n399\n00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:06.230\nit might be a really good introduction\nto getting into that level, right?\n\n400\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.790\n&gt;&gt; Completely.\n\n401\n00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n402\n00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.130\nthis is where because I work so\nmuch in styles.\n\n403\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.010\nThat's why this,\nwhy I come back to Word, it's there's so\n\n404\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.720\nmuch that Word can do-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n405\n00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.150\n&gt;&gt; With styles that if,\n\n406\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.630\nif only people just knew-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.216\n&gt;&gt; I just want to tell the world!\n\n408\n00:20:19.216 --> 00:20:20.180\nSo here I am!\n\n409\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.020\n&gt;&gt; Telling the world.\n\n411\n00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.980\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so it's really,\nreally great at how you can do this, so.\n\n412\n00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.970\nBut before we get done with our\nintroduction, I wanted to go back to\n\n413\n00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:35.480\nthe places to find where your styles are\nlike displaying where you can see them.\n\n414\n00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.615\nLet me go ahead and\ntake myself off from behind my head.\n\n415\n00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:40.779\nCuz we talked about the styles pane.\n\n416\n00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:43.884\nWe talked about the in style and specter.\n\n417\n00:20:43.884 --> 00:20:47.190\nA few options that you can do down at\nthe very bottom of the styles panel there\n\n418\n00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.805\nis options.\n\n419\n00:20:47.805 --> 00:20:50.320\nCuz it's showing me everything but\nthere's only so\n\n420\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.950\nmany styles that were\nused in this document.\n\n421\n00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:58.110\nSo if I go to options,\nI can come to select styles to show.\n\n422\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:00.420\nAnd I can just say in\nthe current document.\n\n423\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.390\nOr in use what are the ones that\nare only in this document, and\n\n424\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.120\nmaybe I'll alphabetized them and\nwhen I click okay,\n\n425\n00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.020\nnotice that this list\ngets a lot smaller here.\n\n426\n00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.090\nBecause I'm not going to use\nevery single one of these.\n\n427\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.260\nIf I'm going this like alright,\nwe're going to use heading 1, 2, and 3.\n\n428\n00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.600\nI'm going to use the title and\nI'm going to use the emphasis and\n\n429\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.990\nthe book title cuz I want those.\n\n430\n00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:27.090\nI don't wanna see anything else cuz a lot\nof times I actually keep this panel\n\n431\n00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.930\nopen and\nthis is what I use to apply or modify.\n\n432\n00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.460\nSo all the same things that I was\ndoing up here by right-clicking or\n\n433\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.270\nclicking it to apply and\ndoing all those things.\n\n434\n00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:44.010\nI keep this up because I don't need to\nsee anything more than what I have And\n\n435\n00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:44.870\nI can go from there.\n\n436\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.590\nYou don't have to, but\nI'd just want to show you.\n\n437\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.680\nAnd then, the one other thing I wanted to\nshow you was the reveal formatting pane.\n\n438\n00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.600\nAnd the reveal formatting pane\nis on the style inspector.\n\n439\n00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.784\nAnd these are all in the show notes for\nlike how do you find all this.\n\n440\n00:21:56.784 --> 00:21:59.362\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have to dig down in there.\n\n441\n00:21:59.362 --> 00:22:03.870\nBut it's a little, the capital A,\nA single A with the magnifying glass,\n\n442\n00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.558\nit's reveal formatting.\n\n443\n00:22:05.558 --> 00:22:09.469\nNow, we're getting all sorts of crazy with\nthese panels and everything like that but\n\n444\n00:22:09.469 --> 00:22:12.238\nthe reveal formatting if you're,\nbehind my head you can see\n\n445\n00:22:12.238 --> 00:22:15.733\nthat there are some other things in here,\nlike it's giving me everything.\n\n446\n00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:20.158\nIt's very much like the style inspector,\nso it's like well, what's the difference,\n\n447\n00:22:20.158 --> 00:22:21.930\nbut it shows me everything in here.\n\n448\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.160\nIt's all of the text that I have and\nwhat does it look like and\n\n449\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.610\nit shows me what I'm selected on,\nwhat is the format.\n\n450\n00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.420\nIf I really wanted to get crazy I could\ncompare it with something else and\n\n451\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.020\nthen I click on another, so Wonderland.\n\n452\n00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.690\nThe title versus having and\n\n453\n00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.010\nthen it goes through all\nthe differences and everything.\n\n454\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.955\nAnyone that came over from WordPerfect.\n\n455\n00:22:42.955 --> 00:22:46.240\nYeah, WordPerfect was always something\nthat was always revealing codes or\n\n456\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.010\nrevealing the format.\n\n457\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.500\nI heard a lot of people that were like,\nwhoa, this was\n\n458\n00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.800\nexactly what we're looking for because\nthat's what word perfect used to do.\n\n459\n00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.540\nI knew people that were\nWordPerfect people.\n\n460\n00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.140\nThey did not like coming over to Word.\n\n461\n00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.532\nI want my WordPerfect.\n\n462\n00:22:59.532 --> 00:23:02.373\nI never worked with it, so\nI can't really say anything, but\n\n463\n00:23:02.373 --> 00:23:04.894\nonce I showed in this panel\nthey got a little happier.\n\n464\n00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:05.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n465\n00:23:05.674 --> 00:23:09.850\n&gt;&gt; So, but that's really what I\nwanted to cover for the introduction.\n\n466\n00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:14.720\nGet us familiar with hearing\nthe terminology, knowing where things\n\n467\n00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.460\nare within the gallery or the different\npains, you can get into the places and\n\n468\n00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.180\nso now, we're going to move on\nto actually applying the styles.\n\n469\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.780\nWe did a little bit in here-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit.\n\n470\n00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.660\nWe'll take it a little bit further\nwith create our own styles and\n\n471\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.570\ndo our updating and\nall sorts of fun stuff.\n\n472\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\nwe can't wait to all be styling, right?\n\n473\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:31.480\nAnd profiling.\n\n474\n00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.600\nSo we can't, we got into that and\nmore advanced functionality\n\n475\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.380\nwhen it comes to styles and\nstart applying them to our documents.\n\n476\n00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.830\nBut great introduction so far,\nwe should all be on the same page.\n\n477\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:42.770\nHopefully, anyway.\n\n478\n00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.210\nIf not, not a problem.\n\n479\n00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.560\nRewind, watch again, and\nthen meet us in the next chapter, right?\n\n480\n00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.173\nThat being said, it looks like we've come\nto the end of another great episode,\n\n481\n00:23:50.173 --> 00:23:51.157\nwe do thank you for watching.\n\n482\n00:23:51.157 --> 00:23:53.619\nSigning off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n483\n00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:54.615\n&gt;&gt;

another great\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.484\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:14.983\ntoday's episode it's more\nwith our Word 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:18.140\nHopefully you guys have been enjoying\nit so far, I know I sure have.\n\n7\n00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.547\nI do know another person that's\nbeen enjoying it as well, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:23.542\nshe's super excited about today's episode,\nbecause I know she loves it.\n\n9\n00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.460\nIt is our good friend Miss Vaughn Smith,\nVaughn,\n\n10\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.660\ngood to have you again, how's it going.\n\n11\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.650\n&gt;&gt; Thank you I'm very excited you are-\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n\n12\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.323\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I've been telling you even\noff camera how much I love styles.\n\n13\n00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.010\n&gt;&gt; She's freaking out.\n\n14\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's been\n\n15\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.360\na nice long conversation about it.\n\n16\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.495\nSo now this episode is where we're\nactually going to apply the styles.\n\n17\n00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:45.085\nWe talked about explaining them,\ngetting introduced to styles.\n\n18\n00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:47.280\nNow we're gonna jump in make them happen.\n\n19\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.713\nWe're gonna make our texts into heading\nones heading twos and our styles.\n\n20\n00:00:50.713 --> 00:00:53.360\nAnd we're gonna make our own,\nand we're gonna do overrides and\n\n21\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.986\nthen we're going to match the styles.\n\n22\n00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:58.853\nAnd I think I just outlined\n[LAUGH] structural elements,\n\n23\n00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:00.990\nI just outlined our show.\n\n24\n00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.836\nLet's go ahead and\njump into it, and get started.\n\n25\n00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:08.950\nI didn't open the document yet,\nbut I have a file called styles.\n\n26\n00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.120\nSo let's open that and get it going.\n\n27\n00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.805\nNothing going on in here, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:19.353\nBut, well the only thing that\nis going on is normal, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:24.510\nThis is a normal style here and\nthere's no overrides in there.\n\n30\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.934\nThis is just straight up, I went ahead and\nmade sure that all those texts\n\n31\n00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:32.943\nstarted as normal to begin with\nbefore we started this episode.\n\n32\n00:01:32.943 --> 00:01:35.640\nSo how do I apply styles?\n\n33\n00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.853\nYou select to effect and\nthen you apply, pretty simple.\n\n34\n00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:44.260\nSo if I have Alice in Wonderland,\nnow this is the title of my document.\n\n35\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.500\nI want this to be like the biggest,\nthe boldest and the top.\n\n36\n00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.957\nSo why don't we apply the title style?\n\n37\n00:01:50.957 --> 00:01:54.470\nThe nice thing is I haven't clicked on\nthis yet, I'm just hovering over it.\n\n38\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.690\nIt does the same thing that you do in the\nfont dialogue box, where if you hover over\n\n39\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.251\nthe text it's gonna show you what\nit looks like before you click it.\n\n40\n00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:06.860\nSo that's the one I want, I click Title,\nand there we go, pretty simple.\n\n41\n00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.240\nAnd I didn't have to think about\nwhat color do I want it to be,\n\n42\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.600\nwhat size, all that,\nit just does it for me.\n\n43\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.490\nAnd that's the nice\nthing about if you just,\n\n44\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.670\neven if you just use the default styles,\nit can make your document look really\n\n45\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.370\npretty and really organized\nreally quickly, so nice stuff.\n\n46\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.010\nLet's go ahead and select the next one,\nSubtitle for Word 2016.\n\n47\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.330\nYes, it's going to be a subtitle, and\nI gave some little hints along the way.\n\n48\n00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.170\nHeading one, heading two, so\nwe know what we should be applying\n\n49\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.180\nthere to just give you\na little bit of a heads up.\n\n50\n00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.769\nLet's keep on going, this is so simple.\n\n51\n00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.567\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's,\neven a cave man could do it right [LAUGH].\n\n52\n00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.502\n&gt;&gt; Yes I can do this, yes you can.\n\n53\n00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.106\n&gt;&gt; I'll go lean on keyboard.\n\n54\n00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:53.257\n[LAUGH] Style connect.\n\n55\n00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:56.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, exactly, so\nI can keep on going through here.\n\n56\n00:02:56.892 --> 00:03:01.090\nNow if I know I have multiple things\nthat I need to apply as heading one,\n\n57\n00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.310\nwhy don't you go ahead and\nselect them all first?\n\n58\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.955\nSo I scrolled through down,\nscrolled through down, wow.\n\n59\n00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:09.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna come, wow [LAUGH].\n\n60\n00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:11.880\n&gt;&gt; I love listening to Vaughn\ntalk everyone, it's so much fun.\n\n61\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.215\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's yeah.\n\n62\n00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:18.610\n[LAUGH] So I'm in the selection pane and\nnow I would like\n\n63\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.330\nto select the heading one [LAUGH] and\nI go ahead and get that selected.\n\n64\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.740\nScroll on down, I wanna get down to here.\n\n65\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.601\nLet's hold our ctrl key\nto also select that one.\n\n66\n00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:33.215\nLet go of ctrl because when you're\nscrolling you don't wanna go ahead\n\n67\n00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:33.772\nand zoom.\n\n68\n00:03:33.772 --> 00:03:37.155\nThe find that other one,\nselect heading one,\n\n69\n00:03:37.155 --> 00:03:41.684\nselect heading one and\nI think that might, I have one more.\n\n70\n00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:42.738\nHow, how many pages did I put in here.\n\n71\n00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:43.752\n&gt;&gt; A lot.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n72\n00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:49.061\n[LAUGH] So now I've gotten them all\nselected, I click heading one and\n\n73\n00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:53.720\nnow they're all selected and\napplied as heading one.\n\n74\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.700\nAnd you could do the same thing for\nheading two.\n\n75\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.018\nI might not get every single one of\nthem while I'm coming through here.\n\n76\n00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:02.482\nThat one's going to be a title,\ngo a little bit more.\n\n77\n00:04:02.482 --> 00:04:04.020\n&gt;&gt; There's another one.\n\n78\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.427\n&gt;&gt; And I think there's one more two more.\n\n79\n00:04:06.427 --> 00:04:10.940\nThat's the wrong one, that's okay,\nI'll come back to that.\n\n80\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.431\nYou know, this is a good one for\nme to show you the local overrides and\n\n81\n00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:14.330\nhow to clear them.\n\n82\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.010\nSo why don't I go ahead and\nselect heading two, and\n\n83\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.270\nwhy did it allow me to select just\nthat one little part of that sentence?\n\n84\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.628\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Word's cool like that.\n\n85\n00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:24.692\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n86\n00:04:24.692 --> 00:04:28.590\nyes we learned that in the other\nepisode is that this is a linked style.\n\n87\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.700\nSo it will apply to characters or\nwords within a paragraph or\n\n88\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.120\nthe entire paragraph, so\nthat's why it's allowing me to do that.\n\n89\n00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.285\nBut I'll go ahead and\nclick here, I can do two things.\n\n90\n00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:45.930\nI can click here and say let's go\nback to normal, and that's fine.\n\n91\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.840\nOr if I hadn't have done that,\n\n92\n00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.170\nI'm in the paragraph that has\nthis paragraph style applied to.\n\n93\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.030\nIf I just click it again,\njust click the style, it takes,\n\n94\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.081\nwell of course now I tell you that and\nnow it's not going to do that.\n\n95\n00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:02.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For another example it will do that, so\n\n96\n00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:03.922\nfor this one you know why?\n\n97\n00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:06.247\nI should have listened to\nmyself in my last episode.\n\n98\n00:05:06.247 --> 00:05:08.196\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You should watch this cool video I\n\n99\n00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:09.274\nsaw on OfficeProTV.\n\n100\n00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.653\nIt had all sorts of good stuff.\n\n101\n00:05:11.653 --> 00:05:13.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes in that one they talked\n\n102\n00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.353\nabout how, they, I'm talking about\nmyself as a third person now.\n\n103\n00:05:16.353 --> 00:05:17.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n104\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.130\n&gt;&gt; That the normal style is a paragraph\n\n105\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.990\nlevel style.\n\n106\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.710\nIt will not apply to just one word.\n\n107\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.330\nSo I had to make sure\nI selected everything.\n\n108\n00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.700\nAnd then clicked Normal and\nit still doesn't want to let me do it.\n\n109\n00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.820\nSo you know what, I'll go the other way.\n\n110\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.836\nI'll just go ahead and\nclick that and click Normal.\n\n111\n00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:38.834\n[LAUGH] It's, you know what, however which\nway you need to get it to, go ahead and\n\n112\n00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:40.243\nget it back to normal.\n\n113\n00:05:40.243 --> 00:05:43.510\nAnd I have it, so now I don't have\nto heading one applied to there.\n\n114\n00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.595\nThat's fine, we can still get to it.\n\n115\n00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:46.853\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\n\n116\n00:05:46.853 --> 00:05:47.975\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, moving on,\n\n117\n00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:51.340\nhey it works you know the whole hand\nwave thing, that Justin likes to do.\n\n118\n00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.020\nSo I've got everything applied.\n\n119\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.830\n&gt;&gt; And that is great.\n\n120\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.880\nCool, so what about I've got it,\nand now I wanna kinda change it.\n\n121\n00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.040\nThis is where the real\npower comes in styles.\n\n122\n00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.209\nAll my heading ones, I want them to be\npurple and I want them to be centered.\n\n123\n00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:08.810\nAll right, perfect.\n\n124\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.590\nClick in at least something that has\nthat particular style applied to it,\n\n125\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.149\nso click on heading one.\n\n126\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.569\nRight click on the heading one up here,\n\n127\n00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.880\nbecause that's where you can get\ninto the modify style dialogue box.\n\n128\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.037\nYou come into here and\nthis is where you're in the source.\n\n129\n00:06:25.037 --> 00:06:29.860\nYou're down into the belly of the beast\nand now I wanna go ahead and change it.\n\n130\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.159\nI have a lot of the formatting that\nyou can apply are right up in here,\n\n131\n00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.451\nin these tool bars.\n\n132\n00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:39.571\nBut if you needed more,\nbecause styles can hold\n\n133\n00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:44.020\nanything at the character or\nparagraph level.\n\n134\n00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.730\nTabs, indents, any of those things.\n\n135\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.060\nSo if you needed to change some of those\nformats in there, you could go ahead and\n\n136\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.370\nhave all of them right in here, in this\nmenu for you to be able to choose from.\n\n137\n00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.980\nBut we´re gonna keep it simple by just,\nlet´s change the color,\n\n138\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.293\n'et´s do some visual changes.\n\n139\n00:07:00.293 --> 00:07:04.821\nLet´s make it centered and I am going\nto have all heading one´s be purple and\n\n140\n00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:07.530\ncentered, click OK, and then look at that.\n\n141\n00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.282\nEvery single one of them has been\nchanged by just changing one place.\n\n142\n00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:16.449\nLove it, so much easier for my life.\n\n143\n00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:17.300\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.650\n&gt;&gt; So, that's one way that you can go\n\n145\n00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.160\nthrough and modify your headaches.\n\n146\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.815\nThere's another way to\nget the same end result.\n\n147\n00:07:25.815 --> 00:07:28.770\nIt's one way that I,\npersonally, like to do.\n\n148\n00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.700\nSo, a lot of the times I am\nlooking at my document and\n\n149\n00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.955\nhow would I know that purple and centered\nwas what I wanted it to look like?\n\n150\n00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:41.558\nCuz through a dialogue box,\nI am not really seeing it in real time.\n\n151\n00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:45.429\nSo, a lot of times,\nwhat I would do is do a style override,\n\n152\n00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:50.564\napply local formats to this and then say\nhey, you know what, take all of these\n\n153\n00:07:50.564 --> 00:07:55.551\nformatting's that I'm doing to this and\nnow use that to update the style.\n\n154\n00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:59.058\nAnything that's associated with\nthat style will change as well.\n\n155\n00:07:59.058 --> 00:08:03.455\nCool, so selecting this text,\nlet's make it red.\n\n156\n00:08:03.455 --> 00:08:08.641\nAnd change the font size down,\ntoo, and make it bold.\n\n157\n00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:11.730\nThat's what I would like\nheading two's to look like.\n\n158\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.960\nSo I've formatted it,\nthis is a heading two.\n\n159\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.310\nYou can keep it selected,\nwhich is probably the easiest way.\n\n160\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.810\nKeep it so I get everything in there.\n\n161\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.470\nRight click on heading two, and\nwe're not going to go to modify,\n\n162\n00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.030\nwe're going to do the first one.\n\n163\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.240\nUpdate heading two to match selection.\n\n164\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.700\nThis is the selection and\nupdating it to match it.\n\n165\n00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:34.375\nNow you're like okay, did it do it?\n\n166\n00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:34.887\nIt did!\n&gt;&gt; It did!\n\n167\n00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:37.145\n[LAUGH] You can see it in the heading too,\n\n168\n00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:38.185\narea and the styles.\n\n169\n00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.445\nIt changed red and everything.\n\n170\n00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:40.095\n&gt;&gt; It did!\n\n171\n00:08:40.095 --> 00:08:41.795\nYes!\nAnd I was like, I was looking more for\n\n172\n00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:43.127\nthe document but yeah, you're right!.\n\n173\n00:08:43.127 --> 00:08:43.652\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:08:43.652 --> 00:08:45.332\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it does.\n\n175\n00:08:45.332 --> 00:08:46.025\nSo, Perfect!\n\n176\n00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:49.948\nSo, I'm hoping you're having\nthose [SOUND] ah-ha moments.\n\n177\n00:08:49.948 --> 00:08:51.525\nLike aah, yes!\n\n178\n00:08:51.525 --> 00:08:52.705\nThat's exactly what I wanted to do!\n\n179\n00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:54.535\nBecause it's so much easier.\n\n180\n00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:56.790\nWe did talk about the format painter.\n\n181\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.460\nIn some other episodes.\n\n182\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.260\nAnd that would be okay, but\nthis again takes it to the next level,\n\n183\n00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.340\nmaking a little bit easier for you to do.\n\n184\n00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.550\nNow, talking about those\noverrides that happen, and\n\n185\n00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.570\nwe had that in the example\nthat we were looking at.\n\n186\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.410\nActually, you know,\nlet me go ahead and pull that back up.\n\n187\n00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.130\nThe styles example file that we were here.\n\n188\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.170\nAnd we came down into this paragraph, or\n\n189\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.010\nthese paragraphs down here where it says,\nthis is not a heading one, this is normal.\n\n190\n00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.550\nWell, I don't want it to\nbe looking like this.\n\n191\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.480\nI really want it to be normal again.\n\n192\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.300\nOr hey, this normal, that doesn't\nhave the stuff that I need to do.\n\n193\n00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.750\nHow can I make it not be that,\n\n194\n00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.460\nall you gotta do is just click on\nthe style itself and it changes back.\n\n195\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.970\nDo you see how now everything\nlooks back to the base normal?\n\n196\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.280\nIf I clicked on here,\n\n197\n00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.720\nwhere it says, This is Heading Two with\noverrides, select the paragraph, or\n\n198\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.970\njust putting my cursor in the paragraph\nsince this is applied to a paragraph,\n\n199\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:02.450\nclicking heading two and notice that it\ngoes back the default of heading two.\n\n200\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:07.010\nSo you can remove overrides from\nit by just clicking it again, and\n\n201\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.310\nsaying I don't want this, we also did\ntalk about in the introduction to styles,\n\n202\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.690\nwhere you did have the styles pane and\n\n203\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.580\nthe revealed formattings, and\nthe cell inspector, that's what it was.\n\n204\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.940\nIn that,\nyou had fields that showed the overrides.\n\n205\n00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:26.610\nThere was a little eraser over there,\nthat you could have clicked on to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.630\nAnd while I'm talking about it,\nlet me just show you really quickly.\n\n207\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.680\nI will go back to the styles, and\nwe'll go to the little two As.\n\n208\n00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.260\nAnd the two As, there is the style\ninspector over here on the bottom.\n\n209\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.060\nAnd you can see that this is the override\nof the normal paragraph style.\n\n210\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.860\nI can click on this clear\nparagraph formatting, and\n\n211\n00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.420\nit's gonna take it back to that.\n\n212\n00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:53.560\nNow it does two levels here, because it\ndoes have a now text level formatting,\n\n213\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.880\nso you could clear it there and\nyou could go ahead.\n\n214\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.410\nThis one you would have to go ahead and\nselect all of the text that has this,\n\n215\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.230\nbecause it is a text level formatting.\n\n216\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.770\nThat whole cursor in the paragraph\ndoes the paragraph level,\n\n217\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.020\nsuck the text to go ahead and\nget the character level.\n\n218\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.000\nAlright?\n\n219\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.320\nSometimes you even see it\nin this episode right here.\n\n220\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.068\nI'm like it selected,\nit still didn't work.\n\n221\n00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:20.070\nWell okay, it's,\nI wanna say there's like this is the rule,\n\n222\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.150\nbut sometimes you gotta break the rules\na little bit and and say hey, didn't work\n\n223\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.200\nif I just had the cursor in, select\nthe text and then it'll get rid of it.\n\n224\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.940\nSo, it happens, even to the best of us.\n\n225\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right, no one is immune.\n\n226\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.960\n&gt;&gt; So you can go to that style\ninspector and do the oversize that way.\n\n227\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.320\nI think that's a little\nbit more in the belly,\n\n228\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.850\nwe were talking about\nthe belly of the beast.\n\n229\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.510\nDoing it up here on the styles gallery\nmight be a little easier for you.\n\n230\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.510\nAnd it's not as deep.\n\n231\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.970\nBut that being said,\n\n232\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.260\nhaving all the ways that you\nunderstand how to do local overrides.\n\n233\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.900\nThe other thing I wanna point out here,\nthis document,\n\n234\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.360\nstyles example, versus the styles.\n\n235\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.050\nThey are not the same styles,\nstyles are document-specific.\n\n236\n00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:10.060\nIf I started a file new, I'm gonna do\ncontrol N, all those other styles that I,\n\n237\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.610\nI redid that style two or\nheading two, nothing applies here,\n\n238\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:21.160\nit's very document-specific, so they don't\ntravel from one to the other by default.\n\n239\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.866\n&gt;&gt; Right, because I was going to say,\nthere has to be a place where it's storing\n\n240\n00:12:25.866 --> 00:12:30.648\nthis information, and if I can create\nthat type of information in a format that\n\n241\n00:12:30.648 --> 00:12:34.283\nit's looking for,\nI should be able to create my own style.\n\n242\n00:12:34.283 --> 00:12:37.676\n&gt;&gt; You, [LAUGH] two different screens\nI heard there, in my mind okay,\n\n243\n00:12:37.676 --> 00:12:42.480\nbecause I do know a way that you can share\nstyles from one document to another.\n\n244\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.720\nI would call this styles advanced,\nthis is a much more advanced concept.\n\n245\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.770\nRight now I'm just getting you\nfamiliar with how to apply it,\n\n246\n00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.060\nthis is Word essentials.\n\n247\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.420\nSo we wanna make sure\njust this is the base.\n\n248\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.185\n&gt;&gt; It gives them more than they can chew,\nright?\n\n249\n00:12:57.185 --> 00:12:58.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Piecemeal these things out, so\n\n250\n00:12:58.885 --> 00:12:59.695\nyou can hang with us.\n\n251\n00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:03.685\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but since I love all of this\nstuff so much, I will have an episode in\n\n252\n00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:07.755\nsome of the more advanced series of where,\nthat talks about sharing out styles.\n\n253\n00:13:07.755 --> 00:13:12.220\nAnd when we get into, when we make\na new document, Just listen right now.\n\n254\n00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Do the smile and a wave.\n\n255\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.320\nAnytime you make a new document,\n\n256\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.120\nyou're actually making it\noff the normal template, and\n\n257\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.170\non that normal template you could actually\nadd styles to that normal template,\n\n258\n00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:27.540\nso every time you start a new document,\nit will have styles that you've created or\n\n259\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.430\nmodified to be the starting point for\nevery new file.\n\n260\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.150\nBut then existing documents have like,\nthere's a lot of styles in this document\n\n261\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.610\nthat I really want to\napply to this document.\n\n262\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.480\nYou can say, move the styles from this\ndocument over to this document, and\n\n263\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.420\nthen be able to use it from there.\n\n264\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.650\nAnd so there's style-mapping and\nsome other cool stuff in there.\n\n265\n00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Is there like style-trading websites\n[LAUGH] where you can upload your\n\n266\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.250\nfavorite style?\n\n267\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.100\n&gt;&gt; Probably actually.\n\n268\n00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.750\n&gt;&gt; If not, there should be.\n\n269\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.110\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n&gt;&gt; Vaughn's like,\n\n270\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.430\nI'm gonna make a website tonight.\n\n271\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.950\nNetwork solutions registering domain.\n\n272\n00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's probably people\nthat are like, in this Word document,\n\n273\n00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.470\nall these styles that are created,\nyou go ahead and download that document.\n\n274\n00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.200\n&gt;&gt; Like sharing, the same kind of idea.\n\n275\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.980\nYou know what?\n\n276\n00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.470\nI would not doubt it.\n\n277\n00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.060\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n278\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.236\nYou have your homework ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n279\n00:14:16.236 --> 00:14:19.114\n&gt;&gt; Go to the oracle of the internet and\nyou will find that.\n\n280\n00:14:19.114 --> 00:14:23.130\nSo document specific styles or\nstyles or document specific.\n\n281\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.490\nOkay, perfect.\n\n282\n00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.206\nWe know about the overrides.\n\n283\n00:14:25.206 --> 00:14:26.700\nCreate our own style.\n\n284\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.180\nLet's come into there.\n\n285\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.270\nI have the styles Word file\nopened up again, and again,\n\n286\n00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.310\nthis is two different ways.\n\n287\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.500\nWe want to, hey this is almost like\nI created my own style right here.\n\n288\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.420\nI took the heading two,\nused the default, went and applied it,\n\n289\n00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.430\nand then just modified the heading two.\n\n290\n00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.710\nAnd like hey,\nthat's exactly what I wanted to do.\n\n291\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.230\nBut I want to make my own style that says,\nVonne's style.\n\n292\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.050\nThat pink text that I had\nmade in the other one.\n\n293\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:59.820\nSo first of all, you do need to select\nText and make that particular style.\n\n294\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.130\nAnd maybe just for fun, I'll select,\n\n295\n00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:07.170\nThere were no tears, cuz after you\nlearn styles, you won't have to cry.\n\n296\n00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.734\nThat words is not doing\nwhat you wanted to do.\n\n297\n00:15:08.734 --> 00:15:11.770\nSo [LAUGH] if I select this text,\nlet's make it,\n\n298\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:17.380\nwe'll make a bold, we'll make it, we'll\ngo into more colors, we'll make it pink.\n\n299\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.780\nWe'll make it a little bit bigger fonts,\nand let's go ahead and\n\n300\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:26.550\nmake it cooper black, some of my favorite\nfont to use when I'm demonstrating,\n\n301\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.340\nI'm not going to make it bold though,\nbecause bold cooper is\n\n302\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.840\nalready a thick font to begin with.-\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n303\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.875\nit looks like it's bleeding or something.\n\n304\n00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:34.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cooper black,\n\n305\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.910\nit always reminds me of\nthe iron on letters.\n\n306\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:38.920\n&gt;&gt; Yea, yea.\n\n307\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.200\nFrom back in the day.\n\n308\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.682\nWe love our 80s references.\n\n309\n00:15:41.682 --> 00:15:44.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And of course remember I also talked\n\n310\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.830\nabout how They never had\nthe name plates that said Vonne.\n\n311\n00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.750\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne was using this a lot.\n\n312\n00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo my mom would make me my own T-shirts\n\n313\n00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.310\nwith my name on it.\n\n314\n00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.950\n&gt;&gt; With a rainbow and\na unicorn spouting fire out of its eyes?\n\n315\n00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.620\n&gt;&gt; No, my favorite one was like\na light blue T-shirt with red letters.\n\n316\n00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.037\nIt just said Vonne.\n\n317\n00:16:00.037 --> 00:16:01.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n318\n00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.008\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n319\n00:16:02.008 --> 00:16:04.395\nSo that's Cooper Black\nis part of my childhood.\n\n320\n00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:09.444\nSo we have this font and\nthis is the Formatting that I have made.\n\n321\n00:16:09.444 --> 00:16:12.741\nAnd if this was a paragraph,\nI could make it centered and anything.\n\n322\n00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:15.104\nRight now I'm just gonna\ndo character level,\n\n323\n00:16:15.104 --> 00:16:17.294\neven though I'm gonna make it link style.\n\n324\n00:16:17.294 --> 00:16:18.680\nHow do I do it?\n\n325\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.648\nKeep the text selected,\ncome to the drop down Create a style.\n\n326\n00:16:23.648 --> 00:16:25.367\nYes, this is exactly what I wanna do.\n\n327\n00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:30.169\nOkay but you do, it says based on\nthe formatting of selected text.\n\n328\n00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:31.604\nAlways that selective effect.\n\n329\n00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:34.213\n&gt;&gt; Just in case you were unfamiliar\nwith what create a style means.\n\n330\n00:16:34.213 --> 00:16:36.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, hey the tool tips are good.\n\n331\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.840\n&gt;&gt; And they are actually very helpful.\n\n332\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.865\n&gt;&gt; Tell them what's going on.\n\n333\n00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Without them you could get lost in some\n\n334\n00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.200\nof these but of course creative\nstyle is kind of self descriptive.\n\n335\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes and you have us to guide you along.\n\n336\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.582\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwho needs the stupid tool tips right?\n\n337\n00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:51.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we go ahead and\n\n338\n00:16:51.825 --> 00:16:56.923\nsay Vonn's style,\nyeah style yep that's how you spell it.\n\n339\n00:16:56.923 --> 00:16:59.060\nI could have just said\nstyle one if I wanted to.\n\n340\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.965\n&gt;&gt; You forgot the silent j.\n\n341\n00:16:59.965 --> 00:17:02.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now if I clicked OK here.\n\n342\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.646\nTotally fine, just move on,\nand everything's great.\n\n343\n00:17:05.646 --> 00:17:09.969\nBut if wanna just go a little bit deeper,\nI wanna go into that modify styles\n\n344\n00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:13.260\ndialogue box,\njust to show you a few things.\n\n345\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.514\nWhen I do create new cell from formatting,\nand I went into that modify.\n\n346\n00:17:17.514 --> 00:17:22.731\nTwo things I want to point out to you,\nand all styles have this.\n\n347\n00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:28.259\nStyle based on and style for\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n348\n00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:33.080\nTwo that are important to me,\nthis one specifically.\n\n349\n00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.280\nStyle for following paragraph.\n\n350\n00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.590\nIf I were typing, and I'm formatting as I\ntype, and I type, type, type, type, type.\n\n351\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.860\nGo ahead and apply the style.\n\n352\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.540\nHit Enter, that Enter means\nit's gonna stay in font style,\n\n353\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.660\nbut if I'm using this like as a heading\nlevel, the next time I hit Enter,\n\n354\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.840\nI would want it to go back to\nthe regular style, the normal style.\n\n355\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.320\nSo this style follow is kind of important\n\n356\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.620\nif you need to be hey,\ndon't keep it when I hit Enter.\n\n357\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.854\nSo following the style,\nI'm gonna say normal and then a based on.\n\n358\n00:18:10.854 --> 00:18:15.641\nThis can be a very good thing and\nthis could be a not very good thing.\n\n359\n00:18:15.641 --> 00:18:20.390\nIt's based on normal, almost all of your\nstyles are gonna be based on normal.\n\n360\n00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.825\nThat means if you change normal\neverybody else will change.\n\n361\n00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:27.980\nCuz think about it, if your headings\nare all connected together and\n\n362\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.840\nyou're using the same font.\n\n363\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.890\nIf I change the normal,\nI wanna have everything else.\n\n364\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:38.570\nSo I don't have Cooper Black and Arial,\nlike that might not look so good together.\n\n365\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.861\nSo do you want it connected to that base?\n\n366\n00:18:42.861 --> 00:18:46.200\nLet me show you by example what\nthat means if I keep it this way.\n\n367\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.740\nAnd at this level when you're\ncreating a new paragraph style, or\n\n368\n00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:55.380\nsorry just new style in general, you could\nchoose whether it is strictly a character,\n\n369\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.760\nstrictly a paragraph or a linked.\n\n370\n00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.320\nI would say, just keep it as linked\ncuz it makes it a little easier for\n\n371\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.694\nwhether you want it to be character or\nparagraph.\n\n372\n00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:09.267\nDon't limit yourself necessarily.\n\n373\n00:19:09.267 --> 00:19:14.011\nI'm gonna click OK here, and\nnow I've created my own style.\n\n374\n00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:19.042\nAnd if I was typing down here,\nlet's get to the end of this and\n\n375\n00:19:19.042 --> 00:19:21.642\nI hit Enter and I type in Hello.\n\n376\n00:19:21.642 --> 00:19:25.775\nAnd I'm clicking on von style right here.\n\n377\n00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:29.340\nBecause I had changed\nthe what comes after,\n\n378\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.740\nwhen I hit Enter, I go back to normal.\n\n379\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.160\nBut if I hadn't changed that in that\ndialogue box, it would have kept being\n\n380\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.090\nthe pink and\nCooper Black text but based on.\n\n381\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:47.794\nLet's say I come into Normal and\nI click on it and I modify and\n\n382\n00:19:47.794 --> 00:19:54.767\nI change the font from Calibri to lets\ngo with Bakersville and I click OK.\n\n383\n00:19:54.767 --> 00:19:57.121\nDo you see how a lot of\nthat is going to change?\n\n384\n00:19:57.121 --> 00:20:01.634\nNow this didn't change here\nbecause it is a character level.\n\n385\n00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:07.834\nSo it kind of went a little off there, but\nI'm just trying to say that if you choose,\n\n386\n00:20:07.834 --> 00:20:13.090\nit based on, sometimes it would\nbe connect, sometimes it won't.\n\n387\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.980\nOkay, so it's not a be all\nend all every single time and\n\n388\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.830\nlet's really get into another font so\nI can see if it's just yap.\n\n389\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:25.310\nSo see, the heading levels aren't\nchanging, even though they're based on\n\n390\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.850\nnormal, but that is because it does have\nthat character that is overriding it.\n\n391\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.684\nAnyways, while it's not necessarily\nworking perfectly for this example,\n\n392\n00:20:34.684 --> 00:20:39.436\njust know that that connection, if it\nis changing and you don't want it to,\n\n393\n00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:43.177\ngo back and tell it to not be\nconnected to that normal style.\n\n394\n00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:47.880\nSo, wasn't showing you exactly what\nI wanted to show, but that's okay.\n\n395\n00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.483\nSometimes things,\nI wouldn't caused a complete backfire.\n\n396\n00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:52.156\nIts just that, its not.\n\n397\n00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:54.238\n&gt;&gt; Its a different learning\nexperience than you planned.\n\n398\n00:20:54.238 --> 00:20:55.317\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:20:55.317 --> 00:20:57.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That is right, but\n\n400\n00:20:57.785 --> 00:21:02.640\nthat is the premise of what\nthat particular option is.\n\n401\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.570\nAnd there we go, so I'm just looking at\nmy notes to make sure I got everything.\n\n402\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.378\nYeah, so make your own styles if you want.\n\n403\n00:21:10.378 --> 00:21:13.485\nApply the default styles\nmodify those styles.\n\n404\n00:21:13.485 --> 00:21:19.027\nDo the base go ahead and locally\nformat it and then match to update.\n\n405\n00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:21.985\nI love that functionality so\nI use that a lot.\n\n406\n00:21:21.985 --> 00:21:24.910\nAnd so now hopefully you can\ngo into your documents and\n\n407\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.620\nstart applying your styles and\nget super crazy and excited like me.\n\n408\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go ladies and\n\n409\n00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.145\ngentlemen it's time to get stylish.\n\n410\n00:21:32.145 --> 00:21:35.005\nStart playing around with your\nWord documents tells you how to\n\n411\n00:21:35.005 --> 00:21:38.415\nwork with styles, apply styles,\ncreate even your own custom style, and\n\n412\n00:21:38.415 --> 00:21:40.400\nhave a lot of good times and\nfun doing that.\n\n413\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.369\nMake your life a little bit easier when\ntrying to format a document just like\n\n414\n00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:45.069\nyou like it.\n\n415\n00:21:45.069 --> 00:21:46.991\nAll right, Vonne, thank you so\nmuch for showing us Styles.\n\n416\n00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:47.932\nIt's been a fun trip.\n\n417\n00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.320\nThat it has been, for sure.\n\n418\n00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.655\nBut it looks like we've come to the end of\nanother

to another great\nepisode here at OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:14.251\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well, I hope you're in\n\n5\n00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.278\nfor more of our wonderful Word 2016\nseries because that's what we're doing.\n\n6\n00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:21.479\nAnd joining us to help us do that,\nour good friend, Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.034\nVonne, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:28.538\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, it's good, I'm ready to\ntell you all about themes and stylesets.\n\n9\n00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:31.382\nNow when I think of themes,\nI immediately think of parties.\n\n10\n00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:34.364\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think of your birthday parties where\n\n11\n00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:35.504\nyou have to have a theme.\n\n12\n00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:38.263\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know this was a thing until\nI got married, and my wife was like,\n\n13\n00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:41.298\nwell, we have to do a theme, and\nI'm like, what are you talking about?\n\n14\n00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:44.450\nWell, it's gotta be like a Greek theme,\nor a Mexican theme, or\n\n15\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.350\nthis theme, or that theme.\n\n16\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.543\nAnd I'm like, how about people\njust come over and we feed them?\n\n17\n00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:49.193\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we eat, and talk, and have fun.\n\n18\n00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:50.361\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, and\n\n19\n00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:54.120\nI'm sure your little girls are gonna be\nlike, I want Barbie party, I want this.\n\n20\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.250\n&gt;&gt; Daniel Tiger,\nprincess parties, you name it.\n\n21\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.590\nSo I now I understand what a theme is,\nhow the heck does this correlate to Word?\n\n22\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, it's very much like that\nin the sense of if you are having a party\n\n23\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.761\nwith a theme, then the cups and\nthe plates and the silverware match.\n\n24\n00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:10.796\nAnd it's all like the same colors, right,\n\n25\n00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:13.438\ncuz if you're going to be\ndoing a Pretty Princess theme,\n\n26\n00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:17.150\nthere's probably gonna be some pinks,\nsome purples, maybe some turquoise.\n\n27\n00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.679\n&gt;&gt; They made appearances.\n\n28\n00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All three of those colors [LAUGH].\n\n29\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nthat's the idea about themes, and\n\n30\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.550\nthen it really kind of\ncorrelates into style sets.\n\n31\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.660\nSo, it's all about picking, hey,\n\n32\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.230\nthis is our default theme, I wanna modify\nour theme, I wanna modify the colors,\n\n33\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.560\nI wanna modify the fonts, I wanna\nmake all the headings look different.\n\n34\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.500\nAll by one kind of click,\nif you wanna say, and up on the top level,\n\n35\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.840\nchange the global style set,\nall my styles will change.\n\n36\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.106\nChange the theme of the document,\nit'll change the colors that I use,\n\n37\n00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:53.321\nthe effects that I use, and\nthen the fonts that I use.\n\n38\n00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.774\nThat's actually the definition of a theme.\n\n39\n00:01:55.774 --> 00:02:01.137\nSo, let's come into Justin's computer and\nsee the style sets and\n\n40\n00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:05.481\ntheme Word document that I\nhave in the document open.\n\n41\n00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:08.602\nWow, [LAUGH] I was trying to get there.\n\n42\n00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:11.483\n&gt;&gt; Vonne's brain is screaming\nat her mouth to catch up.\n\n43\n00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:13.805\n[LAUGH] Work with me.\n\n44\n00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:15.802\n&gt;&gt; I was trying, and it just didn't work.\n\n45\n00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:21.330\n[LAUGH] So,\nDocument &gt; Open &gt; Apply Styles.\n\n46\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.361\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n&gt;&gt; I can do it,\n\n47\n00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:26.007\nI'm gonna zoom out to show you\nthat this does have two pages.\n\n48\n00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:30.404\nI need to come over into View and\ngo into Multiple Pages, so, there you go.\n\n49\n00:02:30.404 --> 00:02:32.349\nAnd there's a bunny,\ngotta have a bunny in there.\n\n50\n00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.123\nNow, we're not at the point where we\nhave learned how to put in SmartArt or\n\n51\n00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:40.490\neven insert a picture and format it.\n\n52\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.562\nBut when we get into the effects,\nbecause like I just said,\n\n53\n00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:50.646\nthemes are part of the font,\nthe effects, and the colors.\n\n54\n00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:55.375\nSo the effects, you're not really gonna\nsee that if you don't have anything\n\n55\n00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.350\nthat has effects applied to it.\n\n56\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.454\nAnd the SmartArt,\n\n57\n00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:02.530\nthat will really demonstrate when\nwe start getting into the effects.\n\n58\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.190\nWe're gonna get into style sets first,\nokay?\n\n59\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.480\nBut if you don't have styles applied to\nyour document, this isn't gonna work.\n\n60\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.920\nIf you don't have a title, a heading,\nheading two, normal, subtitle,\n\n61\n00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.710\nall of those different things that we've\nlearned about on how to apply styles.\n\n62\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.028\nThen if you start going and\nmodifying or applying style sets, and\n\n63\n00:03:25.028 --> 00:03:27.160\nnothing's happening, that's why.\n\n64\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.154\nSo, that would be like the key number\none point, gotta have styles apply.\n\n65\n00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:34.308\nAnd nothing that has a lot of like the,\nwell,\n\n66\n00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:36.253\nI guess you could have local overrides.\n\n67\n00:03:36.253 --> 00:03:41.121\nBut to have them as clean applied styles\nwould be the place where you're gonna see\n\n68\n00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.633\nthis is most effective.\n\n69\n00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:46.430\nYou're coming over to\nthe Design tab on the ribbon.\n\n70\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.190\nAnd in this document format group,\nacross the top,\n\n71\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.830\nyou see all these different style sets.\n\n72\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.026\nAnd there are little tiny thumbnails of\nit, but you can see title, heading one,\n\n73\n00:03:57.026 --> 00:03:58.211\ntitle, heading one.\n\n74\n00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:02.310\nJust like what I said,\ngotta have them to have a style set.\n\n75\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.820\nAnd if I start hovering over them and\nlook at what it does,\n\n76\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.160\nI think this is always so\nmuch fun when you start looking like, man,\n\n77\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.410\nthat just changed\neverything really quickly.\n\n78\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.250\nThis one, that's pretty.\n\n79\n00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.030\nSo if I click on that and\n\n80\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.800\nthen do you see how it changed the way the\nformat of the style looks or the title,\n\n81\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.665\nthe heading, the heading 2s, and the\nnormal, and then the document background?\n\n82\n00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:30.260\nOr this is like what is known as a drawing\narea, because of the SmartArt in there.\n\n83\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.710\nYou can come over here and\nchange a couple other ones.\n\n84\n00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.860\nMaybe you want it to be,\nWord 2003, old school styling.\n\n85\n00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.503\nI like that one,\nthat one's pretty, 2010, okay,\n\n86\n00:04:40.503 --> 00:04:42.721\nand then you can keep on\ngoing through each one.\n\n87\n00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:45.555\nGot a little orange kicking in there,\nright there.\n\n88\n00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:50.570\nNow it's connected to the theme as well.\n\n89\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.059\nSo why did they choose orange for this?\n\n90\n00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.332\nMaybe, I really like this, but\nI don't like the color of it.\n\n91\n00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:59.513\nThat's probably why you got colors and\nfonts and themes right next to it.\n\n92\n00:04:59.513 --> 00:05:02.033\n[LAUGH] So\nwhy don't we stick with that one?\n\n93\n00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:05.921\nLet's take this one, so\nit's got this colors, fonts.\n\n94\n00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:11.826\nAnd if you scroll on down a little bit\nmore, because of the heading level or\n\n95\n00:05:11.826 --> 00:05:15.480\nthe style level,\nit did move this all down.\n\n96\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.020\nBecause the title, the font size is a lot\nbigger, so it kind of moved it down.\n\n97\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.517\nSo let's keep it here right now.\n\n98\n00:05:21.517 --> 00:05:23.509\nIf I come over here to themes,\n\n99\n00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.354\nnotice that a theme has all of\nthose things applied to it.\n\n100\n00:05:27.354 --> 00:05:32.729\nIf I move this over to the facet or\nthe gallery, it's changing.\n\n101\n00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:33.663\nThat one's cute.\n&gt;&gt; That's nice.\n\n102\n00:05:33.663 --> 00:05:34.684\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:36.808\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be like a more blue and\n\n104\n00:05:36.808 --> 00:05:39.018\ngreen type of theme for the colors.\n\n105\n00:05:39.018 --> 00:05:41.625\nThe font is,\nI don't really know what that font is, but\n\n106\n00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:44.310\nit's different than\nthe one that I had before.\n\n107\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.130\nAnd then the effects,\nlook at this SmartArt, well,\n\n108\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.660\nnow that it's kind of about here, you know\nwhat, let's go to this one, there we go.\n\n109\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.590\nAnd now we'll come over\nhere to the themes.\n\n110\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.923\nYou can see that some of the styles, I'm\nnot sure if you can see it very clearly,\n\n111\n00:05:57.923 --> 00:06:01.681\nbut we'll go ahead and\nreally isolate that in a second.\n\n112\n00:06:01.681 --> 00:06:06.976\nBut the drop shadows versus the gradients\nand how it's actually formatting those\n\n113\n00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:12.050\none, two, three, those graphical elements,\nit's all part of that theme.\n\n114\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.570\nAnd so I usually pick the Ion Boardroom.\n\n115\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.106\nWhy?\n\n116\n00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:19.152\nBecause it's pink.\n\n117\n00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:21.347\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pinkalicious.\n\n118\n00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:24.890\n&gt;&gt; It's pinkalicious and I like it,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and use that.\n\n119\n00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.660\nSo the style sets\nare separate than themes,\n\n120\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.600\nbut they do correlate with one another.\n\n121\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.089\nSo great ways to quickly change everything\nin your document with styles or\n\n122\n00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.068\nthe themes.\n\n123\n00:06:40.068 --> 00:06:42.974\nAnd now,\nif I come back over here to my Home tab,\n\n124\n00:06:42.974 --> 00:06:48.160\nnotice that my style gallery will have\nthat based on the style set that I chose.\n\n125\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.010\nIf I wanted to come into this text\nright here and change the color,\n\n126\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.077\nnow the colors across the top,\nthey're all based on the theme.\n\n127\n00:06:56.077 --> 00:06:59.720\nBecause we've been seeing all of\nthe Office theme up until this point.\n\n128\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.090\nWe've been seeing the orange and\nthe green and the blue.\n\n129\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.780\nAnd just like those kind of,\nwell, Office friendly colors,\n\n130\n00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.010\ncuz maybe not every office is gonna want\na whole bunch of shades of pink in there.\n\n131\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.748\nSo now I have the different\nlevels of the 20%,\n\n132\n00:07:15.748 --> 00:07:20.880\n40%, and the lighter versions\nof these themes available for\n\n133\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.230\nme because I chose a different theme.\n\n134\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.414\nComing back over to the design,\nmaybe I like this theme,\n\n135\n00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:32.857\nbut I'm not really loving the font color,\nor not the color,\n\n136\n00:07:32.857 --> 00:07:38.024\nI don't really like the font itself for\nthe heading and the body text.\n\n137\n00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:44.012\nSo you could come over here to the Fonts,\nso I have the style set and the theme,\n\n138\n00:07:44.012 --> 00:07:50.326\nbut then I can go to the specifics and\nmaybe let's go with the font of Garamond.\n\n139\n00:07:50.326 --> 00:07:52.103\nI like Garamond, that's a nice font.\n\n140\n00:07:52.103 --> 00:07:57.291\nOkay, cool, so\nI'm doing slight variations on the theme.\n\n141\n00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.867\nMaybe I like this theme, but\nI don't like the effects.\n\n142\n00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:06.340\nNow I will zoom in a little bit more here,\nso you can see it a little bit easier.\n\n143\n00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.941\nIf I come into the effects,\nwatch the one, two, and\n\n144\n00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:10.846\nthree as I start hovering over these.\n\n145\n00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:12.204\nYou see the changes?\n\n146\n00:08:12.204 --> 00:08:13.202\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n147\n00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:14.120\n&gt;&gt; What's going on there?\n\n148\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.590\n&gt;&gt; There are some of them\nare a little more three dimensional.\n\n149\n00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.840\nThe others are a little flatter,\nmore modern looking.\n\n150\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:26.123\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, because I applied\na specific style to this SmartArts.\n\n151\n00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:29.400\nWord art, SmartArt, they all start\nto blend together a little bit.\n\n152\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.700\nBut I applied this to the SmartArt, and\n\n153\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.430\nthese were the default effects of Office,\nand these are all of the different\n\n154\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.920\neffects that are associated\nwith each individual theme.\n\n155\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.496\nSo I could go ahead and isolate to change\nthe effects different than the fonts.\n\n156\n00:08:45.496 --> 00:08:48.728\nAnd what do you think\nthe colors are gonna do?\n\n157\n00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:52.130\nYeah, you could go ahead and\npick a different color theme as well.\n\n158\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.831\nSo you can kind of mix and match,\nthey have them all together in a package.\n\n159\n00:08:55.831 --> 00:09:00.009\nAnd that's like when you're going to the\nParty Store to buy your Pretty Princess.\n\n160\n00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:02.403\nSometimes they have them as\na whole package deal, right?\n\n161\n00:09:02.403 --> 00:09:03.948\nBut then they also have, okay,\n\n162\n00:09:03.948 --> 00:09:08.023\nwhere you can just buy the tiaras separate\nthan the wands and separate than the cups.\n\n163\n00:09:08.023 --> 00:09:09.904\nSo you can get each one individually.\n\n164\n00:09:09.904 --> 00:09:10.553\n&gt;&gt; More a la carte.\n\n165\n00:09:10.553 --> 00:09:11.192\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n166\n00:09:11.192 --> 00:09:13.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is the a la carte option\n\n167\n00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:13.760\nright here.\n\n168\n00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.590\nSo you can pick and choose what colors,\nfonts, effects, themes,\n\n169\n00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.404\noverall themes, and then style sets.\n\n170\n00:09:21.404 --> 00:09:26.094\nSo you can keep going and\njust make anything you want in your\n\n171\n00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:29.550\ndocuments as the base style setter theme.\n\n172\n00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.400\nOne last thing,\n\n173\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:37.070\nthough, maybe these colors, I don't really\nlike any of these color combinations.\n\n174\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.830\nThat's why actually,\nit's a little bit behind my head.\n\n175\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.150\nYou can see most of it,\nit says hm, customize colors.\n\n176\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.550\nYou can come in here and\nmake your entirely own palette.\n\n177\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.260\nSo you could pick any\nvariation of pinks or\n\n178\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.830\nblues because maybe none of\nthe defaults are what you really like.\n\n179\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.120\nYou can come through and pick each one\nof these and go to the more colors and\n\n180\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.940\nmake your own.\n\n181\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.176\nI do actually like this, but maybe I\ndon't want any yellow in there, and\n\n182\n00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:07.052\nI want another shade of purple,\n\n183\n00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:12.075\nwhich is probably gonna be really close\nto the rest of them, a slight variation.\n\n184\n00:10:12.075 --> 00:10:18.060\nAnd then I can name it my own type of\ncolor gallery, I can save this and\n\n185\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:24.782\nso I have my own custom color there to be\nable to choose from my a la carte menu.\n\n186\n00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:29.085\nIf you can do it with colors,\nthen you can do it with fonts too.\n\n187\n00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:33.480\nSo they're picking fonts that\nthey think look good together\n\n188\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.230\nin the heading level and\nthen in the body text or normal level.\n\n189\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.098\nBut if you wanted to, down below,\nyou can see half of it.\n\n190\n00:10:42.098 --> 00:10:43.922\nThere's that customized fonts.\n\n191\n00:10:43.922 --> 00:10:49.116\nIf I click at the bottom, notice I\ncan choose what font do I want for\n\n192\n00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:53.001\nmy heading level,\nmaybe I want a French script.\n\n193\n00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:53.883\n&gt;&gt; You wild woman.\n\n194\n00:10:53.883 --> 00:10:56.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's so fancy.\n\n195\n00:10:56.088 --> 00:11:02.897\nAnd then the body I want\nas Goudy Old Style?\n\n196\n00:11:02.897 --> 00:11:04.396\nHm, okay, we can pick that.\n\n197\n00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:09.748\nAnd then I can make that as well,\nVonne text, and then Save.\n\n198\n00:11:09.748 --> 00:11:14.908\nAnd so you can customize all of your,\nyou can't even read that barely.\n\n199\n00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:20.955\n[LAUGH] That says theme effects, but\nit is too fancy for its own good there.\n\n200\n00:11:20.955 --> 00:11:24.410\nYeah, I don't think I can\nread that either, so.\n\n201\n00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.290\nBut anyways, you get the idea here\nthat you can customize your colors,\n\n202\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.020\nyou can customize your fonts.\n\n203\n00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.127\nYou could, if you wanted to,\nonce you have all of your own styles and\n\n204\n00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:38.976\nmaybe done all of your own formatting,\nyou could also save that as your own set.\n\n205\n00:11:38.976 --> 00:11:42.885\nI usually don't go that far because\na lot of times, once I start with all of\n\n206\n00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:46.559\nthese different style sets,\nthere's enough for me to choose from.\n\n207\n00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:50.142\nTo say like, hey, heading one and\nthen this style set,\n\n208\n00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:54.868\nthat looks a lot different and probably\n[LAUGH] more than what I could do on my\n\n209\n00:11:54.868 --> 00:11:57.784\nown in a sense of like,\nkinda like you, Dan.\n\n210\n00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:58.678\nSometimes I get a little lazy.\n\n211\n00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:00.002\n&gt;&gt; It does happen [LAUGH].\n\n212\n00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:04.093\n&gt;&gt; You've done a great job of\ngiving me all these options.\n\n213\n00:12:04.093 --> 00:12:05.920\nI'm just gonna stick with\nwhat you've given me.\n\n214\n00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.359\nBut you can go ahead and\nchoose a new style set.\n\n215\n00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:10.216\n&gt;&gt; It helps me keep the pro\nin procrastination.\n\n216\n00:12:10.216 --> 00:12:12.482\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that one, so\n\n217\n00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:17.830\nthat's where you could go through and\nchange all of the different options.\n\n218\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.564\nAnd really, that's all we got.\n\n219\n00:12:20.564 --> 00:12:25.219\nI mean, there's not any deeper we can\nreally go necessarily with picking it a la\n\n220\n00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:27.664\ncarte or just choosing an overall theme.\n\n221\n00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:33.418\nAnd then applying the style set to\ndocuments that have formatted headings and\n\n222\n00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:34.313\nheadings.\n\n223\n00:12:34.313 --> 00:12:36.975\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well it may not be the Mariana Trench\n\n224\n00:12:36.975 --> 00:12:40.881\nof information when it comes to Word 2016,\nbut it doesn't mean it's any\n\n225\n00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:44.567\nless important information that we\nneed to know for the product itself.\n\n226\n00:12:44.567 --> 00:12:48.341\nYou never know when you'd want to apply\nthese awesome things that Vonne has been\n\n227\n00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.030\nteaching us.\n\n228\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.520\nSo like we said, just cuz it's not\ndeep doesn't mean it's not important.\n\n229\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.290\nVonne, we do thank you for teaching\nthem to us and for joining us today.\n\n230\n00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.470\nWe thank you as well for\njoining us also, but\n\n231\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.990\nit does look like we're at\nthe end of our episode.\n\n232\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.750\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n233\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n234\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.890\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n235\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.410\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:13.520\nYou're watching the Microsoft Office\n2016 essential show.\n\n4\n00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.170\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n5\n00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.080\ntoday we're diving into well some of\nthe different keep options that we have.\n\n6\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.390\nBreaks as well as columns.\n\n7\n00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.740\nAnd, here to help us to understand that is\ngonna be our, well, Microsoft Word Guru,\n\n8\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.230\nherself, Ms. Vaughn Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.690\nVaughn, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.880\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.800\nI like being called a guru, that's nice.\n\n12\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.030\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's great.\n\n13\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.750\nOkay, so Vaughn,\nas we've gone through this show,\n\n14\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.380\nwe've seen a lot different things so far.\n\n15\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.640\nReally gotten to know\nWord a little bit more.\n\n16\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.760\nBut, now we are starting to divide\nup the way that the document looks.\n\n17\n00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.540\nAnd the problem that we have is simple,\nat least when I used to do it, right.\n\n18\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.653\nI could never get them exactly the way I\nwanted to when I learned how to do it on\n\n19\n00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:54.256\ntypewriter.\n\n20\n00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:56.360\nBut now on Word it makes it easier,\ndoesn't it?\n\n21\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n22\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.660\nThis is where we are getting to the page\nlayout section of our Word essential show.\n\n23\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.920\nWe've talked so much about\nformatting the text, like you said.\n\n24\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.610\nWe've gone through all\nthose different options.\n\n25\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.180\nAnd now we're really talking about\nbreaking up the whole document.\n\n26\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.670\nAnd understanding how to use brace\ncan make it a huge difference for\n\n27\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.090\nyou as you go through.\n\n28\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.690\nAnd this is one of those, I don't\nknow if you've ever done this Ronnie,\n\n29\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.210\nwhere if you wanna get down to the next\npage, enter, enter, enter, enter.\n\n30\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n31\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.430\n&gt;&gt; Have you done that before?\n\n32\n00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.720\n&gt;&gt; I have, multiple times and\nmany, many places here.\n\n33\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.640\nSo Vonne, the whole goal behind this,\nright, a lot of times it's very easy to\n\n34\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.900\nunderstand that when you take a look at\nsome of the things we're talking about\n\n35\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.820\nmost people don't have a context\non why they would do it.\n\n36\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.140\nAnd I really didn't the first time\nI started using Word processor.\n\n37\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.180\nBut I started realizing how it comes in\nhandy especially when you start getting in\n\n38\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.610\nto really longer documents\nhere is kind of the key.\n\n39\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.060\nSo Vaughn,\nwhat are we going to be taking a look at?\n\n40\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.140\n&gt;&gt; You hit it right on the head, if you're\nonly creating single page document,\n\n41\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.140\nyou probably might not use.\n\n42\n00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.510\nYou might use a few of these things\nthroughout the page layout sections,\n\n43\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.140\nsome margins, things like that.\n\n44\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.430\nBut getting into the things that I'm\ntalking about in this episode are really\n\n45\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.360\nimportant with the keep options,\nthe breaks and the columns.\n\n46\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.970\nSo why don't we jump right in.\n\n47\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.846\nI actually wanted to title this episode,\nKeep it Together, Break it Apart.\n\n48\n00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:13.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I figured they'd be like,\n\n49\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.690\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n50\n00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.820\nSo I just went with like what\nwe're actually covering.\n\n51\n00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.590\nBut really that's what\nwe're going to be doing.\n\n52\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.220\nSo let's jump on in.\n\n53\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.280\nAnd these are things you might have\nnoticed if you started working with\n\n54\n00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.000\ndocuments that are two, three,\nfour, ten, 55 pages long.\n\n55\n00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.470\nSo where does my text start and stop?\n\n56\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.150\nHow does things break?\n\n57\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.550\nAnd how can I rearrange them?\n\n58\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.450\nSo let me scroll down through here.\n\n59\n00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.763\nBefore we get started, I do wanna let\nyou know that this particular document\n\n60\n00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:42.235\nthat I have is keep options,\ncustom heading.\n\n61\n00:02:42.235 --> 00:02:46.075\nThe reason I named it custom headings\nis because I creating the headings.\n\n62\n00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:49.355\nI didn't use the default heading ones and\nheadings two.\n\n63\n00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:53.530\nAnd I also modified some of the default\n\n64\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.370\nkeep options that the normal\nparagraph style has by default.\n\n65\n00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.950\nBut I'll circle back around to that\nbecause the first one, I do want to talk\n\n66\n00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.684\nabout keep options as our first\nsection of this particular episode.\n\n67\n00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:07.819\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I said dissection.\n\n68\n00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.218\nI just made a joke for myself.\n\n69\n00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:09.915\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n70\n00:03:09.915 --> 00:03:12.280\n[LAUGH] I really didn't get it but sure.\n\n71\n00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.210\n&gt;&gt; Well because we are actually going to\nbe talking about section breaks, yes.\n\n72\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.659\nSo that's why I thought\nit was really funny.\n\n73\n00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.270\n[LAUGH] So if I come on down through here,\nand I scroll down,\n\n74\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.210\nthis is one that you see.\n\n75\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.000\nAce of hearts, there's my heading but then\nit's kind of just hanging out by itself\n\n76\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.330\nat the end of page one and\nthen the rest of it starts at page two.\n\n77\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.500\nThese are things that\nwould drive me crazy.\n\n78\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.110\nSo what I would do,\nI'd put my cursor right here and\n\n79\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.710\nI'd enter down until it\nforced it down there, right?\n\n80\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.710\nOkay, don't do that anymore.\n\n81\n00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.480\nI still do it from time\nto time if it's just hey,\n\n82\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.170\nI need to get it down\nthere really quickly.\n\n83\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.190\nI know I know better, but\nyou just have to know when is the best and\n\n84\n00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.810\nappropriate time to use it.\n\n85\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.150\nSometimes the old way or\n\n86\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.460\nthe not as efficient,\nis actually the most efficient sometimes.\n\n87\n00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.120\nSo you have to kind of pick and\nchoose your battles here and there.\n\n88\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.660\n&gt;&gt; All right Vaughn,\nsince you raised the issue here.\n\n89\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.700\nWhy is it so bad that I add in extra\nenters in there, returns in there,\n\n90\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.040\nwhat can that cause in the document\nthat I'm not suspecting apparently?\n\n91\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Really, there's really nothing\nwrong with it, because whether or\n\n92\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.110\nnot you use the breaks or the keep\noptions that I'm going to be showing you,\n\n93\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.350\nEven those can mess up your document,\nin a sense, because right now, I have\n\n94\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.610\na finished document, but you start putting\nin these breaks and these keep options.\n\n95\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.660\nAnd then you start adding more\ninformation, like, I need to go back and\n\n96\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.430\nadd another paragraph.\n\n97\n00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.800\nAnd then it pushes that down, well then,\nthat paragraph or those four or\n\n98\n00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.970\nfive paragraphs that you had manually\ninserted and then when you add the text,\n\n99\n00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.920\nit pushes that down, and then you\nget this big old blank space, why?\n\n100\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.700\nYeah, because I used that to move that\ndown, and now I've got more stuff, so\n\n101\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.290\nyou have to kinda come back, well,\nyou do have to come back and delete it and\n\n102\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.070\neverything like that.\n\n103\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.300\nSo that's why I was saying it's\nnot always the easiest, but\n\n104\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.240\nagain like I said if you start putting in\nbreaks, you're gonna do the same thing.\n\n105\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.600\nYou had a break that says move on down or\nchange this keep option.\n\n106\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.530\nYou add text,\nit'll still do the same thing.\n\n107\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.110\nSo it's kind of half dozen one of\nthe other is that the saying Ronnie?\n\n108\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.790\n&gt;&gt; Well I use that saying all the time\nwhere I've experienced this exactly\n\n109\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.890\nthe same that you talked\nabout it in that way Vaughn.\n\n110\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.430\nIn which you end up with\nthese unusual gaps.\n\n111\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.870\nBut with those enters,\nbecause you might have done it, let's say,\n\n112\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.270\nat the end of that page\nthat you showed us.\n\n113\n00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.480\nYou might have actually just\nclicked enter one time there.\n\n114\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.430\nBut if I'd gone and\nfind another line later on,\n\n115\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.860\nI might have actually hit enter four or\nfive times, or six times.\n\n116\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.520\nAnd then later on it's three.\n\n117\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.330\n&gt;&gt; So that it became inconsistent\nin terms of those breaks.\n\n118\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.200\nSo when I start thinking about\nthis idea of those enters,\n\n119\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.220\nI know that I found myself\nespecially in a time crunch.\n\n120\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.670\nI didn't think I'd be in a time crunch,\nbut now I am trying to fix all that.\n\n121\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.410\nIt's the inconsistency that\nI get in between them,\n\n122\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.490\nthat I think really ruins our\nefficiency when we're working with it.\n\n123\n00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.700\nBut at the same time, it makes it hard to\nactually know, did I do that on purpose or\n\n124\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.350\ndid somebody delete a single line and\nI just didn't realize it?\n\n125\n00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.810\nWhen everything else has actually\njust been adding in two or three.\n\n126\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.856\nSo that's where I tend to find the issues.\n\n127\n00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, I completely\nagree with you, so I love this.\n\n128\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.540\nLet's talk about these keep\noptions that we're talking about.\n\n129\n00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.700\nWhat is going on here in ace of hearts?\n\n130\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.540\nThere's something going on and this is\nparagraph level formatting before I start.\n\n131\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.850\nAll this is per paragraph or\n\n132\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.540\nwhen I'm going to be\ndemonstrating it through styles.\n\n133\n00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.120\nFor the most part, it's style level.\n\n134\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.340\nIt's really paragraph level.\n\n135\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.520\n&gt;&gt; What you see here is an example\nof widows and orphan control.\n\n136\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.460\nOkay, so what is that?\n\n137\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.160\nAnd I had to write it down, because\nto me it's just like all one thing.\n\n138\n00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.380\nIt's just breaks in the line.\n\n139\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.260\nSo, a widow would be the last\nline at the top of the next page.\n\n140\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.440\nAn orphan is the first line of\na paragraph on the bottom of the page.\n\n141\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.930\nSo right here, this is, well,\n\n142\n00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.450\nit's not actually an example specifically,\nof an orphan.\n\n143\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.160\nBut, it's really more of\na keep with next because\n\n144\n00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.940\nthis paragraph right here really\nneeds to be attached to that heading.\n\n145\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.450\nLet's scroll on down a little bit more.\n\n146\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.560\nThere's one.\n\n147\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.140\nThere, that would be a widow.\n\n148\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.990\nSo this is the last\nline of this paragraph.\n\n149\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.720\nBeing out by itself,\non the top of that next page.\n\n150\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.810\nSo, whether you see it as like, okay\nit's a keep option with the heading or\n\n151\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.080\nin the sense like widow and\norphan control.\n\n152\n00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.810\nThese are all of the things that you can\nsay hey you know, I'd really like to not\n\n153\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.920\ndo this, I don't want to have a one or\ntwo lines in a paragraph on another page.\n\n154\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.168\nI'd rather either put them all together,\nand if it needs to,\n\n155\n00:07:42.168 --> 00:07:45.796\njump all the way down, the whole\nparagraph would go to the next page.\n\n156\n00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:50.720\nOr maybe I should make sure that\nat least two lines come over so\n\n157\n00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:57.207\nthat way it's not as much as a widow or\nan orphan right here within my paragraph.\n\n158\n00:07:57.207 --> 00:08:01.556\nSo these are all of these different\nthings that you can control with.\n\n159\n00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:04.577\nParagraph level keep option formatting.\n\n160\n00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:08.980\nAnd like I said, I did use styles in\nhere because why do we use styles?\n\n161\n00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.908\nIt makes your life so much easier because\nthis way if I have three pages here,\n\n162\n00:08:13.908 --> 00:08:18.761\nI could format each individual paragraph\nitself and use that formatting.\n\n163\n00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:23.828\nBut I really want to be most\neffective by using those styles and\n\n164\n00:08:23.828 --> 00:08:27.149\nmodifying these options in that style.\n\n165\n00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:30.620\nSo all of this regular\ntext you can see up here.\n\n166\n00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.570\nThis is the normal style.\n\n167\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.240\nThis is my own created heading\nlevel two or what I named it and\n\n168\n00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.550\nthen the green is my heading\nlevel one formatting as well.\n\n169\n00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.570\nSo if I wanted all the normal text,\n\n170\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.100\nthe normal paragraphs to\nhave widow orphan controls,\n\n171\n00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.040\nand or stay together,\nit's up to you how you wanna do that.\n\n172\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.280\nSo let's go ahead, let's get to this page\nright here so we can get a good example.\n\n173\n00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.480\nI'm going to modify the style.\n\n174\n00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.462\nSo I'm gonna right click on\nthe normal paragraph style.\n\n175\n00:09:04.462 --> 00:09:09.340\nGo to Modify and then this dialog box,\nwhich we've been to before,\n\n176\n00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.360\nif you haven't seen it definitely\ngo watch those Styles episode.\n\n177\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.910\nTo get into the keep options,\nyou need to go into the paragraph and\n\n178\n00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.960\nthat's in the Format button\ndown here on the bottom left.\n\n179\n00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.880\nWe come up to paragraph and\nthen it gets into our indents and\n\n180\n00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.470\nspacing tab by default.\n\n181\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.880\nWe want to move over to the line and\npage breaks tab.\n\n182\n00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.060\nRight in here, the pagination.\n\n183\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.430\nWidow orphan control.\n\n184\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.340\nThat's not on right now.\n\n185\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.520\nIf I check that on, lets just do\none at a time so we can see that.\n\n186\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.670\nLets click okay.\n\n187\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.660\nWatch that first line of that page.\n\n188\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.760\nDo you see how now it keeps at least two\nlines together, that's what the widow and\n\n189\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.480\norphan control does within Word.\n\n190\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.290\nIf I wanted to have it all stick\ntogether let's see what that looks like.\n\n191\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.780\nGo into modify, come down to format,\ngo to paragraph.\n\n192\n00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.489\nKeep lines together, click OK.\n\n193\n00:10:05.489 --> 00:10:07.530\nLet's see what happens.\n\n194\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:13.040\nIt's saying that it didn't have\nenough room on this particular page\n\n195\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.680\nto keep all lines together so\nit moved everything down to the next page.\n\n196\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.170\nSo I like this option, but\nif you have really long paragraphs,\n\n197\n00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.870\nyou might get talking\nabout inconsistencies.\n\n198\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:29.370\nThen you're gonna start having a lot of\nthat white space on each page that might\n\n199\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.530\nbe not the same.\n\n200\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.790\nAnd shorter, longer,\nyou might not want it.\n\n201\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.030\nIt's completely up to you how you want.\n\n202\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:40.000\nMaybe the widow and orphan control with\nthe two lines that is keeping together,\n\n203\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.090\nthat might be as much as you need.\n\n204\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.125\nSo go ahead and make it look\nthe way you are wanting it to be.\n\n205\n00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:49.880\nSo different keep options for\nthat particular paragraph.\n\n206\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.600\nLet's come up here to the ace of hearts.\n\n207\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.030\nThis is one of where,\nthere is a paragraph here.\n\n208\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.910\nAnd I really should go ahead and put\non that show in high character marks so\n\n209\n00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.720\nyou can see where I'm at right now.\n\n210\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.010\nSo there's a full paragraph here, for\nheading too I don't want it to this.\n\n211\n00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.790\nI would like this paragraph to\nkeep with the next paragraph.\n\n212\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.040\nAnd that's something I\ncan do at this level.\n\n213\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.982\nIf I go into the styles, and\nthen I go to Modify, and go to Format, and\n\n214\n00:11:17.982 --> 00:11:19.281\ngo to Paragraph.\n\n215\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.127\nAnd then say let's make sure\nthat I keep with next and\n\n216\n00:11:23.127 --> 00:11:27.126\njust to make sure you know right here like\nwhy is it saying keep lines together and\n\n217\n00:11:27.126 --> 00:11:28.629\nwidow and orphan of control.\n\n218\n00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:33.255\nThat wasn't actually on there by default\nbut because this particular style.\n\n219\n00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:37.720\nThis style is based off\nof the normal style.\n\n220\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.680\nIt's remembering that.\n\n221\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.620\nSo I changed normal.\n\n222\n00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.650\nAll of these other styles\nthat are connected to it,\n\n223\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.130\nor based off of it,\nare going to keep the same things.\n\n224\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.520\nWhich it's normally a good thing cause I\nwould want to keep the lines together and\n\n225\n00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.410\nI would want to have widow and orphan\ncontrol but since this is a heading level\n\n226\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.640\nand usually heading levels\nare going to be not too many lines.\n\n227\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.420\nBut you could have a heading that\nspans across multiple lines.\n\n228\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.671\nSo it's good to go ahead and keep this on.\n\n229\n00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:08.097\nKeep with next.\n\n230\n00:12:08.097 --> 00:12:09.538\nLet's watch what happens.\n\n231\n00:12:09.538 --> 00:12:11.027\nClick OK.\n\n232\n00:12:11.027 --> 00:12:15.650\nNotice that it jumped down there\nto say I needed to stay with next.\n\n233\n00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.960\nSo that way I had to move myself down and\nkeep with the next paragraph.\n\n234\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.080\nLove these things.\n\n235\n00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.400\nAnd again, at that style level is\nreally where you want to do it because.\n\n236\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.030\nI'm gonna undo this really quick.\n\n237\n00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:30.100\nI could take this single paragraph and\nonly modify this one.\n\n238\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.980\nNow, I've been going through\nthe Modify style dialogue box,\n\n239\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.265\nso where else can I get to that\nparagraph level formatting?\n\n240\n00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:40.678\nIt's in the More Options in\nthe paragraph group on the home tab.\n\n241\n00:12:40.678 --> 00:12:46.850\nClick on that little button,\nthat is the dialog box launcher button.\n\n242\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.510\nIt is just a more button.\n\n243\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.065\nWe click on here and you are right into\nthe Lines and Page Breaks, it might go\n\n244\n00:12:52.065 --> 00:12:55.495\nover to the lines and Spacing by default\nbut then you can come over here.\n\n245\n00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:59.290\nAnd just do it to just this one paragraph.\n\n246\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.490\nAgain you have 55 pages with a whole bunch\nof heading two's, I'd rather go ahead and\n\n247\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.350\nget all of them done hence why\nwe should always use style and\n\n248\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.751\nI guess use the word hence\nwhich is one of my favorites.\n\n249\n00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:13.814\n[LAUGH] So that I would go ahead and\nmake sure we do that.\n\n250\n00:13:13.814 --> 00:13:14.340\nLovely.\n\n251\n00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.830\nSo those are your different keep\noptions at the paragraph level.\n\n252\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.210\nSo that's keeping it together.\n\n253\n00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.070\nWhat about breaking it apart?\n\n254\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.659\nThis is where I started\ngetting into our breaks.\n\n255\n00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:28.857\nI have a file that I have called breaks,\nand you know what I just realized,\n\n256\n00:13:28.857 --> 00:13:32.783\nas soon as I went down to my other\ndocument, I did skip over one thing,\n\n257\n00:13:32.783 --> 00:13:35.340\nI wanted to do one last thing-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n258\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.410\n&gt;&gt; With the keep option,\n\n259\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.720\nso let's break this back up,\ngo back to how we can keep it together.\n\n260\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.290\nI just wanted to point out that\nin the default heading levels\n\n261\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.780\nthis is normal with no changes.\n\n262\n00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.850\nThis is heading one, this is heading two.\n\n263\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.300\nIf I come into the normal style and\nI come in to modify and\n\n264\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.490\nI go to format Notice that widow and\norphan controls are always on by default.\n\n265\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.010\nAnd remember all new documents\nare based off of the normal style,\n\n266\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.090\nor when you start typing.\n\n267\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:12.650\nSo you always widow and orphan\ncontrol on the normal paragraph style.\n\n268\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:17.170\nAnd pretty much styles are based off of\nit so you're already gonna have that.\n\n269\n00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.520\nI, on purpose, turned them off,\nso you could see what they do.\n\n270\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.770\nThe other thing is if you look at your\nheadings, if I go into Heading 1,\n\n271\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.140\nmodify that.\n\n272\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.860\nThose Keep options, they have the Keep\nwith next, Keep lines together.\n\n273\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.500\nThose are already on by default in\nthe default Heading 1 and Heading 2.\n\n274\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.960\nSo you wouldn't necessarily have to worry\nabout them if you used them straight from\n\n275\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.450\nwhat you have by default.\n\n276\n00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.790\nIf you start creating\nyour own from normal,\n\n277\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.930\nthese wouldn't be in\nthose options by default.\n\n278\n00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:53.277\nBut now you know where they are, and you\ncan change them, and you can go with that,\n\n279\n00:14:53.277 --> 00:14:54.606\nlet's cancel out that.\n\n280\n00:14:54.606 --> 00:14:56.844\nOkay, so now, now let's break it up.\n\n281\n00:14:56.844 --> 00:14:59.569\n[LAUGH] Let's come over here to breaks.\n\n282\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.790\nBreaks, section breaks, continuous section\nbreaks, next paged breaks and page breaks.\n\n283\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:10.200\nThese are just kind of huge things\nthat when I really mastered them and\n\n284\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.760\nwhen I finally kind of it stuck with me.\n\n285\n00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.310\nIt clicked on, I went that's how\nI can get things like different\n\n286\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.350\norientations on different pages, different\nheaders and footers on different pages.\n\n287\n00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.180\nI could go ahead and\nmake parts of my documents in columns,\n\n288\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.170\nparts of my documents in not columns.\n\n289\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.780\nMy gosh.\n\n290\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.350\nThat's huge.\n\n291\n00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.030\nIt opened up like this world of\npossibilities on how I can get things in\n\n292\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.250\none document to look differently.\n\n293\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.630\nAnd until I understood what\nlike Continuous section break.\n\n294\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:46.480\nMeans we're making a new section of the\ndocument but we're not breaking the pages.\n\n295\n00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.531\nIt's continuous along.\n\n296\n00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:50.750\nSo I can have one in\nthe middle of the page and\n\n297\n00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.978\nthere's no physical break between them.\n\n298\n00:15:53.978 --> 00:15:56.535\nAnd that way I can change things around.\n\n299\n00:15:56.535 --> 00:15:58.190\nWell then what about a page break?\n\n300\n00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.529\nIt sounds exactly what it is.\n\n301\n00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:03.140\nIt is a break in the page and\nit will physically move everything down.\n\n302\n00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.510\nAnd that was that whole enter, enter,\nenter, enter, enter, to get a new page.\n\n303\n00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:11.015\nJust put a page break in and\nit will go ahead and do that again.\n\n304\n00:16:11.015 --> 00:16:11.665\nJust put it in there.\n\n305\n00:16:12.785 --> 00:16:13.785\nWonderful.\n\n306\n00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:18.385\nIf I wanted for some reason for\nright here like Pig and Peppers.\n\n307\n00:16:18.385 --> 00:16:19.945\nThis is on page one.\n\n308\n00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:22.935\nI would like let me also go ahead and put\nthat show in high characters on there so\n\n309\n00:16:22.935 --> 00:16:23.985\nyou can see it.\n\n310\n00:16:23.985 --> 00:16:28.055\nI would like to have this go\nto the next page just because\n\n311\n00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.045\nI just want it to go there.\n\n312\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.530\nInstead of hitting the enter,\nthe keyboard shortcut,\n\n313\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.610\nright off the bat, it's Ctrl+Enter.\n\n314\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.130\nCtrl+Enter is insert a page break.\n\n315\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.520\nBut let me show you where\nit is in the menu first.\n\n316\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:46.240\nPut your cursor in front of the text where\nyou want this to start the next page.\n\n317\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.580\nYou could come here too, cuz this is\nwhere you want to end the page and\n\n318\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.850\ngo to the next.\n\n319\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.790\nEither one would work.\n\n320\n00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.740\nBut if you put it here, then that means\nyou're not gonna get that extra enter mark\n\n321\n00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.540\non top of it when you tell\nit to go to the next page.\n\n322\n00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.490\nSo cursor where you want, very important.\n\n323\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:08.560\nAnd we go to the layout tab, and\non that layout tab we come into breaks and\n\n324\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.480\nthere is page mark the point at which\none page ends and the next begin.\n\n325\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.727\nAnd [SOUND] there you go,\nmoves it on down and\n\n326\n00:17:16.727 --> 00:17:19.988\nnow you force that down\nonto the next page.\n\n327\n00:17:19.988 --> 00:17:24.320\nGreat, but when you put page breaks in,\nhow do you rid of them?\n\n328\n00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.230\nAnd that's why I've had a lot people\ncome here to Pig and Pepper and\n\n329\n00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.610\nthey hit the back space key.\n\n330\n00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.920\nAnd sometimes it happens, and sometime,\nespecially with section breaks,\n\n331\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.190\nit doesn't want to delete itself.\n\n332\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:40.250\nSo if you can get to back spacing and\nget rid of it, fantastic.\n\n333\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.720\nBut another way is that you\nhave to forward backspace.\n\n334\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.980\nThat's an oxymoron right there.\n\n335\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You need to delete forward.\n\n336\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.295\nSo if you put your cursor in the front of\nit and then you hit the delete key on your\n\n337\n00:17:54.295 --> 00:17:58.865\nkeyboard, or if you have a keyboard like\nmine where I don't have two different keys\n\n338\n00:17:58.865 --> 00:18:03.005\nI can map there's usually the function\ndelete we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n339\n00:18:03.005 --> 00:18:05.985\nAnd specifically with this\nvirtual machine it will.\n\n340\n00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:08.115\nI go ahead and forward delete and\nthat way I can get it.\n\n341\n00:18:08.115 --> 00:18:10.155\nBut you really need to have those show and\n\n342\n00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:13.685\nhide characters on so\nyou know where these breaks are happening.\n\n343\n00:18:13.685 --> 00:18:17.398\nIf you don't have them on well you don't\nreally see it, you just see a bunch of\n\n344\n00:18:17.398 --> 00:18:21.800\nwhite space and who knows if it's enter,\nenter, enter or an actual page break.\n\n345\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.768\nSo that's how you can go ahead and\nmove pages down.\n\n346\n00:18:24.768 --> 00:18:29.730\nNow I wanna move on to sections, but I'm\ngoing to kind of take a small detour in\n\n347\n00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.230\nhere because I think it's going to\nreally prove a point when we get into\n\n348\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.780\ncontinuous section breaks or\nthey're in columns right now.\n\n349\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.180\nBecause if you looked at the breaks menu,\nor the breaks drop down,\n\n350\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.120\nthere's things like a column break.\n\n351\n00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.770\nWell, can't really show you column breaks\nuntil I've shown you how to make columns\n\n352\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:54.810\nand then, we get into the continuous\neven and odd section breaks as well.\n\n353\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.220\nAnd the text wrapping,\nwhen we get into images and\n\n354\n00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.450\ntext boxes the text wrapping is\nkind of in a different place.\n\n355\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.370\nIt gives you more options.\n\n356\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.540\nSo I don't usually put this, I don't\n\n357\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.589\nuse text wrapping from this menu when I\nwant to do that on different objects.\n\n358\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.150\nSo columns.\n\n359\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.930\nMy cursor, well,\nwe can keep it right here.\n\n360\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.270\nWe can keep it in the pig and pepper,\n\n361\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.590\nbecause none of my document\nis sectioned out right now.\n\n362\n00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:22.030\nIf I got into columns, hey, why don't we\ngo ahead and throw this into two columns?\n\n363\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.720\nPerfect, that's exactly what I wanted for\nthis particular example.\n\n364\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:32.080\nMaybe you're doing a newsletter or\nsome type of news-like thing,\n\n365\n00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.690\nmaybe a newspaper for the school and if I\nscroll on through here then every single\n\n366\n00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.860\npart of my document is made into columns.\n\n367\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.724\nWonderful.\nWhat if I want a line in between that,\n\n368\n00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.410\nwhat if I wanted three columns?\n\n369\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:48.810\nWhat if I wanted the first columns\nto be a little bit less wide,\n\n370\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.220\na little bit smaller\nthan the right column?\n\n371\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.540\nI want the right column to be wider.\n\n372\n00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.140\nYou can change all of that by coming into\n\n373\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.390\nthe more columns dialogue\nbox from this menu.\n\n374\n00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.470\nNotice this is a page level formatting.\n\n375\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.900\nThis is the entire document.\n\n376\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.310\nWe're laying out the document.\n\n377\n00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.830\nCome into more columns,\nyou have the choice between one,\n\n378\n00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.660\ntwo, three, or left or right.\n\n379\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.320\nAnd those are the ones by default\nwhere it will go ahead and\n\n380\n00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.640\nmake the columns different.\n\n381\n00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.470\nLet's just say two columns for\nhere because they will be\n\n382\n00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.780\nequal column with that's what's on default\ndone by the following when you do two.\n\n383\n00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.730\nIf you uncheck a box, now, you can see the\ndifference in column one and column two,\n\n384\n00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.905\nwhere you could change the width.\n\n385\n00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:31.530\nMaybe I'll make this two,\n\n386\n00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:36.560\nand that automatically makes that four\nbecause there's not so much space\n\n387\n00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.920\non this page which in the margins that is\nallowing you to have this information.\n\n388\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.870\nAnd then the line between,\nthat's that check box right over here.\n\n389\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.930\nAnd right now it is applying\nto the whole document because\n\n390\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.940\nthat's the only thing we have.\n\n391\n00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:56.360\nJust to show you the option here of,\nhey if I have my cursor in this spot and\n\n392\n00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.520\nI chose columns and I said,\nthis point forward,\n\n393\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.610\nit's going to automatically create\na continuous section break for you.\n\n394\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.480\nJust fine, once you understand what\na continuous section break is.\n\n395\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.070\nSo, hey,\n\n396\n00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.330\nI only want this part of my document\nfrom here on forward to have columns and\n\n397\n00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.380\nthen, click another one and say, from\nhere on forward, I want just one column.\n\n398\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.880\nThat's how you could create columns\nin the document differently\n\n399\n00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.580\nwithout even putting in\nthe section break first.\n\n400\n00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.430\nThe way I've always been taught,\n\n401\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.040\nis you need to section the document first,\nand then do the columns.\n\n402\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.750\nBut they do have this option of this\npoint four where you can control it\n\n403\n00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.060\nfrom this particular point.\n\n404\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.540\nLet's click okay, that's cute.\n\n405\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.660\nDifferent columns,\nline in-between, good to go.\n\n406\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.730\nI don't want any columns now.\n\n407\n00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.050\nI want to take them off.\n\n408\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.420\nNow let's pretend that we\nhaven't been in the document.\n\n409\n00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.510\nWe can't undo right now.\n\n410\n00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.930\nLet's say I save and closed,\nand now I've come in, and\n\n411\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.600\nI already have columns\nhow do I take them off?\n\n412\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.550\nLet's just put it back into one column\n\n413\n00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.730\nbecause everything is in\na singular column when we start.\n\n414\n00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:58.940\nSo I just click on one, and\n\n415\n00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.920\nthen it goes back to the way\na document is normally created.\n\n416\n00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.500\nGreat.\n\n417\n00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.450\nLet's go on to continuous section breaks.\n\n418\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.825\nContinuing through a document that has\nthe same, well, it's still flowing.\n\n419\n00:22:14.825 --> 00:22:15.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n420\n00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.310\n&gt;&gt; But I want to divide it up.\n\n421\n00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:21.340\nLet's come into this Pig and Pepper\nhere where we made a page break before\n\n422\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.720\nput my cursor in here, and\nwe'll go with a continuous section break.\n\n423\n00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.610\nInsert a break, and\nstart the new section on the same page.\n\n424\n00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.580\nClick there, not much of a change.\n\n425\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.490\nDid you notice, though Ronnie,\nthat it moved down here?\n\n426\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.140\nLet me undo so you can see that.\n\n427\n00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.940\nSee how Pig and\nPepper kind of moved down a little bit.\n\n428\n00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.600\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it shifted a little bit.\n\n429\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is one thing that\nkinda gets me a little bit.\n\n430\n00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.510\nWhen you put these section breaks\nin it does kind of mess with your\n\n431\n00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.060\nformatting a little bit.\n\n432\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.104\nSo I would go ahead and\n\n433\n00:22:49.104 --> 00:22:52.690\nmaybe remove some of the space\nbefore in this particular paragraph.\n\n434\n00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.390\nSo that way, it kind of bumps it up\na little bit more because there is\n\n435\n00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.710\nspace before in this particular\nheading level of a heading one.\n\n436\n00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.410\nSo I would go in and actually take\nsome of that off on just this one.\n\n437\n00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.425\nI wouldn't change all of the heading ones.\n\n438\n00:23:07.425 --> 00:23:11.620\nJust this particular one to kind\nof accommodate that section break.\n\n439\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.560\nLet's move down here.\n\n440\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.278\nAnd why don't we put another break right\nhere before Alice in Wonderland and\n\n441\n00:23:20.278 --> 00:23:22.189\nyes that is there twice.\n\n442\n00:23:22.189 --> 00:23:28.380\n[LAUGH] I will put in a continuous section\nbreak and now I've made that space.\n\n443\n00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:33.890\nThis is why having that status bar and\nknowing that you can see the sections and\n\n444\n00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.655\nwhere you are at and if you don't see the\nsections, remember, that's where you can\n\n445\n00:23:37.655 --> 00:23:42.425\nright-click on the status bar and\nmake sure sections is turned on for you.\n\n446\n00:23:43.885 --> 00:23:46.673\nCuz I now I have three separate sections.\n\n447\n00:23:46.673 --> 00:23:51.451\nI have section one, notice down on\nthe bottom status bar says, section one.\n\n448\n00:23:51.451 --> 00:23:52.584\nScroll through.\n\n449\n00:23:52.584 --> 00:23:55.211\nThis is section two.\n\n450\n00:23:55.211 --> 00:23:59.084\nThis is section three, and so\non and so forth, it's really nice.\n\n451\n00:23:59.084 --> 00:24:04.921\nSo that way, I could go ahead and put\nin columns, maybe just for section one.\n\n452\n00:24:04.921 --> 00:24:09.066\nAs long as my cursor is somewhere\nin this particular section,\n\n453\n00:24:09.066 --> 00:24:10.990\ngo into Columns, go to Two.\n\n454\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.636\nNotice that it only goes to where\nI've told it to be this section,\n\n455\n00:24:15.636 --> 00:24:20.930\nwhich is really, really handy to\nsay just this part, not this part.\n\n456\n00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:26.460\nSo sections have multiple meanings,\nI guess you could say, applications within\n\n457\n00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.370\nthe document, like I mentioned in the\nbeginning, different headers and footers.\n\n458\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:33.810\nDifferent page numbers, all of those\ngood things, it's really, really handy.\n\n459\n00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.720\nAnother one would here, hey I don't really\nwant Alice in Wonderland word styles.\n\n460\n00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.646\nI want that to go across the whole page,\nand then,\n\n461\n00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:45.633\nI don't want the columns to start\nuntil after Down the Rabbit Hole.\n\n462\n00:24:45.633 --> 00:24:48.176\nWhat do you think we would go ahead and\nadd, Ronnie?\n\n463\n00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:50.625\n&gt;&gt; We would add in some section break.\n\n464\n00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:55.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and then tell section one,\nwhich would now be Alice in Wonderland,\n\n465\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:01.322\nto not be in columns, section two be in\ncolumns, then section three would not.\n\n466\n00:25:01.322 --> 00:25:04.070\nAnd this would be one of those\nwhen I would teach they're like,\n\n467\n00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.740\ndo you know how many times I've\nbeen wanting to make this happen?\n\n468\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.754\nI love columns but I don't want the first\npart to be, throw in a section.\n\n469\n00:25:10.754 --> 00:25:13.611\nLet's put a continuous\nsection break on that, so\n\n470\n00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:17.428\nI do have to now put my cursor,\nit's all about where the cursor is.\n\n471\n00:25:17.428 --> 00:25:21.951\nI'm in section one, change this back\nto one column, there we go, and\n\n472\n00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:25.323\nI can have all that that I want,\nI can even center it,\n\n473\n00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:28.740\ndo fun stuff maybe I should\nselect both of these.\n\n474\n00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.878\nOkay, I am digressing so I should probably\nstop, [LAUGH] but it did add an extra\n\n475\n00:25:31.878 --> 00:25:35.230\nparagraph, that's okay, just go ahead and\ndelete it, and then get that there.\n\n476\n00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.740\nCool, what about column breaks?\n\n477\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.780\nI don't want to have\nthis text I could enter,\n\n478\n00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.710\nremember, half dozen one way or the other.\n\n479\n00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.020\nBut if I'm in columns and\n\n480\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.980\nI wanted to force the text in\nthis particular column to move\n\n481\n00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.930\nup into the next column, put your cursor\nwhere you want the new column to start.\n\n482\n00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:06.042\nGo into Layout, come into Columns,\noops, that's the wrong one.\n\n483\n00:26:06.042 --> 00:26:06.554\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n484\n00:26:06.554 --> 00:26:08.774\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about breaks there,\n\n485\n00:26:08.774 --> 00:26:14.600\ngo to Breaks, go into Columns, and then\nit moves it on down to the next column.\n\n486\n00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.320\nBut like I said,\nyou start adding text in here,\n\n487\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.740\nlet's pretend that I typed all of\nlike another paragraph right here.\n\n488\n00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:26.743\nWell now it's gonna go ahead,\nlet's do one more, there we go.\n\n489\n00:26:26.743 --> 00:26:30.570\nWell this one is actually just gonna\ngo ahead and force the columns down but\n\n490\n00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.085\njust to let you know if you didn't have,\nif you needed to move it up or\n\n491\n00:26:34.085 --> 00:26:36.948\ndown, the text,\nit's still gonna move your breaks.\n\n492\n00:26:36.948 --> 00:26:39.925\nOkay, if I have page breaks,\nit's gonna move it all around so\n\n493\n00:26:39.925 --> 00:26:43.878\nI don't want you to think that the other\nway's bad, like we've talked about, so\n\n494\n00:26:43.878 --> 00:26:46.601\neither which way, but\nsections are really important.\n\n495\n00:26:46.601 --> 00:26:50.833\nNow I do have some more to go over there,\nRonnie, because when we get\n\n496\n00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:55.833\ninto the text with, sorry, with\nthe breaks, what about doing cover pages?\n\n497\n00:26:55.833 --> 00:26:59.240\nAnd then inserting blank pages,\ncuz it kinda flows along right with\n\n498\n00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.662\nthe section breaks so I would like\nto go ahead and demonstrate that.\n\n499\n00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:07.069\nBut I can see you giving me that like hey,\nwe're getting close to it, so\n\n500\n00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:11.830\nmight as well and go ahead and make\na maybe a small little part two for this.\n\n501\n00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.690\n&gt;&gt; Well that sounds great, Vonne, there's\nso much good material here, when you start\n\n502\n00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.870\nworking with these longer documents it's\nreally gonna help if you can control where\n\n503\n00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:24.460\nthose breaks are gonna be, being able to\nkeep those items together that we want to.\n\n504\n00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.350\nIt really does make your document look\nmore like you did that on purpose, I know\n\n505\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:32.970\nthat sounds strange but it wasn't like you\nsaid, I just put the document up there and\n\n506\n00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.638\nwhatever came out,\nthat's all that we chose.\n\n507\n00:27:34.638 --> 00:27:38.450\nIf you're gonna be working with\nWord on a daily basis, doing this\n\n508\n00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.660\nadds that bit of professionalism that\nwe really want to our documents,\n\n509\n00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.080\nallows us to show that we have\ngood grasp and control over Word.\n\n510\n00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.270\nWell, that is a great place for us to\nend the episode as well, signing off for\n\n511\n00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.320\nOffice Pro TV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n512\n00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n513\n00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.996\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft Word 2016 Essential shows.\n\n514\n00:27:58.996 --> 00:28:03.845\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.020\nYou're watching the Microsoft Word\n2016 Essentials show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.700\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're diving into part two on KEEP option,\n\n5\n00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.710\nbreaks, and columns.\n\n6\n00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.780\nThere's a bit more for us to cover, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.840\nwho better to help us than our Microsoft\ngenius herself, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.640\nVonne, welcome back to the studios.\n\n9\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.151\n&gt;&gt; Guru and genius, I love it.\n\n10\n00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.044\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n11\n00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:34.273\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we're going to continue\non like Ronnie was saying,\n\n12\n00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:37.520\ninto the last two things that\nI wanted to show you all.\n\n13\n00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.110\nBecause it really does correlate into\nsection breaks, and page breaks, and\n\n14\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.530\nit's something that they started adding,\nI want to say 2007,\n\n15\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.820\nmaybe 2003 honestly,\nwhere you could insert a cover page.\n\n16\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.460\nCause I don't remember it before that.\n\n17\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't either.\n\n18\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo I think we're right.\n\n19\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.010\nBut you know what?\n\n20\n00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.260\nThat was a long time ago anyways.\n\n21\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.540\n&gt;&gt; That's a whole decade of products\nwe just went through in three seconds\n\n22\n00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.105\nthere, Vonne.\n\n23\n00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:02.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n24\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.790\nif it appeared during that time,\nI'm sure that we've hit it, and\n\n25\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.460\nwe've covered it at some point as well.\n\n26\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.420\nSo, Vonne, why are cover pages, for\nus, so important in today's world?\n\n27\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.240\nWell, I can still remember, what was it?\n\n28\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.100\nFifth grade, and writing a book report and\nyou had to have that cover page.\n\n29\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and you had the transparency and\n\n30\n00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.330\nthose little things that look like\na triangle that you would slip\n\n31\n00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.860\nto hold the paper together.\n\n32\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.860\nDo you remember?\n\n33\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, the report covers.\n\n34\n00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, and the binders that you had.\n\n35\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.985\nIt had all different colors and\nI was like, Okay, my book report.\n\n36\n00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:40.583\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n37\n00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.250\n&gt;&gt; And then you´d have.\n\n38\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.180\nMaybe the table of contents,\nnow I am starting to digress\n\n39\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.561\ninto when we get into the,\n&gt;&gt; Fifth grade, [LAUGH].\n\n40\n00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, which you know I\nalways travel back to middle school and\n\n41\n00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.830\nhigh school, I don't know why I\nkeep doing this to myself, but\n\n42\n00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.910\nit's just one of those things,\nyou put a cover page on it.\n\n43\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.040\nPut a cover on your report,\nso what is this about.\n\n44\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.790\nWhen you print it,\nit goes ahead and makes everything.\n\n45\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.150\nIf you start thinking about,\nif I am printing something out,\n\n46\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.920\nthis is going to be my cover page and\nthen this, if I am binding it,\n\n47\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.318\nthis would be my blank page and\nthe rest of the text starts here.\n\n48\n00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:19.480\nYou would want to have that, if you were\ndoing like double sided printing, and\n\n49\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.060\nyou were going to bound it on this side,\nwhether you were doing a spiral bound or\n\n50\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.770\neven a three hole punch, or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n51\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.560\nSo how could I quickly and easily do that?\n\n52\n00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.200\nThat whole enter, enter,\nenter, enter, enter again.\n\n53\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.500\nHey, I used to do it too, so.\n\n54\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.450\nBut putting on a cover page,\nit's just part of the insert cover page.\n\n55\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.300\nAnd the gallery that\nyou get to choose from,\n\n56\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.650\nof how to make it graphically pleasing,\na nice aesthetics going on here.\n\n57\n00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.650\nYou don't even have to think about it.\n\n58\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.140\nI love that part about it, and that's fun.\n\n59\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.290\nAnd then inserting a blank page,\nI just want a blank page, well,\n\n60\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.780\nthat's in the command too, so\nlet's show you how to do it.\n\n61\n00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.510\nI'm back into the page that we started\nwith, we are right here in breaks,\n\n62\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.250\nin the Word document, it's right\nwhere I left off from that part one.\n\n63\n00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.460\nSo here is Alice in Wonderland.\n\n64\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.320\nI don't necessarily have to be\nanywhere near the top of the page, for\n\n65\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.350\nit to do this.\n\n66\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.020\nAs long as I'm somewhere on my document,\n\n67\n00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.820\nbecause it's going to put the cover page,\nhmm.\n\n68\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.540\n&gt;&gt; In the beginning.\n\n69\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.750\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, in the beginning, whether\nI'm on page six or I'm on page one.\n\n70\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.390\nSo if I go over here to insert,\nbecause that's what I'm doing.\n\n71\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.630\nI'm going to insert a cover page.\n\n72\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.220\nLook at all of the cool options you get.\n\n73\n00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.140\nThis is pretty.\n\n74\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.020\nThis looks professional.\n\n75\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.480\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Like somebody meant to do this.\n\n76\n00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.790\nYou can see some of the different\ngalleries that they have for you.\n\n77\n00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.480\nI really like that the retrospect,\nbut I don't like the color.\n\n78\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.020\nWell you can format any of these things,\nas these are all\n\n79\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.470\nelements that we're going to learn how\nto do in our Word Advanced Series.\n\n80\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.290\nWe're gonna start adding in shapes,\nand we're gonna add pictures, and\n\n81\n00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.710\nwe're gonna start formatting\nall of those options.\n\n82\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.580\nSo if it's not the right color,\nthat's okay, throw it in there.\n\n83\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.570\nBut this is part of all of these, this has\nreally come these are parts of a quick\n\n84\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.980\nparts, and in the gallery in to\nwhere it has all of these things,\n\n85\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.540\nlike all of these default features,\nwhen you insert headers and footers, and\n\n86\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.210\nlike the different graphical elements.\n\n87\n00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.980\nIt's all part of the building blocks,\n\n88\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.980\nthat's usually get to the building\nblocks from adding quick parts.\n\n89\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.900\nAnd you can get into it.\n\n90\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.220\nAnd you'll start seeing all\nthe things it's created for us.\n\n91\n00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.650\nSo building blocks is what\nI was actually looking for.\n\n92\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.970\nThis is not quick parts.\n\n93\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:33.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n94\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.635\n&gt;&gt; But it's kinda quick parts.\n\n95\n00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:35.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because they're part of\n\n96\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.360\nbuilding blocks.\n\n97\n00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.550\nThe blurred line.\n\n98\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.330\nHand wave.\n\n99\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.430\nJust go, okay.\n\n100\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.380\nThey're part of Word.\n\n101\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.230\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo Vonne, now that you've chosen\n\n102\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.150\nCourier MT as your font-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.240\n&gt;&gt; For your cover page-\n\n104\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.070\n&gt;&gt; You know I love that.\n\n105\n00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.180\n&gt;&gt; What else do we need to do?\n\n106\n00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.560\n&gt;&gt; We use ticket.\n\n107\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.450\nWe cheekit?\nWe cheekit, we click it and choose it.\n\n108\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.640\nThat's what I was trying to say,\nchoose and click the option.\n\n109\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.900\n&gt;&gt; You're making up words.\n\n110\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.465\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that's what I do.\n\n111\n00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.100\n[LAUGH] So, we're going on the filigree.\n\n112\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.800\nI like this one,\nI think it's cute and so, pretty.\n\n113\n00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.744\n&gt;&gt; I was joking about the curls mt,\nyou shouldn`t do that.\n\n114\n00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:11.955\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, I do love a curls mt,\n\n115\n00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:13.030\nit`s kind of fun.\n\n116\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.150\nSo we have a page break here.\n\n117\n00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.030\nSo it has added this in for us, because\nit`s breaking this page, and going back\n\n118\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.670\nto the first page I had in my document\nto begin with, and now I`ve got it here.\n\n119\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.560\nNow some of these things that you have on\nthis cover page is date, company name,\n\n120\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.140\ncompany address and\nthen the document title and subtitle.\n\n121\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.930\nRight now, it says exactly what it is.\n\n122\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.800\nThese are known as fields.\n\n123\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.830\nAnd they have been put into this cover\npage of how Word decided to build this.\n\n124\n00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.990\nThis is tied to your document properties.\n\n125\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.860\nNow if you're like, I don't know\nwhat my document properties are.\n\n126\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.840\nThat's okay.\n\n127\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.670\nWe have episodes on it in another series,\nbut\n\n128\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.330\nit's the metadata that comes\nalong with your document.\n\n129\n00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.210\nNow somebody,\n\n130\n00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.370\nmaybe you're working in a document that\nwas given to you by somebody else.\n\n131\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.880\nAnd you put it in the cover page like\nwhoa, it has all this information.\n\n132\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.320\nIt's putting my company name in there.\n\n133\n00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.540\nIt's putting my company address.\n\n134\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.510\nThat's because they added it into\nthe metadata to document properties, and\n\n135\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.030\nit's gonna populate automatically.\n\n136\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.220\nSo you could see how, like,\n\" that might be kind of fun if I\n\n137\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.180\nused them in conjunction,\" but you're\nlike, \"I didn't do it.\" That's all right.\n\n138\n00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.480\nYou can just go ahead and put it in here.\n\n139\n00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.120\nYou could come into here, but\nnotice that it does highlight and\n\n140\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.970\nput this little tabby thing\non the top of this field,\n\n141\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.670\nbecause it is identifying\nthat this is the Title field.\n\n142\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.770\nDon't worry it.\n\n143\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.050\nEven if you're not even putting\nthe title of the document,\n\n144\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.920\nmaybe you're putting the company name,\nit's okay.\n\n145\n00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.590\nThey don't have to correlate or\ncoincide with each other.\n\n146\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.070\nAnd I can just type in Vonne.\n\n147\n00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.570\nVonne Smith.\n\n148\n00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.250\nYehey.\n\n149\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.170\nOr maybe we just go ahead put Alice,\nbecause it is\n\n150\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.270\nthe title of the book,\nAlice In Wonderland.\n\n151\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.370\nYehey.\n\n152\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.540\nDocuments subtitle.\n\n153\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.370\nIf I have a subtitle, that'll be great.\n\n154\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.510\nWhat if I don't want a subtitle?\n\n155\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.460\nYou can get rid of it.\n\n156\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.150\nJust like if it was regular text,\nyou select it and\n\n157\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.600\nnotice it does highlight the whole thing.\n\n158\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.960\nYou hit the delete key or the backspace,\nbut the field still stays there.\n\n159\n00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.210\nSo if you wanna get rid of a whole field,\n\n160\n00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.360\nyou just have to like\nselect the tab itself.\n\n161\n00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.770\nLet me undo that for a second.\n\n162\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.470\nNotice this is selecting the text in here.\n\n163\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.320\nThat selecting the tab of the field,\nand I hit delete,\n\n164\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.220\nthen it gets rid of the whole block for\nyou.\n\n165\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.050\nSo it's still text,\nwith just a little bit of extra on it.\n\n166\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.950\nSo, sometimes you might have to backspace\ntwice, delete it all, select it all, or\n\n167\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.730\njust make sure you know which piece\nthat you're selecting to get rid of it.\n\n168\n00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.050\nThese are little graphical elements,\nif I didn't want it to be blue,\n\n169\n00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.310\nyou could select it and\nit is the format tab, but\n\n170\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.190\nwe're not going to get\ninto the details of it.\n\n171\n00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.560\nBut you can change the picture color,\nso let's make that orange.\n\n172\n00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.190\nWell that's actually\nnot what we would want.\n\n173\n00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.520\nWe'd literally want to go ahead and\ndo the fill color in there,\n\n174\n00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.590\nbut you do have the different options here\nof coloring things and so on and so forth.\n\n175\n00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.520\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n176\n00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.020\nWatch the advanced show when\nwe get into images and shapes,\n\n177\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.320\nand you can do all sorts of\nfun stuff with formatting.\n\n178\n00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.670\nScrolling on down here, again more fields.\n\n179\n00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.290\nIt does have a date field,\nand it has a date picker,\n\n180\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.060\nif you pick this particular one.\n\n181\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.130\nBut maybe I don't want that, so delete.\n\n182\n00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.300\nMm.\nDidn't get the tab.\n\n183\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.501\nGet the tab there, and then get rid of it,\n\n184\n00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:37.600\ncause maybe I don't want any of that or\nI just want to put Office Pro TV.\n\n185\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.450\nOops.\n\n186\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.320\nTV.\nGet rid of the others.\n\n187\n00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.170\nSelect it.\n\n188\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.810\nGet rid of it.\n\n189\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:43.860\nPerfect.\n\n190\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.570\nLove cover pages, super simple,\nprofessional looking and easy to use.\n\n191\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.010\nMaybe I need to go ahead\nan put in another blank page,\n\n192\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.130\nbecause we are talking about printing on\nthat first page, opening up, I don't want\n\n193\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:02.220\nthe text to start on the back side of\nthat first printed page of the page two,\n\n194\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.230\nI want page two to be blank, and\nthen the text to start on the third page,\n\n195\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.470\non that right hand side\nof my bounded book.\n\n196\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:16.740\nI can put my cursor in front of\nthe a in Alice insert, blank page.\n\n197\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.730\nThere we go.\n\n198\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.940\nSo now I have page two.\n\n199\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.210\nIt is making a page break,\n\n200\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.490\nwhich is what I want it to do anyways,\nand then starts the next page there.\n\n201\n00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:33.090\nNot much more to go with inserting a blank\npage, except that it's nice to be able to\n\n202\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.230\neasily do it, instead of putting like\npage break, like two double page breaks.\n\n203\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.390\nJust go ahead and\nput it in in one command.\n\n204\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.160\nLike I said, it can really help\nif you're doing facing pages or\n\n205\n00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.970\nduplex printing, and\nall your different options.\n\n206\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:50.410\nSo, that's what I got with cover pages and\nblank pages.\n\n207\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.400\nAnd goes right in with breaks.\n\n208\n00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.590\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, let me just ask a question.\n\n209\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:59.200\nCan I create a customized cover page,\nmy own?\n\n210\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.980\n&gt;&gt; You could.\n\n211\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:07.550\nNow to be able to use it and to put it\ninto that gallery, it's totally possible.\n\n212\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.540\nYou would have to save it\ninto the building blocks,\n\n213\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.340\nlike dialogue box,\nthe place where this stuff is stored for\n\n214\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.320\nyou to be able to choose\nit from that drop down.\n\n215\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.380\nThe other thing would be if you did that,\n\n216\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.900\nI'm pretty sure that'd\nbe document specific.\n\n217\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.920\nSo if I start another one, I wanted that\nsame one, then you might not have it.\n\n218\n00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.940\nI'm not a 100% on that one, because\nbuilding blocks do carry over across if\n\n219\n00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.650\nits down far enough in, like those\nprogram details, if you wanna call it.\n\n220\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.640\nSo it's possible.\n\n221\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.180\nIt would be a little bit of work.\n\n222\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.460\nIt's not impossible, but\nif you really wanted to have\n\n223\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.010\nyour own cover page every time, you\nmight want to create your own template.\n\n224\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which we will be doing in the advanced\n\n225\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.030\nshow, so say hey, I always want to have\nthis cover page, you could do that and\n\n226\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.820\nstart a new document that way.\n\n227\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.540\nYou could always copy and paste.\n\n228\n00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.740\nYou could select it all, but you would\nhave to get it all the information with\n\n229\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.740\nthe graphics and the page breaks.\n\n230\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.160\nSo yes, it is possible, so.\n\n231\n00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nYeah, no Vonne,\n\n232\n00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.000\nI was trying to think of\na context about the use of them.\n\n233\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.180\nAt least I have been out of college for\nawhile now, and\n\n234\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.240\nI haven't had to do anything like this.\n\n235\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.530\nBut I could see if I was in college and\nrealize that a particular professor or\n\n236\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.230\nsomebody, whoever,\nwanted me to make papers for them.\n\n237\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.310\nIf they had a specific format,\nthen I might just choose to do this, and\n\n238\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:35.460\nlet Word do it's thing, because it's\nactually better at doing it than I am.\n\n239\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.060\nTo be able to create that idea of that\ncover page, and even that second page\n\n240\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.350\nwhere they used to scribble red marks\nall over, for at least my papers, Vonne.\n\n241\n00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.730\nBut I could see that actually happening.\n\n242\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually, Ronnie, you've\ngiven me a little bit of a challenge.\n\n243\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.660\nI like this.\n\n244\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I think I'm going to double check\n\n245\n00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.460\nwith\n&gt;&gt; Myself and with Word to make sure, and\n\n246\n00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.360\nmaybe i will make a little addendum,\neither to this episode or\n\n247\n00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.100\ntell y'all where to find it\nsomewhere in our course library,\n\n248\n00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.360\nbecause now i want to show you guys.\n\n249\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.040\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\nsounds great.\n\n250\n00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.850\nWell Vonne, thank you again for helping us\nto fill out that gap of knowledge that.\n\n251\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.880\n&gt;&gt; I know you wanted to try and\njam all this into one episode,\n\n252\n00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.770\nbut having this part two and talking about\ncover pages can be very important for us.\n\n253\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.930\nSo make sure you do take a look at this\nepisode, as well as with all the keep\n\n254\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.020\noptions, the breaks, and the columns that\nVonne was talking about in part one.\n\n255\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.330\nBut that is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n256\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.690\nSigning off for OfficePro.tv,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n257\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n258\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.820\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nMicrosoft Office 2016 Essential

00:00:14.880\nYou're watching the Microsoft Word\n2016 Essentials Show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.900\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday, we're jumping into margins,\n\n5\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.500\nheaders and footers and\nhere to help us of course is going to be,\n\n6\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.070\nwell, our Microsoft Word diva herself,\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.480\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.030\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.200\nI love my introduction from you [LAUGH].\n\n10\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.510\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, as we start to take\na look now at some of the things,\n\n11\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.150\nwe're no longer really dealing with the\ntext itself inside of the documents and\n\n12\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.830\nmoving around paragraphs and\nmaking sure they appear on the right page.\n\n13\n00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.470\nBut these elements that\nwe're about to talk about\n\n14\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.290\nreally do at least help the text\nlook better on our pages and\n\n15\n00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.930\nallow us to actually format\nthem the way that we need to.\n\n16\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.100\nSo Vonne help us out when we start\ndealing into the worlds of margins and\n\n17\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.160\nheaders and footers.\n\n18\n00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.430\nYes, this is one of those\nthings that a lot of people,\n\n19\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.910\nI've found throughout the years,\nthey kind of struggle with a little bit.\n\n20\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n21\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.740\n&gt;&gt; And on the surface it's like, okay,\nhere you go, that's it, it's easy.\n\n22\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.480\nBut it's always the one, yeah but\n\n23\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.451\nI want it to do this\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n24\n00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:16.951\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that, but I want this.\n\n25\n00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.180\nYou know, it's kind of,\nstory of life sometimes.\n\n26\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.740\nSo what I really want to get into is\n\n27\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.120\nhow you can manipulate your headers and\nfooters.\n\n28\n00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.890\nWhat they are, first of all, and\n\n29\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.080\nhow to manipulate your\nmargins effectively as well.\n\n30\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.600\nAgain, this is still a long the lines\nof page layout like you said.\n\n31\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.800\nWe're controlling how the,\nnot the content, but\n\n32\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.580\nthe pages look if you want to say.\n\n33\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.870\nSo let's just jump right on into it.\n\n34\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.828\nI have a document called page layout for\nus and it's still our Alice in Wonderland.\n\n35\n00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:53.250\nEverything is formatted with our heading,\nso the text itself is ready to go.\n\n36\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.400\nBut having things like page numbers that\ncould go on our headers and footers.\n\n37\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.150\nNow what I've done is I'd\nactually separated this out,\n\n38\n00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.470\nbecause I wanted to put like page numbers\nand then some of the other things like our\n\n39\n00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.390\nline numbers and\na few other items in a separate episodes.\n\n40\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.657\nSo, I'll already know\nwe're gonna do a part two.\n\n41\n00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:16.012\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz giving enough time to\n\n42\n00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:20.814\nconcentrate on headers and footers\nby themselves is very important, and\n\n43\n00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:24.680\nthen we'll throw in page\nnumbers on top of that.\n\n44\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.360\nBut before we get into headers and\nfooters,\n\n45\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.570\nlet's talk about the margins,\nbecause they do correlate together.\n\n46\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.340\nSo what is a margin?\n\n47\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.160\nThe margin is the white\narea around the page.\n\n48\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.200\nYou have top margin, a bottom margin,\nand a left and a right margin and\n\n49\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.850\nwe learned when we were selecting our text\nthis left margin also does double duty\n\n50\n00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.560\nas our selection area to where we can\nselect paragraphs and lines of our text.\n\n51\n00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.940\nSo it's the white area.\n\n52\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.990\nWell, I already said that,\naround our text.\n\n53\n00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.690\nSo how much white area we see,\nit's really personal choice, too.\n\n54\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.560\nDepending on what I need to print out in\nmy document, or even just print to a PDF,\n\n55\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.820\nso it doesn't always have to have\nphysical paper, that we're going to.\n\n56\n00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.770\nWhat do I want it to be like?\n\n57\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.230\nAnd in those top and bottom margins,\nthat's where your headers and\n\n58\n00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.590\nfooters are also going to lie, and\nso that knowing how much space you\n\n59\n00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.500\nneed if you have a really complex\nfooter or a complex header.\n\n60\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.140\nYou might wanna go ahead and\nmake some extra room on those tops and\n\n61\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.840\nbottoms of every page\nwithin that document.\n\n62\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.240\nNow as soon as I say that,\nRonnie, yes you can go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.820\nformat it for the entire document.\n\n64\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.390\nBut back in this section,\n\n65\n00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.520\nthis sub-area of Word essentials,\nwe're talking about sections, right?\n\n66\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.150\nSections can do a lot of good things for\nyou.\n\n67\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.600\nSo if I needed margins for one page\nof my document separate than another\n\n68\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.210\npage of my document or pages, then you've\ngot to go ahead and put those sections.\n\n69\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.870\nAny of these page layout items, headers,\n\n70\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.740\nfooters, margins will go ahead and\napply to each individual section.\n\n71\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.840\nSo keep that in mind and\nwe will work with dividing our documents\n\n72\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.990\nup into sections and putting those\nheaders and footers and margins.\n\n73\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.730\nWe'll throw in a couple just for\nfun, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.350\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, I remember when I first\nstarted working with just typing itself.\n\n75\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.410\nSetting margins were pretty hefty.\n\n76\n00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.190\nIt was an actual physical manual\nthing that you had to do on\n\n77\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.540\nthe type-writer itself.\n\n78\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.780\nWhere you had to kind of pinch and\nmove these things around.\n\n79\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.160\nBut then you also had to take\nnote of the very top margin.\n\n80\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.200\nWhich there was no mechanical device,\n\n81\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.300\nit was just four line spaces, or\nfour slaps of the carriage return.\n\n82\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.710\nAnd would actually give you the one\ninch margin that you needed at top.\n\n83\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.430\nAnd even then physically though.\n\n84\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.350\nAt the very end of the page,\nif you weren't careful like I was\n\n85\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.380\nin a manual typewriter,\nyou could continue to type on,\n\n86\n00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.690\nand then realize that you actually went\ndown to the very last line of that page.\n\n87\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.900\nSo you had to always pay attention.\n\n88\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.590\nBut inside of Word though, they really\ndo make it a little bit easier for\n\n89\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.540\nus to almost set it and forget it, right?\n\n90\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.060\n&gt;&gt; It's the beauty of technology and\nRonnie, I actually do remember that too.\n\n91\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.580\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n92\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.820\n&gt;&gt; I remember those,\nwhen you were doing this,\n\n93\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.910\nI was actually doing the same\nthing right next to you like yeah.\n\n94\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.780\nMy mom had one of those what\nwas it Smith and Corolla?\n\n95\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.160\nWas that their-\n&gt;&gt; Probably yeah.\n\n96\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.290\nSomething like that yeah.\n\n97\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah was that a brand\nname of type writers?\n\n98\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.560\n&gt;&gt; Corona.\n\n99\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.920\n&gt;&gt; Corona yes!\n\n100\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.600\nCorolla [LAUGH].\n\n101\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.772\n&gt;&gt; That's a car.\n\n102\n00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:33.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH] We had one of those too.\n\n103\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I remember I loved that\n\n104\n00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:36.043\ntype writer.\n\n105\n00:05:36.043 --> 00:05:36.666\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n106\n00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:39.056\n&gt;&gt; You know but she didn't like it\ncause I would push all the keys and\n\n107\n00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:41.860\nall the things would pop up and you'd\nhave to like pull them down manually.\n\n108\n00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.330\nBut, I do remember that,\nbut yeah, you're right.\n\n109\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.000\nAs soon as you said it, you can forget it.\n\n110\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.840\nAnd as soon as you get down to the end of\nthe page you're just going to jump down to\n\n111\n00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.850\nthe next page,\nbased on the margins that you set.\n\n112\n00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.970\nSo that is a very nice thing.\n\n113\n00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.060\nAnd I'm going to be showing you how\nto control your margins through\n\n114\n00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.070\nthe layout tab of the ribbon, and\nthen going into the page setup dialog box.\n\n115\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.700\nTalking about pulling them in,\nyou can also do that on the ruler.\n\n116\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.310\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n117\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.140\n&gt;&gt; Let's go in and show you.\n\n118\n00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.540\nI'm on my document,\nI do not have any sections in this one.\n\n119\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.900\nI'm going to go over to the layout and\nthat's where your margins, and notice that\n\n120\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.840\nthis in the group called page setup and\nI am accessing it through this ribbon.\n\n121\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.780\nBut if you were to go over to\nthe File &gt; Print, just to show you,\n\n122\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.660\nI might have mentioned this when we\ntalked about printing a document,\n\n123\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.420\nthe same stuff is right here in\nthe Page Setup of the Print dialog box.\n\n124\n00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:36.775\nAnd if you click on page setup,\nyou're gonna go straight to the same place\n\n125\n00:06:36.775 --> 00:06:40.555\nthat I'm going to go to when I go\nto custom margins from the ribbon.\n\n126\n00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:44.305\nSo there's a couple different places\nthat you can get to this dialog box.\n\n127\n00:06:45.452 --> 00:06:46.512\nGoing down to this margin.\n\n128\n00:06:46.512 --> 00:06:50.222\nHere are some of the default\nmargin settings.\n\n129\n00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:54.132\nAnd I will say this is one that I use\nquite frequently, Ronnie, the narrow.\n\n130\n00:06:54.132 --> 00:06:57.222\nBecause I wanna get more\ntext on the page and\n\n131\n00:06:57.222 --> 00:07:01.962\nespecially if it's like I have\nmaybe one little bit on page two.\n\n132\n00:07:01.962 --> 00:07:04.642\nIt's like I really don't wanna\nprint out a second page,\n\n133\n00:07:04.642 --> 00:07:10.520\njust make the margins a lot wider or\nmargins smaller and a text area wider.\n\n134\n00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.420\nAnd so\na narrow margin will give me a whole inch.\n\n135\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.630\nIf you think half inch on each side for\nthe text to go ahead and\n\n136\n00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.360\nlive on that page.\n\n137\n00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.130\nSo I use this setting a lot.\n\n138\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.880\nBut you can see that there's other\noptions here, like Wide Margins.\n\n139\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.790\nThat's where of course you're going\nto get a narrow area of text.\n\n140\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.850\nWhy don't I click on these so\nyou can see the text moving around.\n\n141\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.370\nSee, there you go, more room for the text.\n\n142\n00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.770\nCome down in here to Wide Margins,\nwhich makes the narrow space for\n\n143\n00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.590\nthe text to sit in.\n\n144\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.270\nSo they these predefined ones.\n\n145\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.120\nYou get into some mirrored\noptions in here, and\n\n146\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.122\nthis is where it might not\nlook the same right now.\n\n147\n00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:51.125\nBut if you start getting to where\nyou printing your pages, and\n\n148\n00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:55.054\nthen they're going to either mirror either\nthe inside or the outside margin, so\n\n149\n00:07:55.054 --> 00:07:56.582\nit's not just left and right.\n\n150\n00:07:56.582 --> 00:08:01.167\nIt becomes inside and\noutside margins for there.\n\n151\n00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:05.642\nAnd then you have the Office 2003 default,\nwhere you had your 0.25.\n\n152\n00:08:05.642 --> 00:08:08.721\nIt had to throw in the quarter inch in\nthere just to be a little different,\n\n153\n00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.650\ninstead of just one inch\nmargins all around.\n\n154\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.990\nAnd, you know, it's funny.\n\n155\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.100\nSpeaking of that,\nI can remember being in school,\n\n156\n00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.790\nthat was one of the requirements for\nturning in your papers.\n\n157\n00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:25.760\nYou had to have 1 inch margins all around,\n12 point Times New Roman double-spaced.\n\n158\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.770\nYou had to type your documents that\nway because if you think about\n\n159\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.710\nit I made much smaller margins, you're\nsupposed to type out three pages, well,\n\n160\n00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.494\nI can type out three pages and only\nhave 50 words on it, if I really wanted.\n\n161\n00:08:37.494 --> 00:08:38.979\nWell, maybe not 50.\n\n162\n00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:40.380\nAnd the word count.\n\n163\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.660\nAnd I remember having to count every\nsingle individual word when I wrote it on\n\n164\n00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.320\npaper and now it does it all for you.\n\n165\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.205\nIt's wonderful.\n\n166\n00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:48.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now, Vonne,\n\n167\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.360\nwith the margins itself, too,\n\n168\n00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.650\nand you may be getting into this in\ncustom margins for all that I know.\n\n169\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.200\nBut sometimes you may find out,\n\n170\n00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.920\nlike I have, where you adjust it and\nall of a sudden the other margin\n\n171\n00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.900\nkinda pops out where even though\nyou thought I can adjust it here,\n\n172\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.500\nand I'm just gonna adjust one of the other\nmargins, and it kind of hits back at you.\n\n173\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.720\nIf you're wondering why that happens,\na lot of times it's the printer that you\n\n174\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.860\nmight have, and that's actually\nkind of a key element, too.\n\n175\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.330\nAnd the reason why is that your printer\nis set up to where it will only print so\n\n176\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.090\nmuch of that page.\n\n177\n00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.640\nSo if you think that you're gonna say,\nI bought this brand new inkjet printer,\n\n178\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.235\nI'm gonna print off a photograph that's\nexactly 8.5 by 11, is that right?\n\n179\n00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.710\nYeah, a regular sheet of paper.\n\n180\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.840\nAnd then you go,\nwhy does it still put that margin?\n\n181\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.590\nIt's because it only has so\nmuch of a print area.\n\n182\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.960\nAnd the same thing, too,\n\n183\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.360\neven if you have those margins,\nyou might be able to adjust it to a point.\n\n184\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.630\nBut then if you see that it's fighting\nback at you, more than likely it's gonna\n\n185\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.380\nbe that printer that's saying you\ncan set it what you want to, but\n\n186\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.400\nI'm gonna tell you this is the only\narea I'm gonna allow you to\n\n187\n00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.830\nprint in is pretty much what you'll see.\n\n188\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.190\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's like I am\noverriding everything you say.\n\n189\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.550\nAnd we all know in the world of printers,\nthey always seem to do that.\n\n190\n00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.795\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; Those printers.\n\n191\n00:09:57.795 --> 00:09:58.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n192\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Print drivers you can really\nfight with them sometimes.\n\n193\n00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.180\nBut that's a really good point because,\nand\n\n194\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.600\na lot of our regular desktop printers\nyou can't print to the edge.\n\n195\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.570\nNow, I know there are some\nprinters on the market for\n\n196\n00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.460\nhome use that will do,\nlike photo printers to the edge.\n\n197\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.710\nBut then we're also getting into\nthe area of photo printing rather than\n\n198\n00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.280\ndocument printing within Word.\n\n199\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.790\nBut definitely a good point, and\nI know you install printers and\n\n200\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.430\ndo all sorts of stuff in your\ntech shows about printers.\n\n201\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.740\nSo that's a great point\nto make right there.\n\n202\n00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.560\nBut speaking of printing, another thing\nthat you might have to print out on,\n\n203\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.220\nyou might have company letterhead.\n\n204\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That you are printing this document on,\n\n205\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.160\nand that company letterhead, you need to\nmake sure you have a two inch top margin,\n\n206\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.080\nor maybe even a 2.5,\n\n207\n00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.200\ndepending on the specifications\nof how much space is already\n\n208\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.775\non that letter head that your putting\ninto the printer and printing on top of.\n\n209\n00:10:48.775 --> 00:10:51.910\nSo, that's something where, hey,\nall those presets are great, but\n\n210\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.240\nit doesn't go for what I need to.\n\n211\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.620\nAnd yes, we will go into that\ncustom margins dialogue box and\n\n212\n00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.730\ngo into the page setup.\n\n213\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:04.950\nSo I could physically type in that\nI might need a 2.5 top margin and\n\n214\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.330\nmaybe a one inch all-around for\nthe others.\n\n215\n00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.230\nAnd there, and I could go,\nlet's just see what it looks like.\n\n216\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.930\nSo, perfect.\n\n217\n00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.630\nNow I have my margins.\n\n218\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.000\nThis is another place where if you were\nprinting it on company letterhead for\n\n219\n00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.900\nmaybe the first page but not the others,\nthat's where those sections come in\n\n220\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.240\nto where you can determine\nmargins differently.\n\n221\n00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.550\nLet's go back into that\ncustom margins dialogue box.\n\n222\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.510\nThere's a few other things that I want to\npoint out in this particular dialogue box.\n\n223\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.310\nAnd I just went back to putting\nit to one inch all around.\n\n224\n00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.400\nAnd you do see the preview and\nit is applying to this whole document.\n\n225\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.850\nThis point forward,\nthat's the one we're talking about.\n\n226\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.100\nWhen we did columns in some of our\nprevious episodes within this area,\n\n227\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.500\nit would then add a section break into\nyour document, depending on where\n\n228\n00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.200\nyour cursor is, and that's where margins\nwill be set for that point forward.\n\n229\n00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.860\nAnd the other part would be\nwhatever it was set at before.\n\n230\n00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.330\nBut we are doing whole document for\nthis one.\n\n231\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.280\nWhat is the gutter?\n\n232\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.270\nThe gutter is the space for the binding.\n\n233\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.650\nYou really see it in this preview.\n\n234\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:15.390\nIf I determine that I want to put in a\ngutter, and you can see down here, you see\n\n235\n00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:21.040\nit's making a checkerboard area of where\nyou're going to be binding this document.\n\n236\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.580\nMaybe you're putting this\ninto a three hole punch or\n\n237\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.700\nsome type of binder that way.\n\n238\n00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.070\nMaybe you're spiral binding this.\n\n239\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.390\nAnd so you want to have the margin\nof the white space around\n\n240\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:37.230\nthe page to stay the same on the left and\nright hand side of the page, but\n\n241\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.370\nthen also have that room for the binding.\n\n242\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.810\nSo, the gutter just adds like\na little bit of extra space for you.\n\n243\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.970\nAnd these are some things like,\nI don't know how much gutter I need.\n\n244\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.550\nYou might have specifications or\nmaybe even searching how much gutter\n\n245\n00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:56.170\ndo you need for a three inch, for a three\nhole punch binder with a one inch margin.\n\n246\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.300\nAnd it will give you an exact measurement.\n\n247\n00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.450\nThis could also be just print out\none piece of paper, try it out.\n\n248\n00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.940\nToo much, and then you can go ahead and\njust from there.\n\n249\n00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.030\nBut that's what the gutter means.\n\n250\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.320\nAnd then the position,\nbecause you can go ahead and\n\n251\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.300\nbound it from the left like a normal book,\nor you could also do it like a legal\n\n252\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.087\npad to where the binding is on the top\nrather than the left-hand side.\n\n253\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.220\nSo, that is what the gutter does.\n\n254\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.000\nThe multiple pages, this where again if\nyou were printing it front and back and\n\n255\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.260\nyou are going to have it bound\nin the middle of some way.\n\n256\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.220\nYou could do the mirror margins or\nyou could really do,\n\n257\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.760\nI would do the book fold cause\nthink about the book in the middle.\n\n258\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.630\nAnd now the left and\nthe right don't say left and\n\n259\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.710\nright they say inside and outside.\n\n260\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.285\nAnd just to show you if\nI go back to normal,\n\n261\n00:13:45.285 --> 00:13:48.660\nthere's where the left and\nthe right comes into play.\n\n262\n00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.830\nSo all the different things that\nyou could do for your margins.\n\n263\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.460\nWe click OK.\nAnd just to prove the point,\n\n264\n00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.640\nyou know what,\nI just changed the page orientation.\n\n265\n00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you did.\n\n266\n00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.860\n&gt;&gt; So, wasn't really expecting to go\ninto page orientation in this example,\n\n267\n00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.510\nbut might as well go ahead and tell it.\n\n268\n00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.910\nThis is portrait.\n\n269\n00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.450\nThis is landscape.\n\n270\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.140\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good enough.\n\n271\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.165\n&gt;&gt; And that's really all there is.\n\n272\n00:14:12.165 --> 00:14:14.940\n[LAUGH] And\nI had accidentally set it there.\n\n273\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.040\nIt is in that page setup, but\nthere's a button right here, so\n\n274\n00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.070\nI'll just flip it back into\nmy portrait orientation.\n\n275\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:22.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne-\n&gt;&gt; And I can do that.\n\n276\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.860\n&gt;&gt; You were also talking about the ability\nto adjust these margins using the ruler.\n\n277\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.470\nHow do we do that?\n\n278\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.020\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n279\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.330\nLet's throw in a session and\ndo both at the same time.\n\n280\n00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:30.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds good.\n\n281\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.860\n&gt;&gt; No, that's fine.\n\n282\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.385\nI like just going with the flow there,\nRonnie.\n\n283\n00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:35.655\n[LAUGH] This is not scripted.\n\n284\n00:14:35.655 --> 00:14:38.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we'll go with a continuous section\n\n285\n00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.060\nbreak right here.\n\n286\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:45.430\nAnd that way I could, actually I should\nprobably put in a next page, cuz if we're\n\n287\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:51.330\ndoing margins, you can't really have\nmargins on the same page be different.\n\n288\n00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.690\nSo let's go ahead and undo that,\nand then insert a page break.\n\n289\n00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:55.220\nThere we go.\n\n290\n00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.781\nAnd sometime with a page break,\nyou know what,\n\n291\n00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:05.070\nI just realized this is\na good teaching moment.\n\n292\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:09.060\nBecause if I take in a page break,\nand I come into here, and I say, okay,\n\n293\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.830\nlet's go ahead and make my wide margins.\n\n294\n00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.230\nAnd I look back up here and\nit's like, wait, that's the same.\n\n295\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.480\nI thought I put in a break.\n\n296\n00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.540\nWell, a page break is one thing, but\nit's not the same as a section break.\n\n297\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.360\nYou are not sectioning your document,\n\n298\n00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.190\nyou're just forcing it down like\na hard page return in here.\n\n299\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.410\nSo it's not the same thing.\n\n300\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.730\nYou can keep a page break here,\ncuz I do want it down.\n\n301\n00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.940\nBut you can then also\ninsert a section break.\n\n302\n00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.650\nSo I can do a continuous section break.\n\n303\n00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.080\nAnd notice, it's kinda hard\nto differentiate those, well,\n\n304\n00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.390\nthe page break and the section break.\n\n305\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.580\nLet me zoom in so you can see this.\n\n306\n00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:53.547\nSee how this is like single dots and\nthe continuous section is two dots?\n\n307\n00:15:53.547 --> 00:15:57.368\nAnd you got to be very careful cuz if this\ntext was all the way over and there was\n\n308\n00:15:57.368 --> 00:16:01.510\nbarely, the paragraph was right there,\nyou could sometimes not even see these.\n\n309\n00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.232\nWatch your status bar,\n\n310\n00:16:03.232 --> 00:16:08.680\nbecause my status bar will let me\nknow I'm in section one right now.\n\n311\n00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.670\nAnd then I come down here.\n\n312\n00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.150\nI am now in section two.\n\n313\n00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.220\nCuz now if I have my sections,\nlet's go in reverse,\n\n314\n00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.960\nlet's throw in the normal margins here,\nwide margins there.\n\n315\n00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.097\nSo sections different from each place.\n\n316\n00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:29.071\nBut you said the ruler, yes.\n\n317\n00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:30.810\n&gt;&gt; The ruler.\n&gt;&gt; And good, keeping me on track there,\n\n318\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:31.460\nRonnie.\n\n319\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.618\nWe gotta stick to the letter of the law,\nstick to the ruler.\n\n320\n00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:37.610\n[LAUGH] And where can I do this?\n\n321\n00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:39.790\nWell, it's on the ruler.\n\n322\n00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.300\n[LAUGH] Notice here,\nthe area up at the time.\n\n323\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.580\nWe were using the ruler to go ahead and\nchange our first line indents,\n\n324\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.420\nput our tab stops on here.\n\n325\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.740\nBut the grey area versus the white area,\nthat's your margin.\n\n326\n00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:01.438\nYou gotta get the two-pointed arrow,\nlet me see if I can, right, right.\n\n327\n00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:04.890\nThere, you see that?\n\n328\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.018\nTwo pointed arrows left and\nright is left margin.\n\n329\n00:17:07.018 --> 00:17:08.210\nAnd I click-hold and\n\n330\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.400\nI can drag that over just like a type\nwriter in the old days, Ronnie.\n\n331\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.150\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; And I can move that over.\n\n332\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.850\nAnd so\nI can adjust it on the fly from the ruler.\n\n333\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.720\nNow I also have a vertical ruler\nthat's being shown right here, and\n\n334\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.830\nI can do the same thing.\n\n335\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.960\nSo that way our top and\n\n336\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.350\nbottom margins could be controlled\nfrom dragging it on the ruler.\n\n337\n00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.730\nSo it's a little bit more\nof a visual indication.\n\n338\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.790\nYou do have it where it almost kind\nof sticks on the increments for\n\n339\n00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.390\nI believe every quarter of an inch.\n\n340\n00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.690\nBut you could throw it in the middle\nsomewhere where it might look like\n\n341\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.860\na quarter or a half, but It's like\nin a weight eighth type position.\n\n342\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.810\nAnd so just going into the margin or\n\n343\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.870\npage setup dialogue box and\nmanually typing in the numbers,\n\n344\n00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:58.398\nthat can kinda help you make sure that you\nget it exactly like you want it to be.\n\n345\n00:17:58.398 --> 00:17:59.670\nAll right, so\n\n346\n00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.320\nthose are all the ways that I can think of\nto change the margins in a Word document.\n\n347\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.140\nSo let's move onto headers and footers.\n\n348\n00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.200\nWhat's living in those tops and\nbottoms of our margins.\n\n349\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.682\nNow, with your headers and footers,\n\n350\n00:18:14.682 --> 00:18:20.940\nyou do have to where you can choose from\na gallery of pre-made headers and footers.\n\n351\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:26.010\nAnd a lot of them are like the cover page\nthat we covered in another episodes.\n\n352\n00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.265\nIt's where it has some graphical\nelements with some extra text that's\n\n353\n00:18:29.265 --> 00:18:30.970\nalready in there.\n\n354\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.390\nOr you could create your own margins.\n\n355\n00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.680\nNot margins, that would be headers and\nfooters, in our margins.\n\n356\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.530\nWhere do we go to insert our headers and\nfooters?\n\n357\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.290\nWell, that would be our Insert tab.\n\n358\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.480\nSo let's come on down into here.\n\n359\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.890\nGo into the Insert tab.\n\n360\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.330\nAnd being different for our sections,\nI want to insert a header.\n\n361\n00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.270\nNow when I choose the header, notice\nit has these different types like this\n\n362\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.930\nAustin or this Banded or the Filigree.\n\n363\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:03.330\nAnd that's where, remember those cover\npages, they had these same names.\n\n364\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.090\nSo it's nice that they're\ntrying to give us\n\n365\n00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.700\nelements of our page\nlayout that all match.\n\n366\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.360\nSo I could have a filigree cover page,\nI could have a filigree header and\n\n367\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.030\na filigree footer.\n\n368\n00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.840\nAnd then it will all\nvisually look the same.\n\n369\n00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.465\nSo that's a nice way for\nus to not really have to think too much.\n\n370\n00:19:23.465 --> 00:19:25.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, fairly consistent.\n\n371\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, creates some nice stuff in here.\n\n372\n00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.850\nAnd so\nyou could pick any of these that you want.\n\n373\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.630\nBut I'm gonna come up to the blank one cuz\n\n374\n00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:39.600\nI wanna show you how all of our\nheaders are really set up by default.\n\n375\n00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.550\nAnd it works all the tab stops.\n\n376\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.720\nSo if you have not watched the tab\nstops episode, go back and watch that.\n\n377\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.920\nAnd that way, when we get into our,\nwhat is a centered tab stop and\n\n378\n00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.710\nwhat is a right align tab stop,\nyou'll know what I'm talking about.\n\n379\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.990\nSo let's go into the blank three columns.\n\n380\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.220\nAnd the header means that it will\ngo up into the header of the page.\n\n381\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.500\nAnd it gives me the header\nsection 1 because I do have that.\n\n382\n00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.922\nAnd it also brings up the contextual tab\non the ribbon for the header and footers.\n\n383\n00:20:09.922 --> 00:20:12.420\nAnd there's a couple different icons and\n\n384\n00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.970\nthings that we can do now\nthat I'm in the header area.\n\n385\n00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.730\nThe other thing to notice, and let me zoom\nout, is that now that I'm in the header\n\n386\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:25.230\narea, the rest of my document grays out.\n\n387\n00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.150\nAnd it can be a little distracting,\nlike gosh, where did I go?\n\n388\n00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.570\nYou're in the behind\nthe scenes if you want to say.\n\n389\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.100\nYou're in the page.\n\n390\n00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.450\nSo it's isolating, but\nyou're not typing in the text area.\n\n391\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.100\nYou're typing in the header area.\n\n392\n00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.160\nYou could get out of that.\n\n393\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.600\nBefore I even type in any text just now,\nhow can I leave and come back to it?\n\n394\n00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.880\nWell, there's a big old close header and\nfooter right there.\n\n395\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.990\nSo that's one way, that's the easiest.\n\n396\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.520\nYou click it.\n\n397\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.280\nAnd now notice, because I had inserted\na header, even though I didn't type\n\n398\n00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.710\nanything, I now have those areas grayed\nout because now I'm in the document.\n\n399\n00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:06.620\nSo there's two different places of where\nyou want to be in when you want to work,\n\n400\n00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.280\nwell, in the different places.\n\n401\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.230\nHow do I get back into this?\n\n402\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.520\nBecause I am not going to insert\nthe header again, there is no reason to,\n\n403\n00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.320\nit's already there.\n\n404\n00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.725\nYou just double-click it.\n\n405\n00:21:15.725 --> 00:21:19.210\nIf you double-click in\nthe top margin header,\n\n406\n00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:24.960\nit activates the header section,\nbrings up that contextual tab,\n\n407\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.120\ngrays out the rest of your text,\nand now you're in this area.\n\n408\n00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.440\nTake note, what is that?\n\n409\n00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.430\nThat's a center-align tab stop.\n\n410\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.630\nThis is a right-align tab stop.\n\n411\n00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:43.510\nSo you have three specific sections\nin your headers separated by tabs.\n\n412\n00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.640\nAnd its nice that in this blank set up,\n\n413\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.300\nits giving me like Type Here,\nType Here, Type There.\n\n414\n00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.420\nSo, but if you delete them you know that\nyou could always throw that tab back\n\n415\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.990\nin and\nget to those three different places.\n\n416\n00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.270\nNow do you have to use all three areas?\n\n417\n00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.340\nMaybe I just want something on\nthe left and something on the right?\n\n418\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.510\nThat's fine.\nMaybe you just want\n\n419\n00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.460\nsomething in the middle.\n\n420\n00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.020\nThat's fine, too.\n\n421\n00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.240\nOkay, you don't have to\noccupy each one of them.\n\n422\n00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.770\nBut for demonstration purposes,\nwe'll go ahead and get most of them.\n\n423\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.460\nSo let's type in,\nI'll just type in my name.\n\n424\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.010\nThat was always the example that I would,\n\n425\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.330\nnow I have an inclination to tab,\nbut the tab's already there.\n\n426\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.760\nSo I'll be making another one.\n\n427\n00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.990\nSo I don't want to, you've got it.\n\n428\n00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.132\nJust click it.\n\n429\n00:22:30.132 --> 00:22:32.695\nLet me go ahead and re-do that.\n\n430\n00:22:32.695 --> 00:22:34.266\nHit the delete key.\n\n431\n00:22:34.266 --> 00:22:36.250\nNow I'm in to that area.\n\n432\n00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.060\nThere we go, throwing it off a little bit.\n\n433\n00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.440\nAnd then we can say Example.\n\n434\n00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.560\nAnd then, type here OfficePro.\n\n435\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.060\nPerfect.\n\n436\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.940\nSo, I've got the information that\nI want to get into my Header.\n\n437\n00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.830\nNow, I'm in this area, if I have\na header you can also have a footer.\n\n438\n00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.870\nYou don't have to have either one of them,\nbut if you want one versus the other.\n\n439\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:04.350\nBut while I'm in this area, how is the\neasiest way for me to get to the footer?\n\n440\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.700\nThere's a button right here, Go to footer.\n\n441\n00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.050\nPerfect.\n\n442\n00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:13.868\nAnd it drops you down to the end\nof my document where I could put\n\n443\n00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:16.430\nin things like date and time.\n\n444\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.310\nI could put on the page numbers, and\n\n445\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.860\nthat's where we will be\nputting in our page numbers.\n\n446\n00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.110\nFor the most part, you should always\nput page numbers in the headers and\n\n447\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.480\nfooters because that's going\nto populate and change.\n\n448\n00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.340\nSo if you're on page three,\nit'll show page three.\n\n449\n00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.600\nIf you're on page four,\nyou'll go on page four.\n\n450\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.570\nBut like I said, separate part for\nthat particular episode, cuz I really want\n\n451\n00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:41.520\nto concentrate on the different formatting\noptions that you could do from there.\n\n452\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.900\nSo you can add text for these elements.\n\n453\n00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.888\nAnd you can jump back and forth from\nthem in the go to header, go to footer,\n\n454\n00:23:48.888 --> 00:23:50.587\njumping back and forth.\n\n455\n00:23:50.587 --> 00:23:55.901\nLeaving it, you can close it or you can\njust double-click into the page area and\n\n456\n00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.977\nthen you've activated that.\n\n457\n00:23:57.977 --> 00:24:00.491\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\nwhen we start to do this, right?\n\n458\n00:24:00.491 --> 00:24:04.975\nI remember one of the first times I\ndid this, it was really great until I\n\n459\n00:24:04.975 --> 00:24:10.310\nrealized something that the very first\npage that I had when I printed it out.\n\n460\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.540\nIt had the header on it, and\nI didn't need to have the header on it.\n\n461\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.172\nIs there a way I can change that?\n\n462\n00:24:15.172 --> 00:24:16.530\n&gt;&gt; That's a very common thing,\n\n463\n00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.530\nbecause if you think about our\nfirst page might be our cover page.\n\n464\n00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that, and\n\n465\n00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.450\nI don't want it there.\n\n466\n00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.925\nLets get back into that header,\ndouble clicking in that area,\n\n467\n00:24:25.925 --> 00:24:28.034\nbecause that is an option right here.\n\n468\n00:24:28.034 --> 00:24:30.610\nDifferent first page.\n\n469\n00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:35.616\nAnd if I check that box on,\nnotice on that first page,\n\n470\n00:24:35.616 --> 00:24:39.751\nI have removed that text\nthat I had typed in.\n\n471\n00:24:39.751 --> 00:24:45.730\nAnd actually, if I type in something\ndifferent, first page, notice that here.\n\n472\n00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.417\nWe don't really need to see with the text,\nbut\n\n473\n00:24:47.417 --> 00:24:49.382\nyou can see that this is\ndifferent than the other one.\n\n474\n00:24:49.382 --> 00:24:54.880\nBecause maybe I wanna just say, Intro to\nWord, or Welcome to Alice in Wonderland.\n\n475\n00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.530\nAnd then the rest of it have\nthe headers that I want to populate\n\n476\n00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.300\nthroughout the rest of the document,\nso that's a really good one.\n\n477\n00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.300\nAnother one would be if you want different\nones on even and odd pages, left and\n\n478\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:10.090\nright, or even and odd [LAUGH], and\nI could change it for those ones.\n\n479\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.171\nAnd if you change it on all of it,\nit will work from there.\n\n480\n00:25:13.171 --> 00:25:15.800\nNotice the header from the top,\nand header from the bottom.\n\n481\n00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.100\nThese are different ways that you\ncan also change where they position\n\n482\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.800\nwithin the margin area.\n\n483\n00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.880\nSo that's something to know about.\n\n484\n00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.941\nAnd then of course, with our sections,\nthat's where I really wanna show you hey,\n\n485\n00:25:29.941 --> 00:25:34.008\nI need different things for\ndifferent pages, or groups of pages.\n\n486\n00:25:34.008 --> 00:25:38.442\nAnd there's one thing that always\ntrips people up, and that's the,\n\n487\n00:25:38.442 --> 00:25:41.430\nwhy does it keep doing it for all of them?\n\n488\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.190\nYou have to unlink them.\n\n489\n00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.170\nLet me show you.\n\n490\n00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:48.860\nI have another document that is called,\nFooters with Sections.\n\n491\n00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.810\nAnd this document's already got a few\ndifferent things in here to know,\n\n492\n00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:57.000\nbefore you start, trying on your document,\nit's not working the same.\n\n493\n00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000\nLet's look at this.\n\n494\n00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.073\nWe have some next page section breaks.\n\n495\n00:26:03.073 --> 00:26:07.773\nSo I have a section designated here, and\nI'm going through, there's another one.\n\n496\n00:26:07.773 --> 00:26:11.791\nThere's another section,\nthere's another section.\n\n497\n00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:15.830\nI also have some special page\nnumberings that's going on in here.\n\n498\n00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.292\nBecause I'm using this in the example,\nbut I wanted to throw this in,\n\n499\n00:26:19.292 --> 00:26:23.123\nbecause its already got sections in it,\nand I can demonstrate this concept.\n\n500\n00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:28.940\nLet's go into, I just wanna make sure,\nthis one, let's go here.\n\n501\n00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.450\nSo let's get into the footer area,\nand I'm going to double click.\n\n502\n00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.200\nAnd even though,\n\n503\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.290\nI know I'm zoomed out really far,\nso just watch what's going on here.\n\n504\n00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.650\nI'm just gonna type in, Ron Smith.\n\n505\n00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:48.120\nAnd notice that it says,\nfooter section one, footer section two.\n\n506\n00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.690\nBut it's doing the whole\nthing through all of it.\n\n507\n00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.370\nSo you're thinking, well,\nI've already got sections.\n\n508\n00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.360\nHere let me come over here to section two,\nand type in some more text.\n\n509\n00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.110\nWhy is it doing it for all of them?\n\n510\n00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.620\nRight up here, the very top,\nlink to previous.\n\n511\n00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.420\nLink to previous section to continue\nusing the same header and footer.\n\n512\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:15.090\nTurn this feature off to create different\nheader and footer for the current section.\n\n513\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.230\nThere it is, that's what's going to\nmake it to where I can change it.\n\n514\n00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.971\nSo, I will be in header two making\nsure my cursor's in the next section.\n\n515\n00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:30.090\nTurn off the link, and then,\nI can type in more text in the middle.\n\n516\n00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:34.413\nSo you can see that this page on the left,\nwhich is section one,\n\n517\n00:27:34.413 --> 00:27:36.545\nis not the same as section two.\n\n518\n00:27:36.545 --> 00:27:42.110\nBut there's more sections,\nif I scroll on down to section three.\n\n519\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.020\nIt's still continuing, isn't it?\n\n520\n00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.972\nBecause by default,\nthey're all linked together.\n\n521\n00:27:45.972 --> 00:27:49.726\nSo if you have multiple sections, you're\ngonna have to go and say, all right,\n\n522\n00:27:49.726 --> 00:27:50.743\nwell section three.\n\n523\n00:27:50.743 --> 00:27:55.340\nI need to unlink you, and then,\ntype in something different,\n\n524\n00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.910\njust a couple letters.\n\n525\n00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.080\nThink you guys getting\nthe hang of it right now.\n\n526\n00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.430\nEach section has to unlink\nitself from the other,\n\n527\n00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:08.770\nand then, you could go ahead and\nchange whoops, well that's fine.\n\n528\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.878\n[LAUGH] It demonstrates that\nit is different, isn't it.\n\n529\n00:28:11.878 --> 00:28:16.284\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now Vonne, I've actually had\nto use this before on a very large,\n\n530\n00:28:16.284 --> 00:28:18.642\nlarge document with a school system.\n\n531\n00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:22.940\nWhere they had multiple reports coming in\nfrom each of the different departments.\n\n532\n00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.776\nAnd there was this one lady that had\nto collate all those documents as one,\n\n533\n00:28:27.776 --> 00:28:30.353\nbefore they could send it to the state.\n\n534\n00:28:30.353 --> 00:28:32.463\nWell the problem that she had was simple,\n\n535\n00:28:32.463 --> 00:28:35.602\nwas this idea that they wanted\nthe actual headers to be there.\n\n536\n00:28:35.602 --> 00:28:39.681\nBut then, in the header or the footer,\nthey wanted to put the department names.\n\n537\n00:28:39.681 --> 00:28:41.974\nAnd they didn't know exactly\nhow this would work,\n\n538\n00:28:41.974 --> 00:28:45.402\nbecause every time they changed it,\nthat lady, you know I felt bad for her.\n\n539\n00:28:45.402 --> 00:28:47.356\nCuz she'd been doing this for now five or\n\n540\n00:28:47.356 --> 00:28:51.110\nsix years, where she'd just manually\nturn off all the headers and footers.\n\n541\n00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:55.960\nAnd then went every single page,\nand typed in the actual things.\n\n542\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.654\nWhen I showed her this, she could\nnot believe that it was that simple.\n\n543\n00:28:59.654 --> 00:29:02.735\nThat all she had to do was take that\ndocument, and as she merged them together,\n\n544\n00:29:02.735 --> 00:29:05.480\nwhich she'll get into into\nadvanced areas I'm assuming.\n\n545\n00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.990\nAs she did that, she was able to\nactually just unlink those, and\n\n546\n00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.230\nnow it actually changed it for her.\n\n547\n00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.980\nShe was able to change it in one place,\nand there it was.\n\n548\n00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.080\nSo if you think that it can't help\nyou out, it really is something\n\n549\n00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.840\nthat can help you out, with extremely\nlong documents when you do this.\n\n550\n00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.100\nIt's really gonna be helpful.\n\n551\n00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.880\nThe other thing, of course,\nis with book editing,\n\n552\n00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.530\nif you're doing something like that,\nas well.\n\n553\n00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.790\nThis can also help you out.\n\n554\n00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.660\nI had a friend that published a book, and\n\n555\n00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.290\nhe wanted the odd and\neven page headers to be different.\n\n556\n00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.215\nAnd he didn't know how to do that.\n\n557\n00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:36.867\nAnd I showed them that if\nI can import it into word,\n\n558\n00:29:36.867 --> 00:29:39.788\nit will also be able to do that,\nas well as very easily.\n\n559\n00:29:39.788 --> 00:29:43.677\n&gt;&gt; And you say this all\nthe time in printed material,\n\n560\n00:29:43.677 --> 00:29:46.275\nin textbooks, or the chapters.\n\n561\n00:29:46.275 --> 00:29:49.355\nIt says, Chapter Two,\nmuscle skeletal blah, blah, blah,\n\n562\n00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:53.690\nand then Chapter Three,\nthe cranial nerves or something.\n\n563\n00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it could be 40 pages in\n\n564\n00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.210\neach chapter, and if you're thinking about\n\n565\n00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.160\nthat woman who had all those-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n566\n00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.305\n&gt;&gt; I mean to manually have to change that\nfor 40 pages, and then another 40 pages.\n\n567\n00:30:05.305 --> 00:30:05.881\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n568\n00:30:05.881 --> 00:30:06.910\n&gt;&gt; That's painful.\n\n569\n00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n570\n00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.680\nyou see it as just how do\nthey get it to do that?\n\n571\n00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.630\nAnd that's always the thing,\nit's like I know I've seen this done.\n\n572\n00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.963\nSo why isn't it doing it?\n\n573\n00:30:14.963 --> 00:30:16.995\nThose little nuances\nthat link to previous,\n\n574\n00:30:16.995 --> 00:30:21.070\nit's the only thing that you would have\nto check off to make it different.\n\n575\n00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.960\nAgain, those sections.\n\n576\n00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:28.490\nThe sections is that part of, I can really\nchange each part different than the other.\n\n577\n00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.628\nThat opens up a whole world of\npossibilities of what you can do.\n\n578\n00:30:32.628 --> 00:30:37.620\nMy only little asterisk on this\nwill be that Word is very powerful.\n\n579\n00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.631\nIt can do a lot of things.\n\n580\n00:30:38.631 --> 00:30:43.174\nBut if you're getting into high\nend level textbook layout,\n\n581\n00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:47.880\nyou might actually find yourself\nfighting with Word more.\n\n582\n00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.787\nTo make it do what you want to, then\ngraduating up to say Microsoft Publisher.\n\n583\n00:30:52.787 --> 00:30:54.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or even one more step up,\n\n584\n00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.150\nyou go into Adobe In Design.\n\n585\n00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.720\nSo it can do a lot of stuff.\n\n586\n00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.490\nBut sometimes you might need\nto go just a little bit more,\n\n587\n00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.490\nbecause those other\nprograms just give you that\n\n588\n00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.470\nmuch more control over things,\n&gt;&gt; No doubt.\n\n589\n00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Like this, and\nit might be a little easier.\n\n590\n00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.530\nBut again, that's a whole other project,\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n591\n00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.030\n&gt;&gt; You have to learn.\nBut hey, guess what?\n\n592\n00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.406\nWe have shows about that too, so [LAUGH].\n\n593\n00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:19.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Vonne, for helping\nus understand a little bit more about\n\n594\n00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:23.140\nthe margins, as well as headers and\nthe footers, and their effective use.\n\n595\n00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.650\nRemember to pay attention here, because\nthese really do help your documents\n\n596\n00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.600\nto look like the professional\ndocuments that you want them to be.\n\n597\n00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.190\nWell, there's more to come, but\nthat's for another episode.\n\n598\n00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.470\nSigning off for OfficePRO.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n599\n00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n600\n00:31:38.560 -->

00:00:13.660\nYou're watching the Microsoft Word\n2016 Essentials Show.\n\n4\n00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.281\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\nactually gonna be diving into a part two\n\n5\n00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:22.332\non margins, headers and footers,we've\ngot a little bit more to cover.\n\n6\n00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:24.235\nAnd here to help us, of course,\n\n7\n00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:28.925\nis going to be the Microsoft Word 2016\nvirtuoso herself Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:30.868\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:33.000\n&gt;&gt; I'm loving these nouns\nyou've got going on, virtuoso.\n\n10\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.258\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n11\n00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:36.952\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I should to\nbreak out in song right now.\n\n12\n00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:37.834\n&gt;&gt; Go for it.\n\n13\n00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:40.218\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll spare you all [LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:42.504\nYeah, don't let me start singing Frozen.\n\n15\n00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:46.570\nYes lots of arm movements\ngoing on there so.\n\n16\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.750\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n17\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.900\nNow that our mute viewers,\nour deaf viewers are actually got quite\n\n18\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.420\na show ahead of us, let's talk about this\nidea of what we need to cover right.\n\n19\n00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.690\nSo in the previous episode we talked\na little bit, I say a little bit we talked\n\n20\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.610\na lot about headers and footers and where\nthey do make the document more effective.\n\n21\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.480\nSo Vonne what do we really\nhave left to go over here?\n\n22\n00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.390\n&gt;&gt; Well the thing that we could put in our\nheaders and footers would be page numbers.\n\n23\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.390\nThat's something that you would want\nto have on every repeating page, and\n\n24\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.510\nthat's really, in a sense,\nwhat headers and footers do.\n\n25\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.740\nThey have content that repeat on\nevery page within your document.\n\n26\n00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.530\nAnd the of course control by sections and\ndepending on if you wanted to have\n\n27\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.300\ndifferent headers and footers, we talked\nabout having them linked to each other.\n\n28\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.655\nAnd so if you unlink them, then the become\ntheir own entity within its section.\n\n29\n00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.380\nBut we didn't get into page numbers, so\n\n30\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.330\nthat's what I'd really like to\nconcentrate on this particular part two.\n\n31\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.920\nSo let's jump into a file that\nwe have called Page Layout,\n\n32\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.260\nwhich is the same one that\nwe were working with before.\n\n33\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.910\nI had just closed it down and\nstarted it back up, so it's fresh.\n\n34\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.890\nAnd there's no header or footer in here.\n\n35\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.010\nSo if I wanted to insert page numbers,\nyou can go over to your insert tab,\n\n36\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.720\nand you have page number right here.\n\n37\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.470\nNow there's a couple options here,\ndo you want it at the top of the page,\n\n38\n00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.890\ndo you want it at the bottom of the page?\n\n39\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.450\nThose two are going to\nbe in that header and\n\n40\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.810\nfooter area that will be automatically\ndesignated when you go ahead and do that.\n\n41\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.060\nAnd the page margins, the nice\nthing is like when you hover over,\n\n42\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.900\nit's gonna give you\nsome of those previous.\n\n43\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.487\nThat's where it's like off into, well,\nthe actual margin area of your page and\n\n44\n00:02:23.487 --> 00:02:25.585\nyou can have it in a left or the right.\n\n45\n00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:29.429\nAnd I mean, I've seen this in many\ndifferent types of books where the page\n\n46\n00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.450\nnumber is actually on that\nlike upper right hand corner.\n\n47\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.910\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or up on the top of the header area.\n\n48\n00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.903\nSo it's really more of a stylistic\npreference on where you want your headers.\n\n49\n00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:41.249\nDo you want them centered?\n\n50\n00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:42.081\nDo you want them on the left?\n\n51\n00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:43.331\nTotally up to you.\n\n52\n00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:45.370\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, you make a good point there.\n\n53\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.730\nThe very fact is that if you're working\nat the collegiate level, right, college?\n\n54\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.721\nYou might have to follow a style guide\nlike the APA or the MLA, I don't even know\n\n55\n00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:56.770\nif the MLA still are, but you have to\nfollow a certain style guide there.\n\n56\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.994\nAnd this really helps you out because\nyou're no longer having to guess and\n\n57\n00:02:59.994 --> 00:03:02.608\njudge where it is,\nyou can find that from that style guide.\n\n58\n00:03:02.608 --> 00:03:06.500\nIt looks like Word can help us set that\nparticular page number where we need it.\n\n59\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n60\n00:03:07.528 --> 00:03:10.744\nAnd these are all of the things\nthat maybe your business,\n\n61\n00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:14.831\nnot even at the college level,\nmaybe your office has determined a policy\n\n62\n00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:18.382\nthat every document that comes in\nhas to have a page number, and\n\n63\n00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:22.680\na lot of times with the file name or\nthe file path that it actually comes from.\n\n64\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.140\nI've seen a lot of that in like some\ngovernment agencies so where you can know\n\n65\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.585\nwhere that was printed from and\nthey can locate it later.\n\n66\n00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:35.251\nThat's where we have our header and footer\nareas and of course the page numbers.\n\n67\n00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:38.157\nAnd do you want it to be in one,\ntwo, three.\n\n68\n00:03:38.157 --> 00:03:40.543\nDo you want it to be A,\nB, C or Roman numerals?\n\n69\n00:03:40.543 --> 00:03:42.555\nIt all depends.\n\n70\n00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.895\nAnd of course with those sections,\n\n71\n00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:47.485\nI always want to throw in those\nsections because they are so important.\n\n72\n00:03:47.485 --> 00:03:52.110\nThen maybe you want the first part\nof your book almost like the preface\n\n73\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.120\nwould be in Roman numerals and\nthen the chapters would be in numbers.\n\n74\n00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.950\nSo there's different formats for\nthose page numbers as well.\n\n75\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.440\nAnd there is another place where you can\nput it where it's in Current position.\n\n76\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.060\nNow, this is wherever your cursor is.\n\n77\n00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.870\nI mean, you can put it directly into\nthe document, if you really wanted to.\n\n78\n00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.810\nIt doesn't have to be, like there's no\nother way that you can put in page numbers\n\n79\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.955\nbesides in the headers and footers.\n\n80\n00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.355\nIt can go right into\nthe page if you want it to.\n\n81\n00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:22.625\nAnd this is also one,\nif maybe you're already in the header and\n\n82\n00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:26.884\nfooter, then you might wanna say, in\nthe current position where that cursor is,\n\n83\n00:04:26.884 --> 00:04:30.178\nthat's where I would like to have\na page number to be inserted.\n\n84\n00:04:30.178 --> 00:04:35.006\nI'm gonna go with the page, the bottom\nof the page, we'll go with our footer,\n\n85\n00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:38.538\nand you can see they have some\nof those pre-built styles or\n\n86\n00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:43.513\ngalleries of these building blocks as we\nnamed them in some of our other episodes,\n\n87\n00:04:43.513 --> 00:04:45.493\ncuz well that's what they are.\n\n88\n00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:49.303\nIt's all these things that come with the\nprogram, oops I moved over, so you can see\n\n89\n00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:53.853\nI had just like some basic numbers,\nsomeone with like little lines across it.\n\n90\n00:04:53.853 --> 00:04:58.623\nSome have some graphical elements where it\nhas some little square it's got like that\n\n91\n00:04:58.623 --> 00:05:03.710\nbig line right there, so you can go and\nsee which one kind of matches.\n\n92\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.740\nAnd do take note on some of these\nnames because we did notice in\n\n93\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.990\nsome of the headers that they're matching\nwith those cover pages that you can add.\n\n94\n00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.872\nSo it's almost like a stationary set,\nwhere it's all of these different pieces.\n\n95\n00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:21.326\nWhere you would order all of the envelopes\nlook the same and the all the stationary,\n\n96\n00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:24.230\nthe headings are letterheads\nthat's what I was trying to say.\n\n97\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.462\nSo they do match these names, and\n\n98\n00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:31.410\nsome don't match they're just part\nof whatever they wanted to determine\n\n99\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.142\nin the page numbers versus the cover\nsheets and everything like that.\n\n100\n00:05:36.142 --> 00:05:37.738\nSo we pick one that we want.\n\n101\n00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:42.520\nI'm just gonna go super basic\nwith the word, the number.\n\n102\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.030\nLet's go with there, plain number three,\nput it on the right hand side and\n\n103\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.590\nit puts it down in the margin.\n\n104\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.060\nAnd notice that it is grayed a little bit,\nany time you have a field or\n\n105\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.030\nsomething that's going\nto be auto populated,\n\n106\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.900\nwhen we get into answering time and\ndate, that's another thing.\n\n107\n00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.460\nSo sometimes, you'll see things in Word\nthat are when you select it it selects\n\n108\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.380\nthe whole thing, and it's kinda great.\n\n109\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.240\nThat's just one of those types\nof fields or entities that's\n\n110\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.810\nin the document that has some type of\nconnection to updating itself in a sense.\n\n111\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.704\nAnd if you think about page numbers it's\ngoing to update itself every single page.\n\n112\n00:06:18.704 --> 00:06:21.811\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne that actually makes a very\ngood point because if you're new\n\n113\n00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:22.346\nwith Word,\n\n114\n00:06:22.346 --> 00:06:26.140\nyou might think that this is something\nthat I should manually set in there.\n\n115\n00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.150\nAnd then you go and you select that and\nall of a sudden you hit Delete,\n\n116\n00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.390\nyou might have deleted\nthe entire field out of there.\n\n117\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.240\nAnd that means you're\nwondering now why page 2 or\n\n118\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.540\npage 256 didn't populate\nthe way that you wanted to.\n\n119\n00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.350\nSo be careful, when you see that gray\nfield, just kind of leave it as is for\n\n120\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.310\nright now and\n\n121\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.460\nthen you'll actually see where you can\nadjust some of that a little bit later on.\n\n122\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.212\nBut don't make the mistake like I have\ndone before which is just simply deleting\n\n123\n00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.910\nthat field out of there, and thinking\nthat I did the right thing by doing that.\n\n124\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz you think it's like its own entity.\n\n125\n00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:00.435\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It has no connection to anything else,\n\n126\n00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:02.680\nso yeah that's a huge point to make.\n\n127\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.605\nWhy don't we go ahead, and just for\nvisual purposes, I'm going to select this.\n\n128\n00:07:07.605 --> 00:07:12.930\nCuz even though it's a field it's still\ntext, it's still information, so I'm going\n\n129\n00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.910\nto make this bigger and bolder, formatting\nour text just like anything else.\n\n130\n00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.540\nYou can format the text in the headers and\nfooters, you can space it,\n\n131\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.220\nyou can change it.\n\n132\n00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.814\nSo, let's make it red, let's make it\na lot bigger so you guys can see it.\n\n133\n00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:31.812\nAnd then, I wanna center it,\nbut this is where,\n\n134\n00:07:31.812 --> 00:07:36.070\nyou don't necessarily wanna click\nthe center button necessarily.\n\n135\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.781\nIt will work, but just remember that\nif you had other information there,\n\n136\n00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:45.496\nit might move some other things\naround because the headers and\n\n137\n00:07:45.496 --> 00:07:47.584\nfooters do have tab spot in there.\n\n138\n00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:51.773\nSo if you have other information\nthere with tabs and you're centering,\n\n139\n00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:53.566\nit's like why am I not moving?\n\n140\n00:07:53.566 --> 00:07:57.740\nThat could be why, so it's working this\ntime, but just saying Is not gonna be\n\n141\n00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.852\nthe be all end all of everything that you\ndo in Word, just like anything in all\n\n142\n00:08:01.852 --> 00:08:05.840\nof these products, you watched these\nvideos and I do this same thing.\n\n143\n00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.080\nI watched tutorials and I go and try to\nrecreate them, that's not working for\n\n144\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.620\nme in this particular document,\neven though I'm following the steps as,\n\n145\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.800\nthat's just the nuances\nof all of these programs.\n\n146\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.820\nEvery document is specific and\nhas little quirks and everything so.\n\n147\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.050\nFor now, we've got that, and so you know\nwhat, let's just make it bold as well.\n\n148\n00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.790\nJust make it, just a little bit bigger so\nwe can really, really see that because if\n\n149\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.590\nI double click out of the header area,\nI get some of the footer area.\n\n150\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.370\nNow, I'll just zoom out a little bit so\nyou guys can see the pages,\n\n151\n00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.400\nyou could see that it is travelling across\nwhat's maybe little too much [LAUGH].\n\n152\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.998\nThere is pages one and two,\nthree and four and five.\n\n153\n00:08:42.998 --> 00:08:47.110\nGreat, so, cuz I don't have any sections,\nit's just going ahead and\n\n154\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.158\nnumbering the pages.\n\n155\n00:08:48.158 --> 00:08:52.670\nI could add my own text in\nthere like page dash and\n\n156\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.325\nthen one and the field that we've got.\n\n157\n00:08:55.575 --> 00:08:58.935\nLike I said you can change\nthe formatting of them if you wanted to.\n\n158\n00:08:58.935 --> 00:09:02.231\nI want these to be abc, roman numerals, so\n\n159\n00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:05.905\nlet's double click back\ninto the footer area.\n\n160\n00:09:05.905 --> 00:09:11.107\nIn the Design tab, the contextual\ntab of the header and footer,\n\n161\n00:09:11.107 --> 00:09:13.787\nyou have the page number right over here\ncuz I don't need to insert it again.\n\n162\n00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:15.937\nI've already put the page and ran.\n\n163\n00:09:15.937 --> 00:09:17.692\nI just wanna come in to here and\n\n164\n00:09:17.692 --> 00:09:20.794\nget to the place where I can\nformat the page numbers.\n\n165\n00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:25.361\nI get into this dialog box and\nthat's where you have the 1, 2,\n\n166\n00:09:25.361 --> 00:09:30.279\n3, the ABCs, the Roman numerals and\nlet's go with the ABC for fun.\n\n167\n00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:33.248\nAnd it is continuing from\nthe previous section, and\n\n168\n00:09:33.248 --> 00:09:37.850\nthis is when if you had sections, do you\nwanted to number the pages all together?\n\n169\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.896\nOr do you wanna start at the beginning\nof every section with another,\n\n170\n00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:46.590\nwell, beginning like a number one or even\nstart at number five if you wanted to.\n\n171\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.590\nI'm not sure if that\nmakes it too much sense.\n\n172\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.984\nBut there like there could be reasons\nwhy you might not start at one.\n\n173\n00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:56.840\nWe click OK and you could see that now,\nit's A, B, C, D, and so on and so forth.\n\n174\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.630\nIf I throw in just so we could just\nsee that changing of the pages,\n\n175\n00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.760\nI'm gonna come in front of\nthe A in Alice from the Woods.\n\n176\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.433\nAnd I'm gonna insert a, not insert, sorry.\n\n177\n00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:13.410\nI am going to insert page break, or a\nsection break, but it's in the Layout tab.\n\n178\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.830\nSo I'm going to insert\na continuous section break.\n\n179\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.295\nWell, it didn't change anything.\n\n180\n00:10:18.295 --> 00:10:20.782\nThat's cuz I didn't change\nthe page formatting options.\n\n181\n00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:25.759\nDouble clicking back into the page\nnumbers, and it doesn't matter that I'm on\n\n182\n00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:30.531\nthe next section, I could be over here\non the section one, so that's okay.\n\n183\n00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:35.299\nI come over here to page numbers,\ngo back into Format page numbers, and\n\n184\n00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:38.873\nnow I would like to have\nthe page numbering start at A,\n\n185\n00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:42.530\nbecause I'm using\nthe Alpha characters here.\n\n186\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:48.310\nAnd I click OK, a, b,c and d.\n\n187\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.430\nWhy did that not change?\n\n188\n00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.421\nWell, you know what,\nlet's try it again [LAUGH].\n\n189\n00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:54.540\nLet's go with format page numbers.\n\n190\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.960\nYou know what?\n\n191\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.099\nRemember how I said you didn't\nhave to have your cursor in there?\n\n192\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.543\nI guess I should listen to\nsome of my own lessons.\n\n193\n00:11:02.543 --> 00:11:04.424\nMake sure you have your cursor in there.\n\n194\n00:11:04.424 --> 00:11:11.519\nHey, now we know so I have a, b, c, and\nthen a and b again cuz it starts over.\n\n195\n00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.965\n&gt;&gt; Vonne you were making a point about\nnot needing to start on page one and\n\n196\n00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:18.650\nyou do see this fairly often and again\ngoing back to the print days more then\n\n197\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.930\nanything else\n&gt;&gt; If you were,\n\n198\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.680\nformal papers is where\nI've normally seen them or\n\n199\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.575\nat the beginning of books where\nthey don't actually put a page one.\n\n200\n00:11:26.575 --> 00:11:28.290\nThen just start on page two.\n\n201\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.975\nSo when you do see stuff like this,\ndon't think that it's difficult to do.\n\n202\n00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:37.150\nVonne just showed you how very easy\nit is if you do need to change that.\n\n203\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.940\nAnd this way of beginning the re-numbering\nagain really does help, when you start\n\n204\n00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.730\nactually bringing multiple things\ntogether and you needed to start again.\n\n205\n00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.167\nSo let's take for an example when we're\ntalking about the idea of chapters, right?\n\n206\n00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:52.490\nIf you wanted to actually do each chapter\nbut you wanted them actually going from\n\n207\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.470\npage one and\nchapter one all the way through page 13.\n\n208\n00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd then start all over to chapter\ntwo with page one you could do that.\n\n209\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.650\nSo really this is very helpful\nwith things like that.\n\n210\n00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's funny you mentioned\nchapters because that is another thing\n\n211\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.030\nthat I'd like to demonstrate that\nWord is actually really good at.\n\n212\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:16.390\nAnd if you noticed, maybe some of you all\nhave seen, when I went into that format\n\n213\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.676\npage numbers dialog box, there was\nsomething about include chapter number.\n\n214\n00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:22.966\n&gt;&gt; Let's check that on.\n\n215\n00:12:22.966 --> 00:12:26.893\nAnd then this is change or\nchapter starts with style one,\n\n216\n00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:31.540\nconnecting to the styles cuz remember\nhow I told you how important styles are.\n\n217\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.680\nCome back and\nplay a lot here at this episode.\n\n218\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.480\nI have heading 1s in this document.\n\n219\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.706\nAnd I'd like it to change at every heading\n1, and of course I could make heading\n\n220\n00:12:41.706 --> 00:12:46.778\n1s look different than the default if I\nwanted that to be my chapter heading.\n\n221\n00:12:46.778 --> 00:12:51.673\nAnd I'll say yeah that's perfect, use the\nhyphen to separate and like you're saying\n\n222\n00:12:51.673 --> 00:12:56.196\nthat Chapter 1-1 and then it goes\nthrough all those pages then Chapter 2-1\n\n223\n00:12:56.196 --> 00:12:57.830\n&gt;&gt; Click OK and I'll get all excited and\n\n224\n00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.550\nthen I say wait, hold on, it says\n\n225\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:05.360\nthere are no chapter numbers to include\nto include in the caption or page number.\n\n226\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.650\nBut I had headings.\n\n227\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:12.208\nTo apply chapter numbers using multi\nlevel list button in the home tab and\n\n228\n00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:17.045\nselecting numbering scheme that's\nlinked to the headings styles.\n\n229\n00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:18.770\nOkay, I get it.\n\n230\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.320\nSo, there's a couple of\nextra steps in there and\n\n231\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.180\nI'm gonna show you those steps\nbecause I just think it's pretty cool.\n\n232\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.000\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n233\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.981\n&gt;&gt; And once you see,\nI just need to have these pieces in,\n\n234\n00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:32.917\nyou're saying that it is\nfairly simple tool for us.\n\n235\n00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:37.885\nNow, I do have an example over\nhere that already has it done and\n\n236\n00:13:37.885 --> 00:13:41.720\nthey're a little small so\nwhy don't I do this?\n\n237\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.980\nWhy don't I make this a little bigger so\nyou guys can see it and\n\n238\n00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.390\nwe'll make it red and bold.\n\n239\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.720\nSo hopefully you can see it a little bit\neasier when I'm through here because now,\n\n240\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.090\nthere's a heading one and\n\n241\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.250\nI made it red to just kind of make\nit stand out a little bit more.\n\n242\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:05.410\nSo there's a heading 1-1-2 and\nthen dash 3 and then right here starts\n\n243\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:10.920\nat 2-1 again because there's\nanother change in that heading.\n\n244\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.670\nBut it's also formatted as\na multilevel list as well.\n\n245\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.670\nSo let's start from the beginning of,\nthis is that fairly same document.\n\n246\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.182\nAnd I have some heading one's in here.\n\n247\n00:14:24.182 --> 00:14:25.925\nLike the down the rabbit hole.\n\n248\n00:14:25.925 --> 00:14:30.230\nAnd then if I zoom out a little bit,\nthat's a lot zoomed out [LAUGH].\n\n249\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.650\nYou'll be able to see once\nI start formating it,\n\n250\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.110\nthat there going to be three heading once.\n\n251\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.280\nSo using those styles efficiently and\ncorrectly, always a good thing.\n\n252\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.430\nLet's make this, let's make it green.\n\n253\n00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.480\nWe'll make it bold.\n\n254\n00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.009\nWe'll bump up the size a decent amount and\nwe'll make it centered.\n\n255\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.786\nWonderful, now I'm doing a local\nformatting here, and I'd like\n\n256\n00:14:52.786 --> 00:14:57.252\nto now say all of this formatting that\nI've done now needs to redefine the style.\n\n257\n00:14:57.252 --> 00:14:59.250\nWell, that's what they\ncall it in InDesign.\n\n258\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.125\nBut in Word,\n\n259\n00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:04.950\noops, let me come back over here, they\ncall it update style to match selection.\n\n260\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:05.900\nClick that.\n\n261\n00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.864\nLet's zoom out just a little bit so\n\n262\n00:15:07.864 --> 00:15:11.405\nnow you can see if I scroll down\nthere's one and there's one.\n\n263\n00:15:11.405 --> 00:15:17.250\nSo each of those headings,\nheading ones are now my chapters.\n\n264\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.870\nHow do I make that multilevel list?\n\n265\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.600\nThe cool thing is, since it is a heading,\nall you need to do is do one and\n\n266\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.518\nit does them all, I don't have to go and\nselect each individual heading and\n\n267\n00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:33.340\nmultilevel list, multilevel list,\nit's connected to the styles.\n\n268\n00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.560\nSo I'm in the very first one,\nmy cursor's in there,\n\n269\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.810\nI come to the multilevel list button\non the home tab and we choose this one.\n\n270\n00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:46.083\nSee this is the one where it has that\nchapter one connected to that heading one.\n\n271\n00:15:46.083 --> 00:15:48.172\nAnd you could also have it connected to,\n\n272\n00:15:48.172 --> 00:15:50.936\nwell it's not gonna put\nchapters on the heading two,\n\n273\n00:15:50.936 --> 00:15:55.113\nbut the heading two knows that it's under\nthis particular chapter and so on and so\n\n274\n00:15:55.113 --> 00:15:58.817\nforth, just like any type of structure\ntags we have with our headings.\n\n275\n00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:05.350\nClick that and List of the physical\nword Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3.\n\n276\n00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.430\nWow, that's pretty handy.\n\n277\n00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.530\nSo, now I've got those particular\nwords associated with that list level.\n\n278\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.610\nNow, I can go ahead and\nput in the page number.\n\n279\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:22.030\nSo let's scroll down and I'm just gonna\ndouble-click into the footer area because\n\n280\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.620\nI already have something that\nwas there from beginning.\n\n281\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.230\nI went to insert a photo but\nthen I deleted it all out for you.\n\n282\n00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.370\nI'm gonna tab, because tabbing gets me to\nthe middle because remember that we have\n\n283\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.840\nour tabs stops there.\n\n284\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.890\nI'm going to insert the page number in\nthe current position because my cursor\n\n285\n00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.600\nis flashing in the second tab stop.\n\n286\n00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.450\nOr I guess that would be first tab\nstop cuz it's the only one we have.\n\n287\n00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.170\n[LAUGH] It's the middle one,\nhow about that.\n\n288\n00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.030\nAnd we will choose the plain number.\n\n289\n00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.990\nI will select it.\n\n290\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.050\nEven though I'm really far away and\nit's hard to see on my screen.\n\n291\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.678\nYou will see in a little bit.\n\n292\n00:16:59.678 --> 00:17:04.760\nRed, make it a lot bigger and\nmake it bold so we can see.\n\n293\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.920\nSo right now, it's just formatted\nas our regular page numbers.\n\n294\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.020\nFine, but if I come into the design and\nI come into Page Number and\n\n295\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.750\nwe format those page numbers.\n\n296\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.880\nWe're gonna use the chapter numbers\nconnected to the heading one.\n\n297\n00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.530\nWe'll use that hyphen.\n\n298\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.069\nBut you can see there's either a colon or\n\n299\n00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:25.263\nan dash in there if you want what\ntype of delimiter or separator.\n\n300\n00:17:25.263 --> 00:17:30.757\nAnd I would like it to start at number\none for every change in section.\n\n301\n00:17:30.757 --> 00:17:32.024\nYou click OK.\n\n302\n00:17:32.024 --> 00:17:36.242\nYou're like, yay,\none dash one, dash three.\n\n303\n00:17:36.242 --> 00:17:37.380\nWhat's going on here?\n\n304\n00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.000\nDo you know what I missed there, Ronnie?\n\n305\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.520\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n306\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.000\n&gt;&gt; I did it on purpose.\n\n307\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.858\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n308\n00:17:43.858 --> 00:17:45.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n309\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.590\n&gt;&gt; I need the other piece of the puzzle,\nI need sections.\n\n310\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo I got the chapters and\n\n311\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.560\nthe multi-level list, but I need sections.\n\n312\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.310\nSo let's come into here in\nfront of the chapter 2, and\n\n313\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.910\nthis is where it,\nthat's that updating feel.\n\n314\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That gray thing that I was talking\n\n315\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.490\nabout, so.\n\n316\n00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.350\nI can't get my cursor in front of it.\n\n317\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.850\nAnd I'm sure it would do just fine.\n\n318\n00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.780\nBut to make my self feel a little bit\nbetter I'm putting the cursor at the end\n\n319\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.852\nof the paragraph above the place.\n\n320\n00:18:10.852 --> 00:18:12.880\nAs I scroll in right there,\n\n321\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.250\nthat's where I'm putting my cursor\nin to insert the section break.\n\n322\n00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.660\nIt'll do the same thing at regardless.\n\n323\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.160\nGosh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n324\n00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.640\n&gt;&gt; Getting a little out of control with\n\n325\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.700\nmy zooming.\n\n326\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.720\nWe go layout breaks.\n\n327\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.730\nWe'll do a next page break.\n\n328\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.250\nAnd now you, there we go.\n\n329\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:34.160\nYou've gotta have all the pieces\nto make sure it works properly.\n\n330\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.990\nNext section break.\n\n331\n00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:41.060\nThere we go, I got that one extra\nparagraph mark and there you go.\n\n332\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.030\nSo you can start being able to\n\n333\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.380\nreally format your page numbers\nto match exactly what you mean.\n\n334\n00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.870\nYou can format those page numbers,\ndo this cool little example\n\n335\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.680\nof the multilevel lists and\nthe sections to create your chapters.\n\n336\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.108\nAnd hopefully you will be able to number\nyour pages to your heart's content and\n\n337\n00:19:00.108 --> 00:19:01.732\nbe able to throw it in there.\n\n338\n00:19:01.732 --> 00:19:06.460\nI always throw page numbers in my document\nbecause that's the one thing I've noticed.\n\n339\n00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:11.030\nEspecially if you print it our or send\na scan, you scan in your documents, and\n\n340\n00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.800\nthen you go and you send it through fax.\n\n341\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or what have you,\n\n342\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.260\nand there's no page numbers at the bottom.\n\n343\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.470\nHow do I know that I got everything?\n\n344\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.380\nAnd especially page one of however.\n\n345\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:26.110\nThat's always a good format to have, to\nknow how many pages I've got all together.\n\n346\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.710\nSo it's important it's\na small little thing,\n\n347\n00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.225\npretty easy to insert in your document so\nI would highly suggest that you use them.\n\n348\n00:19:33.225 --> 00:19:39.272\n&gt;&gt; Vaughn, there's no doubt that when\nworking with large amount of text.\n\n349\n00:19:39.272 --> 00:19:42.820\nWhen you're working with many pages and\nbook forms or\n\n350\n00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.580\nwhatever it might be,\ndessertations, thesis.\n\n351\n00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.920\nThis is gonna be very helpful because it\nreally lets you be able to have the peace\n\n352\n00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.660\nof mind that this is gonna work regardless\nof how many chapters you have or\n\n353\n00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.140\nhow many sections you have.\n\n354\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.830\nIt does it for\nyou without you having to worry about it.\n\n355\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.040\nSo it is a tool that brings\nproductivity as well as efficiency.\n\n356\n00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.010\nIt adds a little bit of style and\n\n357\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.360\nof course professionalism to\nthe documents that we create.\n\n358\n00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.470\nWhen you just look at\nit on a single page or\n\n359\n00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.220\na couple of pages your like why\nwould I ever choose to do that?\n\n360\n00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.740\nIt really doesn't make sense but when\nyou start working with large documents.\n\n361\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.500\nI know that Vaughn has sort\nof created a book before.\n\n362\n00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.450\nAnd large documents really help, I've\nedited a couple of different books before\n\n363\n00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.798\nand just putting things in order in\nthe places that they need to be.\n\n364\n00:20:26.798 --> 00:20:31.490\nHaving these things work automatically and\nsimply, by just doing it one time.\n\n365\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.800\nInstead of 15 times,\nit really made it a lot easier.\n\n366\n00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\njust page structure alone.\n\n367\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.350\nLike the page layout portion of word.\n\n368\n00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.580\nLike your saying.\n\n369\n00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:47.030\nI feel it's kind of one of those things\nthat people don't fully grasp and\n\n370\n00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.160\nthey don't always get it.\n\n371\n00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.300\nAnd I didn't.\n\n372\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.540\nI know and it did take,\nlike you're saying, specific examples for\n\n373\n00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.220\nme to understand the importance of it.\n\n374\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.950\nIf you're working in single documents and\n\n375\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.540\nyou're just like doing a few things\nhere and there, that's fine.\n\n376\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.860\nThat's what Word is so cool about\nis that it has so many uses for so\n\n377\n00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:10.220\nmany different types of people, or\ntypes of jobs, or just reasons why at all.\n\n378\n00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.290\nSo, if you use it, that's great.\n\n379\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.580\nBut at least just giving\nthat understanding of\n\n380\n00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.380\nhow it can make your life a lot easier.\n\n381\n00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.340\nAnd then, being completely honest,\nit might make you pull your hair\n\n382\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.580\nout sometimes too if it's not\nworking the way it's supposed to be.\n\n383\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.530\nWe've all been there.\n\n384\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:26.640\nI get it.\n\n385\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.080\nJust keep trying.\n\n386\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.430\nTry to go to the steps again.\n\n387\n00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.870\nClose the document down.\n\n388\n00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:32.430\nStart it over.\n\n389\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.710\nStart like a sample document off\nto the side to make sure that you\n\n390\n00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.220\ngot it working in one place and\nnot the other.\n\n391\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.170\nWe're just troubleshooting\ncable yesterday.\n\n392\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.245\nWe had, which is it, this one, is that,\nis the spare, is it that thing?\n\n393\n00:21:44.245 --> 00:21:48.350\nAnd like we finally figure out\nafter doing it quite a few times.\n\n394\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:53.060\nThat was the problem and so I feel you\ncan correlate that into your documents.\n\n395\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.740\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And any thing computers really so.\n\n396\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.480\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt.\n\n397\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.290\nWell thank you again Vaughn for\n\n398\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.490\nhelping us to actually take\na look at this small element.\n\n399\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.260\nAs Vaughn said it doesn't seem that\nimportant until you start having to work\n\n400\n00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.270\nwith a lot of.\n\n401\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.450\nThe documents that you need, or\nif you're collating them all together.\n\n402\n00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.630\nBut it is going to be helpful,\n\n403\n00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.005\nit's going to make you much\nfaster as you continue to work.\n\n404\n00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:15.235\nWhether you're actually in an office, or\nwhether you're doing this on your own.\n\n405\n00:22:15.235 --> 00:22:18.508\nIt is something that is extremely\nhelpful and will, again,\n\n406\n00:22:18.508 --> 00:22:23.140\njust be one of the neat tools that you can\nadd in that distinguishes you as well.\n\n407\n00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.790\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode, then.\n\n408\n00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:31.700\nSigning off for OfficePro.TV, I'm your\nhost Ronnie Wong, and I'm Vaughn

00:00:14.340\nYou're watching the Microsoft Word\n2016 Essentials show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.080\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.030\nAnd today,\nwe're gonna actually will take and\n\n6\n00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.250\nlook at hat some fun things\nwe can actually do with Word.\n\n7\n00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.170\nSo we're gonna be talking\nabout declaration,\n\n8\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.250\nas well as orientation here And\nhere to help us, is of course going to be\n\n9\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.860\nour Microsoft Word Master Blaster herself,\nMiss Von Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.130\nVon, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.745\n&gt;&gt; Master Blaster, yeah!\n\n12\n00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:36.840\n[LAUGHS] I like that one.\n\n13\n00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.000\nSo yes, we're going to be\nturning our pages around and\n\n14\n00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.810\nwe're going to be making them pretty.\n\n15\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.990\nSo wanted to kinda leave our\npage layout on a fun note.\n\n16\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.890\nWe'll be putting our page background\ncolors, we'll also be adding some\n\n17\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.430\nwatermarks, you know things that we\nhave seen on documents in the past.\n\n18\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.810\nYou know confidential or\ntop secret, so how do you add that.\n\n19\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.390\nHow do you add a picture watermark,\nhow do you put some page borders on it.\n\n20\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.970\nSo I figured all of those\nthings are more decorations.\n\n21\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.512\nAnd then the orientation, well,\nWe kinda stumbled on it, by,\n\n22\n00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:12.120\nI wouldn't say mistake, but\nit's kinda just popped up.\n\n23\n00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.550\nWell it's changed, because when we\nwere talking about page orientation\n\n24\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.030\nthis would be portrait, this would be?\n\n25\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.120\n&gt;&gt; Landscape.\n&gt;&gt; Landscape.\n\n26\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.220\nYeah.\n\n27\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.290\nSo, some things might be in landscape,\nmaybe like a certificate.\n\n28\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.820\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n29\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.920\n&gt;&gt; Certificate of completion, or\nmaybe I have I have an award for you.\n\n30\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.630\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; Do you?\n\n31\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.581\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I'm afraid.\n\n32\n00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.321\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're going to format your\n\n33\n00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:38.190\ncertificate.\n\n34\n00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.131\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So why don't we jump down and\n\n35\n00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:40.868\nsee what it is?\n\n36\n00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:41.537\n&gt;&gt; I'm afraid.\n\n37\n00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:44.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We have-\n\n38\n00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.140\n&gt;&gt; Team spirit.\n\n39\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n40\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.892\n&gt;&gt; Yay, yeah, that's me I am Mr.\nTeam Spirit, I guarantee you.\n\n41\n00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:53.882\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're always our consummate\n\n42\n00:01:53.882 --> 00:01:54.782\ncheerleader.\n\n43\n00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:56.162\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] yes, I am.\n\n44\n00:01:56.162 --> 00:01:58.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Actually,\n\n45\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.740\nyou are, I mean you're always pumping me\nup, and like we're gonna do good shows.\n\n46\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.570\nWe're gonna do great stuff and\nI think you're a very positive person so\n\n47\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.700\nI wanna give you the most\nteam spirit award.\n\n48\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.990\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, I appreciate it.\n\n49\n00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.580\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\nSo now we'll print this out and\n\n50\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.680\nwe'll give it to you.\n\n51\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.280\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate it.\n\n52\n00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.140\nAnd I like how you set the Comic Sans\nthere, everybody loves Comic Sans.\n\n53\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly.\n\n54\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.150\nIt's fun it's spirited.\n\n55\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.270\nSo I almost did Curls MT for you.\n\n56\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.100\n&gt;&gt; That would have just hit the top.\n\n57\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.640\n&gt;&gt; Well you know what we can fix it.\n\n58\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.350\n&gt;&gt; We can can't we.\n\n59\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.110\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to change this because\nright now it doesn't look right.\n\n60\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.990\nIt doesn't look like a certificate.\n\n61\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.940\nSo we're gonna change\nthe page orientation.\n\n62\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.640\nOn the Layout tab, we're gonna\ncome over here to Orientation, and\n\n63\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.040\nwe're gonna just rotate it,\nand of course, look.\n\n64\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.050\n&gt;&gt; Look, that's better.\n\n65\n00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.980\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like I created in landscape\nand then turned it into portrait for\n\n66\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.690\nthis example.\n\n67\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.300\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\nSo imagine.\n\n68\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.965\n&gt;&gt; I mean you think about that,\nbut yes it does.\n\n69\n00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:54.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I went ahead and\ngave you this award and\n\n70\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.578\njust for fun, let's go ahead and\nget that into our Curls MT for you.\n\n71\n00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:02.210\n[LAUGH] Got it.\n\n72\n00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.150\nGotta find it.\n\n73\n00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.973\nThere it is.\n\n74\n00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:05.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is absolutely me.\n\n76\n00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.795\nIt's all me.\n\n77\n00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:11.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Perfect, so now it's got this.\n\n78\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.990\nAnd we can do a few more\nthings with this certificate.\n\n79\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.740\nWe can put a little page border around it.\n\n80\n00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.090\nWe may be able to put some stars and\nsome lines around it.\n\n81\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.750\nSo I have-\n&gt;&gt; Why do I have\n\n82\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.720\nthe feeling that it's gonna be stars or\nlines.\n\n83\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.790\nI don't know why.\n\n84\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.260\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna get fancy\non you there Ronnie.\n\n85\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.840\nSo we're gonna come over\nhere to our Design Tab and\n\n86\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.180\non this Design Tab,\nover here on the right hand corner,\n\n87\n00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.550\nwe have things like watermark,\npage color and page border.\n\n88\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.620\nWe're gonna come into our\npage border dialogue box.\n\n89\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.140\nAnd it's actually coming\ninto the borders and shading\n\n90\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.910\ndialogue box that we have maybe been here\nbefore in a couple different places, but\n\n91\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.600\nnow we're on the page borders section.\n\n92\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.310\nBecause we went in the borders and shading\nwhen we were doing paragraph formatting,\n\n93\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.700\nwhere we were doing the highlighting,\nnot highlights.\n\n94\n00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.480\nIt's shading.\n\n95\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.920\nIt is paragraph shading,\nbecause highlight is a character format.\n\n96\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.360\nYou all know that because you\nalready watched the other episodes.\n\n97\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.560\nSo I'm on the page border, and\nI have- what type of border do I want?\n\n98\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.920\nDo I want a box border,\none with a little drop shadow on it,\n\n99\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.320\none that looks a little\nbit more 3D with a bevel?\n\n100\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.650\nSo I have some different settings.\n\n101\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.700\nAnd then, the custom would be,\nit's just custom.\n\n102\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.246\nThey don't really get a preview on that.\n\n103\n00:04:21.246 --> 00:04:23.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then, the styles here.\n\n104\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.710\nDo I want dotted lines, double lines,\n\n105\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.630\ndifferent thickness of double lines,\ntriple lines, some squigglies?\n\n106\n00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.760\nAll these different types within here.\n\n107\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.780\nSo if I wanted it to do\nsomething fairly simple.\n\n108\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.050\nLet's just go with a straight, solid line.\n\n109\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.890\nAnd that makes it into,\ndo I want a box or do I want a shadow?\n\n110\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.380\nLet's go with shadow,\ngive it a little depth there.\n\n111\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.470\nWhat color do I want the page word to be-\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n112\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.048\n&gt;&gt; And [LAUGH] we could pick\nsome nice pretty colors in here.\n\n113\n00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:52.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n114\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.150\n&gt;&gt; You know, some pink and\nblue for you there,\n\n115\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.555\nlittle cotton candy [INAUDIBLE] And\nthen how thick do I want the border to be.\n\n116\n00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:02.660\n[LAUGH] I want to be about that,\nlet's see what's that looks like.\n\n117\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.584\nApplying to the whole document, nice.\n\n118\n00:05:04.584 --> 00:05:06.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n119\n00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.450\n&gt;&gt; But I want to go one step\nfurther there for you Ronnie.\n\n120\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.680\nBecause you're a star.\n\n121\n00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we need a star border.\n\n122\n00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.540\nSo come back over into this.\n\n123\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.440\nBecause you have a section down here for\nart.\n\n124\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.950\nAnd we have some apples, and these-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n125\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.592\nYou shouldn't choose that one.\n\n126\n00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:27.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] These still\nremind me of the old days.\n\n127\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.850\nI almost want to say like,\nwas it Windows 3.0 or\n\n128\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.700\nsome really old versions where it looks\nlike, and you had the printers with the,\n\n129\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.170\nwhere it moved across, and the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the dot matrix printer.\n\n130\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI was gonna say dot matrix, but I'm like,\n\n131\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.830\nis that what they're named?\n\n132\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.230\nBut remember old Apple printers and\neverything, so.\n\n133\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.350\nThey look very, they look dated,\nbut they're kind of fun.\n\n134\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.063\nMaybe if we put some balloons around here\nand let's bump up the width a little bit.\n\n135\n00:05:53.063 --> 00:05:53.849\nSo there we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n136\n00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:54.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There we go.\n\n137\n00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.990\nIt almost looks like ice cream cones,\nbut those are balloons.\n\n138\n00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.720\n&gt;&gt; They are balloons.\n\n139\n00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you have some fun,\ncute stuff with your art borders.\n\n140\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.420\nAnd if you get down into-\nhere are some stars.\n\n141\n00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.430\nRight?\nThere are some pretty stars.\n\n142\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.320\nBut I really want to have\npink stars there, Ronnie.\n\n143\n00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.968\n&gt;&gt; Of course you do.\n\n144\n00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:12.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I used this one,\n\n145\n00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.600\nit would still stay yellow.\n\n146\n00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.050\nBut if you scroll down\na little bit further-\n\n147\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.787\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't have pink stars.\n\n148\n00:06:18.787 --> 00:06:21.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; into the ones that are solid black.\n\n149\n00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.620\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n150\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.890\nThose are the ones [LAUGH] that you can\nchange the color to them and I know.\n\n151\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:27.775\n&gt;&gt; I did not know that.\n\n152\n00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:29.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; These right here.\n\n153\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.135\n&gt;&gt; And there we go and then I could\nchange the width if I wanted to.\n\n154\n00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:39.465\nThere we go some pretty pink stars for\nyou, Ronnie.\n\n155\n00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I should be in\na cheerleading team apparently\n\n156\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You should so\n\n157\n00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:47.465\nI have a page border and it goes around\nthe page, if I scroll out just a little\n\n158\n00:06:47.465 --> 00:06:52.575\nbit more you could see that it's very\nmuch within the margin area of our page.\n\n159\n00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:54.915\nNow in a single page\nlike this certificate,\n\n160\n00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:57.750\nwe don't really do much more than that.\n\n161\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.760\nBut if I was coming here to\nour page layout document and\n\n162\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.650\njust for fun let's add a quick\nlittle footer, just to see that.\n\n163\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.480\nAnd if I go into the page\nborder from here, and\n\n164\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.490\nthen we choose,\nwe'll just stay kind of basic for\n\n165\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.256\nnow we'll choose a well we've got\nto have it pink okay [LAUGH].\n\n166\n00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:23.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And we'll make it like a double line\n\n167\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.040\nhere and we have the box.\n\n168\n00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.440\nIt is applying to the whole document but\n\n169\n00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.280\nthere is an options button down\nhere in the bottom right corner.\n\n170\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.610\nTo give you, well, more options.\n\n171\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n172\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.070\nwhere is it measuring from to the edge\nof the page or from the text.\n\n173\n00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.446\nSo, which side or which direction,\nI guess, do you want it to measure out and\n\n174\n00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:46.780\nfrom and\nhow far away from that area do you want.\n\n175\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.675\nYou can customize where specifically\nthe page border ends up.\n\n176\n00:07:51.675 --> 00:07:56.476\nNow, you'd mentioned something in another\nepisode about, well you can go ahead and\n\n177\n00:07:56.476 --> 00:08:01.079\nset your margins all around but when your\nprintable area, might your printer will\n\n178\n00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:04.364\nforce it to not may be put at\nexactly where you told it to be.\n\n179\n00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:10.857\nSo Be aware of that,\ncuz they can be kinda funny like that.\n\n180\n00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.540\nSo we'll just keep that.\n\n181\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.460\nAnd these ones right down in here,\nwhere it has always display in front,\n\n182\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.620\nsurround header, surround footer.\n\n183\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.930\nOkay, well notice how they\nare grayed out right now\n\n184\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.720\nbecause I'm measuring from\nthe edge of the page.\n\n185\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.230\nBut if I chose to measure from the text,\n\n186\n00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.760\nnow you can see that I could\ngive different options.\n\n187\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.380\nMaybe I don't want it to surround\nthe header and footer for whatever reason.\n\n188\n00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.210\nSo I could take that off and\nthen click OK.\n\n189\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.422\nClick OK again.\n\n190\n00:08:40.422 --> 00:08:45.810\nAnd so you can see that the footer is\nnot accompanied in that page border.\n\n191\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:52.860\nAnd the border is much, much closer to\nthe text than it is the page itself.\n\n192\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.230\nSo those are some of the options.\n\n193\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.890\nLet's go back into that options\nbutton that you could do and\n\n194\n00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.210\nit's always displaying in front.\n\n195\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.262\nThat might be something if you have it\ndisplayed in the back of the text, if you\n\n196\n00:09:05.262 --> 00:09:10.881\nstart moving your text around, then it's\nnot a watermark but it's behind the text.\n\n197\n00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:15.210\nIt's just like alignments\nof your graphical elements.\n\n198\n00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.590\nIt's behind, it's not in the front.\n\n199\n00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.910\nSo there are reasons\nwhy you'd wanna do it,\n\n200\n00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.580\nto give it more of\na background type of image.\n\n201\n00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.360\nAnd then if I wanted it,\nsurround the headings.\n\n202\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.810\nAnd then, let's go ahead and bump this up.\n\n203\n00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.270\nMaybe we'll do like ten all around.\n\n204\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:34.920\nAnd I'm just using the tab key on here and\nthen we click OK, click OK again.\n\n205\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.320\nSee how everything moves and and\n\n206\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.460\nnow I chose that option to accompany\nthe footer in the page border.\n\n207\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.200\nSo there are some more advanced settings\nof the page more than just like\n\n208\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.320\nput on our pink stars for our certificate.\n\n209\n00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.290\nSo wanted to show you\nsome of those options.\n\n210\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.560\nLet's go back over to your certificate,\nshall we?\n\n211\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.520\nNow, if I look at this, when I have\nmy page orientation, whether it\n\n212\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.760\nbe portrait or landscape, it doesn't\nmatter which one you're working with.\n\n213\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.380\nVertical alignment, that's a big thing for\n\n214\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:15.080\nme because right now all the content,\nit's more towards the top of the page.\n\n215\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.906\nThere's this extra space down here.\n\n216\n00:10:17.906 --> 00:10:21.202\nAnd I know that if I wanted\nto have something printed,\n\n217\n00:10:21.202 --> 00:10:25.377\ncuz maybe I just had one paragraph,\nsay, it was like a cover page and\n\n218\n00:10:25.377 --> 00:10:30.740\nI have Alice in Wonderland, and then I had\na manual page break and then the next one.\n\n219\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.920\nWell I don't want it to be\njust be up to the top, so\n\n220\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.670\nyou manually hit those enters on\nthe top to force it down into the page.\n\n221\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.780\nWell, you could apply\na section break on that.\n\n222\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.940\nChange the vertical justification or\nalignment.\n\n223\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.300\nJustification and\nalignment are very similar words.\n\n224\n00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.090\nTo say, center itself this way.\n\n225\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.070\nSo, not this way.\n\n226\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.060\nBut this way.\n\n227\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.560\nSo, vertical justification.\n\n228\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.220\nAnd that's something that I would\nlike to do for this document.\n\n229\n00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.684\nThat is in your page set up.\n\n230\n00:10:59.684 --> 00:11:01.042\nDialogue box.\n\n231\n00:11:01.042 --> 00:11:02.903\nThere's a couple different\nways to go to it.\n\n232\n00:11:02.903 --> 00:11:06.622\nI usually just go through the margins\ncuz that's just what I remembered it and\n\n233\n00:11:06.622 --> 00:11:07.603\nhow I associate it.\n\n234\n00:11:07.603 --> 00:11:11.669\nSo I'm coming over to layout,\ncoming over to margins,\n\n235\n00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:15.316\ncustom margins, and\nthen well it's not on here.\n\n236\n00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:19.431\nThere is the orientation, that's what\nwe stumbled upon it last episode, or\n\n237\n00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:21.140\na couple episodes ago.\n\n238\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.280\nIt's in the Layout Tab and\n\n239\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.390\nthe layout, there it is,\nvertical alignment is always to top.\n\n240\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.999\nBut, If you wanted it to be centered,\ncenter it in the middle of the page or\n\n241\n00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:34.494\nthe bottom of the page, that's\nanother option, you could go ahead and\n\n242\n00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:35.207\nchange that.\n\n243\n00:11:35.207 --> 00:11:36.846\nAnd you click OK and watch the text.\n\n244\n00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:39.677\nSo we're just gonna give it\nwhat it looks like before.\n\n245\n00:11:39.677 --> 00:11:45.531\nClick OK and then everything just\nkinda moves down towards this area and\n\n246\n00:11:45.531 --> 00:11:48.468\nthis area match in the white space.\n\n247\n00:11:48.468 --> 00:11:53.570\nSo, it's not really margins,\nit's the vertical alignment on the page.\n\n248\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.500\nSo, that's a big one for\n\n249\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.160\nme that I like to always make\nsure people know where that is.\n\n250\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.680\nAnd if you have documents in sections,\nlike I said, you can have\n\n251\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.110\nvertical justifications in one section\ndifferent from the other sections.\n\n252\n00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.250\nIf you have default and\nthen like a cover page,\n\n253\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.540\nthat's the example that we were using.\n\n254\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.440\nThe insert date and time.\n\n255\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.660\nThis can be in any document.\n\n256\n00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.260\nThis could be in the footer or header.\n\n257\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.652\nIt's just a updatable\nfield that you can have.\n\n258\n00:12:20.652 --> 00:12:23.812\nNow, you don't have to have\nit update automatically.\n\n259\n00:12:23.812 --> 00:12:28.644\nBut if I wanted to, say, like right here,\non this day, and I wanted to put the day,\n\n260\n00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:31.544\nbecause this is maybe this\nis something that you,\n\n261\n00:12:31.544 --> 00:12:35.616\na certificate you give out every week,\nor every day, or every month,\n\n262\n00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:39.099\nemployer of the month,\nthen you wanna what date this is on.\n\n263\n00:12:39.099 --> 00:12:43.376\nAnd by the way,\nif I show my show in high characters,\n\n264\n00:12:43.376 --> 00:12:48.054\nI do have a tab there, and\nI do have a designated tab stop.\n\n265\n00:12:48.054 --> 00:12:50.250\nSo just throwing that in there.\n\n266\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.720\nI turn show high characters off cuz\nthey were a little distracting for\n\n267\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.150\nthis particular example.\n\n268\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.720\nSo I got my cursor where I want it to be,\nand I want to insert the date and time.\n\n269\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.067\nSo we go over to the good old insert tab,\nand we come over here to date and\n\n270\n00:13:03.067 --> 00:13:05.517\ntime, which I know it's one of these.\n\n271\n00:13:05.517 --> 00:13:07.712\nThere it is,\nthe one that looks like a calendar.\n\n272\n00:13:07.712 --> 00:13:08.878\nClick there.\n\n273\n00:13:08.878 --> 00:13:12.100\nAnd now there's a bunch of different\nways you can format dates.\n\n274\n00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.360\nSo you can see all the different examples.\n\n275\n00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.270\nDo you want the time associated with it?\n\n276\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.130\nHow do you want the time to be displayed?\n\n277\n00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.940\nDo you want the day of the week?\n\n278\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.300\nDo you want the month to be in the end and\nthe day first?\n\n279\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.690\nAll the different ways you can do it.\n\n280\n00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:31.710\nLet's just pick, we'll pick this one\ncuz it is Tuesday, June 20th 2017.\n\n281\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.918\nI click OK, or before I click OK,\nthere, update automatically.\n\n282\n00:13:36.918 --> 00:13:40.407\nIf this is a certificate that you\nare giving out every single day,\n\n283\n00:13:40.407 --> 00:13:44.594\nyou know without a shadow of a doubt you\nwill be printing out the certificates to\n\n284\n00:13:44.594 --> 00:13:45.927\ngive it to somebody, but\n\n285\n00:13:45.927 --> 00:13:50.384\nI mean I wouldn't give up the most team\nspirit to anyone there, Ronnie, just you.\n\n286\n00:13:50.384 --> 00:13:50.906\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n287\n00:13:50.906 --> 00:13:55.297\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, everybody in\nour team is fantastic, but you know.\n\n288\n00:13:55.297 --> 00:13:57.634\nYou would appreciate the pink stars and\neverything.\n\n289\n00:13:57.634 --> 00:13:59.473\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n290\n00:13:59.473 --> 00:14:03.260\n&gt;&gt; So\n[LAUGH] we have the update automatically.\n\n291\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.600\nAnd you could see like set this as the\ndefault of any time you insert a date and\n\n292\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.670\ntime, if you wanted to, because maybe\nyou had to do it multiple times.\n\n293\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.210\nWe click OK.\n\n294\n00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.485\nAnd of course I picked one\nthat [LAUGH] goes ahead and\n\n295\n00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:17.295\nmakes it a little bit different.\n\n296\n00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:21.547\nSo and now you can see that this\nis a field that if you needed to\n\n297\n00:14:21.547 --> 00:14:25.974\nupdate cuz maybe it wasn't\nupdating itself automatically,\n\n298\n00:14:25.974 --> 00:14:28.890\nyou can force it to update right there.\n\n299\n00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.190\nAnd then I could go ahead and,\nlet's just backspace off that tab.\n\n300\n00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.463\nAnd really we should just go ahead and\nmake this tab stop.\n\n301\n00:14:36.463 --> 00:14:39.505\nI've turned off the tab, there we go.\n\n302\n00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:41.008\nOkay, don't get obsessed\nwith the alignment.\n\n303\n00:14:41.008 --> 00:14:44.079\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's close enough.\n\n304\n00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:48.979\n[LAUGH] And so that's how you can\ninsert your date and time and\n\n305\n00:14:48.979 --> 00:14:53.280\nhave updates automatically if you want to\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne,\n\n306\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.299\neven with this right here, the lower\nleft-hand corner we have that white space.\n\n307\n00:14:58.299 --> 00:15:02.196\nThis also gives us the opportunity to even\ninsert a basic graphic in there when you\n\n308\n00:15:02.196 --> 00:15:03.181\nwanted to, right?\n\n309\n00:15:03.181 --> 00:15:04.013\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n310\n00:15:04.013 --> 00:15:08.639\n&gt;&gt; And I left that space there because\nI figured since we hadn't really gotten\n\n311\n00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:12.987\ninto pictures just yet, but\nI really wanted to put a picture in there.\n\n312\n00:15:12.987 --> 00:15:17.390\nBut I thought adding an element\nthat we hadn't covered.\n\n313\n00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.430\nI'm always one of those,\nwait, how did you do that?\n\n314\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.392\nWhy is that over there?\n\n315\n00:15:21.392 --> 00:15:25.792\nSo but I would I would definitely put\na nice big fluffy bunny rabbit there\n\n316\n00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:26.388\nfor you.\n\n317\n00:15:26.388 --> 00:15:30.430\n&gt;&gt; Of course, but\nyeah it's good to point out, right.\n\n318\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.581\nThat when you start taking\na look at stuff like that.\n\n319\n00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:35.390\n&gt;&gt; The very fact is,\nthere is a lot more that we can do.\n\n320\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.001\nAnd that's what the whole\ngoal is to understand, and\n\n321\n00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:40.910\nwe're gonna see that of\ncourse in the advance shows.\n\n322\n00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.870\nBut overall though, I just remembered that\nas you start looking at this, adding in\n\n323\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.900\nGraphic elements that really emphasize\nwhat we want it to, that's the whole goal.\n\n324\n00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.900\nYou may think that the whole\ngoal is to make fun of Ronnie.\n\n325\n00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not true,\n\n326\n00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:54.252\neven though that's a part of it.\n\n327\n00:15:54.252 --> 00:15:56.276\nBut the whole goal is to\nemphasize what we want to and\n\n328\n00:15:56.276 --> 00:15:58.550\nwe wanna make sure of course\nas you add these elements in.\n\n329\n00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.493\nTo do that, right?\n\n330\n00:15:59.493 --> 00:16:03.970\nIt's to make sure that everything points\nto what you really want it to show.\n\n331\n00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.979\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and everything that I did in this\ncertificate is everything we've done in\n\n332\n00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:07.518\nthis series.\n\n333\n00:16:07.518 --> 00:16:13.564\nRight here, I created, just to kinda give\nyou a little explanation on some of this,\n\n334\n00:16:13.564 --> 00:16:16.725\nI made a border underneath this paragraph.\n\n335\n00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:19.649\nBut why didn't the lines\ngo all the way to the edge?\n\n336\n00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:23.400\nNotice up here on the ruler,\nI put in indents.\n\n337\n00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.950\nSo I wanted to make it\na little bit smaller.\n\n338\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.200\nSo I pulled in the left and the right\nindent on each one of those sides.\n\n339\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.489\nThis is just center aligned\ntext with Curls MT.\n\n340\n00:16:33.489 --> 00:16:36.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this is Comic Sans.\n\n341\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.050\nThis is just centered text.\n\n342\n00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:43.650\nI controlled some of the spacing,\nyeah, I had some enter marks.\n\n343\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.240\nI didn't do the whole like all of\nthis is space after paragraph.\n\n344\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.040\nThere's nothing wrong with hitting\nEnter multiple times when it's needed.\n\n345\n00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.357\nBut just knowing there's other\nways to probably do the things\n\n346\n00:16:53.357 --> 00:16:56.415\nthat you are meaning to do by the Enter,\nEnter, Enters,\n\n347\n00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:59.047\nwe can go ahead and\nmake that a little bit easier.\n\n348\n00:16:59.047 --> 00:17:02.162\nBut everything else, I mean,\nthis right over here,\n\n349\n00:17:02.162 --> 00:17:05.450\nthese are moved over because\nthere is the left indent.\n\n350\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.420\nI just indented that over.\n\n351\n00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.911\nI didn't hit the Tab key, or I didn't\nhit the space bar a bunch of times,\n\n352\n00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:14.649\nI just moved the whole indent for\nthat paragraph, the same on this one, too.\n\n353\n00:17:14.649 --> 00:17:20.644\nAnd so that's everything that we've\nlearned in this Word Essentials series,\n\n354\n00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:21.990\nor shows, here.\n\n355\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.180\nThen to finish it off with\na few other elements for\n\n356\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.440\npage layout, we have watermarks.\n\n357\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.782\nLet's move over, we're gonna move\noff your certificate there, Ronnie.\n\n358\n00:17:32.782 --> 00:17:34.016\n&gt;&gt; I'm so saddened.\n\n359\n00:17:34.016 --> 00:17:36.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we're gonna, you know what?\n\n360\n00:17:36.142 --> 00:17:39.230\nWe're gonna go into a file\nthat I didn't open beforehand.\n\n361\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.834\nIt is called Page Layout- Water and\nLine, so yeah,\n\n362\n00:17:43.834 --> 00:17:49.110\n[LAUGH] cuz I wanted to\nchange our watermarks here.\n\n363\n00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:54.322\nWatermarks are the things, like I said,\nthey're usually kinda see through.\n\n364\n00:17:54.322 --> 00:17:56.180\nThey have some transparency.\n\n365\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.980\nAnd so it's like a stamp that\ngoes across the top, or really,\n\n366\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.860\nunder the bottom, whichever way.\n\n367\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.070\nYou can put it on the top or the bottom.\n\n368\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:10.560\nBut really, it's a visual element that\nsays top secret, or draft, or do not copy.\n\n369\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.010\nThose are a lot of things you see for\nmaking sure that people, well,\n\n370\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.330\ndon't do that.\n\n371\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.310\nWhere do we go to insert a watermark?\n\n372\n00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.530\nIt's not in the Insert tab.\n\n373\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.190\nIt's over on the Design tab,\ncuz this is a design element.\n\n374\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.340\nWe come over to Watermark.\n\n375\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.150\nAnd you can see they have some\nones that are already built in,\n\n376\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.680\nlike the confidential and the do not copy,\n\n377\n00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.760\nwhether you want it to orientate\ndiagonally or horizontally.\n\n378\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.577\nAnd then it's a little bit behind my head,\nbut there's a couple other options.\n\n379\n00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:39.826\nI mean, you can see most of them, but\n\n380\n00:18:39.826 --> 00:18:43.210\nyou can see that we have\na custom watermark over here.\n\n381\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.570\nAnd then you have some more watermarks on\noffice.com, but there's nothing available,\n\n382\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.090\nwhich is, that's fine.\n\n383\n00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.963\nWe're gonna go to the custom watermark.\n\n384\n00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:55.030\nAnd then we get into the printed\nwatermark dialogue box.\n\n385\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.830\nBecause you can have either a picture or\na text.\n\n386\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.280\nAnd which one do you want?\n\n387\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.140\nWell, it's up to you, but\nI will show you both of them.\n\n388\n00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.989\nLet's just go with the picture one for\nnow.\n\n389\n00:19:06.989 --> 00:19:11.447\nAnd you do have to select your\nimage to put in the background.\n\n390\n00:19:11.447 --> 00:19:14.973\nAnd this is where maybe you\nhave your company logo or\n\n391\n00:19:14.973 --> 00:19:17.928\nmaybe a picture of your company building.\n\n392\n00:19:17.928 --> 00:19:21.279\nAnd you want that in\nthe background of your page,\n\n393\n00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:24.651\nwhich is a little bit\ndifferent than page color.\n\n394\n00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:27.060\nWhich I realize that we didn't\ndo on your certificate.\n\n395\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.711\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n396\n00:19:27.711 --> 00:19:28.909\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll come back to it.\n\n397\n00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:30.036\nWe'll circle back around.\n\n398\n00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:33.253\nSo, we'll come over here\nto Select Picture, and\n\n399\n00:19:33.253 --> 00:19:36.546\nyou can either have it from file,\nor if you wanted,\n\n400\n00:19:36.546 --> 00:19:40.860\nyou could go ahead and\ndo an image search for a picture online.\n\n401\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.886\nLet's go ahead and see, look at there,\nyes, we definitely need to put Mr.\n\n402\n00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:47.568\nFuego pants there in\nthe background of our document.\n\n403\n00:19:47.568 --> 00:19:48.771\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n404\n00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:53.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And notice,\nit does have that washed out checked on.\n\n405\n00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.920\nLet's apply, so you can see,\nand it's kinda transparent,\n\n406\n00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.330\nyou can kinda see it in the background.\n\n407\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.640\nBut that's the whole idea of a watermark.\n\n408\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:07.480\nIt's not supposed to be super in front and\nkinda distracting from your text.\n\n409\n00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.268\nBut if I uncheck wash out and apply,\nyou can see there's where it's gonna be\n\n410\n00:20:12.268 --> 00:20:17.250\na little bit easier to see, but\nthen it starts distracting from your text.\n\n411\n00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:23.080\nAnd watermarks do show up on every printed\npage, just like a header and footer.\n\n412\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.890\nSo this is a page layout or a page element\nthat will repeat across all of them.\n\n413\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.170\nSo that's one we could\ndo with our picture.\n\n414\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.985\nIf you wanted to do a text watermark,\nmaybe I want it to say do not copy or\n\n415\n00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.693\nOfficeProTV, anything to that sort.\n\n416\n00:20:38.693 --> 00:20:40.667\nYou have the text that is built in, and\n\n417\n00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:44.580\nyou can see some of the drafts and\nthe personal, the ones like that.\n\n418\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.640\nBut if I do want it to say OfficeProTV,\n\n419\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.110\nas long as your cursor's in here and the\ntext is selected, you just start typing.\n\n420\n00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:59.180\nAnd I'm using my Shift key,\nOfficeProTV, you can pick your font.\n\n421\n00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.350\nI'll just go with Calibri for now.\n\n422\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.260\nThe size, we'll choose Auto.\n\n423\n00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.030\nWe'll see what it does.\n\n424\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.897\nIt's diagonal, it's gray.\n\n425\n00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:08.810\nLet's see what it looks like,\nthere you go.\n\n426\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.790\nMight be a little harder to see on the\nscreen, but we have that watermarked text.\n\n427\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.774\nAnd you could go through, and\nyou can make it pink if you wanted to,\n\n428\n00:21:18.774 --> 00:21:22.070\nyou could make it CurlsMT, for your fonts.\n\n429\n00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n430\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.880\nyou can pick the different ones\nthat you would want it to be, and\n\n431\n00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.350\nyou can pick a specific size that\nyou would want it to be as well.\n\n432\n00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.229\nSo there we go.\n\n433\n00:21:31.229 --> 00:21:32.429\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n434\n00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:33.503\n&gt;&gt; That's beautiful.\n\n435\n00:21:33.503 --> 00:21:34.493\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n436\n00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:38.970\n&gt;&gt; So that's how you can\nadd a printed watermark.\n\n437\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.360\nI'll close this, and I was using\nthat apply, so I can have it seen.\n\n438\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.710\nBut if you get a document that\ndoes have a watermark and\n\n439\n00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:50.625\nyou don't want it there anymore, you could\ncome into here and tell it to remove\n\n440\n00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:54.818\nthe watermark that is right there\ntowards the bottom of that menu.\n\n441\n00:21:54.818 --> 00:21:58.580\nAnd then it removes the watermark.\n\n442\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.410\nSo those are some different things.\n\n443\n00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.085\nI did wanna come circle back\naround to the page color,\n\n444\n00:22:03.085 --> 00:22:06.550\ncuz that actually trigger in my brain,\nlike we didn't do that.\n\n445\n00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.570\nSo let's move over back over\nto your beautiful certificate.\n\n446\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.016\nI'm glad I didn't close it.\n\n447\n00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:11.934\n&gt;&gt; Rats.\n\n448\n00:22:11.934 --> 00:22:16.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We need to make the whole\nbackground of the page a different color.\n\n449\n00:22:16.082 --> 00:22:20.504\nAnd well, guess what, I guess\n[LAUGH] I needed to install updates.\n\n450\n00:22:20.504 --> 00:22:21.287\nYou know what?\n\n451\n00:22:21.287 --> 00:22:22.660\nWe will tell it to remind me later.\n\n452\n00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.060\nI'm in the middle of a show.\n\n453\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.345\n[LAUGH] Go back over to Design.\n\n454\n00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:31.880\nWe'll come over to our page color, and\nsome of these are, how about some yellow?\n\n455\n00:22:32.897 --> 00:22:33.930\n&gt;&gt; That's a little scary.\n\n456\n00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.960\n[LAUGH] So\nI have some different solid colors.\n\n457\n00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.040\nMaybe like a nice,\nsofter yellow could be a little prettier.\n\n458\n00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.000\nBut you do some other options,\nyou have more colors, of course,\n\n459\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.570\nby picking any other color if\nyou were even just doing text.\n\n460\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.100\nBut I got the fill effects, I've always\nloved good fill effects there, Ronnie.\n\n461\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.841\nSo you can come into filling it with\na gradient, you could fill it with some\n\n462\n00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:59.888\ndead fish textures,\nbecause that would look beautiful.\n\n463\n00:22:59.888 --> 00:23:02.323\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Come back over to page color,\n\n464\n00:23:02.323 --> 00:23:04.130\ncome back over to fill effects.\n\n465\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:08.519\nSome of these textures are little,\nwe have some patterns, again,\n\n466\n00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:13.139\nanother thing to really jar your brain\na little bit with different color\n\n467\n00:23:13.139 --> 00:23:17.080\nforegrounds and\ndifferent color backgrounds in here.\n\n468\n00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.276\nAnd we can have something like that.\n\n469\n00:23:19.276 --> 00:23:20.397\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n470\n00:23:20.397 --> 00:23:21.560\n&gt;&gt; Hard to read.\n\n471\n00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:26.691\n&gt;&gt; And talking about my cat, Fuego,\nwell, if I'd put it as a picture,\n\n472\n00:23:26.691 --> 00:23:32.175\nI did wanna show you a little bit of\nthe differences between a watermark and\n\n473\n00:23:32.175 --> 00:23:33.790\na background image.\n\n474\n00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:38.811\nAnd I click OK,\nyou see how Fuego's pretty big back there?\n\n475\n00:23:38.811 --> 00:23:43.270\nAnd there's no options for\nme to wash it out or make it different.\n\n476\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.855\nAnd the picture, let me go back over to\nthis fill effects and select the picture.\n\n477\n00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:54.180\nIt does matter what the size of\nthe image is when you put this in.\n\n478\n00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.710\nBecause if you have a really,\nreally big picture, and\n\n479\n00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.639\nI'm not sure how How big is this picture.\n\n480\n00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:02.760\nWhat I'm look at\nare the dimensions of the file.\n\n481\n00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.592\nAnd if they're not, if they're too big or\nthey're not big enough,\n\n482\n00:24:06.592 --> 00:24:09.286\nyou might get some\nstretching of the picture.\n\n483\n00:24:09.286 --> 00:24:10.060\nHere's one.\n\n484\n00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:10.761\nThat's a really big one.\n\n485\n00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:12.490\nLet's click that one.\n\n486\n00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.399\nClick okay.\n\n487\n00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:16.175\nYou see, all you see is the graph.\n\n488\n00:24:16.175 --> 00:24:18.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because that's, but\n\n489\n00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.530\nthe picture of the cat is not in there\nbecause it's such a large image that it's\n\n490\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:27.840\njust, there's no scaling of it when\nyou put it as a page color and\n\n491\n00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.290\nyou're using that as your fill effects.\n\n492\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.450\nJust a few other options here.\n\n493\n00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:38.280\nSo patterns, textures, we've got that,\nand then the gradients.\n\n494\n00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.820\nGradients are just colors that\nblend together or gradiate.\n\n495\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.450\nI don't know if that's a real word.\n\n496\n00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.299\n&gt;&gt; Gradiate.\n&gt;&gt; But I've always used it in all of\n\n497\n00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:46.460\nmy teachings.\n\n498\n00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.421\nYou could have it transition.\n\n499\n00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:51.680\nWe'll go with that, with one color.\n\n500\n00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.280\nMaybe if I choose an orange you'd have\neither light to dark or dark to light, so\n\n501\n00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.570\nyou see it's like either\norange to white or\n\n502\n00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.350\norange to black with any\nvariations in between.\n\n503\n00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.490\nYou could have it blend two colors.\n\n504\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.706\nTwo colors that never blend really\nwell together, in my opinion,\n\n505\n00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:10.221\nis the orange and blue.\n\n506\n00:25:10.221 --> 00:25:14.400\nHowever our good old University\nof Florida, they do this a lot.\n\n507\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they do.\n&gt;&gt; Yes they want to blend it.\n\n508\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.457\nI actually have seen it done okay, but\nthere's always that purple in between.\n\n509\n00:25:19.457 --> 00:25:23.808\nYou put white in between that\nmakes it a little bit better And\n\n510\n00:25:23.808 --> 00:25:26.030\nthen your lovely presets.\n\n511\n00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.090\nI love the presets.\n\n512\n00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.229\nThis has been around for a long time.\n\n513\n00:25:28.229 --> 00:25:29.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes they have.\n&gt;&gt; You know this Ronnie.\n\n514\n00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes I do.\n\n515\n00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.131\n&gt;&gt; So we have the different\nones of like the horizon,\n\n516\n00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.998\nyou can see the colors down here.\n\n517\n00:25:34.998 --> 00:25:39.844\nWe have my good old favorite,\nthe rainbows, right.\n\n518\n00:25:39.844 --> 00:25:45.273\nYes here we go and now we have our\nrainbow gradients of our presets.\n\n519\n00:25:45.273 --> 00:25:49.165\nHow do I want the gradient\nto angle itself?\n\n520\n00:25:49.165 --> 00:25:52.672\nHorizontal, vertical, diagonally, up or\n\n521\n00:25:52.672 --> 00:25:56.749\ndown or mirrored so\nthe different variants on here.\n\n522\n00:25:56.749 --> 00:26:02.310\nMaybe from the center and\nwe can go something like that.\n\n523\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.520\nI think that looks perfect for\nyour certificate there Ronnie.\n\n524\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.205\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We'll click OK and whoo.\n\n525\n00:26:07.205 --> 00:26:08.019\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wow.\n\n526\n00:26:08.019 --> 00:26:11.130\n&gt;&gt; That's not really the center but\nyou know what?\n\n527\n00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.190\nWe'll roll with it because I\nthink it looks pretty fantastic.\n\n528\n00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.040\nActually it's moving around when I zoom.\n\n529\n00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.684\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Interesting\n\n530\n00:26:19.684 --> 00:26:20.184\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n531\n00:26:20.184 --> 00:26:20.752\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n532\n00:26:20.752 --> 00:26:21.252\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n533\n00:26:21.252 --> 00:26:22.908\n&gt;&gt; I think now that might, maybe that's\n\n534\n00:26:22.908 --> 00:26:26.171\nsomething with the virtual machine\nthat I'm using in here because I don't\n\n535\n00:26:26.171 --> 00:26:30.384\nthink I've ever seen it do that, have you?\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember seeing that happen,\n\n536\n00:26:30.384 --> 00:26:33.338\nbut who knows.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna chalk that up to\n\n537\n00:26:33.338 --> 00:26:37.211\nrunning Windows on a virtual\nmachine on a Macintosh computer.\n\n538\n00:26:37.211 --> 00:26:39.301\nThere's always those weird little glitches\n\n539\n00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:42.049\nthat happen from time to time, so.\nI'm gonna roll with\n\n540\n00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.608\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n541\n00:26:42.608 --> 00:26:44.025\n&gt;&gt; But I think this is pretty nice\n\n542\n00:26:44.025 --> 00:26:45.319\nlooking.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n543\n00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:46.317\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n544\n00:26:46.317 --> 00:26:48.477\nWell let's go to the last little\n\n545\n00:26:48.477 --> 00:26:50.980\ndecoration that you can have.\n\n546\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.910\nAnd those would be the line\nnumbers on your documents.\n\n547\n00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.150\nAnd yeah, we'll come over here.\n\n548\n00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.450\nLine numbers, where do you\nthink the numbers are gonna go?\n\n549\n00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.460\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna assume at\nthe beginning of a line.\n\n550\n00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah.\n\n551\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.143\nNow, why would you want to do this?\n\n552\n00:27:05.143 --> 00:27:07.380\nI was like I don't know.\n\n553\n00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.335\nI was reading some things,\nlike legal documents.\n\n554\n00:27:09.335 --> 00:27:10.905\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you're doing depositions or\n\n555\n00:27:10.905 --> 00:27:12.995\nwhatever, you need to have those numbers.\n\n556\n00:27:12.995 --> 00:27:15.420\nMaybe a script or a play.\n\n557\n00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; You need to go ahead.\n\n558\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.880\nSo there are specific reasons\nas to why you would want to add\n\n559\n00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.510\nline numbers in here.\n\n560\n00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.700\nAnd that would be on our layout tab.\n\n561\n00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.330\nAnd we come into line numbers.\n\n562\n00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.370\nAnd notice right now there are none.\n\n563\n00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.810\nIf I chose continuous.\n\n564\n00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.810\nLet me scroll in so\nyou can see that a little bit better.\n\n565\n00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.610\nIt is putting a number at\nthe beginning of every line.\n\n566\n00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.199\nEasy peasy.\n\n567\n00:27:37.199 --> 00:27:40.430\nYou could also have it\nre-started every page.\n\n568\n00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.631\nSo that's an option.\n\n569\n00:27:41.631 --> 00:27:43.180\nRe-start every section.\n\n570\n00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.018\nWe know how to put in sections.\n\n571\n00:27:45.018 --> 00:27:47.570\nSuppress current paragraph.\n\n572\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:53.070\nThat would be one where say, here this\nis just our title and our subtitle.\n\n573\n00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:59.050\nThat's not really part of the deposition\nor the script that I want to be included.\n\n574\n00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.840\nSo if I took the ones that I didn't\nwant and said suppress, you can see that\n\n575\n00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.910\nnow it starts right here at the first\nheading as that's the first line.\n\n576\n00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:10.337\nSo that's what the suppress\ncurrent paragraph.\n\n577\n00:28:10.337 --> 00:28:13.783\nAnd then if you wanted to\nhave different options for\n\n578\n00:28:13.783 --> 00:28:17.000\nyour line numberings,\nyou can come into here.\n\n579\n00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.676\nAnd you're like well where is it?\n\n580\n00:28:18.676 --> 00:28:23.280\nIt's that little button right there at\nthe bottom where we have line numbers.\n\n581\n00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.000\nAnd you could see, I could have it\nstart at whatever number I want to.\n\n582\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.760\nThen count by, maybe you only line numbers\nat every fifth line or every tenth line.\n\n583\n00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.899\nSo I could say count by 1, and these are\nthe options that we have that were in that\n\n584\n00:28:37.899 --> 00:28:42.656\ndrop down of whether you wanna restart\non page or a section, you click OK,\n\n585\n00:28:42.656 --> 00:28:47.770\nclick OK again and now there is that 10,\n20, 30, and so on and so forth.\n\n586\n00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:52.380\nSo some different things that\nyou can put as decoration.\n\n587\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.930\nIt is towards a page layout in general but\n\n588\n00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:01.220\nthe line numbers are really just\nthere to help you number your lines.\n\n589\n00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.631\nWow that was a good serve there.\n\n590\n00:29:02.631 --> 00:29:07.147\nThe one thing I did, I do have in my show\nnotes as a couple of little notes from\n\n591\n00:29:07.147 --> 00:29:12.099\nthe Microsoft Office help files that just\npointing out that if you do have tables or\n\n592\n00:29:12.099 --> 00:29:16.660\nfigures or text box, each one of those\nthings are counted as a single line.\n\n593\n00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.570\nSo if you have a multiple\nlines in a table or\n\n594\n00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.880\nmultiple rows in a table\nit doesn't count the rows.\n\n595\n00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.100\nThe table is considered one line.\n\n596\n00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.390\nSo just making a little note on that.\n\n597\n00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.350\nAnd so with that,\n\n598\n00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:35.390\nI believe that is everything I wanted\nto cover in this particular episode.\n\n599\n00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:39.893\nAnd really, the page layout session\nof our Word Essential show.\n\n600\n00:29:39.893 --> 00:29:42.120\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\nwell thank you again for\n\n601\n00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.740\nhelping us out here by showing us some\nof the different things that we can\n\n602\n00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.270\nalso add in for\ngraphical elements into our documents.\n\n603\n00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.950\nSo using that certificate as well as\nbeing able to add line numbers and\n\n604\n00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.590\nsome of the background elements in.\n\n605\n00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.460\nIt really can
