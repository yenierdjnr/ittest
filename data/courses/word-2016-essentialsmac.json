00:00:13.545\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.217\nwe're going to be reviewing\nwhat exactly is in this series.\n\n5\n00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:21.347\nWho is our target audience and who should\nbe watching this, any prerequisites that\n\n6\n00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:25.800\nwe need to know before we get started,\nand a little extra tidbits along the way.\n\n7\n00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.718\nSo what are we covering in this series?\n\n8\n00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:31.186\nThis is broken up into three main topics.\n\n9\n00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:34.800\nWe have Introduction,\nText Formatting and Page Layout.\n\n10\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.369\nIn the introduction, well,\nit's an introduction to Word.\n\n11\n00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.240\nWe get started with what is Word?\n\n12\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.350\nWhat about the interface of Word?\n\n13\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.560\nWe know where we're going so\nit's always important to understand.\n\n14\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.904\nWhen I say go to the ribbon,\nyou know where the ribbon is.\n\n15\n00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:52.270\nOr look at the status bar,\nthe status bar is down at the bottom.\n\n16\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.909\nWe talk about the interface\nof the Word environment.\n\n17\n00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.070\nThen we also get into\nnavigating a Word document.\n\n18\n00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.398\nDo you know that Ctrl-Home will always\ntake you to the very beginning of your\n\n19\n00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:03.923\ndocument?\n\n20\n00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:06.883\nWe go over that and\na lot of other cool tips and\n\n21\n00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:10.563\ntricks of getting around\na document to make it easier,\n\n22\n00:01:10.563 --> 00:01:15.299\nto be a little bit more efficient and\nfaster with typing up a document.\n\n23\n00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.794\nWe're gonna be selecting text.\n\n24\n00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:19.580\nYou think, that's just click,\nhold and drag, right?\n\n25\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.475\nThere's a lot of cool shortcuts that we\ncan do to make you more efficient there\n\n26\n00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:25.994\nwhen selecting a text.\n\n27\n00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:30.010\nWe go over the different auto-correct and\nthe proofing.\n\n28\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.636\nWe also talk about the all important cut,\ncopy and paste, and\n\n29\n00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.671\nknowing about our paste options.\n\n30\n00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.867\nAnd then Find and replace and some\ndifferent things within Find and replace\n\n31\n00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:44.680\nwith the finding special characters and\nhow that can really benefit you.\n\n32\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.848\nThen we move into formatting your text.\n\n33\n00:01:46.848 --> 00:01:51.280\nHow do you make things look bigger,\nbolder, different colors, different fonts?\n\n34\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.886\nSo we go into the world of character\nformatting and paragraph formatting.\n\n35\n00:01:55.886 --> 00:02:00.168\nWe also talk about formatting text\nin lists, either a bulleted list or\n\n36\n00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:01.901\na numbered list.\n\n37\n00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.908\nTabs, I love some tabs.\n\n38\n00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:07.287\nIn tab stops,\nwe learned about left inline tab stops,\n\n39\n00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:11.660\ncenter inline tab stops, what is a leader,\nall of those fun things.\n\n40\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.419\nAnd then my all-time favorite\nwhich would be styles.\n\n41\n00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:20.568\nWe introduced what is a style, why you\nwant to use them, how important they are,\n\n42\n00:02:20.568 --> 00:02:26.110\nand actually really how easy they\nare to implement into your document.\n\n43\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.454\nThen we end with our topic of page layout.\n\n44\n00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:32.050\nThis would be how the text\nflows within your document.\n\n45\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.755\nHow do you do the different pagination,\nand\n\n46\n00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:37.911\nreally what they normally\nwould say is page setup.\n\n47\n00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:42.560\nThings like margins,\nour breaks, our keep options.\n\n48\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.496\nWhat is a widow and orphan control?\n\n49\n00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.750\nWe have section breaks.\n\n50\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.378\nSections are so important in a document,\n\n51\n00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:54.197\nunderstanding them can just open up\na whole new world of how you can use Word.\n\n52\n00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:55.857\nWe talk about columns,\n\n53\n00:02:55.857 --> 00:03:00.910\nwe insert some blank cover pages\nwhich are really easy to do.\n\n54\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.951\nAnd then we talk about our headers and\nfooters within our margins, and\n\n55\n00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.606\nhow we can add page numbers.\n\n56\n00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:09.169\nThat can always be a little tricky,\nso we go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.310\ndedicated an entire episode to that.\n\n58\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.835\nAnd then we end on some decoration.\n\n59\n00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:17.996\nAdding some borders and some shading,\nand some different watermarks and\n\n60\n00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:19.130\nthings like that.\n\n61\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.615\nSo that would be the end\nof that particular topic.\n\n62\n00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:26.526\nNow, that's the wrong way,\nhow about we go this way?\n\n63\n00:03:26.526 --> 00:03:31.390\n[LAUGH] Our target audience, man,\nI'm getting all tripped up here.\n\n64\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.262\nAll Office users, now that means Office\nwith a capital O, as in the Office Suite.\n\n65\n00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:41.980\nNot necessarily that you\nwork in a physical office.\n\n66\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.484\nWhich maybe a lot of you do, but\nthis could be your small business,\n\n67\n00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:48.128\nhome business, school,\nwork, whichever way.\n\n68\n00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:49.734\nBut Microsoft Office and\n\n69\n00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:54.290\nWord is one of the main programs\nwithin that particular suite.\n\n70\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.741\nThis is an Essentials course, which\nmeans it starts from the very beginning,\n\n71\n00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.125\nso this would be anybody\nthat is a basic user, and\n\n72\n00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:08.178\nthen may try to get up into an\nintermediate level of understanding Word.\n\n73\n00:04:08.178 --> 00:04:12.844\nThat being said, you do not have\nto have any prior knowledge of\n\n74\n00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:15.553\nWord before starting this course.\n\n75\n00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:18.140\nYou maybe not even know what it does.\n\n76\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.599\nWell, we start from there.\n\n77\n00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.415\nWe talked about, what is the Enter key?\n\n78\n00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:23.020\nLike, really we're gonna\ntalk about the Enter key?\n\n79\n00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.339\nYou'll be surprised.\n\n80\n00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:29.645\nAnd really some other tricks, like if you\nhold Command and Enter what does that do?\n\n81\n00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:34.165\nAnd just I mean some basic understanding\nof your MAC operating systems is going\n\n82\n00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:35.337\nto be very helpful.\n\n83\n00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:40.947\nUnderstand that we find, we do cover some\nof those basics within the introduction\n\n84\n00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:45.848\nof just understanding, how to do\na File New, how to close the program.\n\n85\n00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:50.039\nAnd if you have any familiarity\nwith other Office products,\n\n86\n00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.420\nthat would be helpful for\nyou getting into Word.\n\n87\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.011\nIn these series, or\nin these episodes, we have files and\n\n88\n00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:01.493\nnotes that are for each episode.\n\n89\n00:05:01.493 --> 00:05:05.368\nThose are my notes that I use to help\nguide us along within the episode, and\n\n90\n00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:07.350\nthose are available to you.\n\n91\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.017\nAnd more often than not, there is a file,\na Word file that we're using for\n\n92\n00:05:12.017 --> 00:05:15.646\ndemonstration purposes, and\nthat is available to you.\n\n93\n00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:19.000\nNow you can download all of them for\nthe entire series right\n\n94\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.770\nhere in this course overview or\nthey are available on individual episodes.\n\n95\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.811\nAnd if for any reason we miss something,\nmaybe it's the wrong file,\n\n96\n00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:29.074\nit's attached to the wrong episode,\nlet us know.\n\n97\n00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:31.579\nContact us and we'll go ahead and\nget that fixed.\n\n98\n00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.570\nHere's some extra tidbits to end this\noverview is that there are always\n\n99\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.115\nmultiple options to do things in Word.\n\n100\n00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:43.611\nAnd I might cover three of them,\nand not cover the other two.\n\n101\n00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:45.970\nAnd you're like,\nwell I know you could do it this way.\n\n102\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.540\nTotally fine.\n\n103\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.332\nThere's many,\nmany options of how to use Word and\n\n104\n00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:51.869\nthe different commands that are available.\n\n105\n00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:53.701\nAnd really in any Office product.\n\n106\n00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:54.981\nUpdates.\n\n107\n00:05:54.981 --> 00:05:57.198\nUpdates do happen.\n\n108\n00:05:57.198 --> 00:06:01.929\nAnd that's where you might have,\nthere might be a major update that\n\n109\n00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:05.415\nhas happened with\nthe Office Suite that makes my,\n\n110\n00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:09.540\nat this time of recording,\nWord different than yours.\n\n111\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.523\nSo just be aware of that, and it will\nchange things in there from time to time.\n\n112\n00:06:14.523 --> 00:06:17.961\nAnd in any of your Office products,\nif you go to the Help menu,\n\n113\n00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.120\nthere is an option for check for updates.\n\n114\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.286\nAnd it will run to see if you need\nupdates and then go ahead and install.\n\n115\n00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:29.295\nA lot of times, if you have your\npreferences in the auto-update to\n\n116\n00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:32.374\ndo automatically,\nit will a lot of times prompt you\n\n117\n00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:37.450\nmaybe when you open one of your Office\nproducts to say Hey, there's an update.\n\n118\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.587\nAnd you can go ahead and run that.\n\n119\n00:06:39.587 --> 00:06:45.647\nAnd that's also where you can check your\ndifferent versions in your Word menu.\n\n120\n00:06:45.647 --> 00:06:47.754\nAnd I cover that in\nthe introduction to Word and\n\n121\n00:06:47.754 --> 00:06:49.980\nshowing you where you can go ahead and\nfind that.\n\n122\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.815\nThere's always lots of answers online,\nsearching for\n\n123\n00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:59.990\nanswers either in the Microsoft Help\nfiles or just in what we call the Oracle.\n\n124\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.241\nJust go to any of your\nfavorite search engines and\n\n125\n00:07:03.241 --> 00:07:05.780\njust type in what you want to find.\n\n126\n00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.633\nAnd there's the world of the Internet\nto help find the answers for\n\n127\n00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:11.044\nany of your questions.\n\n128\n00:07:11.044 --> 00:07:15.160\nAnd everybody uses these products for\ndifferent reasons.\n\n129\n00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.794\nThe way I use Word may not be\nthe same as the way you use Word, or\n\n130\n00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:20.521\nthe person down the street.\n\n131\n00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:25.580\nSo everybody has a different way that\nthey function within the product.\n\n132\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.617\nSo just be aware of that, and\neverybody has different reasons for it.\n\n133\n00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.180\nAnd most of all have fun with this.\n\n134\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.803\nI know that it can be really frustrating\nsometimes when you're trying to make Word\n\n135\n00:07:36.803 --> 00:07:37.494\ndo something.\n\n136\n00:07:37.494 --> 00:07:40.990\nIt's just not doing it,\nI've been there, I totally understand.\n\n137\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.531\nIn these episodes we like to keep it\nlight, we like to keep it fun, and\n\n138\n00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:45.214\nmake jokes.\n\n139\n00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:49.222\nAnd try to keep that when\nyou're off on your own and\n\n140\n00:07:49.222 --> 00:07:52.570\nusing Word is just try\nto have fun with it.\n\n141\n00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.038\nAnd so\nI hope to see you in some future episodes,\n\n142\n00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.003\nand let's go

the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n4\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.480\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nWord 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.540\nThis is introduction to Word and\n\n6\n00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.680\nwho's bringing us the information\nwe need this day?\n\n7\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.160\nWell I can't think of no one else but\nVonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.264\nVon, thank you for having us.\n\n9\n00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:30.926\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me.\n\n10\n00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:34.561\nI love to talk about Word and\nI love Word for Mac and so\n\n11\n00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:38.213\nthat's why we're having\nour very first episode.\n\n12\n00:00:38.213 --> 00:00:39.680\nWell, I guess this is the overview.\n\n13\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.157\nSo I mean-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n14\n00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:43.608\n&gt;&gt; But then, the overview more's\nlike introducing the whole show-\n\n15\n00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:44.553\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n16\n00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:46.642\n&gt;&gt; Altogether this is introducing Word,\n\n17\n00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:50.577\nthe actual product that we're going\nto be learning about in this series.\n\n18\n00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:53.975\nSo I like to always start\nfrom the very beginning and\n\n19\n00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.828\nget you familiar with like, what is Word?\n\n20\n00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:59.066\nSo guess what,\nI have a PowerPoint presentation for that.\n\n21\n00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.658\n&gt;&gt; So I do have a question for\nyou, what is Word?\n\n22\n00:01:01.658 --> 00:01:04.047\n&gt;&gt; Well, why don't I show you?\n\n23\n00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:07.273\nHow about we go ahead and\njump down into my Powerpoint presentation?\n\n24\n00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:13.149\nI just kept it in PowerPoint the program,\nnot going into presentation mode.\n\n25\n00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.936\nJust because, you know what?\n\n26\n00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:15.711\nJust because.\n\n27\n00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:16.305\n&gt;&gt; Just because.\n\n28\n00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:16.990\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n29\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.568\nCuz it's really just kinda helping us\nguide me through introducing it to you.\n\n30\n00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:28.296\nSo Word is a Word processing [LAUGH],\none of those use the same\n\n31\n00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:33.922\nWord in the definition as the term so\nit's a little weird.\n\n32\n00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:38.005\nBut what that means is you're\ngoing to type things in there.\n\n33\n00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.664\nYou're going to be creating documents.\n\n34\n00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:44.351\nYou could be writing a letter,\nyou could be writing notes.\n\n35\n00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:46.745\nYou could be writing a script,\nyou could be writing a book.\n\n36\n00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:48.670\nYou could be creating a manual,\n\n37\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.532\nall sorts of different things\nare why you would want to use Word.\n\n38\n00:01:52.532 --> 00:01:59.322\nAnd it is the, I'll call it maybe\nthe main product in the Office Suite.\n\n39\n00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:02.520\nSome people might say,\nI think Outlook is the main product.\n\n40\n00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219\nOr Excel, they're all there.\n\n41\n00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.416\nI would say the big three would be Word,\nExcel, and Outlook,\n\n42\n00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:13.607\nyou know what we'll throw PowerPoint\nin there, all of them are cool [LAUGH].\n\n43\n00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:18.224\nBut you can see you could be doing\nshort or long document processing and\n\n44\n00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:20.032\ndoing different layouts.\n\n45\n00:02:20.032 --> 00:02:24.997\nI will say that sometimes\npeople want to use Word for\n\n46\n00:02:24.997 --> 00:02:31.130\nmore of a page layout program\nsuch as InDesign or Illustrator.\n\n47\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.495\nI've seen people make Word do things\nwhere I'm like, wow that's impressive.\n\n48\n00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:42.412\n[LAUGH] Cuz that's pretty hard\nto make it do it but it can.\n\n49\n00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.457\nThere is another product called Publisher.\n\n50\n00:02:44.457 --> 00:02:47.104\nPublisher's a pretty cool Office product.\n\n51\n00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:48.495\nIs not available for Mac, though.\n\n52\n00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:50.163\nIt is a PC-only type thing.\n\n53\n00:02:50.163 --> 00:02:55.106\nSo just in case, I just realized\nthat we're in our Word for Mac show,\n\n54\n00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:58.782\nand I'm talking about\na PC-only type of product.\n\n55\n00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:01.333\nBut anyways, I digress.\n\n56\n00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:05.271\nWe'll let's just go ahead and\nkeep on Word as Word, great product.\n\n57\n00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:12.480\nSo as I just mentioned, it is part of\nthe Office 365 suite of applications and\n\n58\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.192\nyou can purchase different\nproduct plans with Office 365.\n\n59\n00:03:18.192 --> 00:03:20.418\nAnd that, there are a bunch of them, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:20.418 --> 00:03:23.738\nNow there is enterprise licenses.\n\n61\n00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:28.587\nThere's small business licenses\nthere's just a Home Office.\n\n62\n00:03:28.587 --> 00:03:32.186\nAnd I have a link on this particular\nslide that you guys have access to it,\n\n63\n00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:34.890\nin a PDF format,\nthat you can go ahead and grab.\n\n64\n00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.510\nAnd so if you're interested in\nlooking into other product plans,\n\n65\n00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.610\nthen you should definitely\nconsult the website.\n\n66\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.475\nAnd what you buy within that particular\nplan of how many of the products,\n\n67\n00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:51.603\nthat determines what level of subscription\nthat you're going to be using.\n\n68\n00:03:51.603 --> 00:03:55.028\nAnd notice on this particular slide,\nI do have that Access,\n\n69\n00:03:55.028 --> 00:03:58.867\nwhile it is part of the Office Suite,\nit is a PC only type of product.\n\n70\n00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:04.141\nAnd so is Publisher, but the rest of them,\nthey should have Mac versions of it,\n\n71\n00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:07.074\nbut we're gonna be concentrating on Word.\n\n72\n00:04:07.074 --> 00:04:13.074\nAnd then how you purchase your product\nbecause the way that you purchase\n\n73\n00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:18.081\nsoftware, at least in the past,\nyou could get it on a disk.\n\n74\n00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:19.114\nDid you ever get one of those?\n\n75\n00:04:19.114 --> 00:04:21.200\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, all the time.\n\n76\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah get on a CD Rom or a DVD and\nyou'd have to put it into your computer.\n\n77\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.390\nIt's funny, in the office I have\nan older MAC that it has a DVD,\n\n78\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.370\nCD drive, and everybody's like,\nmy God, it's like some ancient relic,\n\n79\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.070\nthat it actually has a drive\nattached to the laptop.\n\n80\n00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.320\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n81\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.706\nThat guy is still trucking,\nlove that little old Mac.\n\n82\n00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:47.174\nSo we're going to go ahead and get it, but\nyou can buy it as a stand alone product,\n\n83\n00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:51.849\nto where you don't have an actual\nlike Office 365 subscription.\n\n84\n00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:59.150\nYou have a stand alone version of that\nproduct that you can buy and install.\n\n85\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.170\nAnd that kinda throws us back into here,\nto where how you purchase it and\n\n86\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.510\nhow you use Word is going to be important\nfor this particular series because\n\n87\n00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.060\nwe are doing a local\ninstallation of Word 2016.\n\n88\n00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.530\nBut back into the,\nyou can buy an Office 365 subscription.\n\n89\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.590\nWhen you have a subscription,\nthat means that you can go ahead and\n\n90\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.780\ndownload the software from\nyour online account and\n\n91\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.750\nthen locally install\nWord onto your computer.\n\n92\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.132\nBut you get also use Word\nonline in the the Cloud,\n\n93\n00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:40.940\nwe all call it, and so\nwhere you use it to the browser and\n\n94\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.510\nyou are using the application\nwithin that particular modality.\n\n95\n00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.150\nThis is not going to cover that particular\nversion if you wanna say of using Word, we\n\n96\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.370\nare going to be doing a local installation\nof Word 2016 for this particular show.\n\n97\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.800\nIf you're using the online\nversion of Word,\n\n98\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.890\nsome of this stuff is not gonna translate.\n\n99\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.470\nIt's great because it is one, it's free so\n\n100\n00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.300\nyou don't even have to have purchased\na 365 account to still use Word.\n\n101\n00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.100\nIt does have a lot of the capabilities,\nbut not all of them.\n\n102\n00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.935\nSo just wanted to clarify that here.\n\n103\n00:06:16.935 --> 00:06:18.301\nI mean what is the scope,\n\n104\n00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:22.154\nwhat is the target audience of people\nusing this particular product.\n\n105\n00:06:22.154 --> 00:06:26.978\nAnd really explaining how Word\ncan be delivered to you, and\n\n106\n00:06:26.978 --> 00:06:29.303\nhow you can actually use it.\n\n107\n00:06:29.303 --> 00:06:31.946\nA bunch of different ways in there.\n\n108\n00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:36.379\nNow this is one of my favorite slides,\ntalking about versions and file types.\n\n109\n00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:41.180\nBecause I do like the history\nof where things come from,\n\n110\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.640\nespecially in technology.\n\n111\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.440\nBecause it's so fascinating to me, where\nit all kinda comes and how it dips and\n\n112\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.080\ndives and diverts and what have you.\n\n113\n00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:57.395\nSo Word and the Microsoft Office Suite\nis Microsoft [LAUGH].\n\n114\n00:06:57.395 --> 00:07:04.060\nAnd it is really made for\nthe Windows Operate System but of course,\n\n115\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.710\nthey have Mac versions of,\nOffice products, such as Word.\n\n116\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.360\nAnd that's where, sometimes there's\na little bit of translational say.\n\n117\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.600\nIn this particular series,\nI will be comparing Word PC and\n\n118\n00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.220\nWord Mac quite frequently.\n\n119\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.970\nBecause I'm one that uses\nit in both platforms.\n\n120\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.230\nAnd so there's certain things\nthat can be done in Word for\n\n121\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.590\nPC can't be done in Word for Mac.\n\n122\n00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.710\nIt's just the nature of\nthe operating systems and\n\n123\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.250\nhow it all works so just be aware of that.\n\n124\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.113\nAnd then talking about these versions and\nfile types,\n\n125\n00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:45.611\nyou can see I have this line with\nthe PC versions you know what?\n\n126\n00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:48.543\nI just realized that is a typo.\n\n127\n00:07:48.543 --> 00:07:50.287\nLet me go ahead and\ntype it right there, MAC.\n\n128\n00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:54.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; These are the Mac versions and\n\n129\n00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:57.043\nthe PC versions, and the numbers and\n\n130\n00:07:57.043 --> 00:08:01.710\nthe years are different up\nuntil we've got Mac 2016.\n\n131\n00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.000\nSo, back in the day,\nyou had like Word 2010 for\n\n132\n00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.918\nWindows, but\nit was Mac Office 2011, or 2008.\n\n133\n00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:15.347\nSo they were always a little\noff on their years,\n\n134\n00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:18.954\nwhen we're talking about the different\nversions of these products.\n\n135\n00:08:18.954 --> 00:08:24.570\nLike 2003 PC,\nit was really 2004 for a Mac.\n\n136\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.750\nSo and the filed versions right\nhere the doc versus the docx and\n\n137\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.600\nthat's where we have this kind\nof big divide right here.\n\n138\n00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.520\nWhen Word or\nMicrosoft really the Office Products,\n\n139\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:47.240\nwent went to what's known\nas an XML framework.\n\n140\n00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.724\nWay more tangled than you need to know,\nbut\n\n141\n00:08:49.724 --> 00:08:53.046\nit did expand the capabilities\nof all of their products.\n\n142\n00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:59.505\nAnd that's why you see doc,\nwhich was like the old version,\n\n143\n00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:04.314\nand docx, like with Excel it's xls, xlsx,\n\n144\n00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:08.127\nppt, pptx, that x is for that XML.\n\n145\n00:09:08.127 --> 00:09:12.617\nYou could almost think of x as extended,\nit extended the file format to allow\n\n146\n00:09:12.617 --> 00:09:16.720\na lot more cool things that we\ncan now do on all these products.\n\n147\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.496\nNow you can see you have to go way\nback [LAUGH] to get to where you have\n\n148\n00:09:21.496 --> 00:09:23.620\n.doc as the version.\n\n149\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.639\nBack in 2004 for Mac 2003 for PC.\n\n150\n00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:33.820\nWell it's 2017, so\n[LAUGH] it's been some time.\n\n151\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.868\nBut you might encounter opening up or\nseeing .doc files,\n\n152\n00:09:39.868 --> 00:09:45.053\nand then opening up into\nwhat is now Mac 2016 or\n\n153\n00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:50.745\nWord 2016 and\nthere might be some when you save it.\n\n154\n00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:54.888\nHey you're trying to save it in this old\nversion you really need to save it into\n\n155\n00:09:54.888 --> 00:09:56.685\nthis newer version of file type.\n\n156\n00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:57.551\nYou've seen these warnings right?\n\n157\n00:09:57.551 --> 00:10:00.901\n&gt;&gt; All the time, especially with\nmy PC at home, which is ancient.\n\n158\n00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.393\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, yeah, all the time.\n\n159\n00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:07.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just that basic understanding\nof there are different file types\n\n160\n00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:11.680\nwithin Word,\neven though they're both Word documents.\n\n161\n00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.850\nOld versions and new versions.\n\n162\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.630\nAnd getting those warnings of hey,\n\n163\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.920\nyou need to really save\nthis into the newest .docx.\n\n164\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:26.240\nFile type or version, that you might\nencounter especially if you are using\n\n165\n00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.040\ndocuments that were created back in the\nday and are still using the doc file type.\n\n166\n00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.670\nThe other thing I wanted to throw in\nhere and you actually see down here,\n\n167\n00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.720\nI have some notes in for\nme in the show notes.\n\n168\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.385\nI also have them in, well here in the show\nnotes so you guys can go ahead and\n\n169\n00:10:44.385 --> 00:10:49.147\nsee the exact same version if you're\nopening up a PDF, I don't see that.\n\n170\n00:10:49.147 --> 00:10:52.490\nThese are speaker notes\nby the way in PowerPoint,\n\n171\n00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.965\nso you do have this available to you.\n\n172\n00:10:54.965 --> 00:10:58.003\nI just wanna throw a few\nthings out there and\n\n173\n00:10:58.003 --> 00:11:03.331\nlet's just kinda pull this up is that\nWord was first released in 1983.\n\n174\n00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:06.626\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think is kind of interesting.\n\n175\n00:11:06.626 --> 00:11:11.344\nBut the other cool thing is that\nin 1997 Microsoft went ahead and\n\n176\n00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:17.057\nmade an independent group in Microsoft to\nfocus on writing their Office Suites for\n\n177\n00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:19.040\nthe Mac platform.\n\n178\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.010\nBecause some of these\nversions I'll say like\n\n179\n00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:28.070\nthe Office 2004 and 2008, for Mac,\nthey were a little weird, okay?\n\n180\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.470\nAnd they were significantly different\nin just the interface alone\n\n181\n00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.430\nwith the two different platforms and\nit was confusing.\n\n182\n00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.366\nNow, if you use Mac Word and PC Word,\n\n183\n00:11:41.366 --> 00:11:46.800\nthe interface,\nit actually looks very similar.\n\n184\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.040\nI mean they adopted the ribbons,\nthey went ahead got the status bar.\n\n185\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.350\nIt doesn't look so, so much of a contrast.\n\n186\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.680\nWe're like well, okay I need to really\nrecenter myself and know where I'm at.\n\n187\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.714\nThey really kind of concentrated\non trying to make it.\n\n188\n00:12:00.714 --> 00:12:03.395\nLook a little bit more uniform\nacross both platforms and\n\n189\n00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:05.458\njust the functionality of it altogether.\n\n190\n00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:09.834\nSo I thought that was an interesting\nlittle fact that they did that back in\n\n191\n00:12:09.834 --> 00:12:11.138\nthe day in 1997.\n\n192\n00:12:11.138 --> 00:12:16.500\nAnd then it also talks about\nsome of these other versions.\n\n193\n00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.140\nI'm not sure if you ever\nencountered this but there is\n\n194\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.230\nin the history of Macs basically they\nwent from different types of processors.\n\n195\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:31.200\nAnd in that kind of in between stage,\nthere was some programs that if you were\n\n196\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.860\non a Power PC, and\nthat means that if you're running\n\n197\n00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:42.100\na power PC with an old Chipset\nversus your Intel-based Macs.\n\n198\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.793\nYou had to run it through this whole\nemulator for certain products because\n\n199\n00:12:46.793 --> 00:12:51.877\nyou're using new actual hardware but\nthe program is run to run on old hardware.\n\n200\n00:12:51.877 --> 00:12:55.879\nIt was a real big fun time there\nin Mac history, I will say,\n\n201\n00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:59.912\nespecially with your Adobe products,\nwhew, it was fun.\n\n202\n00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:04.570\nBut that's where I was\ntalking about the 2004.\n\n203\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.548\nIt was written for Power PC, but\nthen the 2008 version, it was written for\n\n204\n00:13:09.548 --> 00:13:13.484\nnative Intel-based Macs, so\nyou didn't need an emulator.\n\n205\n00:13:13.484 --> 00:13:18.065\nSo the 2004 to 2008 did\na whole big change with how\n\n206\n00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:22.946\nthe hardware change within your Macs,\nand it was a big deal.\n\n207\n00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:26.947\n&gt;&gt; Well in these days,\ndo we even use emulators anymore really?\n\n208\n00:13:26.947 --> 00:13:28.555\n&gt;&gt; You'd have to go back\non a really old machine.\n\n209\n00:13:28.555 --> 00:13:29.167\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n210\n00:13:29.167 --> 00:13:32.488\n&gt;&gt; So it's one of those like,\nwe're so far past it,\n\n211\n00:13:32.488 --> 00:13:35.504\nit doesn't really apply to certain people.\n\n212\n00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:40.158\nBut well I guess if you have\na computer back from the early 2000s,\n\n213\n00:13:40.158 --> 00:13:42.254\nyou might still be doing that.\n\n214\n00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:43.114\n&gt;&gt; It could be me.\n\n215\n00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but Mac is also very, I mean\nit's almost like with your plugs for\n\n216\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.590\nyour phones and everything.\n\n217\n00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.980\nWe're not doing this anymore,\nyou have to adopt to this one.\n\n218\n00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.282\nMac is very much about like,\nthis is where we're going.\n\n219\n00:13:55.282 --> 00:13:59.852\nYou've gotta either get on the bus,\nor don't be on the bus.\n\n220\n00:13:59.852 --> 00:14:02.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; Or just be on the corner away.\n\n221\n00:14:02.492 --> 00:14:04.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, I'll just go use a PC.\n\n222\n00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.393\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n223\n00:14:06.393 --> 00:14:09.222\nlet's keep on going down\nin my presentation.\n\n224\n00:14:09.222 --> 00:14:13.322\nSo I got off the bus\na little bit on the sideway.\n\n225\n00:14:13.322 --> 00:14:14.589\n&gt;&gt; But the entry was great.\n\n226\n00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:15.414\nThanks very much, I love it.\n\n227\n00:14:15.414 --> 00:14:16.881\nThank you.\n\n228\n00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:18.079\n&gt;&gt; Those things that I like.\n\n229\n00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:20.236\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So let's come over here to file\n\n230\n00:14:20.236 --> 00:14:25.370\nextensions just kind of going along with\nthe same idea of like the doc vs .docx.\n\n231\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.960\nIt is something that you can turn on to\nsee within your map operating system,\n\n232\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.890\nit's in your finder preferences.\n\n233\n00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.378\nSo you could go into finder,\ngo to preferences, and\n\n234\n00:14:35.378 --> 00:14:38.168\nturn on that you want to show extensions.\n\n235\n00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:42.070\nSometimes having the extensions\non we can get a little weird for\n\n236\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.980\npeople because then you could\nactually change the extension.\n\n237\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.879\nAnd once you change the extension,\n\n238\n00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:51.780\nyou're changing like what program\nit associates itself with.\n\n239\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.940\nAnd if you change that, you could kind\nof mess up the file a little bit and\n\n240\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.930\nsometimes even possibly corrupt it.\n\n241\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.680\nI mean if you went a little far, but\nIt's really more of a preference.\n\n242\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:08.722\nI like file extensions, anytime you have\nthem, do not change anything past the dot.\n\n243\n00:15:08.722 --> 00:15:13.356\nSo if it's learnpowerpoint.ppt\ndon't change past the dot.\n\n244\n00:15:13.356 --> 00:15:17.009\nAnd I know this is Word and\nI'm using a graph that showing PowerPoint\n\n245\n00:15:17.009 --> 00:15:20.099\npresentations or PowerPoint files but\nyou get the idea.\n\n246\n00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.230\nOur setup that we're gonna be using for\n\n247\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:29.150\nthis particular show is I do have\nan Office 365 ProPlus account.\n\n248\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.970\nThese are on enterprise licenses.\n\n249\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.240\nIt is possible that my version\nof an Office products might look\n\n250\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.790\nslightly different from yours because I do\nhave a different level of subscription.\n\n251\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.643\nIt is possible, not always, but\njust know like, I don't have that button,\n\n252\n00:15:48.643 --> 00:15:50.073\nor I don't have that.\n\n253\n00:15:50.073 --> 00:15:53.690\nIt could be the type of subscription,\n\n254\n00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:59.352\nit also could be the version\nof the product that you're on.\n\n255\n00:15:59.352 --> 00:16:01.467\nJust remember that in just a second.\n\n256\n00:16:01.467 --> 00:16:06.992\nIt is locally installed and\nmy operation system, I'm using Sierra and\n\n257\n00:16:06.992 --> 00:16:12.159\nat this current stage in the recording,\nI'm on 10.12.6.\n\n258\n00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:15.854\nAll of these can be a factor, and\nI'm just gonna show you about this Mac.\n\n259\n00:16:15.854 --> 00:16:20.932\nThis is where you can find out which\nversion of the operation system\n\n260\n00:16:20.932 --> 00:16:27.113\nthat you have and where you can find your\nsetup, like what version of Word am I on.\n\n261\n00:16:27.113 --> 00:16:29.474\nI'm just gonna pull Word up right here.\n\n262\n00:16:29.474 --> 00:16:32.618\nCome in to your Word menu and about Word,\n\n263\n00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:36.505\nthis is where you can see\nthis version right here.\n\n264\n00:16:36.505 --> 00:16:41.823\nThat's kind of important and I will\ntell you, it happens to me all the time.\n\n265\n00:16:41.823 --> 00:16:45.360\nI'll be in the middle of filming\na show and Office goes ahead and\n\n266\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.721\nupdates itself in the product updates,\nand I have a whole new set of buttons.\n\n267\n00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:51.851\nRight in the middle of\nfilming an entire series.\n\n268\n00:16:51.851 --> 00:16:53.405\nIt's like okay, thanks.\n\n269\n00:16:53.405 --> 00:16:58.127\n[LAUGH] So updates happen, and\nit does update the product and\n\n270\n00:16:58.127 --> 00:17:01.534\ncan make things a little bit differently.\n\n271\n00:17:01.534 --> 00:17:07.510\nSo when you see those inconsistency of\nwhat I'm showing versus what you see.\n\n272\n00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.371\nCheck all those things, your operating\nsystem, the version of Word, and\n\n273\n00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:17.637\nmaybe your subscription level that you\nhave and little tiny variances in there.\n\n274\n00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:22.000\nNow if you are in older version of Word,\n\n275\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.580\nit might be a little different.\n\n276\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.953\nWhere are we?\n\n277\n00:17:26.953 --> 00:17:30.492\nIf you're going back to 2011, 2008 it's\ngonna look significantly different.\n\n278\n00:17:30.492 --> 00:17:35.842\nSo I would probably just concentrate\non using Word 2016 for Mac.\n\n279\n00:17:35.842 --> 00:17:39.400\nAnd, again,\nthe enterprise asks your organization.\n\n280\n00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.047\nAgain there are certain things that\norganizations can lock down within\n\n281\n00:17:44.047 --> 00:17:48.730\nyour products and just your overall\noperating system in general.\n\n282\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.980\nThat might not be available\nthat I'm showing and\n\n283\n00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:56.030\nthat you just don't have access\nbecause they control your network.\n\n284\n00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.050\nAnd what you can cannot do,\nit's a very powerful thing.\n\n285\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.060\nSo that's what I wanted to go through\nwith my PowerPoint presentation,\n\n286\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.400\nkind of just get you familiar with Word.\n\n287\n00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.520\nA little bit of the whole series setup,\na little bit of a history lesson with Mac.\n\n288\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.678\nSo we are going to be processing\nWord documents all day long,\n\n289\n00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:18.811\nall night, afternoon.\n\n290\n00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:20.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whatever time it is for you.\n\n291\n00:18:20.216 --> 00:18:21.732\n&gt;&gt; We're not going home,\nwe're gonna just live here.\n\n292\n00:18:21.732 --> 00:18:23.328\nWe got a hammock in the back, it's great.\n\n293\n00:18:23.328 --> 00:18:24.603\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah so but you could tell we\ndo do a costume change from time to time.\n\n294\n00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:31.120\nSo [LAUGH] all right,\nI think that's our introduction.\n\n295\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.930\nAnd I look forward to seeing you guys\nin some more episodes very soon.\n\n296\n00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.260\n&gt;&gt; And I look to forward it too, Vonne.\n\n297\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.700\nYou did such a wonderful job.\n\n298\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.950\nThe Word 2016 Essentials for Mac,\nwatch every single video in this series.\n\n299\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.310\nWatch them multiple times,\n\n300\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.100\nthere's show notes, they're all\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n301\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.575\nIn fact,\nevery video in our course

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.837 --> 00:00:17.480\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.461\nAnd in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:23.514\nwe're back with more Microsoft Word\n2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:26.099\n[SOUND] That was a mouthful,\nbut luckily for you,\n\n7\n00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.335\nactually learning is gonna be a whole lot\neasier for our basic Word operations.\n\n8\n00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:34.550\nAnd here to help us in the studio is our\nvery own Word wizard, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.122\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.484\nI love being called a wizard.\n\n11\n00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:39.615\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [SOUND]\n\n12\n00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:41.757\n&gt;&gt; I know, [SOUND] now you know it.\n\n13\n00:00:41.757 --> 00:00:45.490\n[LAUGH] But you're right,\nwe are starting super basic right now.\n\n14\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.070\nWe're gonna start at the foundations,\neven throw in a little bit of just the Mac\n\n15\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.600\noperating system, just kinda getting used\nto like, well, how do I even start Word?\n\n16\n00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.075\nThat's step number one.\n\n17\n00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:58.580\n[LAUGH] And then what can I do\nwith some basic file news, and\n\n18\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.970\nreally just going from the very very\nbeginning assuming we know nothing.\n\n19\n00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.640\nWe've already talked about our\nintroduction, getting us familiar to\n\n20\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.350\nwhat is Word, and we have our locally\ninstalled program on our machine.\n\n21\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.340\nAnd so that's where we're gonna go ahead\nand, well, get this party started.\n\n22\n00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.130\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njump down into my screen.\n\n23\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.565\nYou can see that I have my\nmoon desktop right here, so\n\n24\n00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:21.790\nit makes me feel very spacey.\n\n25\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.085\nWell, I usually feel\nspacey a lot of times.\n\n26\n00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:26.342\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was getting ready to say,\n\n27\n00:01:26.342 --> 00:01:28.795\nI'm not sure if that's\nan appropriately good adjective.\n\n28\n00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.005\n[LAUGH] We're like,\nwhat are we doing again?\n\n29\n00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:32.902\nI don't know.\n\n30\n00:01:32.902 --> 00:01:34.041\n[LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I say that a lot actually.\n\n31\n00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:35.421\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:37.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it's a perfect way to start.\n\n33\n00:01:37.204 --> 00:01:40.060\n[LAUGH] Yeah, story of my life.\n\n34\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.460\nSo we've got our desktop ready to go, and\nlike I said, we have it locally installed.\n\n35\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.600\nSo how can we open up this program?\n\n36\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.445\nWell in Mac, just like anything,\n\n37\n00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:51.570\nit's really a lot of\ndifferent ways we can go to.\n\n38\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.729\nWe can always start down by our Launchpad,\nand Justin, I don't know,\n\n39\n00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.110\ndo you ever use the Launchpad?\n\n40\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.860\n&gt;&gt; By accident sometimes.\n\n41\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.800\nThere's some keyboard shortcuts on the top\npart of your keyboard that'll actually\n\n42\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.274\nlaunch the Launchpad,\nlaunch the Launchpad.\n\n43\n00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:06.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And every once in a while I'm like,\n\n44\n00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.730\nwell, it's already there,\nI'll go ahead and click.\n\n45\n00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.110\nBut it wasn't actually my actual intention\nto access it through that capability.\n\n46\n00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I usually do that to.\n\n47\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.390\nSo, [LAUGH] but\nI figured I'd just go ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.220\npoint this out because it is\na nice place to start out.\n\n49\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.580\nWe go ahead and open up the launchpad.\n\n50\n00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.740\nNow I can see that I do\nhave Word right over there.\n\n51\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.590\nBut sometimes you gotta\nbe careful about it,\n\n52\n00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.290\nit might be on one\nscreen versus the other.\n\n53\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.470\nYou can see there's little dots down here.\n\n54\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.540\nSo if I was on this screen,\nI was like, I don't have Word.\n\n55\n00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.340\nWell then you just go ahead and\nuse, I actually have a magic mouse.\n\n56\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.250\nI love me a magic mouse.\n\n57\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.710\nI don't know about y'all, but man.\n\n58\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.630\nI'm definitely down with it.\n\n59\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.650\nSo I'm just using my finger to\nswipe back and forth on the mouse.\n\n60\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.390\nSo go ahead and get back through\nthe different programs right there.\n\n61\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.710\nAnd of course you have\nthe search up there.\n\n62\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.760\nAgain I don't normally\ngo to the launch pad.\n\n63\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.670\nAnd I just hit the Escape key by\nthe way to just kinda get out of that.\n\n64\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.640\nI'm a big fan of the Spotlight.\n\n65\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.540\nYeah, Justin's over here\nshaking his head like, mm-hm,\n\n66\n00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.850\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n67\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.280\nIt's right over here in\nthe upper right hand corner.\n\n68\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.090\nIt looks like a little magnifying glass,\nbut the keyboard shortcut for\n\n69\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.350\nthat if you ever want to bring that\nup is if you hold Command Space Bar.\n\n70\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.350\nAnd I did notice something,\nthat you have to do Command first and\n\n71\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.260\nthen the Space Bar.\n\n72\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.880\nI'm going to hit the Escape key again.\n\n73\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.933\nIf I hold the Space Bar and then click the\nCommand key, it doesn't do it that way.\n\n74\n00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:28.830\nYou gotta go Command first then Space Bar,\nto go ahead and bring up this Spotlight.\n\n75\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.042\nAnd then you can go ahead and\ntype in the application, or\n\n76\n00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:34.300\nin essence anything, really,\nthat you're wanting to look for.\n\n77\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.154\nSo I go ahead and start typing in Word,\nbrings up my top hit,\n\n78\n00:03:38.154 --> 00:03:39.859\nwould be my application.\n\n79\n00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.150\nAnd that's how you should go.\n\n80\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.560\nYou can also go into the Application menu,\ngo into, what was it, Go, Applications.\n\n81\n00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.390\nMaybe going a little too\nfar into this one, but\n\n82\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.700\nyou could always launch it from there.\n\n83\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.420\nBut like I said, I'm going this one,\nI like to go that way.\n\n84\n00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Quick aside about the Spotlight.\n\n85\n00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.130\nIf you've recently\ninstalled an application,\n\n86\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.660\nit may not populate initially.\n\n87\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.160\nBut behind the scenes, I'm going to leave\nthis very brief, there's a re-indexing\n\n88\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.090\noperation that has to occur for\nSpotlight to do searches appropriately.\n\n89\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.490\nSo there are times where I have installed\nand I have tried to immediately open it\n\n90\n00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.040\nfrom SpotLight,\nsometimes it takes a little bit.\n\n91\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.230\nAnd maybe even a reboot depending on what\napplication and how it was installed.\n\n92\n00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.430\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n93\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.236\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say, did you try\nturning it on and turning it off again?\n\n94\n00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:21.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good old restart's\n\n95\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.480\nalways gonna fix things,\npretty much anything in computers.\n\n96\n00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.296\nBut that's actually a really good point.\n\n97\n00:04:26.296 --> 00:04:29.780\nBecause yeah, I'm not sure if I\nhave experienced it first hand but\n\n98\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.950\nI totally understand what you're saying,\nso good, good point.\n\n99\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.050\nEspecially if you've just went ahead and\nfollowed along and said, hey,\n\n100\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.600\nI went to my Office 365 account,\nI installed a program and\n\n101\n00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.540\nthen I'm doing this with you,\nVonne, and it's not working.\n\n102\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.280\nSo that's a good point to make.\n\n103\n00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.610\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead,\nthe Enter key and start upward, and\n\n104\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.930\nthis is where we start.\n\n105\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.454\nWe've got our start screen.\n\n106\n00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:53.060\nYou can see over on the left hand side,\nit starts up at the top, it's like,\n\n107\n00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.270\nyep, we're using JT,\nwith Justin Timberlake here today.\n\n108\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.150\nAnd so that's what I'm signed in as.\n\n109\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.054\nYours might not have anything there\nif you haven't signed into Office.\n\n110\n00:05:02.054 --> 00:05:06.210\nNow I've worked with this program for\na while, so if it's a very fresh install,\n\n111\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.010\nI think there's a couple welcome screens,\nI mean there's even a place there where it\n\n112\n00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.850\nasks you to log in to\nyour Office 365 account.\n\n113\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.570\nSo just kinda to take\nthat into consideration.\n\n114\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.870\nNotice if I single click on this,\n\n115\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.380\nit does show me the account\nthat I am signed in on.\n\n116\n00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.250\nAnd it does give me access to my\nOneDrive for Business account and\n\n117\n00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.200\nalso my SharePoint.\n\n118\n00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.580\nAnd it also gives me the option to sign\nout if I didn't want to be signed in\n\n119\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.890\nas JT, I could be signed in as Joey,\nor Lance, or the other three different\n\n120\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.040\nlicenses that we have for this\nparticular Office Pro demo co account.\n\n121\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.220\nThen if you go down the rest of it\nwe've got New, Recent, Shared, Open.\n\n122\n00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.240\nYou can see if I click on New, this is\nactually a screen that I'm on by default.\n\n123\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.760\nWhere do you want to start your new file?\n\n124\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.967\nYou have your options for your blank\ndocument, kind of self explanatory,\n\n125\n00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:55.781\nit's blank.\n\n126\n00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:58.352\nAnd then we also have the other ones\nin here that are the templates.\n\n127\n00:05:58.352 --> 00:06:01.584\nThe template is a starting point, it's\nkind of I call it like a rubber stamp,\n\n128\n00:06:01.584 --> 00:06:03.526\nwhere you basically have\nthe template here and\n\n129\n00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:06.070\nyou're stamping it down\nonto your piece of paper.\n\n130\n00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.140\nAnd it gives you a place to go ahead,\nfill in different things.\n\n131\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.350\nAnd you can go through some of these.\n\n132\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.460\nWe'll go ahead and have our own\nepisode about templates later.\n\n133\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.270\nAnd then recent, well anything\nyou've been opening up recently.\n\n134\n00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.720\nYou can see I've got some things,\nlike Muscle Text.\n\n135\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.520\nIt's a book that I work on to help lay out\nmy anatomy and physiology textbook because\n\n136\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.090\nI do use this installation for both\nregular work here and then my off stuff.\n\n137\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.638\nMy off stuff?\n\n138\n00:06:32.638 --> 00:06:35.130\n[LAUGH] My freelance.\n\n139\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.070\nThings that I shared with you.\n\n140\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.320\nI don't have anything in there.\n\n141\n00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.430\nAnd then of course Open goes\nout to where you can find\n\n142\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.980\nthe ones either in your OneDrive or\nyou can see on my Mac.\n\n143\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.650\nThen it actually takes you\nout to different window\n\n144\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.320\nwhere you're in your normal\nfinder in a sense within Word, so\n\n145\n00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.420\nyou could find files that you\nwould like to go ahead and open.\n\n146\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.620\nI'm gonna go ahead and click Cancel on\nthat cuz I don't really want to open it.\n\n147\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.110\nAnd then you realize and\nyou're like, well where did I go?\n\n148\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.920\nWhere's my little start screen?\n\n149\n00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.740\nThat's okay.\n\n150\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.700\nYou're all, you're okay.\n\n151\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.010\nIt's still open.\n\n152\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.910\nThose things you need to get used to\nwhen working in a Mac environment.\n\n153\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.080\nIf you haven't been working on\na Mac lately or for a long time,\n\n154\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.530\nsometimes just the operating system in\ngeneral can be a little misleading.\n\n155\n00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.110\nSo you can see down on here on\nthe dottom row, the dottom?\n\n156\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.220\nIs that what we got going on?\n\n157\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.720\n&gt;&gt; I think you combined the words doc and\nbottom.\n\n158\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.505\nIt's the dottom.\n\n159\n00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:28.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n160\n00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.310\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go with it.\n\n161\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Yup, you totally read my mind.\n\n162\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.150\nExactly where we're going.\n\n163\n00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.060\nDown to the dock bar\nthat is in the bottom.\n\n164\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.180\nNotice down here you can see\nthere's a tiny little black dot\n\n165\n00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.880\nunderneath that icon, that indicates\nthat this application is open.\n\n166\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.727\nIf you ever wondered what those were, like\nyeah, it's saying that this app is open.\n\n167\n00:07:50.727 --> 00:07:52.971\nAnd also notice that up here at the top,\n\n168\n00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.972\nyou can see that you have\nthe menu bar across the top.\n\n169\n00:07:55.972 --> 00:07:58.062\nThat's the nice thing about, that I like.\n\n170\n00:07:58.062 --> 00:08:02.384\nAbout Mac version Office products\nis that it kinda combines,\n\n171\n00:08:02.384 --> 00:08:05.707\nlike you still have the old\nschool menus that you\n\n172\n00:08:05.707 --> 00:08:10.210\nalways used to have before the Windows\nversion got rid of it all.\n\n173\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.480\nNow you only have it in the ribbon.\n\n174\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.370\nSo that's kinda cute.\n\n175\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.700\nSo you can always go\nback to your File menu.\n\n176\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.560\nYour File menu is where you get\nthings like File, New, File, Open.\n\n177\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.613\nAnd I can actually say File, Open and\n\n178\n00:08:22.613 --> 00:08:25.760\nFile, New, and\nactually have a menu to refer back to.\n\n179\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.250\nOtherwise, when you just say, I really\nmeant the backstage view and everything,\n\n180\n00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.875\nwhile I'm working and\noften this for WIndows.\n\n181\n00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:34.865\nSo, it's, kind of,\nnice that this is all here.\n\n182\n00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:39.135\nSo, this is another place that you\ncan go to, to start a new document.\n\n183\n00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:44.085\nJust what we're going to do and\nit brings up our document one.\n\n184\n00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:45.315\nSo, now I have this.\n\n185\n00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:49.235\nMy resolution is a little lower on my\nscreen, so it might not fully encompass\n\n186\n00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:52.415\nthe whole screen that you see\nwhen you start a new document.\n\n187\n00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:59.390\nThis is a very mac like thing I work\nin both platforms, I am bilingual.\n\n188\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.740\nI do a lot of stuff, as you see in\nthe library, both for Windows and for Mac.\n\n189\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.630\nSo if you're a Mac person, you kind of get\nused to the kind of free floating window\n\n190\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:14.020\nlike functionality of\nthe operating system.\n\n191\n00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.210\nAnd you have your two pointed arrows on\nany of your sides of your windows, or\n\n192\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:25.290\nyour corners of your windows that you can\ngo ahead and start resizing this down.\n\n193\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.130\nGrabbing by that top bar which\nis called the title bar here,\n\n194\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.750\nas you can kinda start moving this around.\n\n195\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.630\nAnd I'm gonna kinda,\nwell, move it over here.\n\n196\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.270\nAll right, so this is just basics.\n\n197\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.270\nRight, we're just getting started and\n\n198\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.920\njust kinda getting familiar\nwith this environment.\n\n199\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.530\nWell, that we have a whole another\nepisode about the Word environment.\n\n200\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:52.680\nThis is again just the Windows, it's weird\nwhen I say Windows, but I'm really a Mac.\n\n201\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.750\n&gt;&gt; Technically,\nit is a window-ing kind of engine.\n\n202\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.430\nSo we think of Windows as\nsynonymous with Microsoft,\n\n203\n00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.750\nbut a Windows Display Manager\nis what we're seeing.\n\n204\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.990\nAnd there are some nuanced\ndifferences where you're like\n\n205\n00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.540\nthat doesn't work like I\nthought it was going to.\n\n206\n00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.060\nAnd I'm sure you're gonna cover this.\n\n207\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Man that was a perfect lead-in and\nthat was not in the script by any means.\n\n208\n00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.062\nThere's no notes for him to say that so\nI was just like that was good.\n\n209\n00:10:19.062 --> 00:10:24.140\n[LAUGH] Yes, if you are bilingual\nthese buttons are gonna be different.\n\n210\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.370\nLike, significantly different.\n\n211\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.090\nWhere one they're on the left hand side\nbesides being on the right hand side but\n\n212\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.970\nthese are your, the red,\nyellow and green buttons.\n\n213\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.840\nI know they have actual names, but\nlet's go with the colors, all right?\n\n214\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.770\nLet's start with the yellow\nbutton in the middle.\n\n215\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.620\nThe yellow button in the middle\nis your minimize button and\n\n216\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.080\nthat's going to minimize this\nwindow that you're working in.\n\n217\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.580\nAnd it's going to suck\nitself down into the dock.\n\n218\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.600\nLet me show you what mine does.\n\n219\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.900\nI go ahead and click it and\nit goes down into my dock.\n\n220\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.560\nIt's over, actually, by my trashcan.\n\n221\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.820\nIt's a little behind my head, so just so\nyou can see, it's right down here, and\n\n222\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.130\nthis is something that you need to\ndo on your dock preferences, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.740\nThe dock preference on mine, on my whole\noperating system, not Word preferences.\n\n224\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.970\nMac OS preferences is that\nit goes down to the side.\n\n225\n00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.450\nIf yours does not do that, and its going\ndown to where it almost looks like its\n\n226\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:21.950\nsucking down into the word icon on\nthe dock, that's again that preference.\n\n227\n00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.380\nI'm just gonna go ahead and show you this.\n\n228\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.090\nSo in the System Preferences,\nlooks like a little gears right there and\n\n229\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.650\nthis is some preference in the doc,\nright here.\n\n230\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.570\nYou could see where it will go ahead and\nminimize into the application icon.\n\n231\n00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.860\nNotice mine is checked off.\n\n232\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.130\nIf I turn that on, let me go ahead and\nbring this back up.\n\n233\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.830\nYou see how it goes kinda down into Word,\nokay?\n\n234\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.870\nI personally don't like that,\n\n235\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:53.120\nbecause I don't know where my open windows\nare located, so I don't like that.\n\n236\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.620\nAnd of course, notice you can click\nright back on it to go ahead and\n\n237\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.140\npop that back up.\n\n238\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.120\nSo I wanted to let you guys know\nthis that's what's going on here.\n\n239\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.930\nAnd the other things that you have\nin your dock whether it's like\n\n240\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.430\nautomatically hiding or other things.\n\n241\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.430\nThe thing that I noticed double click\non a title bar of what it does.\n\n242\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.060\nMine's set to zoom which\nI think is the default.\n\n243\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.640\nI'll be showing you what\nthat does when I do that.\n\n244\n00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.210\nDoc preferences do make a difference as to\n\n245\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.720\nwhat's going on when you minimize,\nall right.\n\n246\n00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.480\nSo that's gonna go ahead and\nkinda suck it down, bring it back up,\n\n247\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.970\nand that's where it will restore\nback into where you need it to go.\n\n248\n00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.800\nNow the X, the red X there.\n\n249\n00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.560\nIn this particular application what that\nmeans is it's going to close the File or\n\n250\n00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.990\nin this case,\nthis window that we're working in, but\n\n251\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.198\nnot close out Word of the application.\n\n252\n00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:48.720\nIf you notice I click that,\nWord's still open,\n\n253\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.730\njust like I had kinda gotten\nrid of that Start Menu.\n\n254\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.730\nThat is not the same in all\nof your other Mac programs.\n\n255\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:00.290\nI belive if I started Safari,\nyou could see if I close this x here,\n\n256\n00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.850\nit actually closes,\nwell no still Safari's open,\n\n257\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.370\nI think maybe the calendar there's\nsome other apps that do that.\n\n258\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.220\n&gt;&gt; So, as from a development point of\nview you kind of get to decide whether it\n\n259\n00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.460\nstay open and minimize, effectively\nwhat's happening it's hiding away and\n\n260\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.310\njust hanging out on the doc at the bottom.\n\n261\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.290\nSo it's running as a background process,\nthat means if you don't have to re-launch\n\n262\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.440\nit or anything,\njust opens up a new window.\n\n263\n00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.140\nAnd by and large,\nthat is probably the biggest\n\n264\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.060\nhiccup when someone transitions\nto a Mac OS environment.\n\n265\n00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.980\nI closed it, no, all of them are open,\n\n266\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.190\nbut I think the calendar does\nclose when you X out of it.\n\n267\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.260\nYou just have to be careful.\n\n268\n00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.350\nMy recommendation, assume that it's\ngonna stay open if you hit the red X\n\n269\n00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.780\nunless you specifically,\nI say exit application.\n\n270\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and always look for those dots.\n\n271\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.230\nIs this still open and\nthen you can switch back and forth.\n\n272\n00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.620\nI don't want to jump too far ahead\nwith the keyboard shortcuts but\n\n273\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.860\nI'm just going to go ahead and\ndo it anyways.\n\n274\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.080\nIf you hold your command key and\nthen click the tab key,\n\n275\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.280\nthat will just cycle through\nthe different open applications.\n\n276\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.360\nI'll actually do that just to see what\nI have open and then now I have Safari.\n\n277\n00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.590\nYou can come up to the menu at the top and\nthen Quit Safari.\n\n278\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.640\nAlso keyboard shortcut COMMAND Q for quit.\n\n279\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:17.090\nThat's pretty much a universal Mac thing\nverses, COMMAND W which is close the file.\n\n280\n00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.180\nThe one that we just did.\n\n281\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.940\nSo, again don't have to worry\nabout keyboard shortcuts,\n\n282\n00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.960\nI'm just point it out and\nlooking for the dots.\n\n283\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.870\nAll right so\nlets go back over here to Word, again.\n\n284\n00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.830\nI'm back at my start screen.\n\n285\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.100\nI'll go back to New, and\nclick Blank Document here.\n\n286\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.670\nI could have also gone up to the file and\nI'll double click on this, and\n\n287\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.230\nthen it creates my document.\n\n288\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.500\nNotice, it says document 2.\n\n289\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.300\nIt's like why isn't document?\n\n290\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.500\nIt just does that automatically.\n\n291\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.540\nIt's just gonna change\nthe numbering because I,\n\n292\n00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.910\nwell, this is the second new file I've\ncreated, even though I didn't save it,\n\n293\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.380\nand close it, and\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n294\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.978\nAll right so we did the yellow,\nthe red, ooh the green button.\n\n295\n00:14:53.978 --> 00:14:57.370\n[LAUGH] All right this is another\none if you're switching or\n\n296\n00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.270\nyou're not familiar with it.\n\n297\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.740\nIt still kind of freaks me out\nevery time like goodness gracious.\n\n298\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.250\nThis goes into full screen mode\nwhich can be kind of nice and\n\n299\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.910\nit's kind of annoying to me personally.\n\n300\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.640\nSo if I click on it.\n\n301\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.800\nIf like maximize times two,\nif you want to say.\n\n302\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.000\nBecause normally people think that's\ngonna maximize the window if your coming\n\n303\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.187\nover from a windows environment.\n\n304\n00:15:19.187 --> 00:15:23.620\nI know like everything else kind of goes\naway and if your not used to that or\n\n305\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.360\nnot expecting it your like,\nI don't know where I'm at.\n\n306\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.720\nI've lost my dock bar, I've lost\nmy menu bar, I've lost everything.\n\n307\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.230\nNo it's still there.\n\n308\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.220\nJust went into full screen mode.\n\n309\n00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.670\nCouple ways you can get out of this,\n\n310\n00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.010\nand you can hit the Escape\nkey on your keyboard.\n\n311\n00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.300\nSo that's a nice escape.\n\n312\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.590\nHey, I didn't wanna be there.\n\n313\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.150\nJust hit the Escape key.\n\n314\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.580\nThat's one way that you can do it.\n\n315\n00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.647\nYou can also, if you hover towards\nthe top and just kinda stop for\n\n316\n00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:51.255\na second, notice how it kinda pops up\nthe different options that I have.\n\n317\n00:15:51.255 --> 00:15:54.247\nAnd this is not just for\nWord, by the way, this is for\n\n318\n00:15:54.247 --> 00:15:56.303\nalmost everything in Mac, right.\n\n319\n00:15:56.303 --> 00:15:59.359\nThis is one of those newer\nfeatures that was introduced,\n\n320\n00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:02.170\nI forget which release it\nwas where if you maximize.\n\n321\n00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.430\nIt's actually maximizing to a desktop and\n\n322\n00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.900\nit creates this weird\nmultiple desktop thing.\n\n323\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.940\nApparently there are ways around that,\ncuz some people don't like that.\n\n324\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.090\nI want it to maximize over this, so\nI can still minimize or move it, or\n\n325\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.690\nresize it if I need something on\nthe desktop, or an application behind it.\n\n326\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.223\nBut by default when you hit\nthe green it's full screen and\n\n327\n00:16:24.223 --> 00:16:26.290\nyou got to do stuff to make it not.\n\n328\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it wasn't always like\nthat because I've gone through\n\n329\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.310\nquite a few iterations of the Mac OS and\nI'm just like woah wait what?\n\n330\n00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.910\nAnd so I just stopped clicking\nthe button and it just,\n\n331\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.370\nit wasn't working the way\nI use to like it.\n\n332\n00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:43.300\nSo you do have the hovering and\nthen you can go into your view menu and\n\n333\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.480\nyou can go to view, exit full screen.\n\n334\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.290\nAgain, this is for like Safari,\nany of your applications,\n\n335\n00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.380\nthis is across the board in\nyour basic MacOS preferences.\n\n336\n00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.800\nOr not really preferences,\njust functionality.\n\n337\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.630\nAnd I can exit out of that,\nand I'm kinda back in.\n\n338\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.300\nYou can almost see,\nlike it kinda moves like you said,\n\n339\n00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.560\nthat multiple desktops thing can get\na little weird, so there's that.\n\n340\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.300\nThat double clicking on the title bar,\n\n341\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.050\nthat was that preference\nthat I showed you.\n\n342\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.080\nIf you double click it, do you see how\nit kind of like, well, it says it zooms,\n\n343\n00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.430\nbut it doesn't always go to\nthe same level I've noticed.\n\n344\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.130\nIt just does that okay.\n\n345\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.260\nDouble clicking on it\nwill size it down and\n\n346\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.640\nmake it look nice and\npretty iust to let you know.\n\n347\n00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.290\nBut again, you can always change out\nyour two point arrows, make them bigger,\n\n348\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:32.540\nsmaller, grab them, move them around,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n349\n00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.150\nSo File &gt; New, we'll go ahead and\nstart your new document.\n\n350\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.952\nBut what if I wanted to\nopen up an existing file.\n\n351\n00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:42.880\nAll right now I'm already here cuz maybe I\nwanna do like copy and paste and I need to\n\n352\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.200\ncopy something outta one file and paste\nit into this file, so on and so forth.\n\n353\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.270\nFile open from our menu right\nthere you also have your\n\n354\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.120\nkeyboard shortcut of command O all right?\n\n355\n00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.040\nThrowing that up,\nthere's a couple shortcuts.\n\n356\n00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.840\nDon't worry in the show notes I do have\na whole list of keyboard shortcuts for\n\n357\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.560\nMac that you can go ahead and\nreference if you would like to.\n\n358\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.330\nSo we'll open up the file, I am using this\nfolder on my desktop just to let you see,\n\n359\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.250\nmy Desktop Essentials for Mac.\n\n360\n00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.840\nYou don't have to open up the same file\nI'm working on if you're following along\n\n361\n00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.210\njust pick any work file, honestly.\n\n362\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.310\nI'll pick AliceBook to just show\nyou how we can start working with\n\n363\n00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.200\nmultiple windows,\nthat's what I want to show you.\n\n364\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:25.550\nAnd a little bit of save versus save as,\nthat's wonderful super basic stuff.\n\n365\n00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.340\nMoving them around, I can go ahead and\n\n366\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.770\nkind of use my dragging and\nsizing the windows.\n\n367\n00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.790\nBut there is a little trick that,\nI'll tell you,\n\n368\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:39.180\nI just learned about this recently, and\nI was like, I didn't know it can do that.\n\n369\n00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.450\nThe green button, the green button\nwe said was the full screen.\n\n370\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.930\nWell there's something in Windows where\nyou can dock two Windows off to the sides.\n\n371\n00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.480\nDo you know about this trick in Mac?\n\n372\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.560\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about it in Mac because\na lot of time there's like secondary\n\n373\n00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.510\napps and\nstuff that help you do the tiling.\n\n374\n00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.274\nI know in Windows I know all the shortcuts\nto snap things to grids to stuff so\n\n375\n00:18:57.274 --> 00:18:59.610\nI can quickly arrange my windows.\n\n376\n00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.480\nNot so easy inside of the MAC environment.\n\n377\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is that whole dock over\none side and the other, let me show you.\n\n378\n00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.940\nIf you, I'm like I can show you\nsomething new Justin, I'm excited.\n\n379\n00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.600\nIf you click and hold on the green button,\ndo you see how it kinda pops?\n\n380\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.480\nYeah, right?\n\n381\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.510\nJustin's like this, [LAUGH] so you can\ntake this and say I want this over here.\n\n382\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:24.710\nAnd then it automatically takes you to\nwhere your other window is located.\n\n383\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:29.050\nAnd you click on it and then it takes it\nto where you have both of them in full\n\n384\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:34.280\nscreen mode, right there, and\nit's like the split dock on one side.\n\n385\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.520\nAnd once you're in here, you can take\nthis two pointed arrow, in the middle and\n\n386\n00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.090\nyou can drag this over to have\none show more versus the other.\n\n387\n00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.390\nAnd I could do something like that.\n\n388\n00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.880\nSo if you're working back and\nforth between screens, you can do that,\n\n389\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.490\nsorry I'm having fun\nwatching Justin's face.\n\n390\n00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:58.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm fuming a little\nbit cuz I don't use Mac as\n\n391\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.010\nmuch as I used to in my everyday work but\nthis was one of the most frustrating.\n\n392\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:07.210\nI need to snap these side by side and\nI was like,\n\n393\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.220\nmanually reset, I was like, whatever.\n\n394\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.770\nSo I actually got used to using the\nmultiple desktop things in full screen and\n\n395\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.470\njust swiping because I couldn't do this.\n\n396\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.597\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI told you I just recently learned it.\n\n397\n00:20:17.597 --> 00:20:21.910\nNow it's always the smallest things where\nwe're like, my gosh, you're kidding me.\n\n398\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is making me angry.\n\n399\n00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:25.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, right, all this time.\n\n400\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.745\nI don't know how new that is, honestly.\n\n401\n00:20:27.745 --> 00:20:29.390\n[LAUGH] I said, it's.\n\n402\n00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:34.270\nRecent like within the last two weeks,\nyeah so, just throwing that out there.\n\n403\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.960\nNow the thing is, getting out of it can be\na little weird.I'll tell you cuz I'm like,\n\n404\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.000\nokay well I wanna take this and\nI wanna not full screen this.\n\n405\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.660\nI'll exit out of full screen, but\n\n406\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.620\nit's only the, remember I have two files,\nI'm like wait, where's the other?\n\n407\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.680\nSo I start to do my shortcuts,\n\n408\n00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:57.340\nI'm like I can't find it I had to\nmove over, do the four finger swipe.\n\n409\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.520\nI noticed that's where it's great, but\nit's kind of hiding on another desktop,\n\n410\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.590\nso now I gotta get this\nguy out of full screen.\n\n411\n00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:11.210\nSo, it's two separate things,\neach side goes into full screen mode.\n\n412\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.960\nAnd if you're not very Mac savvy, if you\nwant to say, you're I've lost that thing,\n\n413\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.110\nI don't know where to go.\n\n414\n00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.610\nAgain, I just did a swipe, like\nthe full finger swipe, left and right,\n\n415\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.070\nto be able get to those multiple\ndesktops to kind of find it.\n\n416\n00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:29.190\nSo it's a little weird I liked when\nI found out, but then I'm like, ooh.\n\n417\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.100\nSo I've just got to remember where\nto find those docked pieces.\n\n418\n00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.370\nSo just keep your minds\nyou about right there.\n\n419\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.800\nAll right so, now we know about\nhow to work with multiple windows.\n\n420\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.970\nLet's do a quick little File &gt; Save As and\nFile &gt; Save vs Save As.\n\n421\n00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.580\nOkay, this is one of\nthose super basic ones.\n\n422\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.750\nRight here,\nI have a file called Alice_book.docx,right\n\n423\n00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.760\nwe talked about file types.\n\n424\n00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.920\nIf I typed in Hello, then I went ahead and\nsaid, that's what I want.\n\n425\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.670\nIf I did a file save right now,\n\n426\n00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:10.470\nthat means that I would be updating\nanything that I did in this file,\n\n427\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.300\nsame name, same location of where\nI've saved it, and same file type.\n\n428\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.290\nIt is just committing these changes\nthat I have done to this file,\n\n429\n00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.620\nthat's what save does.\n\n430\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.950\nSave as, that's where you get to\nrename it, change it's location,\n\n431\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.130\nchange the file type.\n\n432\n00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:33.270\nSometimes people say I wanna not save over\nthe original, so I know to do save as.\n\n433\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.940\nSome people refer to this like\ndoing a copy, like another version.\n\n434\n00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.450\nHowever you want to put it into\nyour brain, it's just that save as,\n\n435\n00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.520\njust make sure I would not save\nthese changes under Alice_Book.\n\n436\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.660\nI might do a file save as and\nsay Alice_Book_Vonne,\n\n437\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.770\nso that way this is my version of it.\n\n438\n00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:59.658\nSo I'm not making any changes\nto my original document,\n\n439\n00:22:59.658 --> 00:23:02.470\nthat's what file save as does.\n\n440\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:07.270\nAnd I still do it to this day, where I\njust go ahead and commit the changes,\n\n441\n00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:11.660\nlike, whoops, no I didn't want to do it on\nthat file, I wanted to make it's own copy.\n\n442\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:16.900\nSometimes I'll even do a save as before\nI even start making my modifications.\n\n443\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.880\nBecause I can tell you I've done that and\nthen made the changes to the wrong file\n\n444\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.920\nand it just gets you all kinda\ntwirled around a little bit.\n\n445\n00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.840\nBut that is the basics\nof save versus save as.\n\n446\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.090\nAnd I can put it straight on my desktop,\nlet's go with there.\n\n447\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.190\nIf I change the name and the location,\nand there's where I got it,\n\n448\n00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.350\nYou can even see it right on over there.\n\n449\n00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:42.020\nAnd there you go so file save as and\nsave and there we go.\n\n450\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.530\nClosing remember we talked about our red\nx, this would go ahead and close the file.\n\n451\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:53.652\nI could also do a Cmd+W to that\nparticular file, this one right here.\n\n452\n00:23:53.652 --> 00:23:57.683\nIf I started typing just to save\nback on that save versus save as.\n\n453\n00:23:57.683 --> 00:24:02.739\nThe very first time that Save and\nSave as are the same command is only when\n\n454\n00:24:02.739 --> 00:24:07.626\nyou start from a blank new document,\nand if I tried to do File &gt; Save or\n\n455\n00:24:07.626 --> 00:24:12.288\nCmd+S, it's gonna say, well,\nI don't have a name and a home.\n\n456\n00:24:12.288 --> 00:24:15.870\nI don't have that.\nThis is the only time it will say it.\n\n457\n00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.828\nIt always pulls that first line of\nwhatever you have, like [SOUND].\n\n458\n00:24:18.828 --> 00:24:20.290\n[LAUGH] That's what it's\ntrying to name my file.\n\n459\n00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.110\nAnd then you can do that.\n\n460\n00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:26.770\nI'm gonna cancel this cuz I don't\nneed to save any of my changes.\n\n461\n00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.100\nSo when I close this,\nI am gonna get the, hey, are you sure?\n\n462\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.740\nBecause you wanna save or you don't\nwanna save, or do you want me to cancel?\n\n463\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.609\nThis point,\n\n464\n00:24:34.609 --> 00:24:39.755\nI do not want to save my changes to this\ndocument because I don't need a [SOUND].\n\n465\n00:24:39.755 --> 00:24:45.212\nSo, I'm good there, cuz that's what\nit said, in case you were wondering.\n\n466\n00:24:45.212 --> 00:24:47.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [SOUND] Sounds very important,\nyou probably should have saved that.\n\n467\n00:24:47.283 --> 00:24:48.011\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n468\n00:24:48.011 --> 00:24:52.810\nAll right, so the last thing that\nI wanna leave off with is just\n\n469\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.650\na little bit about the keyboard.\n\n470\n00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:57.180\nThis might sound like, really?\n\n471\n00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.460\nWe're gonna review the keys on a keyboard?\n\n472\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.830\nLike, this is the letter A.\nNo, I'm not talking about that.\n\n473\n00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:06.380\nI just wanna throw some things out there\nbecause, well, it seems very simple,\n\n474\n00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.660\nbut I can tell you how many\ntimes this trips up people,\n\n475\n00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.230\nespecially if you're going back and\nforth between operating systems.\n\n476\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.560\nAnd, well, the Mac keyboard,\nit's a little different.\n\n477\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.850\nSo and I've actually brought\nin my external keyboard.\n\n478\n00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.680\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my keyboard.\n\n479\n00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.270\nI actually brought in both my keyboards,\nlike I said.\n\n480\n00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.350\nThis is the one from home that I use.\n\n481\n00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:30.600\nThe reason why we can't plug in,\nJustin, you know this.\n\n482\n00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:36.930\nUSB 2.0 to not to USB 2.0,\ncuz I have a fancy new laptop here.\n\n483\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.660\nBut on your laptop keyboard,\njust know that for one thing,\n\n484\n00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.450\nI don't have a function\nkey across the top.\n\n485\n00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.830\nI do enough work that I\nreally want my function keys.\n\n486\n00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.810\nAnd I know you can map things and do all\nsorts of crazy stuff with your keyboard\n\n487\n00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:54.310\npreferences, but\njust know you have your Delete key here.\n\n488\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.913\nIt's one of those things where,\nas a Mac person, you have Delete, but\n\n489\n00:25:58.913 --> 00:26:01.310\nthen that's not the Backspace key.\n\n490\n00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.540\nPeople say, use the Backspace, because\nthat will go ahead and backspace over.\n\n491\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.220\nWell, there's a forward Delete\nkey on a full-sized keyboard, and\n\n492\n00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.800\nit also has my function keys.\n\n493\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.698\nI have some ones like the Page Up,\nPage Down, the Home, the End.\n\n494\n00:26:16.698 --> 00:26:20.760\nAnd then my function key right here\nthat I can kinda do some stuff.\n\n495\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.790\nI will tell you,\nas somebody who does a lot of typesetting,\n\n496\n00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.520\nlike when I'm working in InDesign and\neverything, I always have this plugged in.\n\n497\n00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.850\nI just forgot my dongle,\n[LAUGH] but we've got that.\n\n498\n00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:35.689\nSo, notice you don't have some of these\nkeys if you're working on a laptop here.\n\n499\n00:26:35.689 --> 00:26:39.743\nSo, we've got the Delete key, but\nthere's not the forward Delete key.\n\n500\n00:26:39.743 --> 00:26:44.189\nBut, a lot of times, if you, I don't know\nif you know this, but I'm sure you do,\n\n501\n00:26:44.189 --> 00:26:48.572\nbut the Function Delete, that I'll\nactually use, it has a forward Delete key,\n\n502\n00:26:48.572 --> 00:26:51.215\nwhich [LAUGH] I didn't know for\nthe longest time so\n\n503\n00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:54.340\nI'd have to move my mouse and\nlike go all over the places.\n\n504\n00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.090\nBut just be aware that\nyour keyboard does kinda\n\n505\n00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.240\nhave some things that\nmight be a little weird.\n\n506\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.590\nIf I'm using my laptop and\nI wanna do Page Up and Page Down,\n\n507\n00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.250\nI don't have that unless I specifically\nprogram the Page Up, Page Down.\n\n508\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:14.670\nAnd these particular hot keys right here\nare, call hot keys, you can combine them\n\n509\n00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:19.010\nin for some really cool keyboard shortcuts\nto be able to help you navigate around.\n\n510\n00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.680\nAnd I really like to use this.\n\n511\n00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.804\nSo if I'm going in a couple of\nthe episodes where you don't have these,\n\n512\n00:27:24.804 --> 00:27:25.709\nthat's okay.\n\n513\n00:27:25.709 --> 00:27:29.390\nI'll always give you alternative\nways of moving around your document.\n\n514\n00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.820\nBut I just wanted to throw that out there,\nand\n\n515\n00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.580\nalso that you have your\nCmd key right here.\n\n516\n00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.630\nYou also have your Option.\n\n517\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.715\nI might call that an Alt key.\n\n518\n00:27:37.715 --> 00:27:40.922\nBecause, well,\nit says Alt right there, [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:27:40.922 --> 00:27:42.550\nAnd then you also have your Ctrl.\n\n520\n00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.625\nCmd and Ctrl are different than, well,\n\n521\n00:27:46.625 --> 00:27:50.707\neach other, when you're using keyboard\nshortcuts and you have your Shift key.\n\n522\n00:27:50.707 --> 00:27:53.437\nCuz I had already thrown\nout a couple of those,\n\n523\n00:27:53.437 --> 00:27:58.157\nlike using your keyboard shortcuts\nthere and some of the little icons.\n\n524\n00:27:58.157 --> 00:28:02.472\nI always have to remind myself like,\nwhich one, like the arrow, I think,\n\n525\n00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:06.737\nis the Ctrl, and the little infinity\nsign or whatever is the Cmd, right?\n\n526\n00:28:06.737 --> 00:28:08.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always mess those up as well.\n\n527\n00:28:08.535 --> 00:28:12.894\nAnd do keep in mind a lot of the times\nwhat'll happen between Mac and Windows,\n\n528\n00:28:12.894 --> 00:28:15.847\nif you're coming from\na Windows-based platform,\n\n529\n00:28:15.847 --> 00:28:20.006\nCtrl on a Windows-based platform is\nmost of the time, not exclusively,\n\n530\n00:28:20.006 --> 00:28:23.652\nmost of the time, well,\nit's replaced by the Cmd key, right?\n\n531\n00:28:23.652 --> 00:28:26.942\nSo if I wanted to use some\nshortcut that uses Cmd on Mac for\n\n532\n00:28:26.942 --> 00:28:30.442\na particular application and\nit was available on Windows,\n\n533\n00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:33.317\na lot of times you can just\nreplace Cmd with Ctrl.\n\n534\n00:28:33.317 --> 00:28:36.430\nNot always, though, so\nyour mileage may vary.\n\n535\n00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:41.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou might even hear me say Ctrl+S.\n\n536\n00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.560\nI really mean Cmd, okay?\n\n537\n00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.610\nBecause, like I said, I work on both.\n\n538\n00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:45.740\nJust one quick little thing.\n\n539\n00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.250\nLet me just jump back\ndown on that computer.\n\n540\n00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.400\nI have a File &gt; New, and just to show\nyou those things that Justin and\n\n541\n00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:50.940\nI are talking about.\n\n542\n00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.481\nYou can see over on the right-hand side,\nlike right here, the New from Template.\n\n543\n00:28:55.481 --> 00:28:57.420\nBut I'm pretty sure that's the Shift key.\n\n544\n00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.460\nOkay, and then the View,\ndo you see how it has the caret?\n\n545\n00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.380\nPretty sure that's the Ctrl,\nthat's Ctrl+Cmd+F.\n\n546\n00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.600\nLet me try it.\n\n547\n00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.600\nYep, that's it, okay [LAUGH].\nSo that's what it is.\n\n548\n00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.280\nAnd there's also the one with\nthe little kind of [SOUND].\n\n549\n00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.570\nWow, it's really hard for\nme to, there it is.\n\n550\n00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.480\nThat one, right there.\n\n551\n00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.425\nThat's the Option, I believe.\n\n552\n00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:24.163\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like a dancer out of\na Bangles song from the 80s or something,\n\n553\n00:29:24.163 --> 00:29:24.910\nI don't know.\n\n554\n00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My god, that's totally it.\n\n555\n00:29:27.921 --> 00:29:31.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wow, now I've got the song in my head.\n\n556\n00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:33.340\n[LAUGH] That's fantastic.\n\n557\n00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:33.870\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome, you're welcome.\n\n558\n00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you so much,\n\n559\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.910\nso, but yeah, just a couple\nof things about the keyboard.\n\n560\n00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.500\nKeyboard shortcuts, just knowing that\nthat's where you go ahead and find them.\n\n561\n00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.490\nI'm gonna just hit the Esc, and\n\n562\n00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.890\nI'm gonna do a Cmd+Q to close\nout of Word altogether.\n\n563\n00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.818\nAnd I think that about wraps up all\nthe basics that I wanted to cover with\n\n564\n00:29:50.818 --> 00:29:52.829\nstarting Word, a doc preference.\n\n565\n00:29:52.829 --> 00:29:57.264\nEven did a little doc preference in\nMac OS and File &gt; Save As and Save,\n\n566\n00:29:57.264 --> 00:30:01.060\nand I think we're ready to go and\njump into the interface.\n\n567\n00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.665\nThat's that.\n\n568\n00:30:01.665 --> 00:30:03.075\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, well,\n\n569\n00:30:03.075 --> 00:30:06.880\ndefinitely thank you for taking us through\nthe Mac OS-specific portions of Word.\n\n570\n00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.740\nNow, some of this was commingled,\nso if you're familiar with,\n\n571\n00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.066\nhe's like, I already knew that, well,\n\n572\n00:30:11.066 --> 00:30:14.650\nI'd be careful because a lot of times\nthese are application specific.\n\n573\n00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.630\nAnd well, we do know more about Word in\nparticular, so definitely stay tuned.\n\n574\n00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.150\nBut it looks like we're out of time for\nthis episode, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n575\n00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.180\nwrap this one up.\n\n576\n00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.060\nSigning off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n577\n00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.596\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n578\n00:30:26.596 --> 00:30:28.671\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:20.217\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and we're\nback with more Microsoft Word Essentials,\n\n4\n00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:23.250\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.500\nThat's a long title, but\nI got it out of there.\n\n6\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.340\nIn particular, we're gonna to be\nlooking at the Word interface, right?\n\n7\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.522\nWe started off looking at how these\nintegrations work with Mac, right,\n\n8\n00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:36.640\nhow the Word and\nMac interface kind of commingle.\n\n9\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.400\nBut now we're going to be looking more\nWord specific things and luckily,\n\n10\n00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.150\nwe have our very own Microsoft maestro\nin the studio today, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.220\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.246\n&gt;&gt; I love waiting for your introductions,\nlike, what's he gonna call me this time?\n\n13\n00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:51.500\n[LAUGH] That's very good.\n\n14\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.610\nSo yeah, that is a long title,\nand it's hard to kinda get out.\n\n15\n00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.150\n&gt;&gt; So I think you did a really good job.\n\n16\n00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.560\n&gt;&gt; I was close, I was close.\n\n17\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.120\nAnd if I hadn't have forgotten 2016,\nit would have been good,\n\n18\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.440\nit would have been good.\n\n19\n00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.780\n&gt;&gt; We got all the essential\nwords in there.\n\n20\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.710\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; So you're good.\n\n21\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.250\nIt was just like Justin was saying.\n\n22\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.980\nWe're gonna get into Word interface and\nidentifying with the real technical names.\n\n23\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.890\nWhat things are rather than\njust that button over there,\n\n24\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.570\nand that doohickey there,\nand that thingymabob.\n\n25\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.461\nWhich I usually tend to refer\nto a lot of times [LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:25.986\n&gt;&gt; Those aren't the technical names,\nthat's how I refer to.\n\n27\n00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:29.490\nI'm like that thing, with the doohickey\nover next to the watchamacallit.\n\n28\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.110\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, yeah I'm sure we will\ndefinitely get back into that, but\n\n29\n00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.590\nI figure I'd at least tell you the real\nname at least once and then go from there.\n\n30\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.310\nAll right, so we're going to get started,\nby well, starting a board.\n\n31\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.700\nAnd there's actually one thing\nthat I forgot to tell you.\n\n32\n00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.716\nYou were watching in the other episode\nwhere we talked about the word basics\n\n33\n00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:52.850\nlet's show you how to dock it\nin your dock to keep it there.\n\n34\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.790\nSo let's go ahead and jump down in here.\n\n35\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.510\nYou can see on my dock\nboard I got this little,\n\n36\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.738\nlittle bird looking guy down there.\n\n37\n00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:03.518\nThis is known as Haroopad,\nthis is something for that I write and\n\n38\n00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:06.813\nmark down which is what we\nwrite all of our show notes in.\n\n39\n00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:10.576\nBut you see how, it's right there for\nme to able to click on it and\n\n40\n00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:11.852\nopen the program up.\n\n41\n00:02:11.852 --> 00:02:15.420\nWell, I'd like to have Word down there,\nwell, you can do that.\n\n42\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.290\nYou just have to go ahead and open it and\nthen right click on it to go ahead and\n\n43\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.170\nkeep it there as an option or\nyour preferences for your programs.\n\n44\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.950\nAnd I've customized my other stuff,\ncuz I went ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.930\nI got rid of some of the applications\nthat I don't really want on the dock bar.\n\n46\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.690\nAnd maybe throughout this series you\nmight see me actually like minimize it or\n\n47\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.230\ndo an auto hide,\nwhere you don't see it all the time.\n\n48\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.260\nBut in these first introduction\nepisodes I wanted to keep it up and\n\n49\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.120\nreally get you going with that.\n\n50\n00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.180\nSo, I'm gonna do my spotlight, I'm gonna\ndo my command spacebar to bring this up.\n\n51\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.000\nType in Word not Q and\nI will show this, open this up,\n\n52\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.280\nand I can hit enter to get it started.\n\n53\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.870\nNotice that down here I can\nright click like I said.\n\n54\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.125\nGo into options, yes, keep in dock.\n\n55\n00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:02.915\nIt's actually behind my head where you\ncan see where it says keep in dock.\n\n56\n00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:06.755\nAnd that way it will stay,\nwell in the dock.\n\n57\n00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:10.475\nIf I'm going to do that so it's an easier\nway for me to start the application.\n\n58\n00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:15.035\nSo why don't we open a file?\n\n59\n00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:19.065\nI have a file that we're going to\nwork in called Welcome to Word.\n\n60\n00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.860\nAnd so I will go to open down here.\n\n61\n00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.920\nI know that this is on my Maps,\nI will click there.\n\n62\n00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.100\nBrings me out to my other dialog box.\n\n63\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.130\nI also know it's on my desktop and\n\n64\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.350\nin this folder called Word\n2016 Essentials for Mac Files.\n\n65\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.720\nAnd I have it way down there,\nWelcome to Word Docx and\n\n66\n00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.550\nlet's go ahead and open that.\n\n67\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.080\nGives us a starting point to\ngo through this interface.\n\n68\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.230\nWe've already identified some of\nthese in the other episode, but\n\n69\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.750\nlet's just start at the top.\n\n70\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.960\nWelcome to Word, that is my title bar.\n\n71\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.160\nThe title bar lets you know that this\nis a title of the file, we have that.\n\n72\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.640\nWe have some other things that\nwe'll be going over as well, but\n\n73\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.620\nI wanted to start there.\n\n74\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.170\nWe also talked about the menu bar.\n\n75\n00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.410\nLove that Office for\nMacs still has that, so\n\n76\n00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.660\na lot of our different\nfunctions are in here.\n\n77\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.480\nFor example, if I went to the Insert menu,\nthe menu has things like Pictures,\n\n78\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.670\nChart, Movie, Hyperlink,\nall of those different things.\n\n79\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.120\nIf you are a menu person,\n\n80\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.640\nyou are more than welcome to go\nto these to find the commands.\n\n81\n00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.760\nI will probably, most of the time,\n\n82\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.600\ngo to what is known as the ribbon,\nthe ribbon is right here.\n\n83\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.340\nWhere it has these different\ntabs across the ribbon,\n\n84\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.720\nto where I could go to the insert tab,\nsingle click.\n\n85\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.250\nAnd it brings up all of the same\ncommands that I had in my insert menu.\n\n86\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.630\nIt's personal preference,\nI just might not go to the menu as much.\n\n87\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.800\nBecause I've kind of been conditioned\n\n88\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.830\nto use the ribbon because in Windows,\nwe don't have that.\n\n89\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.294\nSo I'm kind of I'm kind of there, but\n\n90\n00:05:06.294 --> 00:05:11.146\nI did want to point out that you do have\nall these options available for you.\n\n91\n00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:16.562\nWhile I'm on the menu, I'll jump\nback to the ribbon in a second but\n\n92\n00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:23.746\nthe Word menu, the word, word, right here,\nthis is where you find your preferences.\n\n93\n00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:26.888\nLike I said in the last episode,\nif you're really familiar with Mac,\n\n94\n00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:28.660\nlike gosh I know all of these things.\n\n95\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.150\nI am going to constantly be\ncomparing this to Windows, because\n\n96\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.840\nif you’re like me that work on both,\nit’s really good to know the differences.\n\n97\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.990\nSo you don’t get kinda tripped up on that.\n\n98\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.180\nAnd maybe you’re new to Mac that\nwhy I’m going over that there too.\n\n99\n00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.342\nSo if you go to the preferences,\nthe preferences aren't nearly as in\n\n100\n00:05:51.342 --> 00:05:56.380\ndepth as the Windows version of Word.\n\n101\n00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.600\nSo just let's you know that we'll\nbe going through these here and\n\n102\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.500\nthere as we go through our different\nepisodes as like why we need to go to it.\n\n103\n00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.200\nWe'll actually be coming back\nhere in just a little bit\n\n104\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.450\nwhen we'll talk about the ribbon.\n\n105\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.570\nBack to the ribbon and the tabs,\nnotice that if I single click,\n\n106\n00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.190\nI keep emphasizing that.\n\n107\n00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.550\nWhy do you keep saying that Vonne?\n\n108\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.760\nWell I'll tell you a in a minute.\n\n109\n00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.490\nSo if I wanted to go to the review tab\non the ribbon, I single click on it and\n\n110\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.970\nthen it gives me the different options.\n\n111\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.510\nHow much you see on the ribbon is going\nto depend on your screen resolution or\n\n112\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.650\nwhat I like to call the real estate.\n\n113\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.030\nI have a low resolutions, so you might\nactually see more buttons than I see.\n\n114\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.430\nAnd if I change this and I size this down,\n\n115\n00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.350\nyou see how then my options\nof how many buttons.\n\n116\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.770\nAnd they kinda group\nthemselves together with\n\n117\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.380\nthese little drop downs to show\nmore commands that are in there.\n\n118\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.570\nSo do be aware that it is resolution\ndependent and real estate dependent\n\n119\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.850\non how much space, or\nthings you're going to be seeing on that.\n\n120\n00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.100\nYou also might not see and\nAcrobat tab on there,\n\n121\n00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.020\nthat's because I have,\nAcrobat Professional, not the reader.\n\n122\n00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.730\nI have the full program installed and\nthat why I have that.\n\n123\n00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.370\nIt might be there, it might not.\n\n124\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.240\nI honestly can't remember\nbecause it's very,\n\n125\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.980\nvery rare that I don't both have The\nOffice, and the Creator Suite installed.\n\n126\n00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.400\nSo it's been a long time and\nit's always there for me, so\n\n127\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.610\njust incase, I don't remember\nif you're gonna see that or not.\n\n128\n00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.800\nAll right the other thing\nthat we have on our ribbon,\n\n129\n00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.720\nlet's go back over here to this Home tab.\n\n130\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.700\nThis is were we're gonna be doing a lot of\ndifferent things like formatting our text,\n\n131\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.820\nour font, we'll be doing our,\nparagraph formatting.\n\n132\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.390\nThis is one of those kinda\ncomfort things for me.\n\n133\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.720\nI'm used to seeing group names down here,\nbecause this is a group.\n\n134\n00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.710\nIt's kinda hard to see, but\n\n135\n00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.500\nthere's like a tiny little line right\nhere that is, well, grouping them.\n\n136\n00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.348\nAnd so this is the font group and\nthis is the paragraph group.\n\n137\n00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:05.810\nThey are not on by default in Mac for\nWindows or\n\n138\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.575\nMac for Windows [LAUGH] Office for Mac.\n\n139\n00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:13.431\nBut if you go over to your Preferences\nagain, go to Word &gt; Preferences, and\n\n140\n00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.136\nI always forget where this is at.\n\n141\n00:08:15.136 --> 00:08:21.270\nIt's in the View, down here, do you\nsee where it says, Show group titles.\n\n142\n00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.280\nIf I check that on and then close out\nof my preferences, there they are.\n\n143\n00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.820\nThere's font and paragraph and styles, and\nall the things that I'm used to seeing.\n\n144\n00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.003\nI like them,\nit's not the biggest thing in the world.\n\n145\n00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:36.090\nIt's like all right,\nI'll know where the buttons are.\n\n146\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.230\nBut just in case people are referring\nto them by their group name and\n\n147\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.370\nyou don't see it, turn that on.\n\n148\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.730\nThere are going to be some commands,\n\n149\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.790\ncuz on the ribbon that's where we have our\ncommands that are grayed out for example.\n\n150\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.025\nNotice here on my layout and\nI'm just randomly choosing one.\n\n151\n00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:55.100\nAnd it's like position,\nwrap text why are those all grayed out?\n\n152\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.770\nWell they're not available to you now.\n\n153\n00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.310\nIt could be that you have to\nhave something selected, or\n\n154\n00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.190\nyou have to on something specific for\nthose particular commands to come up.\n\n155\n00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.580\nSo don't get kind of like\nthose are never available.\n\n156\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.790\nIt's really just at where you are at\nthat particular point in time.\n\n157\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.130\nSo let's go across some other ones.\n\n158\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.340\nContextual tabs,\ncontextual tabs is a big one.\n\n159\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.790\nNotice we have these ones on by default,\nInsert, Design, Layout, References.\n\n160\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.700\nAnd you go through and find\nthe different commands that are on here.\n\n161\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.930\nBut if I come down here to this picture\nof this cute little rabbit over here.\n\n162\n00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.275\nAnd I select it, notice that I get\na whole tab that is available to me\n\n163\n00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:40.665\nthat is not normally available,\nthat is that contextual tab.\n\n164\n00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:47.100\nIt only come up or are available to you\nin the context of what you have selected.\n\n165\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.580\nSo if I select on the Picture Format tab,\n\n166\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.580\nI have some other options that\nare specifically related to pictures.\n\n167\n00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.670\nYou click off of your photograph,\nif click somewhere in a basic paragraph.\n\n168\n00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.171\nNotice that that particular tab goes away,\nso\n\n169\n00:10:03.171 --> 00:10:06.685\nthere's a bunch of those\nthat do live in Word.\n\n170\n00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:09.890\nYou're just not gonna\nsee them all the time.\n\n171\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.790\nAnother thing in the ribbon that is\na little different in Mac versus Windows.\n\n172\n00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.270\nIn Windows, you have a little\nbutton down here in the bottom\n\n173\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.750\nright hand corner of your groups.\n\n174\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.218\nThey're called the dialog\nbox launcher button.\n\n175\n00:10:25.218 --> 00:10:28.228\n[LAUGH] That's a good [LAUGH] I know,\nJustin just went, what?\n\n176\n00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:32.850\n&gt;&gt; That is a long,\na dialog box launcher button.\n\n177\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.354\nProbably could of made up and\nacronym for that-\n\n178\n00:10:34.354 --> 00:10:34.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:10:34.955 --> 00:10:37.040\n&gt;&gt; But we'll go with it I guess.\n\n180\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.820\n&gt;&gt; I always call it the more button,\ncuz it gives you more options.\n\n181\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.500\nWell because in the Office Mac,\n\n182\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.048\nyou have all of the menus,\nthey just don't have that.\n\n183\n00:10:46.048 --> 00:10:51.490\nSo in case you're looking for it, It\ndoesn't exist in this particular version.\n\n184\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:56.190\nNow with this ribbon,\nwhy did you keep saying single-click?\n\n185\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:02.650\nBecause if you double-click on it what it\ndoes is it actually collapses the ribbon.\n\n186\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.937\nIt's like a little short cut, and\nif you wanna bring it back up, sorry,\n\n187\n00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:08.634\nlet me finish that thought.\n\n188\n00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:11.970\nIf you single-click it again, notice\nthat it goes ahead and expands it out.\n\n189\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:19.529\nIf I single-click on say layout, then\nsingle-click it again, collapse it, okay?\n\n190\n00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:24.395\nSo just know this, it doesn't have to\nbe a full double-click in succession.\n\n191\n00:11:24.395 --> 00:11:27.092\nYou can do a single-click,\nthen single-click again and\n\n192\n00:11:27.092 --> 00:11:28.529\nit collapses the ribbon down.\n\n193\n00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:29.884\nSome people might like this,\n\n194\n00:11:29.884 --> 00:11:32.955\ncuz it kinda gives you a little\nbit more room to work with.\n\n195\n00:11:32.955 --> 00:11:35.995\nI tend to always want to have\nthe ribbon fully expanded,\n\n196\n00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.365\nso I just remember not to do that.\n\n197\n00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:41.440\nYou also have over here on the very\nright hand corner, it's kind of small.\n\n198\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.089\nBut it says expand ribbon, if you click\nthat that's another way that you can go\n\n199\n00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:50.420\nback to collapse the ribbon and\nexpand it back out if you need to do this.\n\n200\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.748\nDouble-clicking or\nslow double-clicking, we'll call it or\n\n201\n00:11:53.748 --> 00:11:57.100\nthe button over there\nto collapse the ribbon.\n\n202\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.259\nLet's move on over here to these\nlittle buttons at the top.\n\n203\n00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:04.700\nThis is your Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n204\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:11.540\nIt allows you to quickly access tools\non a bar, [LAUGH] exactly like it says.\n\n205\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.160\nMeaning if you're on your ribbon like\nif I wanted to insert a picture,\n\n206\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.110\nI'd have to go over to my Insert tab,\ncome over here to picture.\n\n207\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.870\nAnd then which one do I want?\n\n208\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.180\nIf I need to change the layout,\nI have to go over to the Layout.\n\n209\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.190\nNotice that it just changes\ndepending on what tab I'm on.\n\n210\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.398\nThe Quick Access Toolbar never changes.\n\n211\n00:12:30.398 --> 00:12:34.300\nSo those are always at stationary,\nthey stay there.\n\n212\n00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.740\nSo you can think that it's easier to click\nthis one little button, than to kinda\n\n213\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.630\nclick through your ribbons and all your\ntabs to get to the specific commands.\n\n214\n00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.910\nSo that's why they call it that.\n\n215\n00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.776\nNotice there is a drop down\nover to the right hand side,\n\n216\n00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:50.407\nwhere you can customize\nthe Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n217\n00:12:50.407 --> 00:12:53.200\nI don't know about you, but\nI'm a big fan of spell check,\n\n218\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.750\ncuz I'm horrible at spelling.\n\n219\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.480\n[LAUGH] I can add the spelling and\ngrammar, the ABC with the check,\n\n220\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.840\nright there.\n\n221\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.020\nThese are your more popular\ncommands that you could\n\n222\n00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.580\nadd onto that particular\nQuick Access Toolbar.\n\n223\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.180\nThere might be some other things like\nInsert picture, I'm always doing that.\n\n224\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.000\nSo I need to be able to add that\nto the Quick Access Toolbar, so\n\n225\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.780\nI don't have to keep going to the ribbon.\n\n226\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.197\nDrop that down hm yep more commands,\nyou guessed it.\n\n227\n00:13:21.197 --> 00:13:23.821\nThat you take you out\ninto your preferences,\n\n228\n00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:27.563\nyou could've gotten here through\nthe preferences dialog box.\n\n229\n00:13:27.563 --> 00:13:31.964\nAnd I can change what do I want to\ncustomize the Quick Access Toolbar?\n\n230\n00:13:31.964 --> 00:13:36.606\nThe thing you have to remember is\nyou have to find it on the left\n\n231\n00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:40.980\nhand side to add it over\nto the right hand side.\n\n232\n00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.310\nSo you have to remember, what's the thing\nthat I wanna add, and where does it live?\n\n233\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.620\nI said Insert picture, right?\n\n234\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.460\nThat might be a popular command.\n\n235\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.430\nIt's not popular, I don't know,\nI don't know its status.\n\n236\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.840\nI do know that it is on the Insert Tab.\n\n237\n00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.325\nSo try to find what tab it is on first.\n\n238\n00:13:58.325 --> 00:14:00.820\nThat's something you've got to\nremember before you get here.\n\n239\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.100\nOr if you can't remember,\nit always has the All Commands and\n\n240\n00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.310\nit will be in alphabetical order.\n\n241\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.230\nThere's a lot, so I'm gonna limit\nmy search back over to the Insert.\n\n242\n00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:16.120\nAnd then if I go down through and\nI can find, there's Insert Picture,\n\n243\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.800\nthat's what I want.\n\n244\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.770\nFind the command, single-click on\nthe arrow or double-click on it and\n\n245\n00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.330\nit will pop itself over into here.\n\n246\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.290\nYou can also add and subtract here.\n\n247\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.400\nYou can also I believe, yep,\nyou can drag and drop them,\n\n248\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.560\nif you wanted to change the order in how\nthey show up across from left to right.\n\n249\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.380\nAnd sometimes, and you can customize\nthis until the cows come in.\n\n250\n00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.160\nYou can have it all the way across, but\n\n251\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.837\nmaybe I've done a little too\nmuch customizing, right?\n\n252\n00:14:43.837 --> 00:14:46.510\nCan I go back to wear I started?\n\n253\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.817\nI had to do this a lot when I'm teaching\nthe products cuz I customized it, but\n\n254\n00:14:49.817 --> 00:14:51.385\nI wanna show you as a clean install.\n\n255\n00:14:51.385 --> 00:14:57.157\nThat little gear command looking guy,\nI can reset my customizations.\n\n256\n00:14:57.157 --> 00:15:03.274\nNotice it says only or all you can\ncustomize the ribbon, which is up here.\n\n257\n00:15:03.274 --> 00:15:05.726\nI wanna save that maybe for\nan extra episode,\n\n258\n00:15:05.726 --> 00:15:09.804\nbecause it just gets a little bit too\nmuch at this particular point in time.\n\n259\n00:15:09.804 --> 00:15:15.245\nBut that’s why it has those two options\nthere for you with the customizations.\n\n260\n00:15:15.245 --> 00:15:17.960\nI like everything that’s right here,\nso I’m gonna click Save.\n\n261\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.210\nAnd then notice,\nI'm here in my Word Preferences, so\n\n262\n00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.390\nI can close out of my Preferences.\n\n263\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.061\nAnd then you can move on along,\n\n264\n00:15:25.061 --> 00:15:28.096\ncuz now you've customized\nthat Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n265\n00:15:28.096 --> 00:15:30.746\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, you said that we\ncan do these customizations and\n\n266\n00:15:30.746 --> 00:15:31.912\nwe can go crazy with them.\n\n267\n00:15:31.912 --> 00:15:33.778\nDo you have any rules of thumb for\n\n268\n00:15:33.778 --> 00:15:37.440\nthis Quick Access Toolbar\nabout limitations before it?\n\n269\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.741\nThis kinda becomes unruly,\nin your experience.\n\n270\n00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:44.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm always customizing it as I go.\n\n271\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.680\nBecause there are some times,\nI know one project,\n\n272\n00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.190\nI was always inserting a screenshot.\n\n273\n00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.020\nSo I would add that on and\n\n274\n00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.090\nthen I moved on to a project\nwhere I really don't it any more.\n\n275\n00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.214\nSo I go ahead and just take it off.\n\n276\n00:15:56.214 --> 00:15:59.238\nI don't if there's any,\nI'm sure there is, but\n\n277\n00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:03.565\nspecific limitations like you can\nonly have 256 commands on there.\n\n278\n00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:07.913\nI don't know that threshold, I would\njust say if it starts to get a little\n\n279\n00:16:07.913 --> 00:16:11.950\ntoo cluttered for your own brain\nthen maybe chill out a little bit,\n\n280\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:12.640\n&gt;&gt; I like this for\n\n281\n00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.250\nsome reason I was thinking of Bob Ross and\nhis painting, his palette.\n\n282\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.950\nSo, essentially use\nthe Quick Access Toolbar as a palette for\n\n283\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.670\na particular set of projects.\n\n284\n00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nyou can make all your happy little trees,\n\n285\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.030\ndefinitely, so\nI really think it's personal preference.\n\n286\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.170\nAll right, so where are we going next?\n\n287\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.560\nLet's go down, in the sense of\nwhat we are looking at here.\n\n288\n00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.200\nWe've been kind of\nconcentrating up in this area,\n\n289\n00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.752\nlet's go down here to the status bar.\n\n290\n00:16:40.752 --> 00:16:42.810\nI'm gonna make my Window\na little smaller so\n\n291\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.220\nyou can see this a little better,\nthis whole bar across the bottom.\n\n292\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.610\nMaybe I'll make it a little smaller so you\ncan see almost everything that I've got.\n\n293\n00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.480\nIt has, well,\nthe status of what you're looking at.\n\n294\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.950\nRight now,\nI know that there are seven pages,why?\n\n295\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.680\nIt says, right there, page 1 of 7.\n\n296\n00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.390\nHow many words the different types\nof options that I have here?\n\n297\n00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.910\nThere's no proofing errors\nbecause I was like,\n\n298\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.950\nI didn't actually realize what that\nicon was, so guess what I did?\n\n299\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.506\nI hovered to discover and\n\n300\n00:17:10.506 --> 00:17:14.220\ngot my little tool tip to let\nme know what's going on there.\n\n301\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.897\nSo you got the status of your document,\nthen if you move over,\n\n302\n00:17:17.897 --> 00:17:23.060\nsome of these little buttons down here,\nthese are your views, your document views.\n\n303\n00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.940\nI have a whole episode just concentrating\non that because this can get a little,\n\n304\n00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.010\nlike, what is it look like.\n\n305\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:29.620\nWhere am I?\n\n306\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.880\nHow do I get out of this?\n\n307\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.870\nBut those are your buttons that correlate\nwith your View tab on the ribbon,\n\n308\n00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.340\nand your View menu, oops,\nthat's one, the View menu.\n\n309\n00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.190\nSo different ways that you're\nactually seeing your document which\n\n310\n00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.680\nis in Print Layout by default.\n\n311\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.520\nYou then have your zooms over here\nto the right, zoom it, ooh, hello.\n\n312\n00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.400\nOkay, [LAUGH] zoom out.\n\n313\n00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.280\nThat's kinda nice, and then it has\nthe percentage of zoom that you're in so\n\n314\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.050\nyou can kinda see things closer or\nfarther away.\n\n315\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.570\nAnd again, more options on that View tab.\n\n316\n00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.240\nThat whole thing like I\nsaid is the status bar.\n\n317\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.510\nSome other things that we have\nin our interface that are just\n\n318\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.060\nkind of the lingering things.\n\n319\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.740\nBack up at the top search in document,\n\n320\n00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.990\nthis is something specific to Office for\nMac.\n\n321\n00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:22.550\nYou have that find or you can search\nthe document for say the word rabbit.\n\n322\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.110\nAnd then, I find it,\nyou notice it goes ahead and highlights.\n\n323\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:30.060\nWe have more on find and replace and what\nthat does but just know that is up there.\n\n324\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.980\nYou have these little buttons over\nhere to where if you wanna give\n\n325\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.230\nMicrosoft some feedback.\n\n326\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.180\nIt will open us up, I'll show you\nwhat it looks like, it just says,\n\n327\n00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.110\nwell tell me what you like.\n\n328\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.410\nAnd then, you go ahead and send the\nfeedback, I don't need that right now, but\n\n329\n00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.360\nthat's what that smiley face means.\n\n330\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.410\nIt's giving more information\nback to Microsoft.\n\n331\n00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.310\nYou can also go ahead and share documents\nright here by this little button,\n\n332\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.440\nthere's multiple ways but\nthat's what that means.\n\n333\n00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.830\nAnd then lastly,\nI would like to end on the Help menu.\n\n334\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.041\nThe Help menu, it's helpful sometimes,\n\n335\n00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:06.421\n[LAUGH] Justin's making a face as well,\nit's like [NOISE].\n\n336\n00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:12.452\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look like there's a lot\ngoing on in that Help menu,it's helpful,\n\n337\n00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:13.100\nmaybe.\n\n338\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.340\nThere's like three options, and\n\n339\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.970\nI'm not sure what to do with it,\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n340\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.460\nyou do have to type something in.\n\n341\n00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.060\nSo if I was looking for\nHelp with shortcuts, right?\n\n342\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.280\nAnd notice that it's gonna give\nme some topics that it thinks\n\n343\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.110\nit would like to give me by me\ntyping in the word shortcuts.\n\n344\n00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.150\nMaybe type something in, nothing pops\nup but, that's not very helpful.\n\n345\n00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.730\nBut for now, we'll click on here and\nit does go out to the Internet.\n\n346\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:44.670\nSo I can't remember if they have a locally\ninstalled version of the help files,\n\n347\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.290\nI think it's always connect to\nthe Internet, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n348\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.770\nNotice mine took a little bit of time,\nbecause then I realized,\n\n349\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.460\nI'm like, gosh, is my WiFi on?\n\n350\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.451\n&gt;&gt; I'm not 100% sure, but\n\n351\n00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:56.260\nthat's actually a very common\noccurrence with newer applications.\n\n352\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.570\nNumber one speed to update, if there's\na typo or some kind of error, or\n\n353\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.710\nif they've had to change something.\n\n354\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.360\nIt needs to be updated, so a lot of times\ndocumentation is hosted online now.\n\n355\n00:20:07.698 --> 00:20:11.899\nAnd as that you may get a pared down\nversion locally for like Core features,\n\n356\n00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:16.350\nyou're not always gonna get the show\nme everything type of documentation.\n\n357\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n358\n00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:23.350\nif I click on keyboard shortcuts here this\nis just what it looks like on the website.\n\n359\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.940\nI just like to go through\nthe web interface,\n\n360\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:33.230\nI think it's support.microsoft.com or just\ntype in Word Help and it brings it up.\n\n361\n00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.840\nI give a lot of those shortcuts or\nthe URLs in the show notes.\n\n362\n00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.190\nActually, let me look over here,\nit's support.office.com.\n\n363\n00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.800\nI've seen it so\n\n364\n00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.610\nmany times, but that's what you've\ngot going on here with your Help.\n\n365\n00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.661\nThe only other thing in you Help\nmenu is that you can go through\n\n366\n00:20:50.661 --> 00:20:53.260\nlet me now cancel out of the searching.\n\n367\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.930\nYou do have the check for updates,\nwhich is always a good thing to do.\n\n368\n00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.630\nActually, I probably should do\nthat before we get much further.\n\n369\n00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.100\nI'm not gonna do it right here on camera.\n\n370\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.351\nBut just to make sure that I have the most\nrecent version of Word at the time\n\n371\n00:21:07.351 --> 00:21:11.689\nof this recording, of course we all\nknow the wonderful world of updates.\n\n372\n00:21:11.689 --> 00:21:16.053\nI talk a little bit about it in the\nintroduction video because it happens, and\n\n373\n00:21:16.053 --> 00:21:18.483\nyou might be watching this now and\nbe like.\n\n374\n00:21:18.483 --> 00:21:21.760\nHey, that's a different button that\nI have, it's probably an update.\n\n375\n00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.019\nThat's where you can find it and\nit brings up that Office update or\n\n376\n00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:27.163\nthey can get a little annoying sometimes.\n\n377\n00:21:27.163 --> 00:21:31.540\nCuz it's like do you wanna make\na search every week, every month.\n\n378\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.630\nAnd it's different in Mac\nthan it is in Windows.\n\n379\n00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.500\nBut I at least want to show you where\nit's at, so you know where to go.\n\n380\n00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.350\nIt's always just keep updated,\nI think I set mine to every month.\n\n381\n00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.560\n&gt;&gt; And\neven though it may be a little annoying,\n\n382\n00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.850\na lot of those are security patches.\n\n383\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.810\nAnd maybe it's not even necessarily\na thing that had become a security\n\n384\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:51.760\nvulnerability.\n\n385\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.450\nThey've just become aware of hey,\n\n386\n00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.890\nthis is a possible vector of attack or\nexploitation.\n\n387\n00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.950\nLet's go ahead and\nfix that, again, annoying\n\n388\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.430\nI can deal with as long as they're doing\ntheir due diligence to maintain those.\n\n389\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.370\nOne quick question for you Vonne.\n\n390\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.610\nThat share button, do I have to be\nsigned in under a particular user name?\n\n391\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.910\nLike I think you're signed in as JT,\nin order to use that share button?\n\n392\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.390\nOr am I getting ahead of\nourselves a little bit?\n\n393\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.405\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, I don't remember,\n\n394\n00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:25.330\nI'm going to default to yes,\nwith a question mark?\n\n395\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.798\n&gt;&gt; The upward inflection,\nI gotcha, I gotcha.\n\n396\n00:22:27.798 --> 00:22:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Well luckily, when we do\na whole episode on sharing files,\n\n397\n00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.420\nand I believe the advance expert,\none or the other shows.\n\n398\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.450\nIt will give me enough time to prep and\nremind myself whether or\n\n399\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.000\nnot we have to be signed in or not.\n\n400\n00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.316\nBut I guess the one thing is you click it,\nand doesn't work,\n\n401\n00:22:45.316 --> 00:22:49.294\nthen I would consult the oracle remind\nmyself of how to actually do that.\n\n402\n00:22:49.294 --> 00:22:52.622\nI wanna say you do, but I could be wrong.\n\n403\n00:22:52.622 --> 00:22:56.274\n&gt;&gt; And that would make sense,I just didn't\nknow if it was maybe giving you an option.\n\n404\n00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:59.696\nOr, you can just download or,\nnot download,\n\n405\n00:22:59.696 --> 00:23:03.130\nbut kind of package it up or\nsomething like that.\n\n406\n00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.900\nOr if it just says, hey, you probably\nshould just go save an email on this.\n\n407\n00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.870\n&gt;&gt; If I remember correctly, and you kind\nof caught me there, I was like gosh,\n\n408\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.660\nwhat should I do?\n\n409\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.880\nI think you can just send it through\nyour email but in that sense,\n\n410\n00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.145\nyou've gotta be signed in too.\n\n411\n00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:20.020\nBecause I was just gonna send\nyou a link to this instead of me\n\n412\n00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.140\nlogging in to my Gmail and\nthen just attaching the file.\n\n413\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:28.830\nThere's always a way of sharing documents\nthat might be a little easier or\n\n414\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.900\nmore like in your workflow.\n\n415\n00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.400\nRather than being connected all through\nlike it's gonna pop up Outlook, and\n\n416\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.170\nthen it's gonna go ahead and\nuse the attachment.\n\n417\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.940\nDo a shareable link to\nyour OneDrive account.\n\n418\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.280\nIn that sense, yes,\nyou do need to be signed in for that.\n\n419\n00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.210\nSo I think it's really\nthe level of sharing\n\n420\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.987\ncompatibility that you wanna have,\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n421\n00:23:48.987 --> 00:23:53.650\nour sharing expectations are definitely\nsomething that we should be aware of.\n\n422\n00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.450\nNow, Vonne, it does look like\nwe're getting near the end, but\n\n423\n00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.540\nyou have any final parting\nwords of wisdom for us?\n\n424\n00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.545\n&gt;&gt; I have one, only because I\ndid consult my notes over here.\n\n425\n00:24:02.545 --> 00:24:05.950\nAd I was like, wait, there was one small\nlittle thing that I did wanna mention\n\n426\n00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:11.650\nabout the quick access toolbar\nin Microsoft for Windows.\n\n427\n00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:16.270\nYou can use the Quick Access Toolbar\nto show below the ribbon,\n\n428\n00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.990\nyou can't do that in Office for Mac.\n\n429\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.716\nIt just doesn't give you an option\nof show below the ribbon and\n\n430\n00:24:21.716 --> 00:24:25.200\nthat's kind of a personal preference\nof mine, I like the quick access.\n\n431\n00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.720\nLet me just jump down into my\ncomputer really quick to give\n\n432\n00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.190\nyou a visual of what I'm talking about.\n\n433\n00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.440\nThis guy right up here,\nit's always gonna stay up there.\n\n434\n00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.720\nThere's no option that says show below,\ncuz I like it right here,\n\n435\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.540\nbecause it's not as far to go up into.\n\n436\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.810\nSo just a little personal preference,\nslight pet peeve of mine.\n\n437\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.901\n&gt;&gt; So it's actually quick to get to,\ninstead of having to traverse over\n\n438\n00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:50.850\nall of the other buttons that could have\npossibly given you the same functionality.\n\n439\n00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:51.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n440\n00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:56.530\nSo if you're looking for that, if you're\nbilingual like me, it doesn't exist,\n\n441\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:01.630\nso I just wanted to save you\nsome agony trying to find it.\n\n442\n00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.902\n&gt;&gt; Those are definitely topics that we\nmay spend a bunch of time searching\n\n443\n00:25:04.902 --> 00:25:08.409\nthe Interwebs to see if we can do things,\nonly to find out, no, we can't.\n\n444\n00:25:08.409 --> 00:25:11.977\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much, Vonne, for\ntaking us on that tour of the Word,\n\n445\n00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:12.630\ninterface.\n\n446\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.470\nAnd there are some differences\nthat are crop up in Mac OS,\n\n447\n00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.060\nas we've just talked about,\nthen what happens in Windows?\n\n448\n00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.190\nSo thanks for bringing us,\nbringing those to our attention.\n\n449\n00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.397\nBut it does look like we're gonna\nfinish this one up, so signing off for\n\n450\n00:25:26.397 --> 00:25:27.098\nOfficeProTV.\n\n451\n00:25:27.098 --> 00:25:28.900\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n452\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n453\n00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.869\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n454\n00:25:31.869 --> 00:25:37.230\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

zoom part, silly me.\n\n7\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.750\nThe views kinda catches my eye and, well,\n\n8\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.280\nif it was up to me,\nthe show would be over.\n\n9\n00:00:36.280

--> 00:00:43.090\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.370\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, other than\ntripping over my worries there for\n\n14\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.680\na little bit but I got it squared away,\nand I'm kinda interested in because\n\n15\n00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.350\nthis is one those things where I think\nI know a little bit about Word, or\n\n16\n00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.000\nthe Microsoft products, and\nthen you teach me so much more.\n\n17\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and this is one of those,\nI wanted to make this it's own episode,\n\n18\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.880\nbecause like, okay, here, these\nare these buttons, this is what they do.\n\n19\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.380\nAnd that's fine,\n\n20\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.800\nbut I feel people get into them and\ndon't really know where they got to.\n\n21\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.530\n[LAUGH] Like,\nI don't know how to get out of this.\n\n22\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.540\nSo that's why I wanted to dedicate\na whole episode about this.\n\n23\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.670\nIt's one of those basics that\na lot of people overlook and\n\n24\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.930\nthat's why I like to shed the light on it,\nexpand your horizons,\n\n25\n00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.810\nshow you the view of document views.\n\n26\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.445\nYes, and of course, you have to do the\nhand motion just like that, right there.\n\n27\n00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:37.330\n[LAUGH] So I have everything\nready to go on my computer.\n\n28\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.800\nSo why don't I just go ahead and\njump on down and get started.\n\n29\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.000\nJust taking another route, if you want to\nsay, to how I can open up the file because\n\n30\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.730\nwe've talked about doing a file open, and\nso and so, for then going to my computer.\n\n31\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.870\nAnd you can always open a file right from\nwhatever folder you have the files in.\n\n32\n00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.520\nSo I've got my Finder opened up\non my Word 2016 Essentials for\n\n33\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.020\nMac files, and we are gonna go to file for\nDocument Views and Navigation,\n\n34\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.310\nyou can see today is\nthe day I modified it.\n\n35\n00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.870\nI have that in list view because\nI was doing, the key chain.\n\n36\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.335\nNo, you need to go away.\n\n37\n00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:16.260\n[LAUGH] That thing always bothers me.\n\n38\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.000\nAnd, I always have to go and\n\n39\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.020\nlook it up on how to like to get\nrid of it in the preferences.\n\n40\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.370\nIt's this weird Mac thing\nthat still kinda gets me.\n\n41\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm gonna be honest with you about it.\n\n42\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.530\nI don't use it a whole bunch, but-\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n43\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.220\n&gt;&gt; But when it's there,\nit can cause you a lot of problems.\n\n44\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.558\nActually, I use some services that it will\nnever prompt me for the password again.\n\n45\n00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:36.831\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; And I'm like, but\n\n46\n00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:38.303\nI typed in the wrong password.\n\n47\n00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:42.260\nSo then I gotta go look up how to change\nthe password inside of the keychain.\n\n48\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.780\nI actually do a lot of times\nwhat you just, cancel.\n\n49\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.300\nI don't know what happened,\nI was just looking around, going with it.\n\n50\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Or when you get in that keychain loop.\n\n51\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.620\nIf you're a Mac user,\nyou know what we're talking about.\n\n52\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.500\nIt's like, I can't cancel this,\nI can't stop.\n\n53\n00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.180\nSo, yeah.\nBut luckily, I was hoping,\n\n54\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.110\nI'm like, please don't go in a loop,\nbut we're good.\n\n55\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.390\nWe're all good here.\n\n56\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.030\nOkay, so I have this file open.\n\n57\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.170\nThere was a few things that I have left\non here from when I was working and\n\n58\n00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.930\nprepping my episodes for everything.\n\n59\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.290\nI have what's known as a show and\nhide characters on, so that's\n\n60\n00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.050\nwhy you have like, I don't know what\nthose little blue things are over there.\n\n61\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.030\nI've got the button on.\n\n62\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.880\nI'm giving you some foreshadowing from\nwhen we are actually going to use this.\n\n63\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.220\nI love this thing.\n\n64\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.810\nI have it on pretty much all the time.\n\n65\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.130\nBut I'm going to turn it off and\nhide the non-printing characters,\n\n66\n00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.290\nany time you hit Enter,\nSpace, Tab, all that stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.600\nWe don't need to worry about\nthat in this particular episode.\n\n68\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.210\nI guess it is a view, if you want to\nsay so, yeah, maybe I meant to do that.\n\n69\n00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.235\nNo, I really did.\n\n70\n00:03:45.235 --> 00:03:48.460\n[LAUGH] All right,\nthe different places that we can get\n\n71\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.500\nour different document views\nare going to be in the view menu.\n\n72\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.740\nYou can see them up at the top.\n\n73\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.110\nThese top five options are the things\nthat we're going to be revealing and\n\n74\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.230\ndemonstrating, you could\nalso go to the View tab.\n\n75\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.590\nThere is the buttons over there\non the left, the other right.\n\n76\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.440\n[LAUGH] And then you also have over here,\ndown at the bottom,\n\n77\n00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.300\nthis will kind of make things smaller\nright there down on our status bar.\n\n78\n00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.040\nI'm gonna go ahead and close this to\nmake it a little easier for us to see.\n\n79\n00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.320\nThese buttons down at the bottom\ndo the exact same thing.\n\n80\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.900\nSo, pick your preference,\nwhichever way you wanna go.\n\n81\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.650\nI'll probably stay on the View tab, just\nto make it a little easier for myself.\n\n82\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.090\nPrint layout, that is the most common and\nthe default view\n\n83\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.865\nif you start any document and pretty\nmuch open a lot of your files, as well.\n\n84\n00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:45.840\nWe'll stay in that print layout view.\n\n85\n00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.610\nWhat that means is that you're looking at,\nwell, like a piece of paper.\n\n86\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.270\nYou can see the margins around your text.\n\n87\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.650\nThe margins are the white space on\nthe tops and bottoms, and lefts and\n\n88\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.110\nrights of your pages.\n\n89\n00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.710\nAnd so you see all of that.\n\n90\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.320\nAnd kinda like a piece of\npaper on your physical desk,\n\n91\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.110\nyou see it if I scroll down, we'll talk\na lot about navigating in another episode.\n\n92\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.600\nIf I scroll on down with my mouse,\nyou see the breaks,\n\n93\n00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.210\nthe physical white space, and\nthe gaps, if you want to say,\n\n94\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.240\nbetween each page that you are looking at.\n\n95\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.140\nVery, very common.\n\n96\n00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.510\nMost common in the default view of Word.\n\n97\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.950\nThat's a print layout, cool.\n\n98\n00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.930\nWe'll be doing pretty much\neverything in print layout.\n\n99\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.740\nBut there are a few other\nviews that we will go to and\n\n100\n00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.510\nI actually use from time to time,\nthat we want to focus on.\n\n101\n00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.280\nThe one that I, I'll go over the ones\nI use the least, I guess, first,\n\n102\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.340\nthen we'll end on the one\nthat I use the most.\n\n103\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.760\nThe web layout view.\n\n104\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.190\nNow, the web layout view,\nif we click this button, all right.\n\n105\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.780\nWell what does it do?\n\n106\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.660\nIt makes it kinda look like a web page,\n\n107\n00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.200\nand Justin still over here making\nfunny faces and making me laugh.\n\n108\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.050\n&gt;&gt; But that is a, I would never use that.\n\n109\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.630\nI'm thinking back, I'm trying to go\nthrough my memories, I might have clicked\n\n110\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.400\non that once and just been so appalled at\nwhat happened that I was like, all right,\n\n111\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.930\nwe're just going to act\nlike that doesn't exist.\n\n112\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's also misleading\nabout a web layout, like,\n\n113\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.120\nyou're gonna use Word to make a webpage.\n\n114\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.080\nNo, don't do that, please don't do that,\nbecause that would be very, very bad.\n\n115\n00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.950\nI say that,\nnow you can save it as an HTML file.\n\n116\n00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.050\nYou can also export it, but again,\n\n117\n00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.240\nif you're gonna be serious about making\na webpage in HTML, you don't use Word.\n\n118\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.810\nIt adds a whole bunch of extra\nstuff you don't need to have.\n\n119\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.500\nBut what it does do, it's like a big\ncontinuous line of your paragraphs.\n\n120\n00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.450\nYou see if I go ahead and change the size\nof window, it's gonna go ahead and\n\n121\n00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.440\nwrap around.\n\n122\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.510\nWe don't really see\nthe margins necessarily.\n\n123\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.820\nAnd if I scroll down, its just one big\nweb page, there is no breaks in it.\n\n124\n00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.810\nJust like you would think\non a regular website but\n\n125\n00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.650\nthe content of the entire page.\n\n126\n00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.810\nSo, but that's what it does.\n\n127\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.830\nSo you could do it if you want, also\nnotice the picture went over to the left,\n\n128\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.010\nversus if I went to the Print Layout,\nbecause the picture's on the right.\n\n129\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.166\nBecause I actually have that with what's\nknown as Word Wrap and everything.\n\n130\n00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:19.822\n[SOUND] Okay, we're gonna just\npretend that didn't happen.\n\n131\n00:07:19.822 --> 00:07:23.644\n[NOISE] [LAUGH] But you can see that the\npicture is specifically over there cuz I\n\n132\n00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:26.142\nwanted it there and\nweb layout doesn't do that.\n\n133\n00:07:26.142 --> 00:07:29.530\nIt just says, you insert an image\nat this point, we don't want that.\n\n134\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.636\nAll right, so just go there if you want.\n\n135\n00:07:32.636 --> 00:07:37.780\nThe draft version,\nnow the draft version, its where you\n\n136\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.320\ncan see everything kind of big and\nyou still see the area\n\n137\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.020\nof where your text sits, of how it wraps\nonce it got to the end of the page.\n\n138\n00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.124\nBut it doesn't really show\nthe physical dimensions\n\n139\n00:07:53.124 --> 00:07:57.888\nof what looks like a page on your desk or\ndesktop.\n\n140\n00:07:57.888 --> 00:08:00.155\nYou can see somethings in here.\n\n141\n00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:02.557\nSee like there's this\ndotted line right here.\n\n142\n00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:07.440\nThat indicates a page break,\nmeaning it's an automatic.\n\n143\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.480\nIt's gotten down to the end of your 8 and\na half by 11 paper.\n\n144\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.450\nIt's making a new page,\nwhich is different than these.\n\n145\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.790\nSection breaks, I used this diagram\nspecifically because I did put manual\n\n146\n00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.750\nsection breaks in here that we'll\nlearn about later and what they are.\n\n147\n00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.262\nBut you can see them in draft view, so\n\n148\n00:08:27.262 --> 00:08:32.500\nyou also think about draft like it's\nlike my working, my first draft of my\n\n149\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.440\nnovel versus how it's going to look\nlike in its actual print layout.\n\n150\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.920\nSo maybe you can kinda\ncorrelate it that way.\n\n151\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.080\nBut it's just kind of like big and\nwhite and\n\n152\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.750\ndoesn't really show you physical pages.\n\n153\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.320\nOr dimensions that you're looking at.\n\n154\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.600\nSo that's what draft does.\n\n155\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne in that draft and\nyou said this.\n\n156\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.890\nMaybe I was trying to take in all of this.\n\n157\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.980\nWhat is the purpose of the ridiculous\namount of white space on\n\n158\n00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.700\nthe right hand side?\n\n159\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.520\nIs there anything that\nwe can use that for?\n\n160\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.280\nOr is it just like, well there it is.\n\n161\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.430\nLike a giant drafting table.\n\n162\n00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.420\nWhen you said draft view\nthat's what I thought of.\n\n163\n00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.390\nIs like the measurements and rules and\n\n164\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.688\nthings in a drafting table when\nyou're designing a physical piece.\n\n165\n00:09:09.688 --> 00:09:11.710\n&gt;&gt; I never thought of it, but\nyou know, we're gonna go with that,\n\n166\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.550\nbecause what is it and\nwhat can we do with it?\n\n167\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.550\nIt's just there, so.\n\n168\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.580\n[LAUGH] I don't have any real good answer\nbesides that's just what the draft view\n\n169\n00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.620\ndoes, it just kind of extends everything\nand doesn't give you that kind of\n\n170\n00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:31.100\nagain I keep saying like a physical\ndesktop of showing you the page itself.\n\n171\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.850\nYou don't know what the page dimensions or\nlike is it landscape versus portrait.\n\n172\n00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.980\nYou don't, kind of have that perspective,\n\n173\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.110\nif you want to say,\nas to where our boundaries are in draft.\n\n174\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.200\nIt's just,\nlet's just put text down on the page.\n\n175\n00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.605\nAnd get rid of all that other stuff so\nyou can just concentrate on the text.\n\n176\n00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:51.300\n[LAUGH] We'll go with that.\n\n177\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.480\nSounds good.\n\n178\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.510\nAll right, the other one we\nhave which is a Mac specific.\n\n179\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.252\nIt's called Focus.\n\n180\n00:09:58.252 --> 00:10:01.660\nTalking about like that physical\ndesktop that I keep mentioning.\n\n181\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.810\nI go over here when I\ngo to the focus mode,\n\n182\n00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.280\nit really kinda looks like we're just\nin full screen mode, doesn't it?\n\n183\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.720\nIt doesn't really do much\nanything different for us.\n\n184\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.310\nSo that's what focus can do.\n\n185\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.092\nNow I will show you, it kinda tripped me\nup, I'll tell you that right there Justin.\n\n186\n00:10:19.092 --> 00:10:22.770\nI was like, ooh, wait, I just wasn't\nexpecting something, and you know what?\n\n187\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.360\nGuess what.\nI just learned something\n\n188\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.710\non the fly right now.\n\n189\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.530\nBecause I was looking for this.\n\n190\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.220\nLet's go back over to the print layout.\n\n191\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.110\nNow let's go to focus.\n\n192\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.760\nAnd you say ooh.\n\n193\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.710\nThat's what I was expecting.\n\n194\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.620\nAnd then when it didn't do\nit I was kinda like why?\n\n195\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.070\nAnd I just kind of kept going.\n\n196\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.680\nRight?\n\n197\n00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.032\nBecause I was gonna come up into focus and\nnoticed that this background comes up and\n\n198\n00:10:46.032 --> 00:10:49.380\nI can change it to like\na mahogany desktop.\n\n199\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.240\nLike a texture.\n\n200\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.350\nI could go to blueprint.\n\n201\n00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.730\nSo I can change the background?\n\n202\n00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.780\nIf you want to say it?\n\n203\n00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.530\nAnd it also gives me a focus, it kind of\nmakes everything dark instead of light,\n\n204\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.850\nit auto-hides the ribbon.\n\n205\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.960\nSo it's allowing you\nto focus on your work?\n\n206\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.850\nAnd that's just something different,\nI realize that what I did when I left\n\n207\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.850\nthe focus, I had gone from\nfocus from draft, didn't I?\n\n208\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.110\nAnd when I went to draft, I went to focus,\n\n209\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.995\nI don't know if you all saw me, I was\nlike, why can't I click on the background?\n\n210\n00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:28.020\n[LAUGH] And it just kinda dawned on\nme of like wait a second, all right.\n\n211\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.230\nPrint Layout, and then focus.\n\n212\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:37.890\nThey actually, the views correlate into\nwhether I'm not, I'm in focus mode versus.\n\n213\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.170\nBut it's not really, necessarily a view,\nit's a mode of looking at it.\n\n214\n00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.210\nKind of like a baby full screen mode.\n\n215\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.015\n&gt;&gt; And this actually happens in some\nof the text editors that I use for\n\n216\n00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:49.290\nprogramming purposes.\n\n217\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.832\nThere's a non-distraction,\nor no distraction mode.\n\n218\n00:11:52.832 --> 00:11:56.140\nThat would do something very similar to\nthis where it says remove all toolbars,\n\n219\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.440\ngive me just the content explicitly.\n\n220\n00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.970\nHowever, kind of an interesting\nfeature of Word is there's other kind\n\n221\n00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:07.610\nof views that you can have things laid out\nwith before going into no distraction.\n\n222\n00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.880\nSo it's almost this is modifying\nthe interface of Word and\n\n223\n00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.170\nnot necessarily how your\ndocument is viewed.\n\n224\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.460\nPer se.\n\n225\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.560\nWe're splitting hairs there.\n\n226\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; But it's close.\n\n227\n00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.890\n&gt;&gt; But I think what you said is right on.\n\n228\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.180\nThis is a mode, not a view.\n\n229\n00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.740\nAnd we'll make that distinction, whether\nor not y'all want to be that technical.\n\n230\n00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.495\nBut I do like what you're just saying and\nit also is reminding me about\n\n231\n00:12:31.495 --> 00:12:34.915\nin all of your Adobe products if you hit\nthe tab key on your keyboard what it does,\n\n232\n00:12:34.915 --> 00:12:38.485\nit just removes all of the panels and\nthe toolbars.\n\n233\n00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:41.887\nSo you're just looking at this.\n\n234\n00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:43.277\nIt gives you the focus.\n\n235\n00:12:43.277 --> 00:12:51.979\nSo this is all coming into focus for\nme quite nicely, so, I know.\n\n236\n00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:52.491\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:54.147\n&gt;&gt; So that we've got with focus.\n\n238\n00:12:54.147 --> 00:12:55.677\nThose are our different document views.\n\n239\n00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:59.087\nLike I said, you could go to the menu,\nyou could also go to the buttons.\n\n240\n00:12:59.087 --> 00:13:02.525\nBut let's just go through a few\nother things on the view tab.\n\n241\n00:13:02.525 --> 00:13:06.161\nThat we should probably pay\nattention to such as the ruler.\n\n242\n00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:12.680\nNow I already have this checked on but\nit's probably not checked on by default.\n\n243\n00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.930\nSo it's something like, I've been\nkinda playing around with this stuff.\n\n244\n00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.033\nSo you can turn this on, we'll talk\nabout what the ruler does later.\n\n245\n00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:23.711\nLike when we get into tab stops,\nI love me some tab stops.\n\n246\n00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:29.071\nBut right now you can see that it is\ndemonstrating and showing you the physical\n\n247\n00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:35.340\ndimension of this 8 and a half by 11 page,\nwith our one and something-ish margins.\n\n248\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.216\n[LAUGH] And\nthen I also have a vertical ruler,\n\n249\n00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:42.570\nwhich is something in your preferences\nthat you can turn on or off,\n\n250\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.150\nwhether you want you to\nshow a vertical ruler.\n\n251\n00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.050\nI think it's actually in view?\n\n252\n00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.350\nThere is a vertical right there!\n\n253\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.040\nVertical ruler down there at the bottom,\njust in case here.\n\n254\n00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.240\nIf yours doesn't have that,\nthat's what it does.\n\n255\n00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.880\nLet's go ahead and see some other things.\n\n256\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.180\nNow it's time for zooms.\n\n257\n00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.133\nAll right?\n\n258\n00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:09.094\nZooming right up here we have a couple\nplaces again down here at the bottom,\n\n259\n00:14:09.094 --> 00:14:13.738\nwe can use our little zoom slider thing,\nwhich is really nice to do, so\n\n260\n00:14:13.738 --> 00:14:18.537\nwe can zoom in and out, or we can click\non some of these buttons up at the top\n\n261\n00:14:18.537 --> 00:14:22.130\nthat kind of give you\nspecific like zoom to 100%.\n\n262\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.320\nWell, I'm clicking on it.\n\n263\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.213\nThe reason why it's not working\n[LAUGH] it's already at 100%, so\n\n264\n00:14:27.213 --> 00:14:28.990\nthat's why it didn't work.\n\n265\n00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.200\nBut if I zoom in, I grab that\nscroll-y bar down at the bottom and\n\n266\n00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.800\nscroll it to the right or\nscroll it to the left.\n\n267\n00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.248\nNotice it's zooming in and out of my\ndocument I go really far out then I could\n\n268\n00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:46.049\nsee a lot of different pages together,\nkeep on zooming in it's gonna go ahead and\n\n269\n00:14:46.049 --> 00:14:50.000\ngive me like two left if you want to say,\nzoom in a little bit more and\n\n270\n00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.160\nso on and so forth.\n\n271\n00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.923\nYou can use this slider to go back and\nforth.\n\n272\n00:14:53.923 --> 00:15:01.283\nNow that means that this button that's a\nquick click to get to zoom to 100%, boom.\n\n273\n00:15:01.283 --> 00:15:06.230\nIt goes to 100% within\nwhatever I am at right now.\n\n274\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.480\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, when we're zooming in,\n\n275\n00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.190\ndoes that actually pick where your\ncursor is as the point of zoom?\n\n276\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.310\nIs it zooming in toward\nthe cursor in your document or\n\n277\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.680\nis it just zooming to\nthe upper left hand corner.\n\n278\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.605\n&gt;&gt; It really is where ever your\nscreen is cuz notice if I zoom in and\n\n279\n00:15:23.605 --> 00:15:27.595\nI scroll and then I zoom out and\nthen I zoom back in.\n\n280\n00:15:27.595 --> 00:15:31.525\nIt actually did go back to my cursor,\nyou know that's a really good point.\n\n281\n00:15:31.525 --> 00:15:33.575\nOkay.\nSo if I scroll out,\n\n282\n00:15:33.575 --> 00:15:37.025\nI zoom out, scroll up click here.\n\n283\n00:15:37.025 --> 00:15:39.955\nLet's go back up to like down\nthe rabbit hole and then zoom in.\n\n284\n00:15:39.955 --> 00:15:43.515\nYes, the slider does\npick the mouse cursor,\n\n285\n00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:47.743\nthe flashing I-beam as to\nwhere you're zooming in.\n\n286\n00:15:47.743 --> 00:15:49.223\nGood pick up on that one, nice.\n\n287\n00:15:49.223 --> 00:15:51.236\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's one of those things that,\n\n288\n00:15:51.236 --> 00:15:52.271\nif you don't know-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:15:52.271 --> 00:15:53.165\n&gt;&gt; You're like,\n\n290\n00:15:53.165 --> 00:15:55.156\nI need to zoom in on this photo, and\n\n291\n00:15:55.156 --> 00:15:57.150\nI can't get it to zoom in on this-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.953\n&gt;&gt; Photo.\n\n293\n00:15:57.953 --> 00:16:00.812\nSo, and,\nI think that makes sense to me, but\n\n294\n00:16:00.812 --> 00:16:05.570\nI don't think zoom out necessarily uses,\nit just zooms, all the way out.\n\n295\n00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:06.250\n&gt;&gt; It's, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n296\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.587\nzoom in That focuses on\na point to zoom into,\n\n297\n00:16:08.587 --> 00:16:11.820\nthe zoom out is, let me just\npull back away from these pages.\n\n298\n00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I go right here,\n\n299\n00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.690\nnotice my scroll,\nmy flashing cursor's up at that first one.\n\n300\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.430\nScroll down to this page,\nand start zooming in.\n\n301\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.730\nNow it went to Ace of Hearts, okay.\n\n302\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.168\nSo you know what, it's a little back and\nforth, I would say.\n\n303\n00:16:25.168 --> 00:16:27.724\nOkay, let's zoom back out to 100%.\n\n304\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.390\nAll right, well you know what?\n\n305\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.520\nIt looked like it did.\n\n306\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.510\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's if the cursor's\ninside the view.\n\n307\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.480\nSo there are some weird nuances, right.\n\n308\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If the cursor's inside the view.\n\n309\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.950\nBecause, I bet if you put,\nyou scroll up and click,\n\n310\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.580\nthen it'll actually zoom like that.\n\n311\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.950\nGo to that point.\n\n312\n00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:49.070\nRight, so, click a point and\nthen come back in there.\n\n313\n00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.140\nIt'll go toward the cursor but\n\n314\n00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.720\nthat's only because the cursor was on the\npage view that was currently highlighted.\n\n315\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n316\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.750\nOkay, so that's where it doesn't seem to\nbe connected directly to the cursor so it\n\n317\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:05.060\njust was fooling us to make us look like\nit was at the cursor cuz when we zoom out.\n\n318\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.390\nScroll down, come into here.\n\n319\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.840\nScroll in.\n\n320\n00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.677\nYeah, it didn't jump back up.\n\n321\n00:17:09.677 --> 00:17:11.237\nI'm really glad that you are,\n\n322\n00:17:11.237 --> 00:17:14.514\nwe are troubleshooting this\nlike nobody's business, today.\n\n323\n00:17:14.514 --> 00:17:17.990\n&gt;&gt;

I don't even know what that means,\nVonne.\n\n352\n00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.990\nThat just like if I scroll the one way,\nand\n\n353\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.705\nit's not going the right,\nI just switch directions, right?\n\n354\n00:19:09.705 --> 00:19:11.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty resilient like that.\n\n355\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.920\n&gt;&gt; And for those of you, hopefully,\nunderstand what I'm talking about\n\n356\n00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.770\nwhen you're using a trackpad, whether you\nuse your fingers to go up or you use your\n\n357\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.310\nfingers to do down whether or not it's\ngonna change the direction of the page.\n\n358\n00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.260\nAnd it goes like with our iPhones.\n\n359\n00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.760\nI'm always backwards from whatever\nmy husband's computer is.\n\n360\n00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.070\nAnd he always is like,\nI'm like, how can you do this?\n\n361\n00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.680\nHe's like,\nI don't know how you do it the other way.\n\n362\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.440\nAnd we have this big old thing.\n\n363\n00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.780\n&gt;&gt; So it's versus like if I pull down\nsome people are like, I wanna go down.\n\n364\n00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.750\nVersus, I think, for me it makes sense,\nit's like I'm grabbing the page and\n\n365\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.880\npushing it up, so that's,\n\n366\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.590\nI think that's how my brain works,\nI'm not even really conscious of it.\n\n367\n00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.972\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n[LAUGH] It's one thing that it's just\n\n368\n00:19:51.972 --> 00:19:56.204\nlike, I do it and then if somebody's\ncomputer isn't set up the way mine is,\n\n369\n00:19:56.204 --> 00:20:00.588\nI, God, I [INAUDIBLE] go backwards,\nand I don't know which way is up, now.\n\n370\n00:20:00.588 --> 00:20:03.397\n[LAUGH] But, let's come down\ninto here to show you that it's,\n\n371\n00:20:03.397 --> 00:20:05.520\nI'm talking about your System preferences.\n\n372\n00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.310\nThis is not a Word preference.\n\n373\n00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.680\nYour system preferences and going to,\nI believe it's your mouse, it's this one.\n\n374\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.610\nThe natural scroll,\nsee they're scrolling down.\n\n375\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.803\nIt's scrolling the page down versus you're\nlike, I think what yours is saying,\n\n376\n00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:22.648\nyou push the page which really means\nyou're wanting to go down in the page.\n\n377\n00:20:22.648 --> 00:20:23.986\nAnd I think that's how\nwe do it on our phones.\n\n378\n00:20:23.986 --> 00:20:24.583\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n379\n00:20:24.583 --> 00:20:28.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think that's where\nthe gestures of whether you're doing like\n\n380\n00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.730\nthe phone way of doing it.\n\n381\n00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.860\nTo me, it's not, but notice,\nlet me just show you really quick.\n\n382\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.550\nIf I command control, I'm using up.\n\n383\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.570\nMy finger is moving up.\n\n384\n00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.520\nTo me, that should be zooming in.\n\n385\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:49.290\nTo hold command control and\nuse my mouse wheel or\n\n386\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.270\nmy magic mouse to scroll\nlike I'm scrolling down.\n\n387\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.531\nThat's backwards to me, to me.\n\n388\n00:20:53.531 --> 00:21:00.576\nSo if I turn this here to where\nI go to a natural movement.\n\n389\n00:21:00.576 --> 00:21:05.330\nCommand control, up, see I'm going in.\n\n390\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.590\nDown, I'm going out.\n\n391\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.960\nThat's the way it is for me.\n\n392\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.040\nMy preference, and it's also\nthe way that it does it in Windows.\n\n393\n00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.670\nWindowed windows.\n\n394\n00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:21.415\nSo that's why I had to go in and\nchange my mouse preferences and\n\n395\n00:21:21.415 --> 00:21:29.190\nI've luckily had now i've taught you\nthis I can keep it on that preference.\n\n396\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:34.820\nThrowing that together, they do correlate\ntogether in this really handy dandy zoom\n\n397\n00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.040\nkeyboard shortcut that I'm telling you,\n\n398\n00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.148\nin Mac it does connect\nto your operated system.\n\n399\n00:21:39.148 --> 00:21:42.204\nThen the other thing I\nwanna leave off on is,\n\n400\n00:21:42.204 --> 00:21:46.834\nin the view tab up here you have\none page versus multiple pages, and\n\n401\n00:21:46.834 --> 00:21:52.225\nas I've been scrolling in and out it\nautomatically goes to a multi page view.\n\n402\n00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:57.440\nBut if you want to definitely\nkeep it only in a one page view.\n\n403\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.447\nYou do have that option, so\nthat way if I use my scroll,\n\n404\n00:22:01.447 --> 00:22:03.636\nI can scroll out or scroll in.\n\n405\n00:22:03.636 --> 00:22:07.310\nAnd you see how it keeps\nit all down the line.\n\n406\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.930\nBut if I use multi-pages, then it goes\nahead and starts two up or three up, or\n\n407\n00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.575\nhowever many they need to go horizontally.\n\n408\n00:22:14.575 --> 00:22:19.954\nBut those two buttons do make\na difference in how you're zooming in and\n\n409\n00:22:19.954 --> 00:22:24.800\nout, of whether you want to not multi or\nmulti, go to each one.\n\n410\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.828\nOne page versus multi-page.\n\n411\n00:22:25.828 --> 00:22:28.913\nThen the last one I guess we can go ahead,\npage width,\n\n412\n00:22:28.913 --> 00:22:31.280\nit's kind of like the zoom to 100%.\n\n413\n00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.210\nPage width, it will automatically fill\nthe width of whatever you have in\n\n414\n00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:41.400\nyour screen or your monitor,\nthe window that your Word is going with.\n\n415\n00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:47.990\nSo of all of those different buttons,\nzooms, the levels,\n\n416\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:54.440\nthe views, the document views, and I guess\nnow we'll say the mode, the focus mode.\n\n417\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.050\nDifferent ways to just control\nwhat you're looking at.\n\n418\n00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.330\nWe really haven't done\nmuch about navigating.\n\n419\n00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.920\nYeah, I did some scrolling and everything.\n\n420\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.080\nWe clicked and we talked about that I\nbeam, but that kind of correlates into,\n\n421\n00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.750\nwell, what am I looking at?\n\n422\n00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.900\nSo that's why I wanted to take this\ntime and tell you all about it.\n\n423\n00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.437\nAnd at least you know,\ndon't go into the Web layout.\n\n424\n00:23:13.437 --> 00:23:16.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:39.236\nSo, luckily we have our\nvery own Microsoft maestro\n\n9\n00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:43.196\nin the house today to help\nus learn that very thing.\n\n10\n00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:44.310\nAnd that's Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.612\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.467\n&gt;&gt; Yes I'm in the house.\n\n13\n00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.253\n&gt;&gt; You live here?\n\n15\n00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:50.229\nThat's the craziest thing.\n\n16\n00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:51.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I feel like we do.\n\n17\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.491\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, navigating a document,\n\n18\n00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.148\nis it really that hard, or\nam I over thinking this?\n\n19\n00:00:58.148 --> 00:01:01.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know,\nit's funny you say that.\n\n20\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.675\nBecause we just scroll, right?\n\n21\n00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:05.982\nI mean we're just doing it,\nif you're watching this in succession,\n\n22\n00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.690\nwe had the document views.\n\n23\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.710\nAnd it was kind of hard for\n\n24\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.520\nme to talk about zooming in and\nout without just saying, hey go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.000\nscroll down to get down in your document,\nscroll up to get up in your document.\n\n26\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.170\nSo in that sense, life full test,\nthat's all there is.\n\n27\n00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.600\nBut just like everything, there's little\nnuances, like we were talking about,\n\n28\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.240\nwhere does the, does the zooming go\nahead and like focus on your cursor.\n\n29\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.050\nWe actually talked about this off camera\nabout in other programs it does matter,\n\n30\n00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.570\nlike where your mouse is, and\nwhen you zoom in, and so on and so forth.\n\n31\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.606\nSo we did a little navigating our views\nbut now I wanna show you how to get around\n\n32\n00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:43.539\na document and\nalso just showing you lots of shortcuts.\n\n33\n00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.026\nI'm all about a shortcut and\nshowing you different ways that, yeah,\n\n34\n00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:51.840\nscrolls fun, but\ndid you know you could use your keyboard?\n\n35\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.576\nDid you know you can use these combination\nof keys to kinda get you around to\n\n36\n00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:55.860\ndifferent places?\n\n37\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.320\nDid you know you have\na go-to dialogue box in Word?\n\n38\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.375\nYeah there is.\n\n39\n00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:01.383\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\n\n40\n00:02:01.383 --> 00:02:04.393\nyou've kind of got me sold because this\nis one of these things were you're like,\n\n41\n00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:05.175\nthis is simplistic.\n\n42\n00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:08.198\nBut as someone who spends a lot\nof time on the command line and\n\n43\n00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:11.950\na variety of applications being able\nto get to the top of a document without\n\n44\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.190\nhaving to go through each successive line,\n\n45\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.276\njust knowing that keyboard shortcut has\nimproved my workflow substantially.\n\n46\n00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:23.078\nSo these are gonna be some tips and tricks\nbased on what you told me to make you\n\n47\n00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:27.370\nkinda more efficient and\nbetter apt at completing work promptly.\n\n48\n00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.390\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and I actually,\nI did bring in a prop.\n\n49\n00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.401\nI brought in my keyboard, its in the front\nso if you see me reaching for this,\n\n50\n00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:35.991\nremember we saw this in\none of my other episodes.\n\n51\n00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.817\nAnd I will tell you because\nof the work that I do,\n\n52\n00:02:38.817 --> 00:02:43.780\nmaybe not necessarily always in Word but\nI've done really well documents in Word.\n\n53\n00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.027\nLike you say getting the shortcuts\nbe able to get to hey page 6 or\n\n54\n00:02:48.027 --> 00:02:52.356\npage 66 really easily, it's gonna be so\nmuch better if I could\n\n55\n00:02:52.356 --> 00:02:57.188\njust type it in rather than using\nyour scrolls what's all about those.\n\n56\n00:02:57.188 --> 00:03:00.391\nGetting to the topic document\nending the document and\n\n57\n00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:05.034\nI bought this keyboard specifically for\nthe work that I do in long documents.\n\n58\n00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:08.397\nIt is more in design [LAUGH],\nI have to go through the Word documents,\n\n59\n00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:11.520\nshe gives me of all the information for\nme to put it inside.\n\n60\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.605\nAll right, let's get started.\n\n61\n00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:19.133\nI've got my same file that we were\nworking in our document views and\n\n62\n00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.499\nnavigation cuz now we're navigating.\n\n63\n00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:24.400\nGreat, I will zoom in just a little bit.\n\n64\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.650\nI'm using that command control and\nthe scrolling wheel to zoom up.\n\n65\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.340\nTaking some time, slowing down, and be\nable like look at your mouse cursor icon.\n\n66\n00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.370\nHuge in all of your products.\n\n67\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.215\nAlways look at that.\n\n68\n00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:42.745\nLike right now my mouse cursor looks\nlike what we would call like an i-beam.\n\n69\n00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.611\nThis i-beam is to just say hey this\nis what your mouse looks like.\n\n70\n00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:50.420\nBut look at if I go ahead and\nput my mouse up here.\n\n71\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.960\nIf I go into this area I get a completely\ndifferent mouse cursor icon,\n\n72\n00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.335\nthat's something else.\n\n73\n00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:56.670\nWhat if I go over here to the left?\n\n74\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.270\nTotally other mouse cursor icon.\n\n75\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.614\nThose are kind of like a big difference\nwhen we get into like selecting\n\n76\n00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:04.370\ninformation.\n\n77\n00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.360\nBut it also correlates into navigating\nbecause you gotta kind of see\n\n78\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.092\nwhat I'm looking at, what is my mouse\ncursor look at, and what am I doing?\n\n79\n00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:17.360\nThe other big thing to notice\nis the flashing cursor.\n\n80\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.428\nThe flashing cursor,\nthe thing that right there hello, sorry.\n\n81\n00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:26.116\nLet me, [LAUGH] let me oops, this way and\nthis way, let's get there, there we go.\n\n82\n00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:28.775\nI was trying to zoom in so\nyou could see this really well,\n\n83\n00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:31.260\nthat little guy, right there.\n\n84\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.441\nWhat does that mean?\n\n85\n00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:36.662\nThat means that if you start typing right\nnow that's where your text is gonna go.\n\n86\n00:04:36.662 --> 00:04:39.790\nSo, scrolling and\n\n87\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.805\nnavigating but\nknowing where is your cursor, that's\n\n88\n00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:49.940\ngonna be a huge different cuz you can get\nsomewhere else and not be at that like,\n\n89\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.490\nfocal point if you wanna say like this\nis where I want my text to start.\n\n90\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.220\nOkay so just being very conscientious\nof those little things to make sure\n\n91\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.860\nthat we're at where we need to get.\n\n92\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.770\nJust look for them, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.660\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna click on the zoom\nto 100% to just get me out of there.\n\n94\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.552\nSo yes, the first way of navigating\na document, you can use your scroll wheel,\n\n95\n00:05:12.552 --> 00:05:17.300\nokay right, go ahead and scroll down, and\nI just realized that I've changed my mouse\n\n96\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.180\npreferences and\nnow I can't use my scroll down.\n\n97\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.558\nOoh, now I am just gonna have to remember\nto do it opposite of how I normally do\n\n98\n00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:25.150\nat my zooms.\n\n99\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.620\nSorry guys, I gotta go back over here and\nturn that off, all right.\n\n100\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.010\nOS preferences, wow there we go.\n\n101\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.610\nUsing my scroll down,\ngets down in the document.\n\n102\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.419\nAll right, I had to flip it for\nmy zoom, but that's okay.\n\n103\n00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.231\nAll right, so we're gonna scroll down,\nnotice that in Mac for some reason,\n\n104\n00:05:42.231 --> 00:05:44.709\nlike that scroll it doesn't\nstay the whole time.\n\n105\n00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:49.350\nLike that's a dedicated space in Windows.\n\n106\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.890\nIt's not for Mac.\n\n107\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.244\nSo you have to kind of get it started.\n\n108\n00:05:53.244 --> 00:05:56.820\nAnd then if you wanted to, oops,\ncome on, let's go, there we go.\n\n109\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.440\nNotice then, then I can go ahead and\ngrab that little guy and scroll up and\n\n110\n00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.860\nscroll down through my document.\n\n111\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.790\nIt just doesn't stay there the whole time.\n\n112\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.404\nJust to let you know.\n\n113\n00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:08.159\nAll right,\n\n114\n00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:12.900\nnow I know that this document has seven\npages, like how did you know that?\n\n115\n00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.399\nWell, I created it for one thing.\n\n116\n00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:15.947\nBut two, I have my status bar down here.\n\n117\n00:06:15.947 --> 00:06:19.350\nAnd I'm just taking you down there,\nso you can notice it,\n\n118\n00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.724\ncuz we're gonna come back around at\nthe end where the status bar can give you\n\n119\n00:06:23.724 --> 00:06:28.470\na lot of cool things about where you are,\nwhen you are navigating your document.\n\n120\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.420\nPage one of seven, okay that's great.\n\n121\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.640\nOops, I actually just did a shortcut\nthat I wasn't ready to show you but\n\n122\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.440\nhey you know what why not?\n\n123\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.575\nLet's go there.\n\n124\n00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:39.810\nWhy I click on that,\n\n125\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.550\nthat's actually bringing up what's\ncalled the navigation pane.\n\n126\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.810\nThe navigation pane is really nice,\nI used this a lot.\n\n127\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.220\nBecause as you can see\nonce I click on that,\n\n128\n00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.630\nit's giving me a place where I\ncould navigate based on my pages.\n\n129\n00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.022\nSee I'm over here, now my mouse is over\non this side so now when I'm scrolling,\n\n130\n00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:04.237\nI'm scrolling in this pane over here,\nI'm not scrolling in the document.\n\n131\n00:07:04.237 --> 00:07:05.700\nNotice the mouse here?\n\n132\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.850\nScroll up a down.\n\n133\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.660\nMouse over here, scroll in this pane.\n\n134\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.050\nSo if I wanted to get to,\nlet's just say page six,\n\n135\n00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.550\nyou're like wait why does that page?\n\n136\n00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.190\nThat's one, two,\nwhat is going on in this document?\n\n137\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.000\nBased on our page numbers,\nbased on our sections.\n\n138\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.130\nJust keep that in mind,\nbe like how would you do that?\n\n139\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.710\nI'm not here to tell you\nthat just right now.\n\n140\n00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.345\nBut just in case that throws you off,\n\n141\n00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:34.625\nit's not always gonna be numbered\nsequentially like this is page seven.\n\n142\n00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:39.606\nBut, you know kind of looking at this,\nif I click on it, I will get to that\n\n143\n00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:44.595\nparticular page, which is numbered\n5-1 again just because of the way\n\n144\n00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:49.786\nthat my headers and footers are numbered\nbased on my sections, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:49.786 --> 00:07:53.654\nBut that is a nice place to get around\nin a document is if you go ahead and\n\n146\n00:07:53.654 --> 00:07:55.212\ngrab the navigation pane.\n\n147\n00:07:55.212 --> 00:07:58.463\nAlso notice since I am on\nthis view tab here on ribbon,\n\n148\n00:07:58.463 --> 00:08:00.501\nI can get to the navigation pane.\n\n149\n00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:04.114\nFrom here just check the box on and\ncheck the box on.\n\n150\n00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:07.772\nOr you can click the little button down\nthere that again I wanted to show you\n\n151\n00:08:07.772 --> 00:08:10.427\nthe ribbon first, and\nthen the little shortcut, but\n\n152\n00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:12.802\nwe get to the same thing,\nso that's all right.\n\n153\n00:08:12.802 --> 00:08:15.077\nI think it's also in the menu.\n\n154\n00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:17.444\nView &gt; Sidebar.\n\n155\n00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:19.182\nThey call it a side bar.\n\n156\n00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:20.260\nThey call it a pane.\n\n157\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.835\nWhatever the thing that's over there.\n\n158\n00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:22.970\nYou'll go ahead and find.\n\n159\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.810\nAnd then some other ways\nthat you could navigate\n\n160\n00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.800\nusing this navigation\npane instead of by pages.\n\n161\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.740\nYou can navigate by what's\nknown as the Document Map.\n\n162\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.960\nThis only works if you are using Headings.\n\n163\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.800\nHeading one, heading two,\nheading three, any of those.\n\n164\n00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.012\nIf you don't ever designate or\nuse a style called heading one,\n\n165\n00:08:46.012 --> 00:08:50.395\nheading two, or anything then\nyou're not gonna see any of this.\n\n166\n00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:53.636\nCuz notice that is says that\naround the rabbit hole, up and\n\n167\n00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:57.273\nthrough the rabbit hole pig and\n[INAUDIBLE], can see all of those,\n\n168\n00:08:57.273 --> 00:09:01.311\nthose are the ones that are correlating\nwith the text over here because it\n\n169\n00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:04.654\nis formatted that way, so\nthat's kind of a key on that one.\n\n170\n00:09:04.654 --> 00:09:09.032\nBut notice As I can click on those\nparticular heading levels, and\n\n171\n00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:11.985\nit will get me down to\nthe same information.\n\n172\n00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.675\nLike, wait, that's repeated, I did.\n\n173\n00:09:13.675 --> 00:09:17.185\nI just took the same stuff and\ncopied it to just make a longer document.\n\n174\n00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:19.120\nThis doesn't actually read.\n\n175\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.760\nLike an actual story, okay so\nthat's just in case the little FYI,\n\n176\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.035\nthis doesn't make any sense,\nit's not supposed to.\n\n177\n00:09:26.035 --> 00:09:28.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No Vonne, I can attest to this view in\n\n178\n00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.310\nparticular, I am almost think of\nthis as a hierarchical for outline.\n\n179\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.100\nI tend to write more technical\ntype of things and stories, so\n\n180\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.070\nI do have headings and\nsubheadings and this mapping is very,\n\n181\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.610\nI need to go talk about\nthe creation of the cluster.\n\n182\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.520\nClick it and it takes me directly to that.\n\n183\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.610\nI don't have to sift through pages or\nremember page numbers.\n\n184\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.230\nOr remember, hey, this is numbering based\non sections and, it's just a title,\n\n185\n00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.100\nclick, and I'm there.\n\n186\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.670\nSo this is actually something that I use,\nmore often that not.\n\n187\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, heading levels are so like basic.\n\n188\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.020\nWe do this all day long.\n\n189\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.310\nIf you think about books that we read,\ntextbooks.\n\n190\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.758\nWe have a table of contents.\n\n191\n00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:11.171\nAnd then those table of contents,\nlike correlate into the actual text.\n\n192\n00:10:11.171 --> 00:10:14.750\nSo that is later in the book or\nanything like that.\n\n193\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.290\nSo you know about headings.\n\n194\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.088\nYou just maybe not use it kind of\nthinking of it in this terms and\n\n195\n00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:27.628\nall I have to make sure that I\napplied that type of styling.\n\n196\n00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:31.541\nSo yes, that the hierarchy,\nthe document map.\n\n197\n00:10:31.541 --> 00:10:33.460\nYou know,\nwe talked about this in website maps and\n\n198\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.620\nthings like that where all\nthese different pieces are.\n\n199\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.060\nSo use your headings they're amazing,\nthey're super easy to use too.\n\n200\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.420\nGuess what, I have a whole episode\non it in this particular series.\n\n201\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.180\nSo we'll get there.\n\n202\n00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.540\nThose are the different ways\nthat we could go ahead and\n\n203\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.580\nfind our different ways\naround our document.\n\n204\n00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.370\nGo to this particular pane.\n\n205\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.400\nYou don't like this pane,\nmaybe it's being a pain for\n\n206\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.600\nyou, you can click the little x right\nnext to it right there to go ahead and\n\n207\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.035\nclose that side board Cyborg\n[LAUGH] What are we on, Star Trek?\n\n208\n00:11:03.035 --> 00:11:04.943\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what just happened, but\n\n209\n00:11:04.943 --> 00:11:07.625\nI'm afraid the machines are gonna\ncome in and take over at any minute.\n\n210\n00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.555\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\nlike six of seven or eight.\n\n211\n00:11:09.555 --> 00:11:12.559\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways.\n\n212\n00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:14.000\n&gt;&gt; Just be careful of those cyborgs.\n\n213\n00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n214\n00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:18.976\nSo you could go ahead and close that\ndown if you don't want to go there.\n\n215\n00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:23.807\nThat Go To that I kind of made\nreference in the beginning,\n\n216\n00:11:23.807 --> 00:11:27.038\nI like this, it's in your edit menu.\n\n217\n00:11:27.038 --> 00:11:30.460\nThe thing is it's not mapped the same\nshortcut that I have in Windows.\n\n218\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.252\nWhy do they always do that to me?\n\n219\n00:11:32.252 --> 00:11:38.014\nIt's Edit&gt;Find&gt;Go To, but do you see\nnormally go to is Ctrl+G in Windows,\n\n220\n00:11:38.014 --> 00:11:40.298\nhere, it's not Command+G.\n\n221\n00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:43.043\nIt's command Option or Alt+G and\n\n222\n00:11:43.043 --> 00:11:48.351\nthat will get you to the dialog box\nif you are a keyboard fan like me.\n\n223\n00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:51.471\nAnd I always have to remember to\nkind of like map them in my brain\n\n224\n00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:53.770\nabout which Operating System I'm using it.\n\n225\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.110\nGo To, and this will take you\nto a bunch of different places.\n\n226\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.698\nYou could go to a page.\n\n227\n00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:01.525\nJust like we did in that navigation page.\n\n228\n00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:04.490\nAnd for right now,\nit's probably all we need to know about.\n\n229\n00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:09.560\nBut there are other things that I\nuse this when I am using footnotes,\n\n230\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.190\nbookmarks, equations or headings.\n\n231\n00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.100\nAll of those different things.\n\n232\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.192\nI use a lot of these things in my Word\ndocument in real life it also because we\n\n233\n00:12:19.192 --> 00:12:22.822\nhave an expert level show that we\ntalk about long documentation.\n\n234\n00:12:22.822 --> 00:12:27.722\nSo this is a nice way to bring up\na way to navigate to a specific\n\n235\n00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:30.374\ntype of content in my document.\n\n236\n00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:33.936\nRight now we'll just go ahead and stick\nwith page like I said enter a page number.\n\n237\n00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:38.150\nLet's go to page 5 and\nthen you click the Go To at the bottom and\n\n238\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.848\nthen it will go ahead and takes you\nto page 5 and then you close this and\n\n239\n00:12:42.848 --> 00:12:45.220\nnow I am right here on page 5 of 7.\n\n240\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.420\nIt's a cute way especially if you start\ngetting really good with those short cuts,\n\n241\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.321\nyou could go ahead and Command+Alt+G,\nbring this up, type the number 2,\n\n242\n00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:55.194\nhit enter, then hit the Escape key.\n\n243\n00:12:55.194 --> 00:12:59.386\nYou see I did all that navigating to\na specific page without ever touching\n\n244\n00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:00.083\nthe mouse.\n\n245\n00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:01.751\nIt's kind of like my goal in life,\n\n246\n00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:06.190\nis to get to where I can do everything\non the keyboard, and not use the mouse.\n\n247\n00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.030\nThat's just me, it's just like this weird\nkinda thing with me, I love shortcuts.\n\n248\n00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.450\nBut don't think that you have to.\n\n249\n00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.530\nIt's just that it kinda\na little corky thing with me.\n\n250\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.500\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nas a secondary response to that, Vonne,\n\n251\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.570\nit's interesting that we\nactually share a goal.\n\n252\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.160\nThat is one of my goals as well.\n\n253\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.320\nI take a different avenue.\n\n254\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.870\nI use some different text editors but\nI can attest to this.\n\n255\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.300\nThe more you can keep from having to move\nyour hand from the keyboard to the mouse.\n\n256\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:34.310\nI feel, and have observed, I tend to be\nmore productive if I don't have to do it.\n\n257\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.323\nAlso, if you do this eight hours a day,\n\n258\n00:13:36.323 --> 00:13:39.634\nyou may end up with some repetitive\nmotion, kind of stiffness.\n\n259\n00:13:39.634 --> 00:13:42.146\nI'm moving my hand a lot, and\nmy shoulder is killing me.\n\n260\n00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:46.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like you said, you do a lot of\ntyping, you're gonna want to eventually\n\n261\n00:13:46.775 --> 00:13:51.160\nget to the place where you wanna use\nthe keyboard as much as possible.\n\n262\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.831\nGood segue into guess what?\n\n263\n00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:57.416\nKeyboard shortcuts or\nkeyboard navigation, Mm-hm, let's go.\n\n264\n00:13:57.416 --> 00:13:58.399\nI'm down in here.\n\n265\n00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:02.540\nRemember it's all about where\nis your flashing cursor?\n\n266\n00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.290\nLet me scroll in a little bit.\n\n267\n00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.260\nI'll just use the scroll\ndown at the bottom.\n\n268\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:11.530\nRight here, I can see my flashing\ncursor is at the top of page 5.\n\n269\n00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.380\nIf I use my scrolly wheel, scroll on up.\n\n270\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.680\nLet's get up to page 1 of 7.\n\n271\n00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:23.970\nSo now I'm here,\nmy flashing cursor is still down there.\n\n272\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.820\nOkay, it's way down on\nwhatever page I did.\n\n273\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.950\nSo if I started typing like some\nletters you see how it jumped down?\n\n274\n00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.590\nI typed in fits.\n\n275\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.750\nI put an f there.\n\n276\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.300\nGotta make sure, scroll verses\nflashing cursor, big difference.\n\n277\n00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.850\nLet's scroll on up,\n\n278\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:45.029\nI'm going to click on my cursor in front\nof the A in Alice to get me there.\n\n279\n00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:49.948\nUsing my keyboard,\nif I use my down arrow key on my keyboard,\n\n280\n00:14:49.948 --> 00:14:51.884\nwhere is it going to go?\n\n281\n00:14:51.884 --> 00:14:57.880\nDown, use my up goes up,\nuse my left arrow.\n\n282\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.600\nI'm gonna scroll on a little bit more so\nyou, or I can zoom in.\n\n283\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.280\nUse my, that's other left ,I'm sorry.\n\n284\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.230\nThe right arrow I'm jumping\nover one character at a time,\n\n285\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.740\ngetting my cursor to move that way.\n\n286\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.158\nSo if I need to kinda move\naround to start editing texts,\n\n287\n00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:17.082\nI can use that keyboard to get me there,\nright?\n\n288\n00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:19.222\nAnd the cursor goes with it.\n\n289\n00:15:19.222 --> 00:15:23.003\nThere's some little tricks in here\nthat if I wanted to get my my mouse,\n\n290\n00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:27.426\nnotice you can't see me do it, but\nI'm going click, click, click, click, and\n\n291\n00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:31.170\ngetting to the first word in the sentence,\nwhich is down.\n\n292\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:39.000\nIf I wanted to jump over by word, not by\ncharacter, it's your Option or Alt key.\n\n293\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.740\nWhich is not the same as\nsome of your other programs.\n\n294\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.410\nSo Alt, and you see if I start clicking,\nmy right arrow.\n\n295\n00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.117\nThere, there, there, there, there,\nthere was nothing else to do.\n\n296\n00:15:53.117 --> 00:15:59.396\nI'm jumping by words there,\nnot by characters, you can use the left or\n\n297\n00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:04.120\nthe right arrow to jump by\nwords Not just a little bit.\n\n298\n00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.485\nIf I use the Alt in correlation\nwith my down arrow or up arrow,\n\n299\n00:16:09.485 --> 00:16:14.340\nnotice that it's jumping to,\nsee now it's down to a.\n\n300\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.160\nOne more there in the beginning of o,\nlet me scroll down so you can see this.\n\n301\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.080\nWatch, jump, jump, jump,\nit's jumping by paragraphs.\n\n302\n00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.570\nSo that's where you can go up and down,\njust kinda of an easier way to go by using\n\n303\n00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.250\nthat Alt key in correlation with your\narrows to get where you need by word or\n\n304\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.900\nby paragraph depending if you are going\nup and down or left and right.\n\n305\n00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.180\nThe other one that you can do,\n\n306\n00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.980\nlet's get my cursor in front of dark\nhere in this particular sentence.\n\n307\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.690\nThe Command key, the Command key if\nyou hold it and use your right arrow,\n\n308\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.685\ngo to the other side of the page.\n\n309\n00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:52.030\nSee it stops over on the end\nof the line which is hurrying.\n\n310\n00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.747\nIn Windows it's the Control key will\njump you by word, it's not Alt.\n\n311\n00:16:58.747 --> 00:17:00.837\nSo it's weird, I know, right.\n\n312\n00:17:00.837 --> 00:17:05.370\nIt's like, come on,\nwe can not have any continuity at all.\n\n313\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.908\n[SOUND] Okay, that's why I keep\nemphasizing this for you guys.\n\n314\n00:17:08.908 --> 00:17:11.651\nSo hopefully you can be\nas frustrated as me.\n\n315\n00:17:11.651 --> 00:17:15.980\n[LAUGH] But really just to illuminate\nthe fact that it does that.\n\n316\n00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.890\nAnd that's where we got, all right,\nso now I'm going to grab my prop.\n\n317\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.465\nGrab my keyboard over here,\n\n318\n00:17:23.465 --> 00:17:27.960\nokay, cuz there's some other keys that\nare really nice to be able to use.\n\n319\n00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.090\nI'm using my mouse right here to\nput my cursor in front of Alice.\n\n320\n00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.090\nPage up, page down.\n\n321\n00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.490\nLove that.\n\n322\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.890\nWhen I do this,\nif I hit the page down key on my keyboard,\n\n323\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:43.930\nnotice it's jumping like full screenshots,\nif we want to call that.\n\n324\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.980\nSo it's kind of taking this either\nchapter two, Through The Looking Glass.\n\n325\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.238\nSo you can see that it's\nbarely up at that the top now.\n\n326\n00:17:50.238 --> 00:17:54.760\nSo it's jumping with your cursor,\ncursor's still there,\n\n327\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.330\nby screens not by pages all together.\n\n328\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.400\nSo just be careful about that.\n\n329\n00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.622\nBut if I scroll out,\nyou might not be able to see this\n\n330\n00:18:06.622 --> 00:18:11.724\nvery clearly, but\nif I hold my Command key down and\n\n331\n00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:16.851\nuse my Page Down,\nnow I'm jumping by full pages.\n\n332\n00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:21.190\nThat's a true page,\nif you wanna say, up and page down.\n\n333\n00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.280\nSo jump up, holding the Command and\nthe Page Up and\n\n334\n00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.500\nPage Down button will get you\nto the top of every page.\n\n335\n00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.585\nLet's zoom in a little bit more.\n\n336\n00:18:31.585 --> 00:18:37.166\nYour Home and End keys, e n d,\nif you have those on those keyboard,\n\n337\n00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:41.370\nthe End by itself will take\nyou to the end of a line.\n\n338\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.750\nThe Home will take you to\nthe beginning of the line.\n\n339\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.910\nThat's the way most programs work,\nif you have homes and ends.\n\n340\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:55.160\nThis is probably my super fave,\nI'm using my scroll wheel down here.\n\n341\n00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.500\nHow do I get to the very\nbeginning of my document?\n\n342\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.630\nHow do I get to the very\nend of my document?\n\n343\n00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.420\nMy fave, Command Home.\n\n344\n00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.336\nHold the Command, click the Home key.\n\n345\n00:19:05.336 --> 00:19:10.086\nIt doesn't matter if you have 185\npages and you're on page 183,\n\n346\n00:19:10.086 --> 00:19:14.280\nyou hold Ctrl or sorry, sorry,\ndoing the Windows thing.\n\n347\n00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.170\nHold Command, click the Home key,\n\n348\n00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.160\nyou will always go to the very\nbeginning of the document.\n\n349\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.690\nLove that.\n\n350\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.480\nIn reverse, if you wanna say or\nthe opposite, hold the Command key,\n\n351\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.490\nclick the End, e n d, key,\ntakes it to the end of the document.\n\n352\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:33.900\nYou're writing your novel, right, you\nwant to get to the very end, Command End,\n\n353\n00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.098\n[SOUND] keep on typing.\n\n354\n00:19:35.098 --> 00:19:36.272\nWant to get to the beginning?\n\n355\n00:19:36.272 --> 00:19:38.274\nCommand Home.\n\n356\n00:19:38.274 --> 00:19:41.026\nThose are my favorites,\nI super super love those.\n\n357\n00:19:41.026 --> 00:19:43.460\n[LAUGH] So that's what we've got there.\n\n358\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.380\nAnd then the only other thing I wanted to\ngo with, cuz these are, kind of ends my\n\n359\n00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:55.060\nshortcuts from navigating, it's really\nmore of just being aware of sections.\n\n360\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:00.180\nDown here I have page 1 of 7, but\nthis is section one of this document.\n\n361\n00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.221\nI know that there are sections,\ncuz remember, I made this.\n\n362\n00:20:04.221 --> 00:20:06.422\nSo, two things.\n\n363\n00:20:06.422 --> 00:20:06.983\nTwo things.\n\n364\n00:20:06.983 --> 00:20:13.040\n[LAUGH] One is having your status\nbar be able to show sections.\n\n365\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.330\nIf you right click down anywhere in this\nkind of blank area of your status bar,\n\n366\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.710\nyou can get into all the different things\nthat you can show on the status bar.\n\n367\n00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.120\nThis is the same in all of your\nOffice products, by the way.\n\n368\n00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.380\nSo this is definitely one that\nI will go with is sections.\n\n369\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.470\nAnd notice there is section one.\n\n370\n00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.700\nIf I scroll on down,\n\n371\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.530\nI think if you get into, yep,\ngotta get a little bit further down.\n\n372\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.000\nThere you go, see?\n\n373\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.421\nSection two.\n\n374\n00:20:37.421 --> 00:20:41.650\nI have made next page section breaks.\n\n375\n00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.040\nWhy do you want to do that?\n\n376\n00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.540\nThere's a variety of reasons, okay.\n\n377\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.840\nBut that's just to kind of let you know\nthat it's not always about your pages.\n\n378\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.590\nIt could be about your sections and\nhow to navigate with that.\n\n379\n00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:58.870\nAnd then I'm also going to talk\nabout on the Home tab this button\n\n380\n00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:04.000\nthat I forgot I turned on in the last\nepisode, show all non printing characters,\n\n381\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.755\nor I refer to it as the show hide button.\n\n382\n00:21:05.755 --> 00:21:10.750\nIf you click on this, it's gonna show you\nall of those non printing characters,\n\n383\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:17.200\nthe enter marks, tabs, where I made,\nright there, section breaks.\n\n384\n00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.067\nTurning that on will let you know\nabout all the different things that is\n\n385\n00:21:22.067 --> 00:21:25.134\ngoing on your document that you can't see.\n\n386\n00:21:25.134 --> 00:21:28.753\nMaybe you've experienced this, Justin,\nsomebody gives you a file and you start\n\n387\n00:21:28.753 --> 00:21:32.319\ntyping and editing it and everything, and\nthen all of a sudden you scroll down and\n\n388\n00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:34.400\nthere's this big blank\npaper in the middle.\n\n389\n00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.980\nWhy is there a blank page,\nthere wasn't a blank page there before?\n\n390\n00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.520\nBe like I don't know what happened.\n\n391\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:46.150\nIt's cuz somebody or something, if you\nwant to say, put in a manual page break.\n\n392\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.730\nBreak the page.\n\n393\n00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.602\nWell you start adding more,\nwell that's gonna move everything down and\n\n394\n00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:52.816\ngive you a blank page.\n\n395\n00:21:52.816 --> 00:21:56.595\nAnd those are just things that I know I've\nexperience and people asked me about.\n\n396\n00:21:56.595 --> 00:21:59.453\nAnd it's those things that\nyou can't really see, but\n\n397\n00:21:59.453 --> 00:22:02.540\nif you turn that button on it\nwill let you show some stuff.\n\n398\n00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.270\nAnd so I'm always in this mode,\nbut that's just me.\n\n399\n00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.040\nYou know where it's at, and you know\nlater when we get into more stuff of\n\n400\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.930\nwhy you're going to want to keep that on.\n\n401\n00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.132\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\nI've definitely encountered that.\n\n402\n00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:16.699\nAnd to some extent, I add these breaks and\nthen sometimes I have to go find\n\n403\n00:22:16.699 --> 00:22:20.444\nthem again because I'm like,\nI added some things to my own document and\n\n404\n00:22:20.444 --> 00:22:24.040\nnow the formatting is kind of weird and\nnot what I anticipated.\n\n405\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.304\nSo that show and\nhide character button can be beneficial.\n\n406\n00:22:28.304 --> 00:22:30.910\nIt's kind of like a love\nhate relationship with me.\n\n407\n00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.360\nI'm like, I like that you're\nshowing me what I can't see but\n\n408\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.435\nit kind of puts me on edge for\nsome reason.\n\n409\n00:22:37.435 --> 00:22:38.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, what is all\n\n410\n00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.670\nthis stuff-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.680\n&gt;&gt; That I didn't type?\n\n412\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.050\nBut you kind of did, you set it up.\n\n413\n00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:43.720\nAnd well Vonne,\n\n414\n00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.060\nyou've definitely shown us how to expedite\nour navigation through a document.\n\n415\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.050\nSo thank you so much.\n\n416\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.830\nAnd hopefully you learned something.\n\n417\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.230\nTake a little bit of these and just\nintegrate them a little bit day by day\n\n418\n00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.350\nas you learn more of these\nnavigation tips and tricks.\n\n419\n00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:01.680\nBut definitely stay tuned for more\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n420\n00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.040\nWe got more coming at you.\n\n421\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.800\nBut for now we're going to go ahead and\nwrap this one up, so\n\n422\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.840\nsigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n423\n00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.661\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith\n&gt;&gt; And I'll see you next time.\n\n424\n00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:16.190\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:18.070\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.638\nwe're back with more Microsoft Word\n2016 essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:25.110\nI very could've possibly transposed those.\n\n6\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.890\nWho knows, there's a lot of words, but\n\n7\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.950\nin particular we're gonna be\ntalking about selecting text.\n\n8\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.020\nNow, you may go, hmm,\nthat seems very simplistic.\n\n9\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.490\nHowever, some of those shortcuts and\nnuance behaviors, well,\n\n10\n00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.070\nthey can make you incredibly productive.\n\n11\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.040\nAnd luckily we were able to\ngrab the queen of productivity\n\n12\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.680\nto help us with this very thing.\n\n13\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.310\nMiss Vonne Smith,\nhow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n14\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.330\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic,\nhow are you all doing today?\n\n15\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.900\n&gt;&gt; She had it ready.\n\n16\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.060\nShe was ready to go.\n\n17\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.543\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n[LAUGH] Yes, it's-\n\n18\n00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:52.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:52.645\n&gt;&gt; Elbow, elbow.\n\n20\n00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:53.405\nWrist, wrist.\n\n21\n00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:54.485\n&gt;&gt; I can't do that.\n\n22\n00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.689\nI'm afraid I'm gonna\nthrow out my shoulder.\n\n23\n00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n24\n00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:00.655\nSomebody very wise taught me that.\n\n25\n00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:01.505\nSo, yes you are right.\n\n26\n00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:03.485\nWe are going to be selecting text.\n\n27\n00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.085\nAnd selecting text, yeah,\nlike he said, seems pretty easy.\n\n28\n00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:10.955\nJust click hold and drag, which is a very\ncommon method of selecting text, and yes,\n\n29\n00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:12.390\nthat works.\n\n30\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.860\nBut, there's a lot of other\nways you can do that.\n\n31\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.370\nKeyboard shortcuts,\ndo you know that there's a selection\n\n32\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.990\narea that you can use to make\nsome other shortcuts in there,\n\n33\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.640\nto select a whole document,\nor select a paragraph?\n\n34\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.730\nThat's what I'm here to teach you, all\nthose different ways that can help you be\n\n35\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.980\nmore productive and hopefully get\nyou where you want to go faster.\n\n36\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.350\nI think that is the definition\nof productivity, right?\n\n37\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.150\n&gt;&gt; If it's not,\nthen we just made up a new one.\n\n38\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.560\nWe're gonna have to submit a change\nrequest to possibly Merriam-Webster,\n\n39\n00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.170\nbut for now, I think on the show,\nwe'll go with it.\n\n40\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.955\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Get there better, faster.\n\n41\n00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:46.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice,\n\n42\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.100\nwell why don't we go ahead and jump on\ndown into our Alice in Wonderland text.\n\n43\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.740\nThis is the same file that we've been\nusing for the last couple of episodes,\n\n44\n00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.790\nthis is document views and navigation.\n\n45\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.170\nSo we're going to learn\nhow to navigate around,\n\n46\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.540\nnot necessarily navigate,\nthat was the last episode.\n\n47\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.410\nWe're gonna select the text in here.\n\n48\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.770\nBut a lot of the techniques that I showed\nyou on how to navigate with the keyboard,\n\n49\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.760\nit's gonna come back into play a little\nbit later down this episode because we're\n\n50\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.500\ngonna be using them again.\n\n51\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.210\nAll right, just to review a little\nbit about the navigating,\n\n52\n00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.880\nalways looking at your\nmouse cursor icon and\n\n53\n00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.510\nwhat does it look like,\nbecause that's what it's gonna do.\n\n54\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.260\nRight now, if I'm out here or if I'm down\nin some text, I'm gonna get an I beam.\n\n55\n00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.080\nThe I beam indicates that you will\nbe able to click and be able to get\n\n56\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.450\nthat flashing cursor another key\ncomponent of what we need to look for,\n\n57\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.750\nthat flashing cursor right now is in\nfront of the A in Alice in Wonderland.\n\n58\n00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.830\nUp at the top, we had this little hand\ndocument thing, that's to indicate where\n\n59\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.160\nyou can, if you can click in there, I\nshould double click, just to let you know.\n\n60\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.020\nThat's gonna get you into the header and\nfooter sections, okay.\n\n61\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.980\nSo, just in case you get there,\n\n62\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.400\nI'll should put this on the navigate\njust in case but, hey, you know what?\n\n63\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.660\nNow.\nSo that's all good.\n\n64\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.113\nDouble clicking in the header, it will\nallow you to start typing in headers and\n\n65\n00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:04.728\nfooters.\n\n66\n00:03:04.728 --> 00:03:09.146\nAnd notice your contextual tab also\ncomes up in that space to be able, well,\n\n67\n00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:15.190\nput that repeating elements on the top and\nthe bottom of every page in your document.\n\n68\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.430\nA lot of people get in here and\ndon't know how to get out.\n\n69\n00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.525\nIt is nice they put this close in here.\n\n70\n00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:21.640\nBut I don't know if\nit's always been there.\n\n71\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.260\nBut [LAUGH] you can double-click\nto get into that area.\n\n72\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.290\nYou can double-click down in your normal\npage area to get you out of this.\n\n73\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.760\nSo just in case you accidentally do\nthat and don't know where you're at.\n\n74\n00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.110\nAnd the other thing to notice\nwhen you're in your document\n\n75\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.380\nis moving over to the left hand side.\n\n76\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.480\nThis left hand side we get a black arrow\npointing to the right in Windows white,\n\n77\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.560\njust in case you want to know.\n\n78\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.550\nAnd then notice that if I move up,\nsee how my, I got a black arrow again but\n\n79\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.300\nit tilts to the left.\n\n80\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.490\nSo left arrow, right arrow,\nor whatever way its leaning,\n\n81\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.170\nthe reason why you have this,\nversus going to the right hand side,\n\n82\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.060\nif I go to the right hand side of my page,\nnotice it's an I beam.\n\n83\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.110\nBecause this is that selection area\nthat I've been kind of mentioning\n\n84\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.460\nat least a couple times here\nin this little introduction.\n\n85\n00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.490\nCursors, always good.\n\n86\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.420\nI beam, understand.\n\n87\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.750\nI would like to select some text.\n\n88\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.310\nI would like to select this down,\ndown, down.\n\n89\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.250\nWhy?\nBecause I want to format it or copy it.\n\n90\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.190\nWe're not getting into like what\nwe're gonna do after we select it.\n\n91\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.660\nThis episode is only\nabout Select to effect.\n\n92\n00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.290\nI need to select this thing\nbefore I can effect it.\n\n93\n00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.338\nClick hold and drag.\n\n94\n00:04:38.338 --> 00:04:38.960\nGet my I-beam,\n\n95\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.680\neven though my flash encourages its way\nover there, that's okay, that's fine.\n\n96\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.680\nBecause, when I'm going to select,\nwhen I click, get the I-beam.\n\n97\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.580\nDrag, hold down the mouse.\n\n98\n00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.860\nDrag, as soon as I'm done,\nI let go of the mouse and\n\n99\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.320\nnow I have selected that amount of text.\n\n100\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320\nPull.\n\n101\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.070\nOnce you get something selected and\nyou now want to not have it selected,\n\n102\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.150\nwe want to deselect, you just click off.\n\n103\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.200\nYou click off somewhere,\nI don't care where.\n\n104\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.650\nYou just go ahead and click off.\n\n105\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.415\nIt sounds like I'm saying some not\nnice things to people, aren't I?\n\n106\n00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:11.994\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n107\n00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:15.458\nnow say that five times faster cuz\nsomebody might wash your mouth out\n\n108\n00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:16.550\nwith soap.\n\n109\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n110\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.190\n[LAUGH] I'm just gonna click off\nover here in a blank area or\n\n111\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.190\nsomewhere over to the right or\nsomewhere else in the text and\n\n112\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.720\nnotice that the highlighted, somebody\ncalls it highlighting, I tend not to\n\n113\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.630\nlike use that word because there is\na highlighter in your text formatting.\n\n114\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.090\nSo when I think someone is highlighting\ntext, I think of this, not selecting it.\n\n115\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.960\nBut it's a very common word that people\nthrow around when we're selecting.\n\n116\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.280\n&gt;&gt; I'm completely guilty of that.\n\n117\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.200\nLet's just highlight the text,\nit's not technically highlight,\n\n118\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.230\nI'm selecting the text.\n\n119\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.680\nThe clicking off, I want to emphasize\nsome personal painpoints that I have.\n\n120\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.750\nIf you do some weirdness,\nbe careful, cuz you may accidentally\n\n121\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.950\nmove that stuff all over the place, if you\ndon't get outside of the selected box.\n\n122\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:10.740\n&gt;&gt; That is a perfect lead in to, yes,\nwhy am I emphasizing so much to deselect?\n\n123\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.700\nBecause there's a Dragon edit or\nedit wall dragon.\n\n124\n00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.500\nI can't honestly remember the correct term\nbut I'm gonna show you where it's at.\n\n125\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.927\nThe nice thing about in Mac,\nwhich is different than in your PC,\n\n126\n00:06:21.927 --> 00:06:25.200\nwhat he's saying is right here,\nwhat if I selected this.\n\n127\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.114\nI click hold drag.\n\n128\n00:06:27.114 --> 00:06:29.480\nI forgot the rest,\nI wanna get more of this.\n\n129\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.740\nI want to get the rest of the sentence.\n\n130\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.320\nSo, it's kind of like\na natural inclination almost,\n\n131\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.910\nlike keep going with this.\n\n132\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.800\nAnd it keeps dragging, but\nnotice, look at my cursor.\n\n133\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.980\nThat's not a I-beam, is it?\n\n134\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.810\nThat is an arrow.\n\n135\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.473\nSo, if you click and hold and\ndrag, and look this.\n\n136\n00:06:44.473 --> 00:06:50.240\nIt gives you that kind of previewing of,\nwait hold on, you got this.\n\n137\n00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.760\nAnd now when you're dragging and\nletting go down here, it's dropping this.\n\n138\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.800\nYou don't get that\nghosting effect in other,\n\n139\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.630\nnot Adobe, sorry,\nMicrosoft products for PC.\n\n140\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.928\nSo I was like,\nI'm glad they had that visual for\n\n141\n00:07:03.928 --> 00:07:05.610\nyou there to help you out a little bit.\n\n142\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.097\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's just a preview of disaster for\n\n143\n00:07:08.097 --> 00:07:10.386\nme [INAUDIBLE] cuz it's not a few words.\n\n144\n00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:13.583\nIt's usually a large blob of\ntext that I have selected.\n\n145\n00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:18.070\nI'm like, I need this last loop,\nman, I messed that up real bad.\n\n146\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.422\nSo, it's just like Ctrl+Z City and\nthen let me try again.\n\n147\n00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:24.162\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like Ctrl+Z City.\n\n148\n00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:25.920\nAnd what is Ctrl+Z?\n\n149\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.506\nUndo, yes, we talked about that\nin our introduction to Word,\n\n150\n00:07:29.506 --> 00:07:32.630\nit's a very important button\nright up here at the top.\n\n151\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.110\nIt does on our quick, what is this,\nthe quick access tool bar.\n\n152\n00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.780\nWe can click it.\n\n153\n00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.720\nBut yes, your keyboard shortcut is Cmd\n+ Z, or Ctrl + Z if you're in a PC.\n\n154\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.754\nIt is in your edit menu as well, so\n\n155\n00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:49.100\nyou could see there that it's great out\nright now cuz I don't have anything undo.\n\n156\n00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.915\nThat's always good thing.\n\n157\n00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:53.553\nSo if you didn't get all\nof it in the first try,\n\n158\n00:07:53.553 --> 00:07:56.614\nclick off it, click hold and\ndrag, and start again.\n\n159\n00:07:56.614 --> 00:07:59.531\nThat's the moral of the story.\n\n160\n00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:03.250\nIf first you don't succeed,\ntry and try again.\n\n161\n00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.582\nThis is maybe a smaller thing that,\nI know it kind bothers me a little bit,\n\n162\n00:08:08.582 --> 00:08:13.540\nbut I'm gonna zoom in a lot so\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n163\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.770\nAnd I'm gonna move on over, whoops,\nnot too much, okay, gonna try it again.\n\n164\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.224\nClick, hold, and drag, and notice when I\nstart going, do you see how it was like,\n\n165\n00:08:22.224 --> 00:08:23.000\nboom, boom?\n\n166\n00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.910\nIt's grabbing all of the words,\n\n167\n00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.850\neven though my mouse is barely\neven covering the words.\n\n168\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.660\nThat's just something it does,\nbut it is a preference, and\n\n169\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.950\nit is something you can\nturn off all together.\n\n170\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.670\nThere are some,\nI found some little tricks, here, watch.\n\n171\n00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.210\nIf I click, hold, and drag, and when we\nget to the word nothing, right there,\n\n172\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.690\nsee it pulls it all, oops,\nno I don't want that.\n\n173\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.810\nJust move your mouse back,\nI'm still holding the mouse, by the way.\n\n174\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.025\nMove it back and you see how now,\nif I start dragging,\n\n175\n00:08:54.025 --> 00:08:56.110\nit's gonna go by each character.\n\n176\n00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.470\nSo it's like, no don't,\nnope, no no no, stop.\n\n177\n00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.393\nAnd you kind of are telling it, no,\n\n178\n00:09:01.393 --> 00:09:05.130\nI'm not wanting you to grab\nthe whole word while I'm dragging.\n\n179\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.212\nIt's almost like a small reset.\n\n180\n00:09:07.212 --> 00:09:11.240\nI personally like doing that\nthan turning off the preference,\n\n181\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.446\nbut I will show you where it's at.\n\n182\n00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:18.411\nIt's in your Word &gt; Preferences,\nit's in Edit, and yeah, right there,\n\n183\n00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:21.620\nsee, Select entire word\nwhen selecting text.\n\n184\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.681\nYou can turn it off,\nif this is just driving you crazy, and\n\n185\n00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:26.633\nyou don't want it to do that, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:30.889\nThose little things that always\nbothers you so much [LAUGH] and\n\n187\n00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:34.590\nyou wanna find out how to fix it, okay?\n\n188\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:40.077\nGreat, let's move on to some more\nproductivity tips and tricks, right?\n\n189\n00:09:40.077 --> 00:09:41.770\nHow to select one word?\n\n190\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.300\nSure, click, hold, and\ndrag, or just double-click.\n\n191\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.312\nIf you double-click on any word,\nthat selects the whole word.\n\n192\n00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:54.230\nNice, that's fun, double-click,\ndouble-click, perfect.\n\n193\n00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.990\nWhat if I wanted to select\nthe whole paragraph?\n\n194\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.942\nLet me zoom out just, whoops,\nsorry, just a little bit.\n\n195\n00:09:59.942 --> 00:10:03.790\nI want this whole paragraph,\nthat's the triple-click, one, two, three,\n\n196\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.153\nyou gotta go in succession,\none, two, three.\n\n197\n00:10:06.153 --> 00:10:10.692\nOoh, everyone loves that one, that's where\nyou can select the entire paragraph.\n\n198\n00:10:10.692 --> 00:10:16.490\nAnd that means that where you hit\nthe Enter key and make a new paragraph.\n\n199\n00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.660\nThat's always a pretty fun one.\n\n200\n00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.240\nThis is another one that I like, it's\nwhere I wanted to select a sentence, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.729\nSo you can see right here, I'm clicking\nand dragging just to show you,\n\n202\n00:10:26.729 --> 00:10:28.980\nthat's one sentence, correct?\n\n203\n00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:35.370\nWell if I hold my Cmd key, and\nclick on any one word in that sentence,\n\n204\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.400\nit selects the sentence,\nthat's pretty cute.\n\n205\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.150\nAnd it is finding the punctuation, okay,\n\n206\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:46.510\nfrom the period to the next period,\nthat's what it's going to make a sentence.\n\n207\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.340\nSo if there's some kind of a weird\npunctuation there it might\n\n208\n00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.800\nthrow it off slightly.\n\n209\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.490\nBut the Ctrl + Click, sorry, [LAUGH] Cmd\n+ Click on a sentence is pretty fun.\n\n210\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.810\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, speaking of punctuation,\ndoes the paragraph work like that,\n\n211\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.920\nwe have that hidden character that we\ncan see with the show hide button.\n\n212\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.350\nIs that how it determines what to select?\n\n213\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I love this, yes, correct.\n\n214\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:12.020\nAnytime, and this is the show hide button,\nor show the non-printing characters,\n\n215\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.780\nwhich we always love to talk about.\n\n216\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.620\nAnd I'll be turning it on pretty\nmuch throughout the entire series.\n\n217\n00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.820\nAnd we did talk about this when we were,\n\n218\n00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.260\nI believe in the navigating, but\ndon't worry, I'll be doing it more too.\n\n219\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.610\nSo you can see that any time I hit\nthe Enter key, that's where it finds it.\n\n220\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.543\nSo right here, while we might treat\nthis as, this is one line, right,\n\n221\n00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:35.917\nit is a paragraph cuz\nyou hit the Enter key.\n\n222\n00:11:35.917 --> 00:11:39.307\nSo if I, I'll do it on this one because\nthis one's got a little weird formatting.\n\n223\n00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:42.230\nIf I one, two, three,\nit selects that whole paragraph.\n\n224\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.402\nSo yes it finds where there's one,\nthere's the next one,\n\n225\n00:11:46.402 --> 00:11:49.753\nthat's where it determines\nas the paragraph.\n\n226\n00:11:49.753 --> 00:11:53.084\nThe reason why I did this one, just to\nshow you, if I double click on, sorry,\n\n227\n00:11:53.084 --> 00:11:55.970\none, two, three,\nit's not grabbing the Chapter 1.\n\n228\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.894\nThat's just a technicality, really,\nbecause I actually created this in Word.\n\n229\n00:11:59.894 --> 00:12:02.977\nAnd in Word it has a certain type\nof bulleted list formatting,\n\n230\n00:12:02.977 --> 00:12:06.557\nwhere I can actually put in words\nlike Chapter 1 based on the sections.\n\n231\n00:12:06.557 --> 00:12:08.404\nPeople are like, what?\n\n232\n00:12:08.404 --> 00:12:10.098\nJust go, okay, sounds good.\n\n233\n00:12:10.098 --> 00:12:12.098\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those special character\n\n234\n00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:13.988\nthings where you're not\nreally in control of it.\n\n235\n00:12:13.988 --> 00:12:17.168\nSo it does really weird selecting and\nformatting type things,\n\n236\n00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:18.433\nam I correct about that?\n\n237\n00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:23.228\n&gt;&gt; Somewhat, it's a bulleted list,\nokay, bullets, numbers.\n\n238\n00:12:23.228 --> 00:12:28.260\nAnd you see up here up on my ribbon,\nyou see that how that number's on?\n\n239\n00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.888\nIf I just clicked this off,\nyou see that takes it off.\n\n240\n00:12:30.888 --> 00:12:35.684\nIt's kind of the same way if I had done\njust a regular bullet character, right,\n\n241\n00:12:35.684 --> 00:12:40.501\nfor that particular paragraph, cuz\nbullets are paragraph level formatting.\n\n242\n00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:42.217\nIf you're like, whoa, don't worry,\n\n243\n00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:44.440\nI have more episodes that\ngo into detail about this.\n\n244\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.891\nBut there is a specific numbering\nformat that pulls out chapters, and\n\n245\n00:12:48.891 --> 00:12:52.824\nwe'll say chapters, and\nit's based on your sections, so.\n\n246\n00:12:52.824 --> 00:12:56.636\nJust wanted to throw that out there for\nyou, in case you're wondering, so\n\n247\n00:12:56.636 --> 00:12:58.430\nthat's my explanation.\n\n248\n00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.118\nEven if you didn't understand it,\nthat's okay.\n\n249\n00:13:00.118 --> 00:13:02.627\n[LAUGH] All right, so where are we now?\n\n250\n00:13:02.627 --> 00:13:06.360\nWe went ahead and did the selection of\nthe sentence, which is one of my faves.\n\n251\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.433\nThis left area, it does not have an I-beam\nbecause this is your selection area.\n\n252\n00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:15.752\nI get so many times when people are like,\nI'm clicking off, and\n\n253\n00:13:15.752 --> 00:13:17.300\nit keeps selecting the line.\n\n254\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.190\nWell [LAUGH] that's because\nthat's what it does.\n\n255\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.208\nThe selection area,\nif you single-click in that area,\n\n256\n00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:26.313\nit's gonna hi, ooh, it's gonna select.\n\n257\n00:13:26.313 --> 00:13:28.785\n[LAUGH] I almost said the word\nthat I said I don't like to use.\n\n258\n00:13:28.785 --> 00:13:30.758\n[LAUGH] I still use it sometimes.\n\n259\n00:13:30.758 --> 00:13:33.545\nIt's going to select that whole line.\n\n260\n00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:36.169\nIf you click, hold, and drag down,\n\n261\n00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:41.092\nyou could select multiple lines,\nokay, so it gets the whole thing.\n\n262\n00:13:41.092 --> 00:13:43.274\nMaybe a little bit faster\nthat doing a click, hold, and\n\n263\n00:13:43.274 --> 00:13:46.166\ndrag across all of your text, so\nthat's a nice little thing right there.\n\n264\n00:13:46.166 --> 00:13:51.088\nSome other little shortcuts in that\nselection area, if you single-click,\n\n265\n00:13:51.088 --> 00:13:52.155\nit's one line.\n\n266\n00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:56.323\nIf you double-click,\nselects the whole paragraph.\n\n267\n00:13:56.323 --> 00:13:57.323\nJust different than, remember,\n\n268\n00:13:57.323 --> 00:13:59.520\nthe triple-clicking that's on\nthe words in the paragraph.\n\n269\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.405\nAnd then if you triple-click\nin the selection area,\n\n270\n00:14:03.405 --> 00:14:06.612\nyou're getting a select all, whoa sorry.\n\n271\n00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:10.548\nI was just trying to zoom out, to see how\nit's all blue, cuz that's the selection.\n\n272\n00:14:10.548 --> 00:14:15.810\nSo that's fun right there, of doing\na triple-click in the selection area.\n\n273\n00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.680\nSorry it's kinda rendering\nitself when I am using my\n\n274\n00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.780\nkeyboard shortcut to zoom in and out.\n\n275\n00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.080\nUsing that Ctrl and Cmd and\nthen scrolley wheel.\n\n276\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.697\nSo those are your selection areas,\npretty neat little things.\n\n277\n00:14:27.697 --> 00:14:31.942\nLet's see, ooh,\nwe're onto our keyboard shortcuts, just,\n\n278\n00:14:31.942 --> 00:14:35.690\nconsorting, is that what I'm-\n&gt;&gt; Consulting.\n\n279\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.816\n&gt;&gt; Consulting that's, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think consorting might be like you're\n\n280\n00:14:38.816 --> 00:14:41.330\nup to no good or something,\nI don't [LAUGH] know.\n\n281\n00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.460\n&gt;&gt; I know, it came out of my mouth,\nI'm like, that's not the right word.\n\n282\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.331\n&gt;&gt; Ew that just tastes bad.\n\n283\n00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:47.632\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:14:47.632 --> 00:14:50.459\n&gt;&gt; I'm consulting my notes to keyboard\n\n285\n00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:52.288\nshortcut selections.\n\n286\n00:14:52.288 --> 00:14:56.855\nThis is where it's gonna correlate in with\nall of the navigation techniques that we\n\n287\n00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:01.226\nlearned about, with the left and right\narrows, the up and down, the Page Up and\n\n288\n00:15:01.226 --> 00:15:01.900\nPage Down.\n\n289\n00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.440\nThe holding the Alt key to go ahead and\njump by words, and\n\n290\n00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.119\nthen the Cmd key to get\nto the end of the lines.\n\n291\n00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:15.091\nWell, you do all of that while you're\nholding the Shift key as well,\n\n292\n00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:20.100\nyou get to where you're selecting\ntext with your keyboard.\n\n293\n00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.995\nLet's try it, all right, let's see,\nwell first of all, where am I,\n\n294\n00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:24.556\nin the sense of like, in my document?\n\n295\n00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:28.298\nI'm gonna use my mouse, and\nthen zoom in so you guys can see this,\n\n296\n00:15:28.298 --> 00:15:32.336\nput my flashing cursor right there,\nand now let's use the keyboard.\n\n297\n00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:36.780\nBy themselves, arrow keys,\ngoing by characters.\n\n298\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:42.600\nHold that Shift key down,\narrow key over to the right,\n\n299\n00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.150\nand I'm selecting by characters, ooh fun!\n\n300\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.930\nHold down that Alt or Option key while\nyou're holding that Shift key, and\n\n301\n00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.720\nthen use the right arrow,\nI'm jumping by words.\n\n302\n00:15:55.005 --> 00:15:57.795\nI've let go of the Alt, but\nnow I can hold the Shift key.\n\n303\n00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:02.117\nGo ahead and hold the Shift and then\nyour Command key, hit the right arrow,\n\n304\n00:16:02.117 --> 00:16:06.096\ngets me all the way down to the end of\nthe line Keep holding the shift and\n\n305\n00:16:06.096 --> 00:16:07.900\ncommand and go the down arrow.\n\n306\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.900\nCollects the paragraph, and then you\ncan keep on going as far as you need.\n\n307\n00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.310\nThat whole back to,\nhey I want to go ahead and\n\n308\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.170\njust not take my hands off my keyboard.\n\n309\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.480\nFantastic way to do that.\n\n310\n00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.144\nYou can also use your page up and\npage down with your Shift key,\n\n311\n00:16:24.144 --> 00:16:27.472\nto go ahead and\nselect those chucks of text.\n\n312\n00:16:27.472 --> 00:16:31.930\nAnd the nice thing, is you can use\nall of these selection techniques.\n\n313\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.880\nThe mouse, the triple clicking or the\ndouble clicking, and then the dragging,\n\n314\n00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.420\nand all that kinda stuff.\n\n315\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.890\nIn conjunction with each other,\n\n316\n00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.800\nbecause if I went ahead and\nI've done this quite a few times.\n\n317\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.711\nWhere I'll take my mouse,\nnot using my keyboard anymore.\n\n318\n00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:48.493\nClick hold, and drag, and\nselect down to like here and\n\n319\n00:16:48.493 --> 00:16:50.621\nlike, that was just a little too much.\n\n320\n00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:54.695\nSee I really wanted to stop at\nthe word hurrying down it, and\n\n321\n00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:57.072\nnot have those other selections.\n\n322\n00:16:57.072 --> 00:17:00.727\nInstead of like de-selecting and\nstarting over,\n\n323\n00:17:00.727 --> 00:17:05.997\nI'll just go to my keyboard hold my\nshift key down using my left arrow key,\n\n324\n00:17:05.997 --> 00:17:10.860\nand then with my left arrow key I\ncan like take away that selection.\n\n325\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.390\nI can expand or contract the selection,\n\n326\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.030\nor I really needed the rest of that\nsentence, well then hold the Shift key and\n\n327\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.410\nthe Command and then hit the down\narrow and then I can get the rest.\n\n328\n00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.510\nSo, sometimes I will\nstart with the mouse and\n\n329\n00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.580\nthen switch over to the keyboard to\nkind of manipulate that section, or\n\n330\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.990\nthat selection a little bit, and it's\na lot of fun and it's a lot easier for me.\n\n331\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.030\nSo I'm usually gonna type or\ndo something to that effect.\n\n332\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.928\nSo, use them all together and\nit can make your life a lot easier.\n\n333\n00:17:39.928 --> 00:17:42.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you've messed with\nany type of audio equipment,\n\n334\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.260\nor lighting equipment, or anything,\nI think of these as course adjustment, and\n\n335\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.350\nfine grade adjustment knobs, right?\n\n336\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.760\nSo, aw I got a big slide,\nI need to back it up a little bit,\n\n337\n00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.350\nthere's your fine grade adjustment,\nthose keyboard shortcuts.\n\n338\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.760\nNow they can be used for\ncoarse adjustments, like a page up or\n\n339\n00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.670\na page down or things like that, but a lot\nof times if you're already clicking around\n\n340\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:06.450\nand grab that, too much, back-up,\njust a little bit more, go forward.\n\n341\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.901\nThat's like in my mind, just like\nan old school radio or something.\n\n342\n00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:10.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n343\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.790\n&gt;&gt; What was it the U channel,\n\n344\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.750\nand then you had the other knob that\nwent to all the little buttons.\n\n345\n00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.355\nWell, showing our age again.\n\n346\n00:18:17.355 --> 00:18:21.432\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess we're just gonna have to.\n\n347\n00:18:21.432 --> 00:18:22.072\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n348\n00:18:22.072 --> 00:18:25.372\nIt is a prominent memory of my childhood\n\n349\n00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:28.780\nof the bottom button,\nwith all the different numbers on it.\n\n350\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.630\nSo, few other little techniques\nthat I'd like to show you,\n\n351\n00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.410\nis how to select a range and\nthen how to select multiples.\n\n352\n00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.163\nThis is your Shift and your Cmd key.\n\n353\n00:18:40.163 --> 00:18:44.479\nThis is another one that works across all?\n\n354\n00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:46.719\nI don't know if I wanna\nsay all applications,\n\n355\n00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:50.396\ncuz you never know about that but\nmany applications, or even like a finder,\n\n356\n00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:54.330\nor if you're in Windows, you go ahead and\nuse your Windows Explorer.\n\n357\n00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.140\nI'd like to select a range of text.\n\n358\n00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.566\nI wanna get from here down to here.\n\n359\n00:19:01.566 --> 00:19:03.446\nI don't know if you've ever cross pages.\n\n360\n00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:05.170\nIf you do click, hold and drag.\n\n361\n00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.845\nYou do like whoa and it flips out and\nit's like no, nope stop,\n\n362\n00:19:07.845 --> 00:19:09.550\nI didn't wanna do that.\n\n363\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.696\nSo how can I not do that?\n\n364\n00:19:11.696 --> 00:19:16.720\nWell, do a start, shift and what I mean by\n\n365\n00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.810\nthat is put your cursor in the beginning\nof where you want to start your selection.\n\n366\n00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.520\nJust scroll on down or navigate however,\n\n367\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.030\nI'm scrolling down that's\nnot moving my cursor.\n\n368\n00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:28.890\nScrolling on down.\n\n369\n00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.610\nThis is where I want the ending\nof my selection to be.\n\n370\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:38.926\nHold your Shift key, click once at the end\nand it'll select everything in-between.\n\n371\n00:19:38.926 --> 00:19:44.077\nSo that start, Shift, end will select\nthe range of everything in-between.\n\n372\n00:19:44.077 --> 00:19:49.870\nAgain, files, a whole bunch of stuff\nthat can happen with your shift click,\n\n373\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.080\nwhich is quite lovely.\n\n374\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.350\nI'm gonna turn these paragraph signs\noff or the non-printing characters,\n\n375\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.680\njust for a little bit.\n\n376\n00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.150\nAnd my other favorite,\n\n377\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:02.805\nis being able to select non-contiguous\nvariable amounts of text.\n\n378\n00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:05.679\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whoo Vonne,\n\n379\n00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:10.169\nthat a little mouth [INAUDIBLE] see,\nit just broke me up.\n\n380\n00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:11.539\n[INAUDIBLE] I don't know.\n\n381\n00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:12.519\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n382\n00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:15.788\ncuz he was just looking around and\nthat was a lot of words.\n\n383\n00:20:15.788 --> 00:20:17.994\n&gt;&gt; Non-continuous variable, what?\n\n384\n00:20:17.994 --> 00:20:19.678\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n385\n00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:24.380\nMultiple pieces if you wanna say\nthat are not next to each other.\n\n386\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.180\nNon contiguous.\n\n387\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.000\nMeaning, if I wanna slit the word Alice.\n\n388\n00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.040\nDouble click.\nI'm just using the shortcut.\n\n389\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.897\nHold my command key, double click on Dina,\n\n390\n00:20:34.897 --> 00:20:39.380\ndouble click on cats,\ndouble click on dozing.\n\n391\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.070\nYou see how I'm selecting those four\nwords that aren't next to each other.\n\n392\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.850\nThey're multiples and\nI'm not using the range.\n\n393\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.120\nYou can't get that any other way,\nunless you hold your command key down.\n\n394\n00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.940\nIn Windows, it's controlled to\ngo ahead and select multiples.\n\n395\n00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.310\nI do this a lot, especially for\nthings like this.\n\n396\n00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.693\nIf I want to select this line, single\nclick out in the selection area hold my\n\n397\n00:21:05.693 --> 00:21:08.685\ncommand, single click here,\nsingle click here,\n\n398\n00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:12.948\nsingle click here because I wanna change\nthem all to red or what have you.\n\n399\n00:21:12.948 --> 00:21:16.408\nTo get your multiple selected\ndo what you need to do.\n\n400\n00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:19.198\nClick off of it, but\ntechnically you use the styles,\n\n401\n00:21:19.198 --> 00:21:21.679\nbecause that [INAUDIBLE]\nstyles are really fun.\n\n402\n00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:26.860\n[INAUDIBLE], that's the thing that\nyou can do and it's a lot of fun.\n\n403\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.120\nI'm going to make one little caveat,\nnot caveat,\n\n404\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.670\nI'm just gonna do a little asterisk on\nthe bottom of this, probably not gonna\n\n405\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:41.310\nhave this happen to you, but this was\ndriving me crazy for the last week.\n\n406\n00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:46.390\nI couldn't use the Cmd+click to select\na sentence, and I couldn't use the Cmd\n\n407\n00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.730\nkey to select multiple or\nvariable amounts of non contiguous text.\n\n408\n00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:51.760\nDrive me crazy.\n\n409\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.900\nI'm like, I know you can do this.\n\n410\n00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.120\nI know you can, because I've done\nthis before in Office format,\n\n411\n00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.480\nthe whole nine, what is going on?\n\n412\n00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.980\nFreaking me out.\n\n413\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.530\nAnd I'm like, did they change this?\n\n414\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.600\nNo.\n\n415\n00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.370\nAnd these links are in the show\nnotes in case you wanna know.\n\n416\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.720\nAnd at the time of the recording,\nthis is pretty recent.\n\n417\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.240\nAnd it's like multiple selects.\n\n418\n00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.160\nIt's like, can't multiple select with\nthe Ctrl+Click, what's going on?\n\n419\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.620\nBlah, blah, blah, bah.\n\n420\n00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.750\nYeah, it's a known bug that\nwas in whatever update or\n\n421\n00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:31.490\nwhatever thing that they had pushed out,\nthat basically broke that functionality.\n\n422\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.420\nAnd, you know how this goes Justin.\n\n423\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.090\nI mean I scoured this for an hour.\n\n424\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.240\nCuz I couldn't find anything.\n\n425\n00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.110\nBut also look at what they said.\n\n426\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.160\nHighlighting, selecting text.\n\n427\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.900\nI was trying to put in like, what in\nGoogle is going to bring this up, and\n\n428\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:52.490\nwhen I finally reused the word\nhighlighting it brought me to this forum.\n\n429\n00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:57.775\nAnd it finally explained, yes, it's\na major bug in the versions of office or\n\n430\n00:22:57.775 --> 00:23:02.081\nthe office and I as my gosh, and\nI was so excited to go ahead and\n\n431\n00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:05.819\ntell you guys at this point,\nthis what the problem is,\n\n432\n00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:10.320\nif you can't do this you'll be okay,\nwell guess what?\n\n433\n00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.328\nI went in, I came into work this morning\nupdates, updates, updates and it's fixed.\n\n434\n00:23:14.328 --> 00:23:17.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I feel like it's be getting a lot\n\n435\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.050\nof traffic.\n\n436\n00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.740\nLike hey, why's this not working anymore?\n\n437\n00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.260\nAnd this is a fairly utilitarian and\nI can't say i'm gonna need this line,\n\n438\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.660\nthis line, I'm gonna grab this, and so\n\n439\n00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.301\nI use this as well,\nthat's why you should run updates.\n\n440\n00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:34.430\nThat's a perfect reason, updates, done.\n\n441\n00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.728\nThere's a lot of people working\non the Office products in various\n\n442\n00:23:36.728 --> 00:23:37.530\nMicrosoft products.\n\n443\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.387\nSo, I figured it would be soon.\n\n444\n00:23:39.387 --> 00:23:41.511\nI was like, I wonder how she fixed it.\n\n445\n00:23:41.511 --> 00:23:44.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then well, it was an update.\n\n446\n00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, Microsoft fixed it for me.\n\n447\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.051\nThis morning, it was one of those,\n\n448\n00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:52.413\nlike cuz it's the auto-updates that happen\nand it had OneNote, Excel, and I saw Word\n\n449\n00:23:52.413 --> 00:23:56.272\nin that list cuz sometimes it just has\nlike one product, and I'm like okay.\n\n450\n00:23:56.272 --> 00:23:59.656\nBut I saw Word there and I'm like nuh-uh,\nare they really going to fix this\n\n451\n00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:02.896\non the day that I'm going to record\nthis episode about selecting text?\n\n452\n00:24:02.896 --> 00:24:05.906\nYes, it did, and it works,\nand I'm so happy, and\n\n453\n00:24:05.906 --> 00:24:10.036\none of the things I'll go ahead and\nthrow out there, in these forums,\n\n454\n00:24:10.036 --> 00:24:13.430\nwhat they said,\nis like it was the feedback button.\n\n455\n00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.460\nSo just to remind you, let me show\nyou down here where this little guy,\n\n456\n00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.890\nremember we introduced this when\nwe were doing like the interface.\n\n457\n00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.990\nTell me what's like, what can be better?\n\n458\n00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.510\nA bet you there's a bunch\nof people being like, what,\n\n459\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.256\nhey this is broken, you gonna fix it?\n\n460\n00:24:27.256 --> 00:24:28.930\n[LAUGH] And they did.\n\n461\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:34.528\nSo they do listen, and it also a testament\nto Using your Office 365 subscriptions,\n\n462\n00:24:34.528 --> 00:24:37.227\ninstead of buying like a single product.\n\n463\n00:24:37.227 --> 00:24:41.222\nThey're always gonna be pushing out\nthose patches, and those updates,\n\n464\n00:24:41.222 --> 00:24:42.903\nand it's a really good thing.\n\n465\n00:24:42.903 --> 00:24:46.322\nSo, my life became much\neasier this morning,\n\n466\n00:24:46.322 --> 00:24:51.830\nwhen I could go ahead and show you\nwithout saying this usually works.\n\n467\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.240\nI just don't know why it's not working.\n\n468\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.857\nI found why, and\nI also went ahead and got it.\n\n469\n00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.292\nThank you Microsoft for doing a great job.\n\n470\n00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:03.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's definitely a teachable,\n\n471\n00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:06.370\nI'll get that out in just a moment.\n\n472\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:11.490\nBecause these things do happen, so\nconsult the Microsoft forms, and\n\n473\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:16.695\nmake sure you validate it, and verify,\nand kind of lastly security and\n\n474\n00:25:16.695 --> 00:25:20.802\nbug fixes,\nperfect reasons to run updates regularly.\n\n475\n00:25:20.802 --> 00:25:23.934\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and I just did wanna throw\nus that one more time into my computer,\n\n476\n00:25:23.934 --> 00:25:26.260\nexcept I just wanted to point\nthis out in case, your like,\n\n477\n00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.366\nmine is still not working.\n\n478\n00:25:27.366 --> 00:25:32.180\nNotice my version right now is 15.39.\n\n479\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.050\nSo if you're past that, and\nby the way what I did, I went to Word,\n\n480\n00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.190\nwent to About Word to pull up.\n\n481\n00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.555\nSo this is the most recent version that\nI have, and that was the numbering I\n\n482\n00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:43.668\nwanted to show you, so just in case\nit's a place where you can find.\n\n483\n00:25:43.668 --> 00:25:46.611\nAnd that's where going\nout into these forums and\n\n484\n00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:51.291\nlooking for, it's this version that\nis broken but this version's fine.\n\n485\n00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:53.670\nNow you know where to find your versions.\n\n486\n00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.380\nAnd then you can go ahead and do some\ndetective work, and all that good stuff.\n\n487\n00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.405\nSo, all right, now I'm done.\n\n488\n00:25:59.405 --> 00:26:00.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You must have read my mind.\n\n489\n00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.270\nI was like,\nI feel like Columbo a little bit.\n\n490\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.300\nBut there you have it,\nfolks, selecting text.\n\n491\n00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.970\nYou thought it was simple, but\n\n492\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:11.870\nit's actually a whole lot of tools\nthat will make you more productive.\n\n493\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.750\nSo thank you so much for that Vonne.\n\n494\n00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.410\nAnd, well we got more Microsoft Word\n2016 Essentials for Mac coming at'cha.\n\n495\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.197\nBut for this episode, we are done.\n\n496\n00:26:20.197 --> 00:26:22.996\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap it up,\nso signing off for OfficeProTV,\n\n497\n00:26:22.996 --> 00:26:24.568\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n498\n00:26:24.568 --> 00:26:25.567\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n499\n00:26:25.567 --> 00:26:27.535\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

The official name of that character\nis the octothorpe, by the way.\n\n88\n00:04:56.024 --> 00:04:56.538\n&gt;&gt; Woah, what?\n\n89\n00:04:56.538 --> 00:05:00.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it is technically\nan octothorpe, and not that pound.\n\n90\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.270\nPeople call it that,\nthat's how we use it colloquially,\n\n91\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.900\nbut it is the octothorpe character.\n\n92\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.737\n&gt;&gt; I had no idea [LAUGH].\n\n93\n00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:09.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The more you know.\n\n94\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.267\n&gt;&gt; RIght [LAUGH].\n\n95\n00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:11.798\nSo how about going on those rabbit holes,\nright?\n\n96\n00:05:11.798 --> 00:05:13.462\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n97\n00:05:13.462 --> 00:05:14.287\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay,\n\n98\n00:05:14.287 --> 00:05:17.120\nI had no idea that that's what it is.\n\n99\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.238\nWe'll just call it the pound sign,\noctothorpe, there you go.\n\n100\n00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.300\n[LAUGH] So I have these different\ncharacters that you can do.\n\n101\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.270\nNow, what if I wanted to\nget down to the next line?\n\n102\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.900\nMeaning, I wanna make a paragraph,\nyou hit the Enter key.\n\n103\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.900\nNow when you hit the Enter key, you're\nalso making, a carriage return, right?\n\n104\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.650\nWe're moving the carriage, we're talking\nabout back on our old type writers that is\n\n105\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.980\nmoving back to the beginning of a line and\ndown one.\n\n106\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.341\nSo we indicated that as a hard return or\na regular paragraph,\n\n107\n00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:53.626\nour Show/Hide character buttons,\nright, we love this.\n\n108\n00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:57.307\nGod, always show your non printing\ncharacters, very, very important.\n\n109\n00:05:57.307 --> 00:06:03.525\nSo you can always see that right here,\nI've got the spaces and the enters.\n\n110\n00:06:03.525 --> 00:06:06.540\nI'm gonna throw it out right now,\nbut we'll talk more about it later.\n\n111\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.760\nIn Mac, you notice how when I hit Enter,\nlike I'm not making the spacing.\n\n112\n00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.807\nIf you're again, bilingual and you go back\nfrom Word on PC versus Word on a Mac.\n\n113\n00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:21.100\nWord on a PC does that kinda spacing\nafter each paragraph, which I love.\n\n114\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.770\nThis doesn't do it.\n\n115\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.477\nThat's all right, we can talk more\nabout styles and styles, that's later.\n\n116\n00:06:26.477 --> 00:06:30.813\nAnd if I type in some more information,\nhow about I just go ahead and\n\n117\n00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:36.100\ntype in my first name that always gonna\ntell me I've got some spelling mistakes.\n\n118\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.180\nThere is something else that is\na soft return or a line break.\n\n119\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.690\nIf you hit the Enter key by yourself or\nthe Return key, you're making a paragraph,\n\n120\n00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.010\nlike we just said.\n\n121\n00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.010\nHold your Shift key down and\nthen click the return,\n\n122\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.820\ndo you see how that is not the same thing?\n\n123\n00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.420\nYou see, and we'll just type in Justin,\njust for fun.\n\n124\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.478\nIt all looks like the same line, right?\n\n125\n00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:04.170\nOne, two, three lines.\n\n126\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.290\nRight here,\nthere are technically only two paragraphs.\n\n127\n00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:13.160\nThis, right here, has a manual\nline break that breaks the line,\n\n128\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.880\nbut not the paragraph.\n\n129\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.840\nThat's huge.\n\n130\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.700\nIt's a big thing when you're\ndoing paragraph level formatting.\n\n131\n00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.710\nIf I was trying to format\nthis as a bulleted list,\n\n132\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.530\nI would only get a bullet here and\na bullet here, right here.\n\n133\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.274\nI would not get a bullet here cuz\nthat's not a change in paragraph.\n\n134\n00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:34.387\nI hope you're seeing now why showing\nnon-printing characters is very,\n\n135\n00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.391\nvery important.\n\n136\n00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:39.578\nBecause there's a bunch of things\nthat are in our character set and\n\n137\n00:07:39.578 --> 00:07:44.438\nthings that we're gonna talk about that\nare really more of like a direction,\n\n138\n00:07:44.438 --> 00:07:49.112\na formality if you wanna say,\nlike the Shift+Enter making a line break.\n\n139\n00:07:49.112 --> 00:07:52.607\nThe space, the Enter, all of that stuff.\n\n140\n00:07:52.607 --> 00:07:55.945\nThose are things that still kind\nof work within us typing and\n\n141\n00:07:55.945 --> 00:08:00.210\nusing computers in general is like,\nwhere you're going to go.\n\n142\n00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.526\nI'm gonna hit Enter a couple\nmore times just for fun.\n\n143\n00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:05.350\nThe Tab key, the Tab key.\n\n144\n00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.174\nTab stops another one of my favorite\nsubjects, full episodes on those two.\n\n145\n00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:16.360\nJustin this kind of throws out,\nwhen you think of the tab key,\n\n146\n00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.590\nhow many spaces does that bring you in?\n\n147\n00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm gonna be honest with\nyou Vonne, I use some text editors\n\n148\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.250\nbecause there's some things that I do that\nrequire, it's just easier to hit the Tab.\n\n149\n00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.980\nBut I use what's called\nsoft spacing where I\n\n150\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.805\nmight programmatically change\nthe tab character to four spaces.\n\n151\n00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:39.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm not saying that's right, but\n\n152\n00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.830\nit works in my work flow, so, am I right?\n\n153\n00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.850\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n154\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.850\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; Well, well, it's gray, yeah, so\n\n155\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.640\nwe talk about this in the other episode.\n\n156\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.540\nAnd there's a whole episode in my favorite\nshow of Silicon Valley that talks\n\n157\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.500\nabout the difference between spaces and\ntabs and\n\n158\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.500\nhe breaks up with a girl because she\nuses tabs instead of spaces and.\n\n159\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.343\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a programmer thing because yes,\n\n160\n00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:09.680\nlike do you want to program your text\neditor to do a, when you hit the Tab\n\n161\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.450\ncreate spaces instead of a tab character\nAnd if you're doing programming,\n\n162\n00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.070\nthere are reasons why you want\nto use that verses others.\n\n163\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.950\nAnyways, don't want to get annoyed about\nthat, but throwing that down into like,\n\n164\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.930\nI remember back in the day, showing our\nages again, it would be five spaces.\n\n165\n00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.030\nIf on a typewriter, you would hit it,\n\n166\n00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:36.080\nit was also go a set five spaces,\nno matter where you're at, right.\n\n167\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.990\nThat's just what the typewriter did.\n\n168\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.630\nPeople still hold on to that, but\n\n169\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.690\nthat's not entirely true if you're\nusing this as a word processor.\n\n170\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.610\nLet's look.\n\n171\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.558\nIf I hit the Tab key,\nThat's a tab, that is not this.\n\n172\n00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:57.130\nBut if I turn this off,\nyou wouldn't know any difference, right.\n\n173\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.710\nThis is a tab, these are spaces.\n\n174\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:04.010\nLet's just jump down one paragraph,\nTab, Tab, to me,\n\n175\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.750\nthat looks like five spaces, right.\n\n176\n00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.740\nIt's really correlating to\nyour ruler up here at the top.\n\n177\n00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.490\nAnd I have this on my View tab, if you\ngo to View, Ruler if it's not turned on.\n\n178\n00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.520\nIt's jumping every half inch, see?\n\n179\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.430\nAnd don't do what I'm doing,\n\n180\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.030\nI'm just giving this as a visual\nspacing of every half inch.\n\n181\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.260\nThat's where the tab is going to jump and\nstop.\n\n182\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.960\nTake a look, if I typed in Vonne,\nhit the Tab key, whoa, where are we?\n\n183\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.013\nIf I typed in Hi, Tab, that's\na totally different space, isn't it?\n\n184\n00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:44.780\nJustinin, [LAUGH], Justinine, right?\n\n185\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.455\n&gt;&gt; Justinine.\n\n186\n00:10:45.455 --> 00:10:46.328\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Justinine.\n\n187\n00:10:46.328 --> 00:10:49.556\n[LAUGH] No that's like, wait a second, so\n\n188\n00:10:49.556 --> 00:10:53.990\nthat's the thing of like,\nthis is a tab same as this.\n\n189\n00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.930\nA completely different\nspacing going on there\n\n190\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.220\nbecause that's a tab's\nwork in word processing.\n\n191\n00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.950\nIt jumps to every defined default\ntab stop, and if you go past\n\n192\n00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:11.340\na certain tab stop, it's gonna go to\nthe next half-inch defined tab stop.\n\n193\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.040\nThat's how it really works\nin Word in the processing.\n\n194\n00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.830\n&gt;&gt; So I can see this becoming a problem,\nespecially with monospace fonts,\n\n195\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.860\nwhere you don't have\nuniform character widths.\n\n196\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.900\nDefinitely stop me if I misuse\nany type of terminology.\n\n197\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.810\nThen you're going to have inconsistent\nspaces based on whatever characters you\n\n198\n00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.850\ntyped prior to hitting Tab, right?\n\n199\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n200\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.510\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm about to go into\nfull-on panic mode here.\n\n201\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.580\nWhich brings up a second point,\nis it always half an inch or\n\n202\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.090\nis it based on like the size\nof the font that you have?\n\n203\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.900\nIs it scaled per the font size?\n\n204\n00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n205\n00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.740\nI mean it's all scalable,\n\n206\n00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.670\nit's like what it is on the ruler, if this\nis a half inch, you know if I took this,\n\n207\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.290\nlet's go ahead and take this and\nlet's make this 36.\n\n208\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.480\nAnd I type in Vonne,\n\n209\n00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.840\nit went to the two inch mark,\nright because that's the tab.\n\n210\n00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.990\nThat's where it's stopping, so\n\n211\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.840\nthis one, it stopped here, right,\nbecause my font is smaller.\n\n212\n00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.680\nThis font is bigger,\nit's gonna stop the next default tab stop.\n\n213\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.920\nAnd yes,\nthe half inch is a default in Word.\n\n214\n00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.860\nCan you change those, can you modify\nwhere your tab stops, yes you can.\n\n215\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.690\nYou can totally do that, but\nit is a functionality that\n\n216\n00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.390\ncan get people really kind of\ntwisted into what's going on.\n\n217\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.140\nWhy did I have to hit\none tab at this point,\n\n218\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.730\ntwo tabs at this point to get the same\namount of space or so on and so forth.\n\n219\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.300\nI think it's backwards.\n\n220\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.816\nI did two tabs the first time,\none tab the second time,\n\n221\n00:12:44.816 --> 00:12:47.796\nall based on where the default tabs stop.\n\n222\n00:12:47.796 --> 00:12:52.252\n&gt;&gt; Well this further confirms my\ninclination to replace tabs with spaces.\n\n223\n00:12:52.252 --> 00:12:53.452\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, thanks for\n\n224\n00:12:53.452 --> 00:12:56.710\nletting me know I have made a good\nchoice in my personal life.\n\n225\n00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:01.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you sent me a document with\nthat, I would be cursing your name.\n\n226\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.808\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I format text in tab stops, so\n\n227\n00:13:03.808 --> 00:13:07.760\nif you don't have tabs,\nI can't format with tab stops.\n\n228\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.780\nAnd that's gonna drive me pretty\nbatty especially if I'm supposed\n\n229\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.723\nto be making tables out of\nyour spacey thing over there.\n\n230\n00:13:14.723 --> 00:13:16.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, not cool.\n\n231\n00:13:16.382 --> 00:13:21.093\n[LAUGH] But again, the Show/Hide\ncharacters is very important to understand\n\n232\n00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:25.082\nwhat is actually happening when\nyou're inputting characters or\n\n233\n00:13:25.082 --> 00:13:28.650\nkeys on your keyboard,\nwhich is very, very, very good.\n\n234\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:34.650\nAll right, now we have a lot of keys\non the keyboard like I know you\n\n235\n00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.510\nknow this one Justin, your double pipes,\nis that what we call that character?\n\n236\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI just call it a vertical pipe, but\n\n237\n00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.970\nit typically semantic meaning depending\non its use, so the or operator.\n\n238\n00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.090\nIt's an operator of type.\n\n239\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.530\n&gt;&gt; What about that one?\n\n240\n00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.960\nThat's ampersand ampersand\nwhich stands for and, alright,\n\n241\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.234\nwe're getting into Boolean logic.\n\n242\n00:13:52.234 --> 00:13:54.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of freaking me out.\n\n243\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you guys are like,\nwhat, what's Boolean logic?\n\n244\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.930\nNo, don't worry about it, it's just\nreally more like what he does with\n\n245\n00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.720\nprogramming and everything,\nlike JavaScript, right.\n\n246\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.560\nOf how you type in the code to\nactually mean if it's red or\n\n247\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.900\ngreen then make a sound, or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n248\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.950\nBut I don't know if that's exactly right,\nbut it's along that same logic.\n\n249\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.020\nSo yeah, there's all these keys we talk\nabout the squiggly brackets versus\n\n250\n00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.000\nthe curly braces,\nwhich they're the same thing.\n\n251\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.790\nAnd then the angle brackets,\nall of these different characters,\n\n252\n00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.750\nyes these are things that you can\nuse at your keyboard to input.\n\n253\n00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.790\nBut there others that you can do, like for\n\n254\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:37.280\nexample what if I need to put in\nthe trademark symbol, right, or the TM or\n\n255\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.050\nthe R with circle around it,\nor the copyright, right.\n\n256\n00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:47.810\nI need to have those things,\nthose are symbols, those are characters\n\n257\n00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:52.980\nthat you can use, 169,\nthat's the copyright.\n\n258\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.370\n&gt;&gt; No, so most of the time I have to\neither look those up inside of Word, or\n\n259\n00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:02.800\nI'm using other environments where I\nknow the corresponding characters or\n\n260\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.310\ncharacter combinations for those.\n\n261\n00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, getting into some of the techy\nstuff we'll be in just a minute.\n\n262\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.731\nBut yes I have other symbols\nthat I can insert, so\n\n263\n00:15:12.731 --> 00:15:16.321\nif I go over to my\nInside tab on my Ribbon,\n\n264\n00:15:16.321 --> 00:15:21.090\ngo all the way over to right and\ngo to Advanced Symbol.\n\n265\n00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.760\nI don't know why they\ncall it Advanced Symbol,\n\n266\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.300\nbecause actually it's not advanced, but\nthen it brings up the dialog box where I\n\n267\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.300\ncan find special characters and\nthey are really small.\n\n268\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.260\nYou can't make them bigger, but do you see\nright there, that's the copyright symbol.\n\n269\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.570\nSee I said 169, I know this cuz this is\nthe thing I've been teaching for years and\n\n270\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.283\nyears and years and years.\n\n271\n00:15:41.283 --> 00:15:43.872\n&gt;&gt;

So\nbinary can just be whatever it may be.\n\n344\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:14.076\nBut if we have 8-bit binary,\nthen we have a set of 8 and\n\n345\n00:20:14.076 --> 00:20:18.331\nthat can represent up to,\nif it's starting at 0, and\n\n346\n00:20:18.331 --> 00:20:22.510\nno negative numbers,\nit can represent up to 255.\n\n347\n00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:27.670\nIf you have two sets of 8, two octets,\nthen I think that's 16 bits,\n\n348\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.204\nwhich is 2 to the 16, which is 65,536.\n\n349\n00:20:31.204 --> 00:20:33.298\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\nthat number just came up again, yes.\n\n350\n00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:34.591\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n\n351\n00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:39.250\n&gt;&gt; And this is where you start talking\nabout, okay, 1s and 0s, on and off.\n\n352\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.213\nThat's 2, right, well 2 to the 8th, right,\n\n353\n00:20:42.213 --> 00:20:46.820\nis that 256 minus the 1 because\nof that whole 0 thing, whatever.\n\n354\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.297\nAnd then you just said 2 to the 16,\neverything is in your sets of 8, and\n\n355\n00:20:51.297 --> 00:20:55.502\nthat's why we have 8-bit,\n16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit.\n\n356\n00:20:55.502 --> 00:21:00.578\nThese are things that you might have heard\nof in either games, operating systems.\n\n357\n00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:04.566\nCuz everything in a computer\nis based off two.\n\n358\n00:21:04.566 --> 00:21:10.010\nAnd then how many powers or how many to\nthe whatevers that it goes ahead and does.\n\n359\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.949\nAnd that's when we started with our\ninputs in computers back in the day.\n\n360\n00:21:13.949 --> 00:21:18.187\nAnd I have references in the show notes\nthat go to some Wikipedia articles that\n\n361\n00:21:18.187 --> 00:21:20.640\nare pretty cool to start looking at.\n\n362\n00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.710\nYou had only a certain amount of\nthings that you could type in.\n\n363\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.395\nWell, the more things advanced,\nyou get in from 8-bit to 16-bit.\n\n364\n00:21:28.395 --> 00:21:32.040\nWell then you're gonna have\na whole set of other characters.\n\n365\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.863\nBesides just like a comma or a colon and\nan A, you can get into those Cyrillic\n\n366\n00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:39.445\ncharacters, you can get into things like,\nwith Russian languages,\n\n367\n00:21:39.445 --> 00:21:43.288\nMiddle Eastern languages, all those\ndifferent things that you can have.\n\n368\n00:21:43.288 --> 00:21:47.355\nAnd that's where we start\ntalking character sets, and\n\n369\n00:21:47.355 --> 00:21:51.790\nwhat the characters\nare allowed within that set.\n\n370\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.087\nThere's I mentioned that OpenType font,\nthis is where,\n\n371\n00:21:55.087 --> 00:21:59.900\nthe thing that I wanna emphasize\nwithin this episode, Mac versus PC.\n\n372\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.731\nYou will always, no matter how\nmuch each one of these program or\n\n373\n00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:06.782\nthese platforms advance,\nthey're different.\n\n374\n00:22:06.782 --> 00:22:08.712\nThey're very, very different.\n\n375\n00:22:08.712 --> 00:22:12.865\nAnd I don't think we'll ever really\nget over all of that will we?\n\n376\n00:22:12.865 --> 00:22:14.969\nBecause it's just not.\n\n377\n00:22:14.969 --> 00:22:19.569\n&gt;&gt; I would say, my gut instinct,\nthere will always be residual kind of\n\n378\n00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:25.074\ndifferences that persist for some amount\nof time, a fairly long amount of time.\n\n379\n00:22:25.074 --> 00:22:29.634\nAnd you're talking about some of these\ncharacter sets and even most recently,\n\n380\n00:22:29.634 --> 00:22:32.229\nthere's been some,\nthis is a Mac only font.\n\n381\n00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:35.541\nAnd then if you have a document\nthat's saved with that font and\n\n382\n00:22:35.541 --> 00:22:39.552\nit comes over here and its not available,\nthen you get some weirdness, and\n\n383\n00:22:39.552 --> 00:22:41.474\nthat can happen in character sets.\n\n384\n00:22:41.474 --> 00:22:45.134\nThat has happened to me during some\nprogramming, cuz people put emojis and\n\n385\n00:22:45.134 --> 00:22:47.352\nthings as part of\nan expanded character set.\n\n386\n00:22:47.352 --> 00:22:52.220\nBut then the programming language that\nI'm using only supports a small subset,\n\n387\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.030\nso you get these weird [SOUND],\njust garbled looking stuff.\n\n388\n00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.071\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nthis gets into some like encodings, right?\n\n389\n00:22:58.071 --> 00:23:02.360\nCuz I know when I do some, the limited\namount of programming that I do,\n\n390\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.890\nyou have to set your bases like we're\nusing UTF-8 or we're using blah.\n\n391\n00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.641\nIt's all right,\nno matter stuff that's come in or out,\n\n392\n00:23:10.641 --> 00:23:15.269\nthis is the set of encoding that\nwe're going to do for our characters.\n\n393\n00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:17.966\nThere's a bunch of them in there, but\n\n394\n00:23:17.966 --> 00:23:22.112\nit's just that we're agreeing\nto talk in this language.\n\n395\n00:23:22.112 --> 00:23:25.960\nAnd PCs and Macs will always\ntalk in different languages.\n\n396\n00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.598\nNo matter how cross-platform compatible\nwe can get with our OpenType fonts,\n\n397\n00:23:30.598 --> 00:23:35.024\nthat was whole thing that happened with\nit's either Microsoft and Adobe or\n\n398\n00:23:35.024 --> 00:23:37.288\nAdobe and Apple, way back in the day.\n\n399\n00:23:37.288 --> 00:23:41.544\nI say that now, where they went ahead and\nsaid, okay this whole font thing,\n\n400\n00:23:41.544 --> 00:23:43.220\nwe can't have this anymore.\n\n401\n00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.720\nAt least we're gonna try to avoid it.\n\n402\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.481\nSo they made the OpenType font\nfile to where it's one font\n\n403\n00:23:49.481 --> 00:23:52.368\nthat goes across both platforms.\n\n404\n00:23:52.368 --> 00:23:55.149\nAnd that's where you can have\nsome goodness that happens,\n\n405\n00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:57.050\nespecially within the printing world.\n\n406\n00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:02.315\nBut that being said,\nit's all about if you input text\n\n407\n00:24:02.315 --> 00:24:07.580\ninto Word on a Mac, and\nyou send it to somebody on a PC,\n\n408\n00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.270\n98% of the time, you'll probably be okay.\n\n409\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:17.520\nBut there are times where it just\ndoes some weird things, doesn't it?\n\n410\n00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.600\nRight, because of how this happens.\n\n411\n00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.440\nAnd I want to talk about one, that I've\npersonally experienced many times and\n\n412\n00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.888\nwe talked about this before the episode,\nnon-breaking space.\n\n413\n00:24:29.888 --> 00:24:31.963\nNon-breaking spaces.\n\n414\n00:24:31.963 --> 00:24:34.130\nOkay, [LAUGH] what's that mean?\n\n415\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.380\nLet's jump down in here.\n\n416\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.990\nWe went ahead and said that if we hit\nthe space, the space is a space, right?\n\n417\n00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.960\nThat's what it is,\nthere's nothing with that, right?\n\n418\n00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.630\nWell if I go into insert\nspecial characters.\n\n419\n00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.430\nAnd I honestly don't know, no, I know\nwhere it's at, special characters here.\n\n420\n00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.983\nYou see there is all these\nnon-breaking space, and\n\n421\n00:24:51.983 --> 00:24:55.950\nit says Ctrl+Shift+Space Bar,\nthat's our shortcut.\n\n422\n00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.685\nIf I wanna put that in,\nthat's an essentially,\n\n423\n00:24:58.685 --> 00:25:02.773\nI'm gonna put a couple of them in,\nthat's essentially the same thing.\n\n424\n00:25:02.773 --> 00:25:06.660\nAnd I'm using the shortcut\nof Ctrl+Shift+Space Bar.\n\n425\n00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.650\nAll right?\nSo that's just designating white space.\n\n426\n00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.920\nNo, they're not the same.\n\n427\n00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.170\nThe space and the non-breaking space\nare two different types of characters.\n\n428\n00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:21.880\nAnd how different operating systems,\nor different coding levels\n\n429\n00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.790\ntreat that non-breaking space can be\nweird, and I've had this happen to me.\n\n430\n00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.110\nAnd by the way,\nI don't remember it ever looking like a,\n\n431\n00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.200\nwhat we'd call it, sideways looking eye?\n\n432\n00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.360\n&gt;&gt; It looks like somebody's\nlooking at you sideways, and\n\n433\n00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.680\nraising his eyebrow like this.\n\n434\n00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.058\nI'm looking at you.\n\n435\n00:25:35.058 --> 00:25:36.258\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n436\n00:25:36.258 --> 00:25:41.900\nWell, did some research into this,\nand this is where I had this.\n\n437\n00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:47.401\nRight there, it's saying here, notice that\non our more recent versions of Word for\n\n438\n00:25:47.401 --> 00:25:50.230\nMac, you're gonna get\nnon-breaking spaces like this.\n\n439\n00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.757\nI've always seen it like this.\n\n440\n00:25:51.757 --> 00:25:54.180\nWhere back on my old job,\nI was on a PC, right.\n\n441\n00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.938\nI had somebody that I was\nworking with that was on a Mac.\n\n442\n00:25:57.938 --> 00:26:02.082\nUsed Word for Mac,and I was on Windows,\nI almost said Windows for Mac,\n\n443\n00:26:02.082 --> 00:26:03.201\n[LAUGH] Word for PC.\n\n444\n00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:05.686\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he would send me those files, and\n\n445\n00:26:05.686 --> 00:26:09.947\nI would get so many of these\nnon-breaking spaces in his document and\n\n446\n00:26:09.947 --> 00:26:11.800\nwhat is going on there?\n\n447\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:17.650\nAnd that's where I noticed that this\nis the whole older versions of Word for\n\n448\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:22.628\nMac translates into non-breaking\nspaces on Windows like this.\n\n449\n00:26:22.628 --> 00:26:25.818\nIt's probably cuz he copied\nit out of a webpage, and\n\n450\n00:26:25.818 --> 00:26:28.584\nwebpages use a lot of non-breaking spaces.\n\n451\n00:26:28.584 --> 00:26:30.027\nBecause in Web, you can't,\n\n452\n00:26:30.027 --> 00:26:34.027\nin HTML you can't have it render more than\none white space if you're typing it in.\n\n453\n00:26:34.027 --> 00:26:37.080\nYou have to designate\na special character like this.\n\n454\n00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.050\nSo this was a kind of a whole new thing\nI'm like wow, that's really interesting.\n\n455\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.340\nOkay, that's, that's what we've got.\n\n456\n00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.082\nSo those non-breaking or\nthose non-breaking spaces, and\n\n457\n00:26:47.082 --> 00:26:51.080\nspecial characters in general,\nit's just what it is.\n\n458\n00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.090\nAnd that, those numbers that we saw\non the copyright, that 169, and you\n\n459\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.660\nhad mentioned something Justin, you said,\nI always have to go and look it up, right?\n\n460\n00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n461\n00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n462\n00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:05.470\nBecause, the letter a,\nthe letter a is a whole bunch\n\n463\n00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:10.210\nof different things that matter\ndepending on what language we'll say?\n\n464\n00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:15.957\nLike programming for, whether it's\na hex value, whether it's a decimal,\n\n465\n00:27:15.957 --> 00:27:21.012\nwhether it's something, ANSI code or\nANSI, ASCII, ANSI, ugh!\n\n466\n00:27:21.012 --> 00:27:24.230\n&gt;&gt; So I can actually tell you\na couple from the ASCII table.\n\n467\n00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:29.870\nThe lowercase letter a I think is 97,\nwhich if you translate that to binary,\n\n468\n00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:33.970\n97 would need at least 6 bits.\n\n469\n00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.055\nSo it would probably be\nan 8 bit representation.\n\n470\n00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:40.170\nAnd then the hex value,\nI don't know, I could work it out.\n\n471\n00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:40.812\nI only know that\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n472\n00:27:40.812 --> 00:27:42.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One cuz I've done some translation,\n\n473\n00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.928\nlike ciphers and stuff,\nlike shift ciphers.\n\n474\n00:27:44.928 --> 00:27:49.111\nAnd then, I just use the ASCII version\nof those to add and subtract, and\n\n475\n00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:50.593\nthen retransform them.\n\n476\n00:27:50.593 --> 00:27:51.521\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you just, I half followed that.\n\n477\n00:27:51.521 --> 00:27:53.136\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n478\n00:27:53.136 --> 00:27:55.073\nit's okay if you guys didn't follow that.\n\n479\n00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:58.290\nBut, it really just illustrates if\nthe whole, there are these tables,\n\n480\n00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.260\nthere's basically lookup tables.\n\n481\n00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.170\nAll these characters, and what type of,\ncomputer based language you wanna talk in.\n\n482\n00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.770\nAnd how it all works and us clicking\nthe letter a on our keyboard and\n\n483\n00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.240\nit just outputs the letter a.\n\n484\n00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:16.086\nThere's a whole bunch of stuff going\non in the background that does that,\n\n485\n00:28:16.086 --> 00:28:17.550\nso that's a huge thing.\n\n486\n00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.860\nAnd there was one, and just to kind\nof demonstrate just a little bit.\n\n487\n00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.160\nI know we're starting to run out on time.\n\n488\n00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.390\nBut, I found this, where, and\nI had to look the reference, or\n\n489\n00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.900\nthe URL in the show notes.\n\n490\n00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.083\nBut how, lookit, the difference\nbetween the end of line characters,\n\n491\n00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:33.766\njust like an enter, right?\n\n492\n00:28:33.766 --> 00:28:36.050\nHow that's in Mac, Windows and Linux.\n\n493\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.702\nAnd that's where you alluded to\nin the beginning I've got so\n\n494\n00:28:39.702 --> 00:28:43.290\nmany problems in my coding of\nhow it treats certain things.\n\n495\n00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.014\nAnd it just, the carriage return\nthat CR that we talked about,\n\n496\n00:28:47.014 --> 00:28:50.630\nthe line feed where it just\nwraps around automatically.\n\n497\n00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.377\nWhat that means is this to\nwhere if I zoom out of the,\n\n498\n00:28:54.377 --> 00:28:57.178\ncome on, let's go this way, right?\n\n499\n00:28:57.178 --> 00:28:59.269\nIf I just start typing right, and\n\n500\n00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:02.940\nI'm just [SOUND] keeping on\ngoing it automatically wraps.\n\n501\n00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:07.824\nYou do not need to hit the enter\nkey when you get to the end like\n\n502\n00:29:07.824 --> 00:29:09.791\na regular typewriter.\n\n503\n00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:12.260\nIt word wraps, that's a line feed, right?\n\n504\n00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.940\nYou're just feeding the line,\nyou just keep on going enter, oops, enter.\n\n505\n00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.733\nNow that's a character term.\n\n506\n00:29:18.733 --> 00:29:21.590\nSo that's what is going\non with the word wrap.\n\n507\n00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.802\nSo your operating systems\nsee all this differently.\n\n508\n00:29:24.802 --> 00:29:29.140\nAnd that can get you into\na whole world of hurt.\n\n509\n00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and typically what'll\nhappen is you make an error or\n\n510\n00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.100\nyou get some weird formatting issues.\n\n511\n00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.159\nAnd I'm speaking more from my inexperience\nnot necessarily like print,layout.\n\n512\n00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:41.910\nBut you'll get an error message,\nwhere there has to be a conversion for\n\n513\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.330\nthe system that you're on.\n\n514\n00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.440\nIn order to all your tooling to work and\n\n515\n00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.405\nyou go I'm gonna let you do it I guess,\ncuz I don't have any choice.\n\n516\n00:29:48.405 --> 00:29:49.877\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know what\n\n517\n00:29:49.877 --> 00:29:52.545\nyou're talking about, so\nI just let it happen.\n\n518\n00:29:52.545 --> 00:29:55.922\nBut new-line characters and\ncarriage returns, and\n\n519\n00:29:55.922 --> 00:29:59.906\na little nuanced differences\nthat can cause some heartaches.\n\n520\n00:29:59.906 --> 00:30:03.730\nSo being aware is kind of of the first\nstep in solving the problem.\n\n521\n00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,and even if you even understood\nhalf of what we were saying today on some\n\n522\n00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:13.640\nof this kind of techie stuff I'm sure\nyou've experienced it at one point or\n\n523\n00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.520\nanother in your life whether\nit's going from a VHS to beta.\n\n524\n00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.973\nWow, I don't know where I\nthrew that one out, but\n\n525\n00:30:19.973 --> 00:30:22.600\n[LAUGH] it's just different\nways that we talk.\n\n526\n00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.520\nOne last thing that I wanna end on\njust to kinda wrap this all on up,\n\n527\n00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.580\nthis is in my show notes.\n\n528\n00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.100\nThis is,\nthis is what's known as the markdown file.\n\n529\n00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.600\nMarkdown is a mark down and\nwe use the editor called Haroopad.\n\n530\n00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.832\nI use it, don't worry about all of this.\n\n531\n00:30:36.832 --> 00:30:41.917\nWhat I'm trying to get at is, here,\nwhere this particular, URL that we're\n\n532\n00:30:41.917 --> 00:30:47.670\nlooking at, look right here where it says,\nit might be hard to see, but it says %2c.\n\n533\n00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.260\nI'm like, what is that?\n\n534\n00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.070\nOkay, remember I said all your\ncharacters have a code behind it?\n\n535\n00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.667\nSo I looked that up,\nI typed in what is %2C?\n\n536\n00:30:55.667 --> 00:31:00.515\nWell you can see %2C, it is, it's a comma.\n\n537\n00:31:00.515 --> 00:31:07.900\nIt's a comma in ANSI I believe, or\nASCII, and that's where hexane.\n\n538\n00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.210\nAll that stuff that you\nwere talking about,\n\n539\n00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.340\nthat how computers talk to each other,\nthat's what it is.\n\n540\n00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.500\nAnd so they made the URL, you can't go\nahead and display a comma in a URL,\n\n541\n00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.575\nso you put in the character code and\nthat's what you get.\n\n542\n00:31:22.575 --> 00:31:26.650\n&gt;&gt; And just for further clarification\non that, that is called URL encoding.\n\n543\n00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.240\nIf you ever want to take\na look at some of those,\n\n544\n00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.456\njust go type a bunch of random things into\nGoogle or your favorite search engine,\n\n545\n00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:34.010\nhit enter, and\nthn look at the long string at the end.\n\n546\n00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.340\nEvery space is a%20,\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n547\n00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:42.035\n&gt;&gt; Every comma is a % or\nnot every, a lot of commas %2c.\n\n548\n00:31:42.035 --> 00:31:44.429\nThere are time really\ngetting away with commas and\n\n549\n00:31:44.429 --> 00:31:47.736\nthere's a bunch of other special\ncharacters that have to be escape,\n\n550\n00:31:47.736 --> 00:31:49.973\ncuz URLs have to follow\na particular pattern.\n\n551\n00:31:49.973 --> 00:31:52.230\nAnd that's using in ASCII look up.\n\n552\n00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:57.786\nPercent in a ASCII hex value, which is\nusually two digits within the ASCII table,\n\n553\n00:31:57.786 --> 00:32:01.506\nwho keep things things from\nbreaking up effectively.\n\n554\n00:32:01.506 --> 00:32:05.079\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the %20,\nthat might be something that you've seen,\n\n555\n00:32:05.079 --> 00:32:08.450\nlike in file names that\nare from different systems.\n\n556\n00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.338\nGet it all the time, why did it do that?\n\n557\n00:32:10.338 --> 00:32:11.284\nIt can't do a space.\n\n558\n00:32:11.284 --> 00:32:12.643\nIt has to do with the special characters.\n\n559\n00:32:12.643 --> 00:32:15.035\nAll right,\nI know we're looking at the time.\n\n560\n00:32:15.035 --> 00:32:16.878\nAnd I think we've already\ngone over a little bit.\n\n561\n00:32:16.878 --> 00:32:21.358\nBut this is stuff that when we start\ntalking about geeky stuff like this,\n\n562\n00:32:21.358 --> 00:32:23.280\n[LAUGH] we can kind of get going.\n\n563\n00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.216\nSo but I will stop right there but\n\n564\n00:32:25.216 --> 00:32:30.400\nhopefully that gives you a little bit of\nbackground knowledge into what's going on.\n\n565\n00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.912\nAnd at least you can recognize and\ntell somebody, hey %20 that's a thing.\n\n566\n00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:36.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n567\n00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.930\nand you should present it\njust like that as well.\n\n568\n00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a thing.\n\n569\n00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.330\nBut just to reiterate,\nknowing about these can help you not\n\n570\n00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:51.220\nhave the struggles that I have and\npossibly Vonne has had in our recent past.\n\n571\n00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.490\nI say recent because it\nhappens to me all the time.\n\n572\n00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.732\nSo just keep it in mind.\n\n573\n00:32:55.732 --> 00:32:59.500\nUse this as a reference definitely stay\ntuned because we got more Microsoft Word\n\n574\n00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.360\n2016 essentials for Mac coming at you.\n\n575\n00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.190\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n576\n00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.410\nSo signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n577\n00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.100\n&gt;&gt;

I know what you're saying.\n\n43\n00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what she's saying.\n\n44\n00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.162\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I don't so.\n\n45\n00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:06.561\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n46\n00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.986\nautomatic things that happen in Word.\n\n47\n00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:11.490\nWell, let's first of all type in Hello.\n\n48\n00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.484\nNow I physically use my shift key on my\nkeyboard to capitalize the word Hello.\n\n49\n00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:24.516\nBut Word automatically capitalizes\nfirst words of sentences for\n\n50\n00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:29.363\nus, which can be really,\nreally handy, and honestly that's\n\n51\n00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:34.850\nsomething that I rely on too heavily,\nbecause then I get into my Gmail or\n\n52\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.896\nsome type of mail program,\nand it doesn't do that.\n\n53\n00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:42.412\nSo I'm sending off all these emails\nwith no capitalized first letters of\n\n54\n00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:46.460\nyour sentences, and they're probably like,\nwhat's going on with this person?\n\n55\n00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.024\nYeah, I'm just relying on Word.\n\n56\n00:02:48.024 --> 00:02:51.939\nSo if I type in,\nI'm gonna type in welcome but\n\n57\n00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:57.206\nI'm not gonna capitalize the W,\nso W-E-L-C-O-M-E.\n\n58\n00:02:57.206 --> 00:02:58.590\nYou're like, it didn't work.\n\n59\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.415\nYou have to space off of it.\n\n60\n00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:02.560\nYou have to complete the word for\n\n61\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.180\nWord to understand, hey let me go\nahead and do all my fancy stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.089\nSo once I hit the space bar\nnotice that it goes ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.234\nautomatically capitalizes Welcome.\n\n64\n00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:12.770\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n65\n00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.340\n&gt;&gt; And then I say, Welcome to ITProTV.\n\n66\n00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.834\nI did all the manual\nuppercases on that one.\n\n67\n00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:22.511\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n68\n00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:26.710\nthat's what it's going to\ndo when you start typing.\n\n69\n00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.627\nI hit my period, I hit my space, and\n\n70\n00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:33.918\nthen if I start typing again,\nif I type the letter I.\n\n71\n00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:38.590\nI, space, notice it capitalizes, but\nalso notice a few things that's happening.\n\n72\n00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.990\nI don't know if you caught it.\n\n73\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.710\nWhen I typed in that letter I,\n\n74\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.810\nit kind of did this flashy\nweird blue thing underneath it.\n\n75\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.870\nThose are called smart tags, and\n\n76\n00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.780\nI'm gonna hover my mouse over it\nright now just to see that it's gonna\n\n77\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.480\nhover back over anything that\nit automatically fixed for me.\n\n78\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.020\nEven after this one, like it's been\na while since I've typed the word welcome.\n\n79\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.077\nIt's gonna go ahead and\nbring up, hey look,\n\n80\n00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:09.756\nthere's something that I did that hey,\nmaybe you didn't want me to do.\n\n81\n00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:13.090\nI'm gonna give you the option, and so\nthat's what those things are called.\n\n82\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.457\nSmart tags are really smart,\nand they're very, very helpful.\n\n83\n00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:20.964\nThere's things that we want to,\nI rely on this heavily,\n\n84\n00:04:20.964 --> 00:04:25.440\nbecause maybe for some reason I didn't\nwant welcome to be capitalized.\n\n85\n00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.636\nNotice if I dropped it down,\nit gives me the options to,\n\n86\n00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:33.534\nhey undo that automatic capitalization,\nor you know what, just stop automatically\n\n87\n00:04:33.534 --> 00:04:37.954\ncorrecting the first letters of my\nsentences, just stop it all together, or\n\n88\n00:04:37.954 --> 00:04:42.442\nhey, why don't I take you all the way\ninto the options of the preferences, and\n\n89\n00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:44.095\nI can control it from there.\n\n90\n00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:46.930\nSo it's nice that it gives\nyou lots of options there.\n\n91\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.713\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, you're able to turn off\nthat capitalization all together?\n\n92\n00:04:51.713 --> 00:04:54.584\n&gt;&gt; That's a good point,\nlike what is the scope of this right here?\n\n93\n00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:55.534\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If I said,\n\n94\n00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:59.785\nstop automatically capitalizing,\nit will do it for this document and\n\n95\n00:04:59.785 --> 00:05:01.522\nfrom here on out basically.\n\n96\n00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:02.055\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n97\n00:05:02.055 --> 00:05:04.663\n&gt;&gt; But if I go on to here,\nlet's go ahead and jump in there,\n\n98\n00:05:04.663 --> 00:05:06.394\ncuz that's a really good question.\n\n99\n00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:11.521\nIf I go to here, if I turn this off,\nnow in my preferences, my actual program\n\n100\n00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:17.450\npreferences, if I turn this one off, It's\ngonna be forever, or for all documents.\n\n101\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.884\nIf I start a new one,\nit's gonna stop doing that.\n\n102\n00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:23.335\nSo, that's nice of like the scope\nof where I want this to happen.\n\n103\n00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:26.305\n&gt;&gt; Until you physically change that back,\nmanually change that back?\n\n104\n00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:26.940\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n105\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.944\nIf you go all the way down into here, you\ngot to turn it back on in the preferences\n\n106\n00:05:30.944 --> 00:05:33.873\nfor it to start doing\nthe automatic automaticing [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:05:33.873 --> 00:05:36.187\n&gt;&gt; Automatic capitalization.\n\n108\n00:05:36.187 --> 00:05:37.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know me,\nI like to make up words.\n\n109\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.474\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes but that's a good point.\n\n110\n00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:42.547\nSo we have all the smart tags, and\n\n111\n00:05:42.547 --> 00:05:45.594\nall of the things that I\ncan go back later and fix.\n\n112\n00:05:45.594 --> 00:05:49.137\nNow if you save this document, and\nthen close it, come back later or\n\n113\n00:05:49.137 --> 00:05:52.947\ntomorrow, all those smart tags,\nthey're not gonna be there anymore.\n\n114\n00:05:52.947 --> 00:05:57.247\nSo it's kind of like you have a window\nof opportunity to have it go back and\n\n115\n00:05:57.247 --> 00:06:01.547\nfix these things as you going, but\nonce you start saving and going back,\n\n116\n00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:05.919\nit will just commit like the things\nit's done because it's assuming that\n\n117\n00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.845\nyou're fine with everything.\n\n118\n00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:08.565\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good.\n\n119\n00:06:08.565 --> 00:06:11.840\n&gt;&gt; So those are some things that it does,\nthe automatically capitalizing.\n\n120\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.850\nBut let's go ahead and go through some\nother things that it's gonna do for\n\n121\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.470\nus automatically.\n\n122\n00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.883\nIt will correct commonly misspelled words.\n\n123\n00:06:19.883 --> 00:06:24.040\nLet's go through this one, this is my\nsentence that I like to try to write out.\n\n124\n00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.963\nI have I, and we're gonna say,\nI can do the dishes.\n\n125\n00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:30.630\nActually I try to pass that one off.\n\n126\n00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a hard one.\n\n127\n00:06:31.455 --> 00:06:32.834\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a tough one.\n\n128\n00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I usually have to\ndelegate that to somebody else.\n\n129\n00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:37.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I can,\n\n130\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.729\nnow I'm gonna type in C-N-A.\n\n131\n00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:45.851\nLook at that, it flipped, cuz I really\nwanted to say C-A-N, but I typed it wrong.\n\n132\n00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:48.715\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so it automatically flipped it.\n\n133\n00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:51.176\nSo, I can do the.\n\n134\n00:06:51.176 --> 00:06:53.481\nI am gonna type in H-T-E.\n\n135\n00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.237\nI do that a lot, right?\n\n136\n00:06:55.237 --> 00:06:56.762\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do that often.\n\n137\n00:06:56.762 --> 00:06:58.201\n&gt;&gt; It switches it for you.\n\n138\n00:06:58.201 --> 00:06:59.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n139\n00:06:59.027 --> 00:07:03.907\nit's gonna say, that's a really\ncommonly misspelled word, so\n\n140\n00:07:03.907 --> 00:07:08.029\nlet's go ahead and do,\nI can do the dishes, yes, okay.\n\n141\n00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:12.601\nNow if I went through, and\nI think the one I normally do is wash, so\n\n142\n00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:15.028\nI'll say, I can wash the dishes.\n\n143\n00:07:15.028 --> 00:07:19.375\nBut wahs, notice it didn't flip that one,\nokay, so it's not every word.\n\n144\n00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:20.025\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n145\n00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:24.704\n&gt;&gt; Basically Word has a list, it has\na list of, if it's spelled like this,\n\n146\n00:07:24.704 --> 00:07:28.847\nchange it to this,\nlike if you see C-N-A change it to C-A-N,\n\n147\n00:07:28.847 --> 00:07:33.185\nbecause they're probably just\ntransposed the letters in there.\n\n148\n00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:34.660\n&gt;&gt; So here's another question for you.\n\n149\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.447\nSo what if you're using colloquialisms?\n\n150\n00:07:36.447 --> 00:07:40.031\nYou purposely wanna say something like,\nI ain't gonna go there.\n\n151\n00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:41.735\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're just doing that for emphasis.\n\n152\n00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:42.713\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n153\n00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:46.832\n&gt;&gt; And then that's a little annoying when\nit's trying to change it back to something\n\n154\n00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:48.036\nthat makes more sense.\n\n155\n00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:50.093\nIs there a way to stop that?\n\n156\n00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:50.976\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.\n\n157\n00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:52.897\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For, and\n\n158\n00:07:52.897 --> 00:07:56.135\nthis is a perfect example\nof why I say can, C-A-N.\n\n159\n00:07:56.135 --> 00:08:01.000\nWell CNA,\nI think it's certified nursing assistants.\n\n160\n00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.283\n&gt;&gt; Yes CNA it is, yes.\n\n161\n00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:06.584\n&gt;&gt; Right, and think if you're in\na program or if your an administrator for\n\n162\n00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:11.460\na program that is doing CNA training,\nyou're not gonna want to keep switching it\n\n163\n00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.225\nback to can, you want CNA, do that,\nstop auto-correcting that.\n\n164\n00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:17.280\nBack in our options again.\n\n165\n00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.698\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; So I have to go back to Word and\n\n166\n00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:19.671\nwe go back to preferences.\n\n167\n00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:22.730\nI should say preferences,\nit's options in PC.\n\n168\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.965\nBut if we go over to the auto-correct,\n\n169\n00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:31.858\nnotice that it is doing this\nauto-correct and it's replacing words.\n\n170\n00:08:31.858 --> 00:08:36.775\nI think we could get down,\nthere's a couple of them COC,\n\n171\n00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:41.360\nit's somewhere in here, but\nI could basically find.\n\n172\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.021\nLet's stop doing that, and I can just\nremove it completely out of the list.\n\n173\n00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:49.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, no, I'm just gonna pick\nthis one, and those I can click delete.\n\n174\n00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.940\nAnd that's again back in that like,\nit will not correct that anymore.\n\n175\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.357\n&gt;&gt; Unless you put it back in manually.\n\n176\n00:08:55.357 --> 00:08:57.070\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\n\n177\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.900\nAnd so at this point,\nnotice that I still have my smart tags.\n\n178\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.230\nWhere I can say, okay, stop automatically\ncorrecting, but then again,\n\n179\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.753\nthat's not the scope of this program or\njust this document.\n\n180\n00:09:07.753 --> 00:09:10.873\nNormally, don't quote me on that,\nyou might do this and\n\n181\n00:09:10.873 --> 00:09:15.033\nit might stop all together, but I like to\nbe sure and I would go all the way into\n\n182\n00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:19.070\nthe preferences or the options and\nmake sure that that is gone from there.\n\n183\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.671\nSo, that's something that you always\nwant to kinda just keep in mind of\n\n184\n00:09:22.671 --> 00:09:27.005\nthe automatically correcting commonly\nwords, unless that's a word that you need.\n\n185\n00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.930\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So just tell it to stop doing that.\n\n186\n00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.690\nSo, that's always a wonderful thing.\n\n187\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.200\nLet's go down for a few other things\nthat it could do, cuz that was\n\n188\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.170\nthe capitalization and misspelled words,\nbut notice the red squigglies.\n\n189\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.600\nNow, we do have a whole\nother episode on proofing,\n\n190\n00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.030\nbut that red squiggly is telling\nme that I have a spelling mistake.\n\n191\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.800\nThat's, something's wrong there.\n\n192\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.776\nNow if I put a period and then a space and\nthen I'll say, more text here, or\n\n193\n00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:55.010\nsomething.\n\n194\n00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.181\nNotice that I get two,\nthere's another one that comes up.\n\n195\n00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.211\nYou see right there, it' like,\nit's kinda hard to see, but\n\n196\n00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:01.870\nit's like two blue underlines.\n\n197\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.990\n&gt;&gt;

Virtually throw it away.\n\n40\n00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:07.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, and talking about that's\nactually a good point, I cut something.\n\n41\n00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.767\nUntil I cut the next thing and that's\ngoing to be what is being retained last.\n\n42\n00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:17.694\n&gt;&gt; Does that make any sense?\n\n43\n00:02:17.694 --> 00:02:20.306\nI'm not sure if I'm\nexplaining that very well.\n\n44\n00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think you can understand, yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.173\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I've done this and\na lot has to do with copying or cut,\n\n46\n00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:27.240\ndoesn't really matter which one.\n\n47\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.424\nWhere I've selected something,\nI'll go ahead and cut it and\n\n48\n00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:34.162\ndo some more things and then select\nsomething else, and then cut that and\n\n49\n00:02:34.162 --> 00:02:38.345\nthen go, and go and paste it, thinking\nI'm pasting that first thing that I cut.\n\n50\n00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:39.210\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n51\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.460\n&gt;&gt; No, it's that last thing and\nthat's what I, it remembers and\n\n52\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.330\nthe other part is like,\nlike gone, like man I forgot.\n\n53\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.246\nSo it's one of the, that's what I was\ntrying to kind of tell you about,\n\n54\n00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:54.659\nabout what's being retained in that,\nwell where does it go?\n\n55\n00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.960\nIt goes to what's known as the clip board.\n\n56\n00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.756\nClip board is a place where the things\nthat you cut or copy is put on, you know\n\n57\n00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:06.799\nlike an actual old school clip board with\nlike little thing at the top, right?\n\n58\n00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.160\n&gt;&gt; The clip on the board.\n\n59\n00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.810\n&gt;&gt; I know, cuz I'm like wait,\nwhat's this something,\n\n60\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.660\n&gt;&gt; There's the board and\n\n61\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.240\nthere's the clip on the board.\n\n62\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.567\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yeah,\nlike, what is that?\n\n63\n00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:15.582\nA clip.\n\n64\n00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:17.778\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where you can go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:17.778 --> 00:03:20.611\nput something on and take something\noff and it's the same idea here.\n\n66\n00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:22.039\nIt's a virtual clipboard board.\n\n67\n00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.842\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n68\n00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:24.538\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we've got there.\n\n69\n00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:28.170\nHow do I cut or copy?\n\n70\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.280\nI guess we should go ahead and\ntalk about copy.\n\n71\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.120\nCopy kinda explains itself,\nit's gonna keep what's in its location and\n\n72\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.240\njust make a copy on that clipboard for you\nto then be able to do something with it.\n\n73\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.450\nWhere is cut, copy, and paste within Word?\n\n74\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.912\nWell, you do have your edit menu,\nand you have up here.\n\n75\n00:03:45.912 --> 00:03:47.230\nNow, why is it grayed out right now?\n\n76\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.283\nThe reason I have it grayed out is\ncuz I don't have anything selected.\n\n77\n00:03:50.283 --> 00:03:53.039\nWe have got to have that select to effect,\nI can't cut or\n\n78\n00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.574\ncopy something unless I tell\nit what it needs to be.\n\n79\n00:03:55.574 --> 00:04:00.350\nThen you also have your buttons,\nover here on the home tab of your ribbons.\n\n80\n00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.040\nYou have the scissors cut, you have what\nlooks like two pieces of paper, copy.\n\n81\n00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.970\nThis is copy formatting,\nwe'll talk about that in another episode,\n\n82\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.150\nand then we also have paste and\n\n83\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.020\nthere is in the drop down you have some\noptions that we're gonna talk about.\n\n84\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.723\nThese paste options are really key,\nthey are important.\n\n85\n00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:21.701\nSo just keep that in mind\nwhen we start doing that and\n\n86\n00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.140\nwe'll go through what all of this means.\n\n87\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.010\nI need to select, let's say I want\nto move these paragraphs around.\n\n88\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.630\nNow remember, I'm just kind of copying,\nI just took text from someone else and\n\n89\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.190\ncopied in it doesn't make logical\norder but let's just say-\n\n90\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.445\n&gt;&gt; Unless your name is Luis Carol.\n\n91\n00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, and even then I've taken\neverything and just chopped it all up.\n\n92\n00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:46.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So right here if I realized that this\n\n93\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.094\nparagraph, really shouldn't be here-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n94\n00:04:49.094 --> 00:04:52.903\n&gt;&gt; It should be second,\nthis second paragraph should be first,\n\n95\n00:04:52.903 --> 00:04:57.152\nthis first paragraph should be second,\nI'm gonna move it around and\n\n96\n00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:59.880\nin a sense cut it outta\nhere select that Cut.\n\n97\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.931\nNow, you can also right-click if\nyou are right clicker, and cut or\n\n98\n00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:08.780\nyou have your keyboard shortcut which is\ncommand X, looks like X like scissors.\n\n99\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.735\nSo you have all three of those\ndifferent ways to go ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:15.990\ndo those particular commands, if I cut.\n\n101\n00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.729\nNotice it takes it out, so\nit's on that clipboard,\n\n102\n00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.929\nI take my mouse down and\nthen I will paste this,\n\n103\n00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:29.453\nI'm going to right click and\ngo to paste which is,\n\n104\n00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:34.106\nI'm sorry Cmd+V,\npeople say it like V why is it V?\n\n105\n00:05:34.106 --> 00:05:38.367\nWell, it's right next to the C and\nit's not P because P is print and\n\n106\n00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:41.790\nI also talk about V,\nI think of it like Elmer's glue,\n\n107\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.063\nlike you're pasting it in Elmer's glue\ncomes to a point, the orange top, yeah?\n\n108\n00:05:47.063 --> 00:05:49.230\n&gt;&gt; Or is v for Velociraptor.\n\n109\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.132\n&gt;&gt; Sure, we can go with that to but\nthat doesn't make sense.\n\n110\n00:05:52.132 --> 00:05:53.452\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Forget that.\n\n111\n00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:57.147\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go ahead and\njust go with paste.\n\n112\n00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:57.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that.\n\n113\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.610\n&gt;&gt; And well take it there and\nit puts the text right in.\n\n114\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.940\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; Cut, paste,\n\n115\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.150\nthere you go, if I wanted to copy.\n\n116\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.730\nLet's select this because maybe\nI wanna make another section,\n\n117\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.310\nanother area with this same kind of title.\n\n118\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.870\nLet's copy this,\nI'm gonna do new Cmd+C on my keyboard and\n\n119\n00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.410\nyou could even see,I don't know if you\nhave watched that little edit up there,\n\n120\n00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.880\nit kinda blinks unless\nyou know that I did that.\n\n121\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.825\nI'm gonna paste and then it paste it in,\ngreat [CROSSTALK] maybe I gonna take\n\n122\n00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:32.927\nthis and then say welcome to ITProTV or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n123\n00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:37.920\nI type something else and ta-da most of\nit, and I just want to change one thing.\n\n124\n00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.217\nI do that a lot with our show notes and\nMs.\n\n125\n00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:45.845\nTanisha can attest that I forget\nto change certain things.\n\n126\n00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:46.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like,\n\n127\n00:06:46.748 --> 00:06:48.776\nthese episode titles don't match.\n\n128\n00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:50.028\nI'm like, yeah I forgot to-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:06:50.028 --> 00:06:51.963\n&gt;&gt; I forgot to change that out because\n\n130\n00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:54.235\nI copied it from another file.\n\n131\n00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:57.436\nSo I've got that going on, and\nI've went ahead and paste it.\n\n132\n00:06:57.436 --> 00:07:01.975\nNow, notice when I pasted that\ntext in from here to here.\n\n133\n00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.161\nIt retains the formatting\nof what the text had.\n\n134\n00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:10.798\nSo it's in the,\nthis is not as a title style but\n\n135\n00:07:10.798 --> 00:07:12.868\nnotice it's bigger-\n&gt;&gt; Bold\n\n136\n00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:13.467\n&gt;&gt; It's bolder,\n\n137\n00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:14.807\nall that kind of wonderful stuff.\n\n138\n00:07:14.807 --> 00:07:19.251\nSo that's what's going on here,\nthat is the default\n\n139\n00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:24.010\nsetting when you're copying\nfrom one place to another.\n\n140\n00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.508\nSo for example, if I selected this and\nI copied, and then came down here,\n\n141\n00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:33.762\nlet's go and then I paste, it looks\nlike actually didn't do it the same way.\n\n142\n00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:37.297\nWow, okay, so thank you for\ncompletely going against what I just said.\n\n143\n00:07:37.297 --> 00:07:41.400\nHowever, that's where you've\ngot these right here.\n\n144\n00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.950\nIt should be keeping\nthe source formatting,\n\n145\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.810\nI don't know why it's not doing that.\n\n146\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.940\nOkay, well, that's a little interesting,\nthat's okay.\n\n147\n00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.742\nWell, the other thing would\nbe I'm just gonna undo the.\n\n148\n00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:54.068\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nevermind that [LAUGH] normally,\n\n149\n00:07:54.068 --> 00:07:58.673\nit keeps it, but Hey,\nsometimes I guess it doesn't.\n\n150\n00:07:58.673 --> 00:07:59.482\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's live action debugging, right.\n\n151\n00:07:59.482 --> 00:08:01.720\nThen that's what it is.\n\n152\n00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, exactly.\n\n153\n00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.154\nBut it will happen a lot.\n\n154\n00:08:06.154 --> 00:08:07.330\nSo why don't we do this.\n\n155\n00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.550\nLet's come back over to our files.\n\n156\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:16.020\nAnd we're going to open up a file called\nFormatted Text, as a word document.\n\n157\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.120\nSo now I'm copying between\none word file to another.\n\n158\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.210\nI want to take this paragraph right here.\n\n159\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.060\nNow do notice,\nlook at the difference between this text,\n\n160\n00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.513\nand I'm using a little\nshortcut command+tilde.\n\n161\n00:08:31.513 --> 00:08:38.331\nCmd+tilde is where you can flip between\ndocuments within the same application.\n\n162\n00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:42.580\nI love this, I use it all\nthe time in all my Mac products.\n\n163\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.124\nSo Cmd+tilde, see, those are my two\nword files that I'm flipping back and\n\n164\n00:08:47.124 --> 00:08:49.945\nforth with,\nwhich is not the same as Alt, Oops,\n\n165\n00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:53.729\nthat's the wrong keyboard altogether,\nwhich is not the same as Command + Tab.\n\n166\n00:08:53.729 --> 00:08:56.682\nCmd+Tab is switching\nbetween your applications.\n\n167\n00:08:56.682 --> 00:09:00.740\nCmd+tilde, right above it,\nis documents within the application.\n\n168\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.081\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ncome back to here.\n\n169\n00:09:03.081 --> 00:09:06.516\nLet's undo there, Ctrl+Z, the font,\n\n170\n00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:10.746\nthis font versus this font,\nnot the same, right?\n\n171\n00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:11.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n172\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:18.160\n&gt;&gt; So when I take this and copy it, flip\nover and paste, they don't match, do they?\n\n173\n00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.830\nThat doesn't look the same,\nand I don't like that.\n\n174\n00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.780\nI wanted to come in and\nmatch everything else.\n\n175\n00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.310\nThat's where those smart\ntags come into play.\n\n176\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:32.700\nThe smart tags, by default,\nit should be on keep source formatting.\n\n177\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.816\nThis is my source, the other document.\n\n178\n00:09:37.816 --> 00:09:40.826\nThe format that's gonna retain here,\ncome over there, and\n\n179\n00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:42.554\nthat's what's gonna be pasted.\n\n180\n00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:43.076\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n181\n00:09:43.076 --> 00:09:45.808\nif I tell it to, no no no no,\nI don't want you to do that,\n\n182\n00:09:45.808 --> 00:09:49.610\nI want you to match the destination\nformatting in this document.\n\n183\n00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.108\nI have what's known as a normal style.\n\n184\n00:09:51.108 --> 00:09:54.008\nWe'll talk about styles\nlater in another episode.\n\n185\n00:09:54.008 --> 00:09:55.657\nBut I wanna bring it into here.\n\n186\n00:09:55.657 --> 00:09:57.680\nAnd if I click there, well, look.\n\n187\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.450\nNow, the text matches.\n\n188\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.310\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; It's not orange, it's just that font.\n\n189\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.807\nEverything is good, and\nI'm fine with that.\n\n190\n00:10:05.807 --> 00:10:11.690\nSo, that's what I like a lot of times\nof doing the match destination,\n\n191\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.730\nrather than keep source.\n\n192\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:20.789\nThere are some times though, where even\ndoing that, it's not gonna do it for\n\n193\n00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:26.584\nme because it's gonna keep even more,\nmeaning like, it's structure.\n\n194\n00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:31.406\nThis is a big thing that I do,\nlike especially from websites or\n\n195\n00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:32.904\nfrom other files.\n\n196\n00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:38.030\nFor example, let's open up this\nChart Data, this is an Excel file.\n\n197\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.190\nI want to get this guy in here.\n\n198\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.595\nI want this information.\n\n199\n00:10:42.595 --> 00:10:45.316\nNow this is in Excel, so\nit does have some specific formatting.\n\n200\n00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:47.411\nThis is also formatted with Table.\n\n201\n00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:52.226\nDon't worry about that, but\njust know that when I copy this, and\n\n202\n00:10:52.226 --> 00:10:56.150\nI just did a Cmd+C, and\nI get little running ints.\n\n203\n00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:02.128\nI am now using my Cmd+Tab to get\nme back over to word, all right.\n\n204\n00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:06.373\nCome down into here, let's get to\nwhere I have another paragraph, and\n\n205\n00:11:06.373 --> 00:11:09.860\nnow I paste, just regular paste and\nit's bringing it in.\n\n206\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.330\nAnd it does look like it's formatted\nthe same, it's got the blue and\n\n207\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:20.520\nthe alternating, and that's grey but\nit doesn't match what I have here.\n\n208\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.486\nSo if I want to match\ndestination table style,\n\n209\n00:11:23.486 --> 00:11:26.234\nwe'll talk about tables in another time.\n\n210\n00:11:26.234 --> 00:11:30.166\nNow it's kinda going back to a regular\ntable, and everything's fine.\n\n211\n00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.940\nBut maybe sometimes, like,\nI don't even want it as a table.\n\n212\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.775\nI don't want the table structure.\n\n213\n00:11:34.775 --> 00:11:37.907\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Just give me what's in there.\n\n214\n00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:38.770\nKeep the text.\n\n215\n00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.450\nIf I choose just keep the text,\nnow there's no table.\n\n216\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.030\nThere's no structure around it.\n\n217\n00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.980\nI'm just getting the text.\n\n218\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.074\nNow with this particular one, I will tell\nyou that because you are taking it from\n\n219\n00:11:50.074 --> 00:11:53.468\na table and bringing it in this text,\nYou're going to have tabs in here where\n\n220\n00:11:53.468 --> 00:11:56.419\nyou probably gonna need to go ahead,\nand like either find or\n\n221\n00:11:56.419 --> 00:12:00.708\nreplacing it with the tabs, Or just know\nthat they're tabs then use tab stops.\n\n222\n00:12:00.708 --> 00:12:04.102\nIf you're like I have no idea what\nyou're talking about, don't worry about\n\n223\n00:12:04.102 --> 00:12:06.868\nit we have other episodes that\ndo talk about formating tables,\n\n224\n00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:09.300\nconverting text to tables and\ntables to text.\n\n225\n00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.430\nWe also have an episode on find and\n\n226\n00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.930\nreplace special characters,\nwhich is one of my favorites.\n\n227\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:20.570\nSo just know that you can do other\nthings to make this not be this way.\n\n228\n00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.846\n[LAUGH] So, there you go.\n\n229\n00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:29.750\nSo you can see that changing and bringing\njust the text can be really effective.\n\n230\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.082\nIt's a big one when you're\ngoing from websites,\n\n231\n00:12:34.082 --> 00:12:39.255\nbecause when you're copying stuff out\nof a webpage, you're copying the HTML.\n\n232\n00:12:39.255 --> 00:12:44.433\nAnd Word can read HTML and try to do its\nformatting, and sometimes whatever it is\n\n233\n00:12:44.433 --> 00:12:49.480\non the page, when you come into here,\nit's like that looks another like it.\n\n234\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.490\nThat's just the nature of\nthe language that it's talking in.\n\n235\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.540\nSo let's kinda move over\nhere on to this website, and\n\n236\n00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.456\nI actually do wanna pull this up.\n\n237\n00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:01.326\nBecause if you are watching\nthis in succession,\n\n238\n00:13:01.326 --> 00:13:05.044\nthe episode before this was\nthe autocorrect options, right?\n\n239\n00:13:05.044 --> 00:13:06.245\n&gt;&gt; Autocorrect options, yes.\n\n240\n00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:07.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n241\n00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.770\nAnd I have a line in the show\nnotes about a hyphen\n\n242\n00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.150\nversus a dash,\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n243\n00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.447\n&gt;&gt; Because just really quickly, really\nquickly, taking a small little diversion.\n\n244\n00:13:16.447 --> 00:13:17.980\n&gt;&gt; This is retro learning?\n\n245\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.750\nPay attention.\n\n246\n00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n247\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.660\nSo if I typed in a hello space,\ndash, space or a hyphen, and\n\n248\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.955\nthen I keep typing, do you see how,\nI don't know if you caught that.\n\n249\n00:13:27.955 --> 00:13:29.436\nLet's try it again.\n\n250\n00:13:29.436 --> 00:13:34.610\nI'll type test space hyphen space,\nwatch that little dash right there.\n\n251\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.530\nI start typing,\ndid you see it get bigger right there?\n\n252\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.361\nOkay, that's something known as an dash.\n\n253\n00:13:42.361 --> 00:13:43.006\n&gt;&gt; Dash.\n\n254\n00:13:43.006 --> 00:13:44.647\n&gt;&gt; E-M, yes.\n\n255\n00:13:44.647 --> 00:13:49.310\nThere are dashes, and there are en dashes.\n\n256\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.476\nThere's also a hyphen and a regular dash.\n\n257\n00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:53.041\nReally?\n\n258\n00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.160\n[LAUGH] Yes.\n\n259\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm following you.\n\n260\n00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, to let you know what an and\n\n261\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.250\nan en dash is, it's a little dash,\nbut think about the letter n.\n\n262\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.691\nThink about the letter m.\n\n263\n00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:07.510\nSee the width of them.\n\n264\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.572\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The n is basically half of the m, or\n\n265\n00:14:10.572 --> 00:14:12.628\nthe m is you know, double.\n\n266\n00:14:12.628 --> 00:14:14.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I would just say half, yeah.\n\n267\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that there, if you look at\nthis, that and that, almost the same size.\n\n268\n00:14:20.124 --> 00:14:26.686\nAn dash is like the width of an m,\nthe en dash is the width of an n.\n\n269\n00:14:26.686 --> 00:14:31.055\nAnd that's how you actually are measuring\nfonts, and a lot of stuff are measured in\n\n270\n00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:33.684\nm's and E-M,\n&gt;&gt; And that's why it's talking about\n\n271\n00:14:33.684 --> 00:14:37.479\nthe actual width of the letter cuz if\nyou think about, the m is the largest,\n\n272\n00:14:37.479 --> 00:14:40.990\nthe longest, the widest letter in\nour character sets besides the w,\n\n273\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.560\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n274\n00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.040\n&gt;&gt; Which is really upside down m.\n\n275\n00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.442\n&gt;&gt; Good, I'm glad we're doing this,\nthis is good stuff.\n\n276\n00:14:45.442 --> 00:14:50.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And when to use them\nproperly within our English language,\n\n277\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.870\nwhich is so interesting sometimes.\n\n278\n00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.360\nRight here, it's just saying\nlike when do I use an en or an?\n\n279\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.435\nWhen do I use a hyphen instead of a dash?\n\n280\n00:14:59.435 --> 00:15:03.837\nAll that kind of stuff, and\nthis is on this english.stackexchange.com.\n\n281\n00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:05.320\nSo it's just really interesting.\n\n282\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.708\nI just like this where\nan is kind of like a comma,\n\n283\n00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:12.503\nlike Against All Odds Pete,\nthe unluckiest man alive,\n\n284\n00:15:12.503 --> 00:15:17.049\nwon the lottery, as opposed to\nan en dash which indicates a range.\n\n285\n00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:20.638\nRight, so we could say pages 31 through\n32, and then a hyphen is where you\n\n286\n00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:24.132\nactually have a compound words,\nthat's when you're supposed to use it.\n\n287\n00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.730\nAnd so, and there's a minus sign.\n\n288\n00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.960\nSo in case you're wondering,\nthat's what this is about.\n\n289\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.660\nI did forget it in the other episodes,\nso I figured I'd throw it in here.\n\n290\n00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.400\nWhy not?\n\n291\n00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.260\nAnd I also just reminded myself that I\nhad a web page still pulled up [LAUGH] to\n\n292\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.830\ngo ahead and talk to you guys about it.\n\n293\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.600\n&gt;&gt; And we're glad you did.\n\n294\n00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.200\nThat was great.\n\n295\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.968\n&gt;&gt; It's fun, right?\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n296\n00:15:43.968 --> 00:15:45.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm really like a topography geek.\n\n297\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.795\nSo I love that kind of stuff.\n\n298\n00:15:46.795 --> 00:15:47.431\n&gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that.\n\n299\n00:15:47.431 --> 00:15:52.602\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let's go to ITProTV,\nokay, it's right here.\n\n300\n00:15:52.602 --> 00:15:54.922\nSo here's our website.\n\n301\n00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:58.151\nI want to be able to copy out,\nlike this kind of part.\n\n302\n00:15:58.151 --> 00:16:02.357\nCuz maybe I'm doing just like a little\nWord document about our website, or\n\n303\n00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:03.510\nabout our company.\n\n304\n00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.470\nSo, I really like to go ahead and\nget all this in here.\n\n305\n00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.280\n&gt;&gt; News article.\n\n306\n00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n307\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.970\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nselect down through here.\n\n308\n00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.120\nThat's good because that's just\ntalking about our virtual labs and\n\n309\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.930\nour practice exams.\n\n310\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.950\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So I'll copy, regular copy.\n\n311\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.470\nNotice, it doesn't have to be within Word,\nor even Excel.\n\n312\n00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.620\nI probably should have said that.\n\n313\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.460\nIt's across all programs.\n\n314\n00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.250\nI think copy from InDesign and\npaste into Word, or vice versa.\n\n315\n00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.630\nSo copy, cut, and\npaste is across the entire platform,\n\n316\n00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.510\nit's not document specific.\n\n317\n00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:39.990\nSo I copy this out of the website, bring\nback up Word, let's zoom out a little bit.\n\n318\n00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.280\nAnd actually this is a good one since\nI'm on a brand new piece of paper,\n\n319\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.620\nI did a File &gt; New.\n\n320\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.240\nThis, I don't know if I said that,\nsorry guys.\n\n321\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.620\nI was starting to just go too fast for\nmy own good if I paste this.\n\n322\n00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:54.921\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n323\n00:16:56.637 --> 00:16:58.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay,\n\n324\n00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.500\nthis is where the pictures in this,\n&gt;&gt; Web page.\n\n325\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.550\nWhile they look this big here,\nthey're not really that big.\n\n326\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.160\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n327\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.460\n&gt;&gt; They're small, I guess to say.\n\n328\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.580\nThey're a lot bigger.\n\n329\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.950\nAnd so it's taking its store size.\n\n330\n00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.490\nIt's taking out all of the stuff\nthat it kind of went with.\n\n331\n00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.910\nAnd it's like, I,\nwow this is a lot of craziness.\n\n332\n00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.150\nBut look right down there\nThere's our smart tag.\n\n333\n00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.320\n&gt;&gt; So, I could try and\nmatch destination formatting.\n\n334\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.310\nIt's still not gonna work cuz\nthe picture's aren't gonna size.\n\n335\n00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:32.700\nBut if I just kept the text, well the\ntext, that's what I really want out of it.\n\n336\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.110\nI want to talk about the virtual labs.\n\n337\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.550\nAnd, I'm not gonna get all\nthe pictures out of it.\n\n338\n00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.350\nI don't want all the tables out of it.\n\n339\n00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:45.060\nI just want the text out of\nWhatever I'm trying to get out of it.\n\n340\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:50.640\nSo I do this a lot with a webpage\nbecause I don't want it.\n\n341\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.090\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.495\n&gt;&gt; But this is actually a good way like\n\n417\n00:21:29.495 --> 00:21:32.883\nyou're saying teachable moment,\nthere is a paste special, and\n\n418\n00:21:32.883 --> 00:21:35.485\ndepending on the content\nof what you have copied.\n\n419\n00:21:35.485 --> 00:21:37.134\nThat makes a big difference and\n\n420\n00:21:37.134 --> 00:21:41.690\nI know now where I was going with that cuz\nback on that Excel file, remember this?\n\n421\n00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:42.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n422\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.676\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; This chart,\n\n423\n00:21:43.676 --> 00:21:45.485\nwhat if I wanted this chart?\n\n424\n00:21:45.485 --> 00:21:46.840\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I knew it was somewhere,\n\n432\n00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.105\nit just wasn't on the webpage.\n\n433\n00:22:03.105 --> 00:22:04.020\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, good.\n\n434\n00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:09.200\nBut again another demonstration of,\nI have completely different options for\n\n435\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.730\npasting when I selected, and\ncopied a chart out of excel\n\n436\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.770\nversus selecting text and pictures\nout of a web page, and pasting it in.\n\n437\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.270\nI have much different paste options.\n\n438\n00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.110\nSo here If I didn't pay attention to this.\n\n439\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.900\nThis is something that you should\nbe aware of right there, look.\n\n440\n00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.910\nIt says, Linked to Excel Data.\n\n441\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.840\nThat means that is linked\nover to that Excel file.\n\n442\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.798\nIf you change that Excel file,\nit will change here in your Word document.\n\n443\n00:22:37.798 --> 00:22:38.802\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, so\nit's one of those goods and bads.\n\n447\n00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.470\nYou just have to know what it's doing and\nwhich one you want to do.\n\n448\n00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.530\nSo if I didn't want to have any\nconnection back to that Excel file,\n\n449\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.020\nI'd do it as embed.\n\n450\n00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.180\nMeaning, keep it as a chart, but\nchange it and do some chart stuff and\n\n451\n00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.690\nchart formatting within Word.\n\n452\n00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.700\nI don't have it linked back over to Excel,\n\n453\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.510\nembedded into here, or\nI can paste it as a picture.\n\n454\n00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.330\nIf I paste it as a picture,\nthen I can format it as a picture.\n\n455\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.740\nNot as a chart and\nnot linked, all that way, so-\n\n456\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.020\n&gt;&gt; Would it remove all the graph or\n\n457\n00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.220\nExcel lines bond, if you did that?\n\n458\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:17.800\nAs a picture.\n\n459\n00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; No, it actually takes it like a.\n\n460\n00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.790\n&gt;&gt; Like a snapshot.\n\n461\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:21.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n462\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.370\nIt's just a straight up picture.\n\n463\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.960\nAnd now I can format it as a picture.\n\n464\n00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.680\nAs opposed to if I had pasted this,\nkept it as an embedded worksheet.\n\n465\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.370\nWatch when I click on my tabs now.\n\n466\n00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:38.060\nI have it as a chart which I could still\n\n467\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.920\nManipulate it as a chart, but\nno connection back to itself.\n\n468\n00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, lots and lots of options.\n\n469\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.670\nYou're like, I didn't realize\nthere was this many [LAUGH].\n\n470\n00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.350\n&gt;&gt; Yep, lots of options,\nall options isn't it?\n\n471\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.561\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nthat's definitely something to watch for.\n\n472\n00:23:52.561 --> 00:23:55.740\nAnd this is another big one for me.\n\n473\n00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:02.770\nWhen you're pasting from a PDF File or\nit doesn't always have to be a PDF.\n\n474\n00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:09.092\nIt could be other file formats\nthat don't treat the lines of\n\n475\n00:24:09.092 --> 00:24:14.160\nyour text as wrapped\nwords within a paragraph.\n\n476\n00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.384\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n477\n00:24:16.384 --> 00:24:20.563\nLet's come back over here,\nI have a PDF called Alice Book and I like,\n\n478\n00:24:20.563 --> 00:24:23.243\nwell that's just right from the Word file.\n\n479\n00:24:23.243 --> 00:24:27.746\nNo, I did a little trick,\nI took this text and put it into InDesign.\n\n480\n00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:31.978\nTook it from InDesign, then exported\nas a PDF cuz that's a big thing.\n\n481\n00:24:31.978 --> 00:24:33.270\n&gt;&gt; You are tricking us.\n\n482\n00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.690\n&gt;&gt; I am,\nbecause you might go ahead and say,\n\n483\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.810\nwell I copied this paragraph out of a PDF\nand it worked fine, it didn't do anything\n\n484\n00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.142\nlike what you did fun\n&gt;&gt; That's the nature of PDFs.\n\n485\n00:24:43.142 --> 00:24:45.253\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; And really just in general because you\n\n486\n00:24:45.253 --> 00:24:47.007\ncan make a PDF from a word document.\n\n487\n00:24:47.007 --> 00:24:47.848\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It'll stay\n\n488\n00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:51.000\nlike word especially if you're copying\nback into word and it'll work fine.\n\n489\n00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.456\nSo I'm not saying that this\nis like across the board,\n\n490\n00:24:53.456 --> 00:24:55.106\nthis is always gonna happen to you.\n\n491\n00:24:55.106 --> 00:25:00.159\nBut I bet you'll run into this, one way or\nthe other, I'm gonna open this up and\n\n492\n00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:04.008\nthis is like where you could've\njust copied it straight from\n\n493\n00:25:04.008 --> 00:25:08.397\nthe website where this comes from,\nif I select this text right here.\n\n494\n00:25:08.397 --> 00:25:10.940\nThat's one,\nyou call that a paragraph won't you Zach?\n\n495\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.900\n&gt;&gt; I would call it a paragraph.\n\n496\n00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.630\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n497\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:16.120\nSo that would have these lines we'll\njust continue on across, right?\n\n498\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n499\n00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, normally.\n\n500\n00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.870\nSo if I take and copy this,\ncome into Word, and\n\n501\n00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:25.700\nthen I paste this That's not what it did.\n\n502\n00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.650\nLook at that.\n\n503\n00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.511\nThat's [SOUND].\n\n504\n00:25:27.511 --> 00:25:32.400\nTo, enter, occurred, enter, enter, enter.\n\n505\n00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.105\nThere is a paragraph on\nevery end of the line\n\n506\n00:25:36.105 --> 00:25:36.846\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n507\n00:25:36.846 --> 00:25:40.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not a full one paragraph.\n\n508\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.359\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; This will drive you crazy.\n\n509\n00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:44.640\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like it's code.\n\n510\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n511\n00:25:45.425 --> 00:25:45.980\n&gt;&gt; It's how it\n\n512\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:46.587\nwas created\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n513\n00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:49.210\n&gt;&gt; And how the PDF understood this.\n\n514\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.490\nThis could again, you could have this from\nwebsites, from multiple places and files.\n\n515\n00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.750\nSo, this is one of those things\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n516\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.451\nAnd, if I didn't have that on,\nI might not know any different, it just,\n\n517\n00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:02.840\nit looks pretty much the same so\nit's fine, but\n\n518\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.453\nif I take this into the text only,\nit's like wow, what just happened?\n\n519\n00:26:06.453 --> 00:26:09.345\nCuz now it's doing space after paragraph,\n\n520\n00:26:09.345 --> 00:26:13.567\nwe'll talk about that in later episodes,\nand then it's just,\n\n521\n00:26:13.567 --> 00:26:18.045\nit's not as one flowing continuous\nparagraph, that's an issue.\n\n522\n00:26:18.045 --> 00:26:18.847\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n523\n00:26:18.847 --> 00:26:24.130\nknowing that it does that\nsometimes is important.\n\n524\n00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.600\nNow how could I make\nthat a whole paragraph?\n\n525\n00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.460\nWell, I'm gonna have to leave it as\na cliffhanger for another episode.\n\n526\n00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.228\n&gt;&gt; But\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n527\n00:26:28.228 --> 00:26:29.288\n&gt;&gt; You can't, Vonne.\n\n528\n00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:31.122\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's so rude.\n\n529\n00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:33.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm so mean.\n\n530\n00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.400\nBut it is, it's actually in the next one.\n\n531\n00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.495\nIt's in the find and replace.\n\n532\n00:26:36.495 --> 00:26:39.154\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n&gt;&gt; I will show you my little trick for\n\n533\n00:26:39.154 --> 00:26:43.190\nbeing able to get those\nparagraphs out into a single one.\n\n534\n00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:46.260\nBut I would like to\nleave on one last thing.\n\n535\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.340\nBack here in Word, if you want to,\nI just want to show you the preferences.\n\n536\n00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.130\nLike a lot of stuff If I go to\nPreferences, and I go to Edit,\n\n537\n00:26:54.130 --> 00:27:00.160\nthere is an option down here of\nhow it treats Cut and Paste.\n\n538\n00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.080\nYou definitely want to\nkeep the smart tags or\n\n539\n00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.820\nthe Paste Options button using\nthe Smart Cut and Paste.\n\n540\n00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:13.448\nBut notice on the settings,\nthere are some more specific things that\n\n541\n00:27:13.448 --> 00:27:19.890\nyou can alter with the word spacing,\nthe smart-style emerging format one.\n\n542\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.720\nFrom Powerpoint.\n\n543\n00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.540\nThose different things.\n\n544\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.230\nI don't normally go with this deep.\n\n545\n00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:31.226\nCuz I just go ahead and, I know about the\npaste options and I use them, but just in\n\n546\n00:27:31.226 --> 00:27:36.223\ncase you want to, when we get more into\nword spacing and space after paragraph,\n\n547\n00:27:36.223 --> 00:27:41.230\nthis might make more sense to you, and\nwhy you might want to do it, but, hey.\n\n548\n00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.840\nI just at least wanted to let you\nknow that they're in there, and\n\n549\n00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.870\nthat you could go ahead and\nchange it if you want.\n\n550\n00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.050\nAnd if you weren't getting those little\nsmart tags that we were talking about, you\n\n551\n00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.660\nmight wanna check these and make sure that\nthese are both checked on to have them.\n\n552\n00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.442\nAnd I believe, I'm done.\n\n553\n00:27:54.442 --> 00:27:57.724\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Thank you.\nSometimes I feel like I need to find and\n\n10\n00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.546\nreplace my brain.\n\n11\n00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:34.505\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\n\n12\n00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, in this sense we are going to go\n\n13\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.160\nahead and find words or\nsome other things, and then.\n\n14\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.050\nWe could stop right there, you could say I\njust want to find them but normally, yeah,\n\n15\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.670\nnormally you'd probably wanna\nreplace it with something.\n\n16\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.863\n&gt;&gt; With another word.\n\n17\n00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:53.662\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly.\n\n18\n00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:56.506\nYes like for\nexample if I wanted to change,\n\n19\n00:00:56.506 --> 00:01:01.089\nmaybe we had a list of people in our\norganization or what have you, and\n\n20\n00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.690\nsomebody got married whatever and\nthey changed their last name.\n\n21\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.500\nSo now, everywhere were it's Vonne Smith,\nit needs to be Vonne Adams.\n\n22\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.311\nI never teach my names so\nit's fine [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:13.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it was just one of\n\n24\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.200\nthose things where you just need to go\nahead and find this and replace with that.\n\n25\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.490\nBut think about this.\n\n26\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.960\nHow many Smiths might\nbe in an organization?\n\n27\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.210\n&gt;&gt; There could be a couple.\n\n28\n00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but would you want to\nreplace all the Smiths with Adams?\n\n29\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.900\nProbably not.\n\n30\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.180\nSo you might wanna say okay\nwell let's go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.100\nnope, nope find the next one,\nfind the next one.\n\n32\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.670\nThere's one.\n\n33\n00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.430\nThat's the right Smith that\nneeds to be changed to Adams.\n\n34\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.980\nLet's go ahead and replace that.\n\n35\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.400\nWe're gonna go through all the different\noptions of the find next and replace all.\n\n36\n00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.340\nAnd then also get into some tricks.\n\n37\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; And things like that,\n\n38\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.565\nthat I love to do.\n\n39\n00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:53.250\n&gt;&gt; So, instead of the finder of lost lugs,\nit's the finder of lost words.\n\n40\n00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there you go.\n\n41\n00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.813\nWe'll do that.\n\n42\n00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:56.197\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good.\n\n43\n00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:58.680\n&gt;&gt; So, let's go ahead and get started.\n\n44\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.210\nYou know what, I didn't open up the file\nbefore we get started, that's okay.\n\n45\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.105\nI've got my finder right here that\nI could find the find and replace.\n\n46\n00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:08.982\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Didn't even mean to do that, so-\n\n47\n00:02:08.982 --> 00:02:09.633\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.706\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's open this up, and\n\n49\n00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:15.440\nlet's zoom in a little bit so we can see.\n\n50\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.250\nThis is just the same text\nwe've been looking at, right?\n\n51\n00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.740\nWe've got Alice, and we've also got\nthe rabbit and so on and so forth.\n\n52\n00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.720\nSo the thing that I'm going\nto want to find first.\n\n53\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.020\nLet say I want to find all of\nthe places where Alice is written in.\n\n54\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.880\nNow, where you gotta start,\n\n55\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.450\nyou do have this up here at the very\ntop of your title bar area.\n\n56\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.510\nWhere you can search in a document.\n\n57\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.390\nYou click in there,\nthat's exactly what it's gonna do.\n\n58\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.062\nI gonna type in something and\nit gonna search the document.\n\n59\n00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:50.719\nYou see automatically it went ahead and\n\n60\n00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.800\nhighlighted all of that particular\nword that I typed in on the document.\n\n61\n00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.760\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n62\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.531\n&gt;&gt; It is good.\n&gt;&gt; It's a highlighting,\n\n63\n00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:03.160\nlike highlight everything that I\nsee here and that's what it does.\n\n64\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.230\nThere are some little\nbuttons up at the top, so\n\n65\n00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.750\nthere's a left button and there's\na right button where you can go through.\n\n66\n00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.480\nBecause right now the first\none that is on is this one.\n\n67\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.943\nIf I click this button to the right,\ndid you see how it's jumping down,\n\n68\n00:03:17.943 --> 00:03:21.771\nit's actually kind of like say [SOUND]\nthere's like a little bloop on each one.\n\n69\n00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:22.620\n&gt;&gt; They're just skipping.\n\n70\n00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes and it's going down so\nthat each one that I'm going through, so\n\n71\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.210\nI can go forward or backwards.\n\n72\n00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.410\nSo if you're thinking about,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n73\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.610\nfind that Smith,\nyou can bump through here.\n\n74\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.560\nBut this right here,\nall it does is find, it's just a search.\n\n75\n00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.035\nTotally fine if that's what you want.\n\n76\n00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:42.245\n&gt;&gt; So my question is this.\n\n77\n00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:43.990\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; If may be so bold.\n\n78\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.750\nIf I want to change that one word so\nit's a different word now,\n\n79\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.555\nbut in every single respect.\n\n80\n00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:49.370\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n81\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.160\n&gt;&gt; Every places of word it's\nhighlighted now it appears.\n\n82\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.440\nI want to be just a different word,\ncan I do that?\n\n83\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Yes, like say we want to replace Alice\nwith Jane, we could totally do that.\n\n84\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.566\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND].\n&gt;&gt; But from this dialogue box right here,\n\n85\n00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:03.570\nit's only a find.\n\n86\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Only a find.\n\n87\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.700\n&gt;&gt; It's only a search.\n\n88\n00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But do you see this little guy right\n\n89\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.720\nover here to the left of this.\n\n90\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.945\nThis is where we could go to replace,\nbut I'm gonna go over here first.\n\n91\n00:04:14.945 --> 00:04:16.610\nOkay.\nI'm gonna go to the least\n\n92\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.490\nmatches in the sidebar.\n\n93\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.059\nBecause then,\n\n94\n00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.780\nit actually gives us all this stuff\nthat we could do the replace over here.\n\n95\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.380\nSo it's just a little bit easier.\n\n96\n00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.200\nThere's two places we can go here or\n\n97\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.970\nwe can go into the dialog box\nwhich we are gonna go to next.\n\n98\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n99\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.990\n&gt;&gt; But notice I can go right here to find,\nand it's highlighting all of them.\n\n100\n00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.270\nThe really cool thing about this sidebar,\nwe'll come to what you're talking about.\n\n101\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.413\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is that it's nice\n\n102\n00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:41.272\nthat you can click on these\nlittle parts over here, and\n\n103\n00:04:41.272 --> 00:04:45.190\nit'll jump you down into the place\nin the document where it's located.\n\n104\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.890\nSo think about if this was 15 pages,\nI could go ahead,\n\n105\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.400\nit would go to each one of those\npages that it needs to be on.\n\n106\n00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is pretty cool\n\n107\n00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.430\nwith that side bar.\n\n108\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.130\n&gt;&gt; It is nice.\n\n109\n00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.050\n&gt;&gt; Like you just said,\nI wanna replace Alice with Jane, right?\n\n110\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So right down here, this our replace.\n\n111\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.950\nIf I type in Jane, right?\n\n112\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.760\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n113\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.820\n&gt;&gt; Now, what I can do.\n\n114\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.680\nWhy is this doing this weird stuff?\n\n115\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.770\nThere should be buttons.\n\n116\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.160\nThere is something really weird\ngoing on with my computer.\n\n117\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.720\nYou know what?\n\n118\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.070\nWe're gonna do this really quick.\n\n119\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.875\nJust for a second, let's just close\nit down and let's restart it back up.\n\n120\n00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:21.820\nThat ghosting.\n\n121\n00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.380\nWe had that happen in auto correct, too.\n\n122\n00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.260\n&gt;&gt; We did,\nwe had that happen earlier, yeah.\n\n123\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.010\n&gt;&gt; That's all right,\nwe'll be okay, let's try.\n\n124\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.185\n&gt;&gt; Live action debugging, folks.\n\n125\n00:05:28.185 --> 00:05:30.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's try it again, see?\n\n126\n00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.720\nLook at the buttons,\nthey're back, all right.\n\n127\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.330\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; So let's get back to where we were.\n\n128\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.450\nAlice, oops okay, Alice, right.\n\n129\n00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.290\nFound them.\n\n130\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.050\nI want to replace with Jane.\n\n131\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.810\nI have my buttons that\nhave the text on them now.\n\n132\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I could see what they're saying.\n\n133\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.980\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n134\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.410\n&gt;&gt; If I know that just straight up,\n\n135\n00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.250\nreplace all Alices with Jane,\nI just click on the replace all.\n\n136\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.920\n&gt;&gt; If I replace them all it just,\nboop, goes through.\n\n137\n00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.870\nAnd if I look at here, there's Jane, Jane.\n\n138\n00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.560\nJane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.\n\n139\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.204\n&gt;&gt; Somehow Jane in Wonderland doesn't\nhave the same gravitas as Alice.\n\n140\n00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:04.242\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n141\n00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:04.755\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:06.100\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that is\n\n143\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.780\nexactly what is does.\n\n144\n00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.580\nAnd the other thing to just notice,\n\n145\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.210\nand this is gonna come back\naround to some other thing.\n\n146\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.660\nNotice that I had Jane's,\nlike with the apostrophe s.\n\n147\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.320\nI also had Jane uppercase here, but\nthen I had it all capitalized here.\n\n148\n00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.680\nCuz originally it was Alice in all caps.\n\n149\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.030\nSo, it wasn't paying attention to\nanything about like, capitalization, or\n\n150\n00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.130\nanything to that effect,\nbecause of some of the find options.\n\n151\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.970\nLet's come back to that.\n\n152\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.780\nOoh.\n\n153\n00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.140\nThis is another big one that you should\nget familiar with when you start using\n\n154\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.750\nfind and replace.\n\n155\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.908\nAlways clear out your fields.\n\n156\n00:06:42.908 --> 00:06:48.036\nBecause I can tell you how many times\nI've like kept stuff in there and\n\n157\n00:06:48.036 --> 00:06:51.051\nit's just always gonna remember that.\n\n158\n00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:53.844\nSo if I'm ready to like okay,\nI don't wanna replace anything,\n\n159\n00:06:53.844 --> 00:06:55.979\ncome to where it says Jane\nbackspace out of that.\n\n160\n00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.376\nCome up to where it says Alice,\nbackspace out of that.\n\n161\n00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.566\nAnd let's type in rabbit.\n\n162\n00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:03.330\nThat's not how you spell rabbit.\n\n163\n00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.720\nRabbit, [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n164\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.090\nAll right, if I look at this,\n\n165\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.040\nlet's look at the ones that\nit has highlighted on here.\n\n166\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.290\nThere's rabbit here lowercase,\nRabbit uppercase.\n\n167\n00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.000\nI did this on purpose.\n\n168\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.640\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n169\n00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.890\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n170\n00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:25.250\nThis little guy right here,\nyou want to either ignore the case,\n\n171\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.730\nwhich is checked on, which is\nthe opposite of ignore would be to\n\n172\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.230\nmake sure you pay attention to the cage.\n\n173\n00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.220\nThis is a weird one.\n\n174\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.890\nI don't know why I did this like in\nthe PC version, it's match case.\n\n175\n00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.460\nLike match the case that\nI have written in here.\n\n176\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI see, right.\n\n177\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.990\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n178\n00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.760\nLet's just uncheck, ignore.\n\n179\n00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.260\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n180\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.675\n&gt;&gt; It's the same thing but it's just\nlike hurts my little brain right here.\n\n181\n00:07:50.675 --> 00:07:52.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can see right here,\n\n182\n00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.570\nrabbit lower case.\n\n183\n00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.070\nRight?\n\n184\n00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.863\nIt's not highlighted in this one, why?\n\n185\n00:07:57.863 --> 00:07:59.695\nCuz that's not the same, okay.\n\n186\n00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:05.960\nIt needed to ignore the case So\nI mean match exactly what it says.\n\n187\n00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's still backwards to me.\n\n188\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.190\n&gt;&gt; It's a conundrum,\nwrapped up in a bag of enigmas.\n\n189\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:12.740\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n190\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.540\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n191\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.740\n&gt;&gt; It's weird.\n\n192\n00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.270\nAnyways but at least you know\nthat that's what that means and\n\n193\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.960\nthat if you ignore the case,\nit's going to match the case.\n\n194\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.142\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I got it.\n\n195\n00:08:22.142 --> 00:08:23.480\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n196\n00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.156\nThe other one that we're looking at,\nlet's type in the word at.\n\n197\n00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:31.006\nSo if I have the word at, and\nI've got it all through here,\n\n198\n00:08:31.006 --> 00:08:36.211\nnotice it has like that, late,\nsome other ones, waistcoat, because A-T.\n\n199\n00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:37.022\n&gt;&gt; Waistcoat?\n\n200\n00:08:37.022 --> 00:08:38.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's all in there,\n\n201\n00:08:38.845 --> 00:08:44.100\nbut in this sense this is where whole\nwords only might come into play.\n\n202\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.223\nI want the word at,\nnot part of conversation, or what.\n\n203\n00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:50.060\nIf I choose this-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n204\n00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see where I'm getting at?\n\n205\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.785\n&gt;&gt; Yes I do,\nI get the gist of your jib now.\n\n206\n00:08:53.785 --> 00:08:58.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we've got the ones that\nI only want to find whole words.\n\n207\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.546\nSo some of these options that you have\nin your find are going to be important\n\n208\n00:09:03.546 --> 00:09:04.087\nto you.\n\n209\n00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:07.170\nThe, oops, no, I do not wanna enable Siri.\n\n210\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.400\nThe one that's a little\nweird is the sounds like.\n\n211\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.885\nLike if I typed in fear because I was\nthinking like there's something in here\n\n212\n00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:16.343\ncalled deer, so\nI was thinking fear, deer, right?\n\n213\n00:09:16.343 --> 00:09:19.422\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and sometimes deer have fear.\n\n214\n00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:21.520\n&gt;&gt; And so I choose.\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes we can fear deer.\n\n215\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:28.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if I do this one I've got,\nvery, four, very and four.\n\n216\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.520\nSo I guess that's what it means, yeah.\n\n217\n00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:36.640\nIt sounds like to Word Mac is very and\nfour, for fear.\n\n218\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.620\nI guess they do kinda sound the same,\nas I actually say them out loud, right?\n\n219\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.094\n&gt;&gt; The qualities are similar, I suppose.\n\n220\n00:09:42.094 --> 00:09:43.203\n&gt;&gt; Little bit of a stretch?\n\n221\n00:09:43.203 --> 00:09:45.110\nYeah, yeah.\n\n222\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.346\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm not sure if I\nwould totally use that one, but\n\n223\n00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:52.257\nI at least wanna show you that and\ndemonstrate that it does exist, and\n\n224\n00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:54.510\nthat you can-\n&gt;&gt; It still, what a time-saver though?\n\n225\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.415\nI mean, if you can select\nthe word that you're looking for\n\n226\n00:09:58.415 --> 00:10:00.249\nthroughout the document,\n\n227\n00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:05.720\ncertainly it might send you to a word that\nhas that word in it as a part of itself.\n\n228\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But still you're going to be able to\n\n229\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.780\nquickly boom, boom, boom,\ngo right through it.\n\n230\n00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.299\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, so\nfind and replace, I love it.\n\n231\n00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:13.112\nI mean, and find and\nreplace is in a lot of things.\n\n232\n00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:14.229\nThis is not just Word.\n\n233\n00:10:14.229 --> 00:10:18.803\nIt's in all of your Microsoft products and\njust a lot of things.\n\n234\n00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:22.067\nAnd even the find,\nyou can use that in your browsers.\n\n235\n00:10:22.067 --> 00:10:25.609\nAnd a lot of browsers if you do\nlike Ctrl or Cmd+F, for find,\n\n236\n00:10:25.609 --> 00:10:28.115\nit will bring that up and\nyou can type it in.\n\n237\n00:10:28.115 --> 00:10:28.931\nI use that all the time.\n\n238\n00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:29.827\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n239\n00:10:29.827 --> 00:10:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Like in Safari, if I went to ITProTV,\nI could find, if I believe, is it Cmd+F?\n\n240\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.670\nYes, notice right here.\n\n241\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.600\nI can just bring that search up and\nI could type in Amazon.\n\n242\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.290\nAnd notice it's gonna do the same thing.\n\n243\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So you can use find in a lot of\n\n244\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.700\ndifferent applications that\nis not just Word specific.\n\n245\n00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.480\nAll right, let's move on to,\nooh, the advanced find and\n\n246\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.000\nreplace, the dialogue box.\n\n247\n00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz the side bar's nice.\n\n248\n00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.340\nAnd I do like that the side bar and\nthe top there, up here,\n\n249\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.585\nwill go ahead and\nhighlight everything on the page.\n\n250\n00:11:07.585 --> 00:11:12.442\nIn the PC version of this, there's a check\nbox I believe, or highlight all or\n\n251\n00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:15.826\nhighlight in reading, or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n252\n00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:20.420\nI can't remember the exact words, but\nthat's what it would do the same thing.\n\n253\n00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.650\nHere it just kinda happens automatically\nif you're using these two places.\n\n254\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.080\nBut there is the advanced Find and\nReplace.\n\n255\n00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.950\nBy the way you can also\ngo through the Edit menu.\n\n256\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.910\nJust in case you were wondering,\nEdit &gt; Find &gt; Advanced Find and\n\n257\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.906\nReplace, because this takes\nyou to the dialog box.\n\n258\n00:11:39.906 --> 00:11:43.334\nAnd this is very similar\nto how it does work.\n\n259\n00:11:43.334 --> 00:11:45.090\nRight there.\nHighlight all items found in, okay,\n\n260\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.610\nthere it is, that's what it says.\n\n261\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.800\nAnd that's what it's actually\ncalled in Word, too.\n\n262\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.410\nAnd this is the dialogue box\nthat I do go to a lot of times.\n\n263\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.677\nNow notice there's a little button\nright here, that takes you.\n\n264\n00:11:57.677 --> 00:11:58.328\nA little hiccup.\n\n265\n00:11:58.328 --> 00:11:59.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n\n266\n00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.690\n&gt;&gt; That takes you to more options.\n\n267\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.970\nIt's just one, it happens.\n\n268\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.210\n&gt;&gt; It's a weird thing that I have.\n\n269\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:03.949\nI hiccup once, then stops.\n\n270\n00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:06.651\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wish I could say that.\n\n271\n00:12:06.651 --> 00:12:09.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.930\n&gt;&gt; I start and, boy,\nit goes on for a while.\n\n273\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I don't, I don't know.\n\n274\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.287\nSomething I got, I'm just weird\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n275\n00:12:15.287 --> 00:12:17.610\nwe've got this expand and collapse.\n\n276\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.750\nAnd so you can see that it's giving me\nthose options that we had in that little\n\n277\n00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.704\nPreferences button right up here.\n\n278\n00:12:23.704 --> 00:12:26.660\nLike the, sounds like, match case.\n\n279\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.520\nNow nothing's going on right here\nbecause I have the sounds like on.\n\n280\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.050\nIf I turn that off, notice that I\nhave the options for the match case.\n\n281\n00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.840\nAnd also bringing up that it's still\nremembering that fear was in here.\n\n282\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.190\nSo that whole thing I said about\nmaking sure you clear out your fields?\n\n283\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It will get you in trouble.\n\n284\n00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.400\nI still do it to this day, so.\n\n285\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.569\nSo we have the find.\nWhat if I went ahead typed in,\n\n286\n00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:57.993\nlet's just say we'll go with, I see the\nword sister, so I'll just go with that.\n\n287\n00:12:57.993 --> 00:13:01.744\nNotice on this one, if I click find all,\nit will highlight but\n\n288\n00:13:01.744 --> 00:13:05.512\nit's not like the same highlighting,\nit's not the yellow.\n\n289\n00:13:05.512 --> 00:13:08.955\nYou see it's really kind of,\nit's not really dark, if you wanna say.\n\n290\n00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.796\nWell, it's just not yellow.\n\n291\n00:13:10.796 --> 00:13:11.364\n&gt;&gt; It's not yellow.\n\n292\n00:13:11.364 --> 00:13:12.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's still highlighting.\n\n293\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.270\nIt's just not the same as with\nthe sidebar, just know that there's\n\n294\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:21.700\nlittle differences, little nuances between\nthe sidebar versus the dialog box.\n\n295\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.950\nBut it does still work and\nyou can go with that.\n\n296\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.310\n&gt;&gt; So here's another one\nof Zach's crazy questions.\n\n297\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.090\nCan you look for more, or rather can\nyou highlight more than one word?\n\n298\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.301\nCan I go fear and also cheese and-\n&gt;&gt; Can I do more than that?\n\n299\n00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:36.142\n&gt;&gt; Multiple words?\n\n300\n00:13:36.142 --> 00:13:36.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n301\n00:13:36.898 --> 00:13:42.060\n&gt;&gt; No, I just don't know.\n\n302\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.347\n&gt;&gt; Why would you want to?\n\n303\n00:13:43.347 --> 00:13:44.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the point.\n\n304\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.147\n&gt;&gt; The point is why would you want to?\n\n305\n00:13:46.147 --> 00:13:47.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n306\n00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.608\nI'm pretty sure it's only one at a time.\n\n307\n00:13:50.608 --> 00:13:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you could do it again.\n\n308\n00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.836\n&gt;&gt; But now you perplexed me.\n\n309\n00:13:54.836 --> 00:13:56.620\n&gt;&gt; You're confusing.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n310\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.030\nI'm gonna say no.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n311\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.220\n&gt;&gt; But.\n\n312\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.180\n&gt;&gt; Revisit it later?\n\n313\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n314\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.795\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna have to consult\nthe Oracle on that one.\n\n315\n00:14:02.795 --> 00:14:03.421\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, you search for sister,\n\n319\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.085\ndo what you wanna do,\nsearch for tired or whatever.\n\n320\n00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:12.776\nAnd then do that.\n\n321\n00:14:12.776 --> 00:14:15.089\nSo I think that you have\nto go individually,\n\n322\n00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:16.722\nyou can't do it in multiples.\n\n323\n00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:18.850\n&gt;&gt;

Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; So you had to make some type of\n\n591\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.633\nindication that this is where my\nparagraphs are gonna break for\n\n592\n00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:21.450\nme to go back, and\nthen do a second replacement.\n\n593\n00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:28.293\nI've seen tutorials where people put like\na tilde sign or like an exclamation point,\n\n594\n00:28:28.293 --> 00:28:34.583\nor some type of character in there that\nis saying go back and find all the tilde.\n\n595\n00:28:34.583 --> 00:28:37.503\nSo replace all the enters with spaces,\n\n596\n00:28:37.503 --> 00:28:41.820\nthen go back and\nreplace all the tilde's with an Enter.\n\n597\n00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:47.023\nSo it doesn't mean I just picked three,\nI guess four when I was done,\n\n598\n00:28:47.023 --> 00:28:52.587\nfour spaces, you can do any type of\nrepetitive thing that you wanna find,\n\n599\n00:28:52.587 --> 00:28:56.394\ngo ahead and put those base or\nparagraphs back in.\n\n600\n00:28:56.394 --> 00:29:00.196\nSo it doesn't have to be exactly\nlike mine, like I said a tilde, but\n\n601\n00:29:00.196 --> 00:29:02.400\nI wouldn't use an exclamation point,\n\n602\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.896\ncuz then you might have\nan exclamation point in the document.\n\n603\n00:29:05.896 --> 00:29:07.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, come to think of it,\nit could happen.\n\n604\n00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:12.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's why I usually do like a\ncouple enters or like the double pipes or\n\n605\n00:29:12.932 --> 00:29:17.537\nsomething, or some character that I\nknow is not gonna be in the text.\n\n606\n00:29:17.537 --> 00:29:22.415\nAnd that's what I use as my paragraph\nde-limiter, if you wanna say, my spacer,\n\n607\n00:29:22.415 --> 00:29:25.980\nthe thing that I'm going to go back to-\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.940\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwe're back with another episode in\n\n4\n00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.026\nour Microsoft Word 2016 essentials for\nMac series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:24.348\nAnd we're gonna be looking at proofing and\nprinting.\n\n6\n00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:27.474\nAnd for some reason when I say proofing,\nI think of bread.\n\n7\n00:00:27.474 --> 00:00:30.501\nI don't know why, but\nI don't think that's what we're up to, but\n\n8\n00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:31.735\nultimately I don't know.\n\n9\n00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:34.984\nLuckily we do have someone in the studio\nthat does know what proofing and\n\n10\n00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:36.077\nprinting is all about.\n\n11\n00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.656\nMs. Vonne Smith,\nhow are you doing today Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:41.484\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic and I'm right there\nwith you because I worked in a bakery for\n\n13\n00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:42.451\nmany, many years.\n\n14\n00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:45.192\nAs soon as you said that,\nI'm like I know all about that proof box.\n\n15\n00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:49.467\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So but yes we are gonna be talking\n\n16\n00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:54.251\nabout how to do a spell check and\nthen how to print your documents.\n\n17\n00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:55.859\nSome very basic things,\n\n18\n00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.927\nwe have it in our introduction topic area\nof this particular series right now.\n\n19\n00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:05.141\nSo well why don't we just go ahead and\njust jump right in and get started\n\n20\n00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:10.014\nbecause I feel like these are things that\nmaybe a lot of people are familiar with.\n\n21\n00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:12.643\nI know I love me a good spell check and\n\n22\n00:01:12.643 --> 00:01:16.434\nI really need it because\nI'm not a good speller so.\n\n23\n00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:18.999\nLet's jump down and look at our computer.\n\n24\n00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.574\nI forgot to actually open up\nthe file before we started but\n\n25\n00:01:21.574 --> 00:01:23.248\nthat is okay I've got it right here.\n\n26\n00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:27.162\nWe are gonna open up spelling and\nproofing let it go ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:29.761\nget itself all nice and pretty in Word.\n\n28\n00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:34.532\nOkay since I have changed the resolution\non this monitor from my desk\n\n29\n00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:36.298\nover here to the studio.\n\n30\n00:01:36.298 --> 00:01:40.128\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nchange the window size a little bit and\n\n31\n00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:43.276\nthen zoom out a little bit as well,\nso we can see this.\n\n32\n00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:48.679\nJust more stuff, now we have covered a few\nof these things that we're gonna talk\n\n33\n00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.339\nabout now in some other episodes, such as\nwhat are the red squiggle lines meaning?\n\n34\n00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:58.576\nThe red squiggles, that means that\nyou have a spelling mistake, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:03.431\nWell, thug, thoughted, I don't even\nknow how to say that, so it's not, but\n\n36\n00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:07.586\nit's not thought, that's for\nsure we're missing and o in there.\n\n37\n00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:12.956\nAnd then we have some other lines\nthat are gonna show up on here.\n\n38\n00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:15.139\nWe have the blue underlines.\n\n39\n00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.945\nThat indicates a grammar\nmistake of some sort.\n\n40\n00:02:19.945 --> 00:02:21.978\nAnd that's checking for\nall sorts of things.\n\n41\n00:02:21.978 --> 00:02:24.806\nNow if you've looked\ndown here where it says,\n\n42\n00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:28.368\nwhen Alice had been all the way\ndown one side, duh duh duh.\n\n43\n00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:33.267\nWell you can see, well, I don't see any\ngrammatical mistakes there it seems.\n\n44\n00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:37.110\nBut it's really more like a syntax,\nthere's double spaces there.\n\n45\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.594\nRemember our wonderful show and\n\n46\n00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:41.460\nhide button that we've shown in\nsome other episodes as well.\n\n47\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.572\nYou could see right there oops, sorry,\nI've moved in a little too much.\n\n48\n00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:46.513\nRight there, two spaces.\n\n49\n00:02:46.513 --> 00:02:50.726\nSo it's nice that it's checking all\nsorts of those different things.\n\n50\n00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:56.277\nSo that's what those little marks\non your paper are going to mean.\n\n51\n00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:59.771\nSo you're pretty much\ngonna only see red and\n\n52\n00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:03.277\nblue squiggles and double lines like that.\n\n53\n00:03:03.277 --> 00:03:05.843\nSo that let's us know\nwhat's going on there.\n\n54\n00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:10.626\nSo it is checking for a lot of stuff.\n\n55\n00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:16.780\nWhen we're doing the on screen displays\nand when we run the wonderful spell check.\n\n56\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.721\nIts something that hopefully if\nyou've used Word a little bit or\n\n57\n00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.491\nuse computer it's like, just make sure\nyou always spell check your document.\n\n58\n00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:27.224\nEven then when one day when we\nactually had to write words on paper.\n\n59\n00:03:27.224 --> 00:03:30.184\nYou gotta make sure you've got\neverything spelled correctly.\n\n60\n00:03:30.184 --> 00:03:32.286\nSo where do we go to find that?\n\n61\n00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:34.496\nThat's in your Review tab and\n\n62\n00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:39.101\nright over here towards the left\nwe have Spelling &amp; Grammar.\n\n63\n00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.411\nYours might not be\nstacked on top of yours.\n\n64\n00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:45.498\nAgain my resolution is a little bit lower\nso that's why it's going to be stacked.\n\n65\n00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:48.284\nYou can also, I think it's in the Tools.\n\n66\n00:03:48.284 --> 00:03:51.199\nSoon as I started I was like I don't\nremember where it actually is in the menu.\n\n67\n00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.941\n[LAUGH] But it is in the Tools menu.\n\n68\n00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:57.295\nAnd I also went ahead and\nadded it onto my quick access toolbar.\n\n69\n00:03:57.295 --> 00:04:01.148\nSo wherever you wanna find it,\nit's always good to go ahead and run it.\n\n70\n00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:02.344\nSo why don't we do that?\n\n71\n00:04:02.344 --> 00:04:05.792\nAnd it's gonna go stating\nwhere my cursor was.\n\n72\n00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:10.454\nThat is another thing you might wanna just\ntake a little bit of notice when you start\n\n73\n00:04:10.454 --> 00:04:11.341\na spell check.\n\n74\n00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:15.265\nMake sure your cursor's at\nthe beginning of your document.\n\n75\n00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:19.014\nIt's okay if it's not, it'll start\nchecking from wherever it's at,\n\n76\n00:04:19.014 --> 00:04:23.067\nand it'll get to the end, say, hey do you\nwant me to go back to the beginning and\n\n77\n00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:26.341\nmake sure that I go back and\ngo from the top down, that's fine.\n\n78\n00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:30.005\nBut I always like to say might as\nwell just start from the beginning,\n\n79\n00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:31.173\nput my cursor there.\n\n80\n00:04:31.173 --> 00:04:35.312\nAnd then we go through the different\noptions that's in our spelling and\n\n81\n00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:36.699\ngrammar dialogue box.\n\n82\n00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.006\nWhat's finding as\nthe mistake at the top and\n\n83\n00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:44.757\nthen what the suggestions would\nbe to correct it at the bottom?\n\n84\n00:04:44.757 --> 00:04:49.443\nLike I've also mentioned sometimes\nI spell things so wrong and\n\n85\n00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:54.939\nget the letters so out of whack,\nit's like I have no suggestions for you.\n\n86\n00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.698\nI can't even suggest any words that's even\nclose to what you're doing because you\n\n87\n00:04:58.698 --> 00:04:59.781\nare so far off the mark.\n\n88\n00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:01.975\n&gt;&gt; Well, I will tell you,\nsometimes that's incredibly deflating.\n\n89\n00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:04.734\nYou're like, wow, I have several\nmillion dollars worth of research and\n\n90\n00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:07.419\ndevelopment and checking spelling,\nand you didn't even come close.\n\n91\n00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.676\nDid you mean dinosaur?\n\n92\n00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:10.871\nNo, I didn't mean dinosaur-.\n\n93\n00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:12.649\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\n\n94\n00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:16.558\nI'm not sure what I meant any more\nbecause I misspelled it so horribly and-\n\n95\n00:05:16.558 --> 00:05:17.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:18.335\n&gt;&gt; It happens\n\n97\n00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:19.566\nto all of us-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n98\n00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:21.331\n&gt;&gt; So I understand your plight Vonne.\n\n99\n00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:22.188\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yes.\n\n100\n00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:25.473\nSo it's a problem, but that's okay,\n\n101\n00:05:25.473 --> 00:05:29.965\nwe have hopefully enough\nthere that we can get going.\n\n102\n00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:33.298\nBut I did wannna go one place before we\ngo through all the different buttons.\n\n103\n00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:37.626\nSo I wanted to take you down here to\nthe Options just to let you know what it's\n\n104\n00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:38.743\nchecking, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:38.743 --> 00:05:41.935\nAlso, before we click that button,\nnotice it does say Check grammar.\n\n106\n00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:46.187\nIf I click the options, I'm actually\nin my Word preferences, just so\n\n107\n00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:50.821\nwe could have gotten it from the Word\n&gt; Preferences &gt; Spelling &amp; Grammar.\n\n108\n00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.279\nBut you can see it's always gonna do\nthings like check spelling as you type.\n\n109\n00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.357\nThat's what the red squiggles are.\n\n110\n00:05:56.357 --> 00:05:59.804\nNotice it's going to ignore\nwords in upper case.\n\n111\n00:05:59.804 --> 00:06:02.044\nThat could be a good or a bad thing.\n\n112\n00:06:02.044 --> 00:06:04.252\nYou might wanna turn that off sometimes.\n\n113\n00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:10.265\nFrequently confused words, that's a little\nconfusing of myself, but that's okay.\n\n114\n00:06:10.265 --> 00:06:12.843\nI'm assuming they're, there, and their.\n\n115\n00:06:12.843 --> 00:06:14.561\nRight, yeah.\n\n116\n00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:15.818\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n117\n00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:19.240\nthere just when you think you\ngot it right you still don't.\n\n118\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.559\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right [LAUGH] and\nI've done it here and there.\n\n119\n00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:25.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there.\n\n120\n00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:29.874\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right exactly I think you guys get\n\n121\n00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:33.615\nthe idea of the different\nwords that means the same or\n\n122\n00:06:33.615 --> 00:06:36.774\nare spelled differently, homonyms or no.\n\n123\n00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:37.529\nWhat are those?\n\n124\n00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.687\nWords that are same meaning,\nbut spelled differently?\n\n125\n00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:45.696\n&gt;&gt; No, homonyms are same sounds\nthat are spelled differently,\n\n126\n00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:49.659\nand may have different,\nI think that's right.\n\n127\n00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.820\nWe'll double-check that.\n\n128\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.781\n&gt;&gt; You can consult the oracle\nwhile we're going on.\n\n129\n00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:56.380\nBut yeah, I mean the English language,\nit's so crazy sometimes.\n\n130\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.495\nBut you can see that it does have all\nthese different things that it is going\n\n131\n00:06:59.495 --> 00:07:00.560\nthrough, and finding.\n\n132\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.636\nAnd with the grammar,\nyou can see it's checking the grammar.\n\n133\n00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:08.460\nI also have something else turned\non that's normally not turned on by\n\n134\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.135\ndefault which is this show\nreadability statistic.\n\n135\n00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:16.228\nSo if you run your spellcheck and it\ndoesn't give you the thing that it's gonna\n\n136\n00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:18.475\nhappen to me at the end, it's cuz of that.\n\n137\n00:07:18.475 --> 00:07:21.058\nReadability statistics are kinda fun so\n\n138\n00:07:21.058 --> 00:07:24.559\nthat's why I wanna show you\nthat it can do this for you.\n\n139\n00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:28.259\nBut just make sure you go into\nthe Options and turn this on.\n\n140\n00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:31.126\nAnd then the other thing I wanted\nto show you with the writing style\n\n141\n00:07:31.126 --> 00:07:32.021\nwith this grammar.\n\n142\n00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:33.519\nAnd there's grammar and more.\n\n143\n00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:38.418\nI wanna go into the settings to show you\nthat it is doing thing like it's gonna\n\n144\n00:07:38.418 --> 00:07:42.417\ncheck for adjectives instead of adverbs,\ncapitalization.\n\n145\n00:07:42.417 --> 00:07:46.538\nSome other things that [LAUGH]\ntalk about that English language.\n\n146\n00:07:46.538 --> 00:07:51.054\nI don't really even know what\nincorrect verb form after auxiliary?\n\n147\n00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:53.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what an auxiliary is.\n\n148\n00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.902\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n149\n00:07:53.902 --> 00:07:58.018\nincorrect verb form I guess those could be\nlike you're using past participle forms\n\n150\n00:07:58.018 --> 00:08:01.624\nwhen you shouldn't be and That's\nthe only way I know to describe a verb.\n\n151\n00:08:01.624 --> 00:08:04.362\nFor some have these weird\ntid bits of language,\n\n152\n00:08:04.362 --> 00:08:06.490\nby the way homophones not homonyms.\n\n153\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.180\n&gt;&gt; Homophones okay.\n\n154\n00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.069\nThen whats a homonym?\n\n155\n00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:14.734\n&gt;&gt; They're similar to homophones [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll go back to talking and\n\n156\n00:08:14.734 --> 00:08:16.140\nyou can look that up again.\n\n157\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.960\nAll these things in our English\nlanguage that like yeah,\n\n158\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.500\nwhen you were saying past participle.\n\n159\n00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.230\nI'm like, all I'm think about is Spanish\nand I still don't remember what it is.\n\n160\n00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.696\nBut anyways, I just wanna let you know\nthat there's a lot of things in here.\n\n161\n00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:32.958\nAnd you could go into,\ndo you wanna check for wordiness?\n\n162\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.402\nThat might be bad for us, right?\n\n163\n00:08:35.402 --> 00:08:36.378\n[LAUGH] I can get a little wordy.\n\n164\n00:08:36.378 --> 00:08:41.046\nThe jargon and everything, so just,\nI'm letting you know that it is in here.\n\n165\n00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:45.652\nWhere you could come into your grammar\nsettings and have it check more or\n\n166\n00:08:45.652 --> 00:08:50.110\nless of what it's going to,\nwell, be checking for you.\n\n167\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.850\nOne of the things that I love that,\n\n168\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.460\nspaces between the sentences,\ndo you want a one space or two space?\n\n169\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.680\nMy gosh, it's amazing.\n\n170\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.895\nSo that would be things\nthat I would like to do.\n\n171\n00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:04.314\nAnd whether or not you want your\npunctuation required with quotes.\n\n172\n00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:07.820\nIsn't that the whole idea of your\npunctuation needs to be within the closing\n\n173\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.073\nof the quote?\n\n174\n00:09:09.073 --> 00:09:13.040\n&gt;&gt; Man, I don't know,\nthis is where we have spelling and\n\n175\n00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.820\ngrammar check and, it's so\nhard to remember all of this.\n\n176\n00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.720\nOne quick question about this is\ncan we upload like custom possible.\n\n177\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.470\nMaybe if I'm running\ntechnical documents and\n\n178\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.740\nthere certain constraints\nwithin those grammar.\n\n179\n00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.100\nIs there anyway that I can create custom\nrules, or are we kinda just stuck?\n\n180\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.004\n&gt;&gt; Within grammar,\nthese are just the check boxes.\n\n181\n00:09:36.004 --> 00:09:40.016\nNow you do have things where you\ncan go in your dictionaries,\n\n182\n00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:45.590\nand add certain phrases and\neverything for it to stop checking words.\n\n183\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.760\nBut the actual grammar rule,\nI'm not sure if you can set.\n\n184\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.136\nBut as we go through it we can tell it to\nignore, and just I think once you start\n\n185\n00:09:56.136 --> 00:10:01.610\ntelling it to ignore, ignore all,\nit'll stop doing that for the most part.\n\n186\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.353\nAt least that is what I\nam going with right now.\n\n187\n00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.709\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So anyways,\n\n188\n00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:07.420\nback to our spell check.\n\n189\n00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.420\nLet's go through this.\n\n190\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.610\nThe word thoughts,\nwe need to go ahead and add that, good.\n\n191\n00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.941\nI am glad you got that there.\n\n192\n00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:15.652\nYou didn't necessarily have to select it,\n\n193\n00:10:15.652 --> 00:10:17.742\nI just wanted to show you\nthat we could go with change.\n\n194\n00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.926\nChange All, yeah,\nlet's just go with Change,\n\n195\n00:10:20.926 --> 00:10:24.510\ncuz I'm not sure how many\nother times we have it.\n\n196\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.910\nThis is one of where it says,\nI shall thinks nothing.\n\n197\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.640\nThat's a subject-verb agreement,\nthat is your grammar.\n\n198\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.610\nAnd so we would have,\nit's suggesting think, sounds good, and\n\n199\n00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.980\nwe go through it and start changing.\n\n200\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.030\nAnd now this is one, kinda back to what\nyou were talking about a little bit there,\n\n201\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.690\nJustin, down, down, down to ITProTV.\n\n202\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:48.570\nWell this is something that I'm gonna\nbe using all the time in writing,\n\n203\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.190\nbecause, well, that's where I work, right?\n\n204\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.780\nSo I don't want it to have to\nignore just this one time.\n\n205\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.404\nI also don't wanna have\nto just ignore all.\n\n206\n00:10:57.404 --> 00:11:02.598\nI could, but really what I should\nprobably do is add it to my dictionary,\n\n207\n00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:07.727\nthat this spelling of the capital ITP,\nand then RO and then capital TV.\n\n208\n00:11:07.727 --> 00:11:11.050\nThat's what I would like\nto have it remember.\n\n209\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.930\nSo you can add it to your dictionary.\n\n210\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:18.596\nSo if I click add, it's now remembering\nit's in, like a Word's global dictionary.\n\n211\n00:11:18.596 --> 00:11:22.104\nTo where is not going to\ntell that that is wrong.\n\n212\n00:11:22.104 --> 00:11:24.900\nLike, my name, that's a big one.\n\n213\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.620\nI always have to add my name to say nope,\nthat's not spelled wrong.\n\n214\n00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.120\nIt's been misspelled my entire life,\nthat's a whole other story.\n\n215\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.580\nBut, no, V O N N E is the proper\nway to spell my name.\n\n216\n00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.900\n&gt;&gt; If it makes you feel any better,\nsometimes it underlines my name as well.\n\n217\n00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.350\nIt's like nope, that's not, and\nI'm like It's a pretty common name,\n\n218\n00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.205\nI know a bunch of them.\n\n219\n00:11:42.205 --> 00:11:44.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it has to be fairly common.\n\n220\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n221\n00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.670\nI mean I'm Justin Timberlake.\n\n222\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.450\nSo I mean [LAUGH].\n\n223\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.640\nYeah definitely.\n\n224\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.940\nSo and now here's one,\nthe center of the earth.\n\n225\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.250\nNow look at how they spelled it.\n\n226\n00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.460\nIt's really small, but they're doing\nlike the English spelling of that right?\n\n227\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.280\nThe re instead of.\n\n228\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.365\nSo is that technically wrong?\n\n229\n00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:09.317\n[SOUND] Just depends on like what region,\nI guess, the dialect or.\n\n230\n00:12:09.317 --> 00:12:10.898\n&gt;&gt; The locale settings so to speak.\n\n231\n00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:11.894\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n232\n00:12:11.894 --> 00:12:15.510\n[LAUGH] But we're gonna go ahead and\nchange it back to center.\n\n233\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.600\nAnd then we just keep on going.\n\n234\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.480\nOkay down, and you get where you\njust start accepting all of them for\n\n235\n00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.468\nthe most part but right here,\nlike no, dina all, miss.\n\n236\n00:12:25.468 --> 00:12:30.030\nThat's something that's part of the text,\nso I would either add or\n\n237\n00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.610\nI would just ignore all.\n\n238\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.760\nSo I know there's a couple other ones\nin here, so I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n239\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.060\nignore that one.\n\n240\n00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.680\nShould, yeah we'll change that.\n\n241\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.563\nThis is a grammar one, it's gonna add\na space after the sentence, that's nice.\n\n242\n00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:45.136\nSo you just go through and\njust read them all,\n\n243\n00:12:45.136 --> 00:12:48.476\nsee that this has got a double space,\nchange everything.\n\n244\n00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.940\nI'm just gonna keep on going through for\nthe most part.\n\n245\n00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.190\nAnd I think we should be done,\nand yes, readability statistics.\n\n246\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.007\nWell, the statistics of your document,\n\n247\n00:12:58.007 --> 00:13:02.680\nlike how many words, characters,\nthe average words per sentence.\n\n248\n00:13:04.706 --> 00:13:11.090\nThis one, the Flesch reading ease and\nFlesch-Kincaid grade level.\n\n249\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.415\nSo this is at a 6.5 grade level.\n\n250\n00:13:13.415 --> 00:13:17.909\nIsn't that nice, I always tell the story\nof this when we are doing the proofing.\n\n251\n00:13:17.909 --> 00:13:21.592\nI had a guy in my class, long, long ago,\nthat said he used to work for the navy.\n\n252\n00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:28.187\nAnd this was his job, was to write and\nproof the technical manuals for\n\n253\n00:13:28.187 --> 00:13:33.200\nthe navy and\nwhere he said there was a whole formula.\n\n254\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.010\nThey would count all the words, and\nhow many words were over five characters?\n\n255\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.578\nHow many words were over 10 characters?\n\n256\n00:13:38.578 --> 00:13:41.487\nOr, all these different kind of\nparameters that they would do.\n\n257\n00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:45.797\nAnd they had this whole calculation\nto determine whether or\n\n258\n00:13:45.797 --> 00:13:48.640\nnot it was at a certain reading level for\n\n259\n00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.930\nthe Navy to be able to distribute\nto everybody in the Navy.\n\n260\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.540\nI thought that was an interesting story,\nso.\n\n261\n00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, being a a former teacher myself,\nwe used to have to consider,\n\n262\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.630\nwhen I would grab articles for\nindividuals to read or whatever.\n\n263\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.780\nI will put them in word to get\nthose reading level calculations.\n\n264\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.167\nThere is a lot of different calculations\nI think the Flesch–Kincaid,\n\n265\n00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:11.039\nI'm horrible with pronouncing that.\n\n266\n00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:15.359\nIs a fairly common one that\nwill give a great level roughly\n\n267\n00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:18.426\nestimate of the difficulty of the text.\n\n268\n00:14:18.426 --> 00:14:21.868\nAnd if you wanna find something\ninteresting, grab news articles and\n\n269\n00:14:21.868 --> 00:14:24.357\nstuff and put them in there and\nget it to rate them,\n\n270\n00:14:24.357 --> 00:14:26.512\nit's interesting I'll leave it at that.\n\n271\n00:14:26.512 --> 00:14:28.168\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah we'll leave it at that,\n\n272\n00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:31.490\nyeah I'm probably\nmispronouncing that as well.\n\n273\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:36.310\nAnd there was a specific grade level that\neverything in the Navy had to be below,\n\n274\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.120\nin a sense,\nto where everybody could read it.\n\n275\n00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.190\nAnd so yeah it's I think it's\nan interesting little thing.\n\n276\n00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.560\nAnd yes, there are other scales\nin how you calculate it, but\n\n277\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.400\nthis is the one that Word is using.\n\n278\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.870\nAnd I apologize to the people who\nmade this, cuz if we're butchering\n\n279\n00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:54.905\nthe pronunciation of your\ngrade level scale, sorry.\n\n280\n00:14:54.905 --> 00:14:58.285\n[LAUGH] All right, so that's what we\ngot with our readability statistics.\n\n281\n00:14:58.285 --> 00:15:01.881\nI'm going to go ahead and click the OK\nbutton here to say that I am done, but\n\n282\n00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:04.676\nremember you do have to turn\nthat on in your preferences.\n\n283\n00:15:04.676 --> 00:15:09.462\nLet's talk about the thesaurus,\nand I have to stop and\n\n284\n00:15:09.462 --> 00:15:12.698\npause when I say the word thesaurus.\n\n285\n00:15:12.698 --> 00:15:17.691\nCuz I start to Blend it all together and\nit comes out like [SOUND].\n\n286\n00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:21.020\n[LAUGH] What is the thesaurus?\n\n287\n00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:26.185\nIt is a book of synonyms, we're talking\nabout homonyms and homophones, right?\n\n288\n00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:27.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and well,\n\n289\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.470\nspeaking of nym sounds,\na homophone is a homonym.\n\n290\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Technically.\n\n291\n00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.700\nFair and fair like county fair or\nthat is fair, homonym.\n\n292\n00:15:36.794 --> 00:15:39.400\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's F A I R.\n\n293\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.353\n&gt;&gt; It's exact same spelling,\nexact same pronunciation,\n\n294\n00:15:43.353 --> 00:15:46.850\ndifferent meanings depending on context.\n\n295\n00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.676\nHomophone, same sound,\ndifferent meanings in different spellings.\n\n296\n00:15:51.676 --> 00:15:55.797\n&gt;&gt; So that would be F A R E, like a fare.\n\n297\n00:15:55.797 --> 00:16:00.594\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, fare and fair, like a tax fare or\nlike a, Fair for a ticket, ticket fare.\n\n298\n00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:04.094\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or pair and pear,\nlike a fruit versus a pair of shoes.\n\n299\n00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:08.131\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n300\n00:16:08.131 --> 00:16:09.621\n&gt;&gt; I taste the nerd in here,\nI can't help it.\n\n301\n00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:11.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just can't help it.\n\n302\n00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.020\nBut thesaurus is synonyms which, Vonne,\nI was not researching that off camera.\n\n303\n00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.660\nWhat are synonyms?\n\n304\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.650\n&gt;&gt; They're words that are similar.\n\n305\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.920\n[LAUGH] As soon as you threw\nthat back to me, I'm like gosh,\n\n306\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.120\ndo I know the correct [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.920\n&gt;&gt; The correct definition of a synonym?\n\n308\n00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.570\nBut those will be words that are the same,\nthe similar meanings.\n\n309\n00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.310\nCorrect well, you know what?\n\n310\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.060\nWe have Word to let me know what they are,\n\n311\n00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.455\ncuz now you're starting to\nmake me second guess myself.\n\n312\n00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.190\n[LAUGH] Let's check this out.\n\n313\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:44.360\nSo on the Review tab, we do have\nthe thesaurus and it's a button but\n\n314\n00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.230\nI like to not necessarily use that\npanel as much as I like to use\n\n315\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.640\nthe right-click for again, for again?\n\n316\n00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.560\n[LAUGH] For example, how brave,\nwell, there are other words for\n\n317\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.940\nbrave, if you just right-click\non the word, you can get to\n\n318\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:07.370\nsynonyms like how courageous,\nvaliant, heroic, bold.\n\n319\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.920\nThose are words that\nare the same synonyms.\n\n320\n00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.490\nThey're the synonyms, right, yeah,\nthey're words that mean the same.\n\n321\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.760\nSo I feel like I'm getting myself\ndown my own rabbit hole right now\n\n322\n00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.840\ntrying to explain this.\n\n323\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.690\n&gt;&gt; And looking at these words,\nI think so similarity,\n\n324\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.830\nI think you actually brought it up.\n\n325\n00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.450\nSimilarity does not equate equivalence.\n\n326\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.330\nWhat I mean is replacing a synonym for\n\n327\n00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.090\na word doesn't necessarily\ngive exactly the same meaning.\n\n328\n00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.930\nBrave in this context, maybe heroic is\nnot, may they didn't do anything heroic.\n\n329\n00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.327\nMaybe they were brave in\nthe face of some danger,\n\n330\n00:17:43.327 --> 00:17:45.690\nwhich doesn't necessarily imply heroism.\n\n331\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.150\n&gt;&gt; And that's with the whole context.\n\n332\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n333\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.500\ncuz how plucky they'll\nall think of me at home.\n\n334\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.460\nOkay, well, then there you go.\n\n335\n00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.560\nYes, and I do remember having books.\n\n336\n00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.860\nI had a thesaurus when I was young, and we\nwould always have to go through that and\n\n337\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.360\nlook through different words.\n\n338\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.470\nWhen you're writing your papers and\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n339\n00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.960\nI tend to right-click on it,\nI think it's a little easier.\n\n340\n00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.396\nI think we'll go back to brave in there,\nbut yeah, do use this with caution.\n\n341\n00:18:13.396 --> 00:18:16.302\nThe only reason why I don't\nlike to use the task pane,\n\n342\n00:18:16.302 --> 00:18:19.790\nit's just cuz it doesn't work\nthe way I think it should.\n\n343\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.820\nSo for example, look at my\nclusters just on the work grade.\n\n344\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.278\nAnd I haven't selected, so if you click\non the source, it's gonna bring it up.\n\n345\n00:18:27.278 --> 00:18:31.180\nOkay, cool, well, that's not so bad but\nit's like all these different ones and\n\n346\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.760\nit nice it does give you some\nother options in here, so\n\n347\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.540\nyou can see it has an adjective and\nalso has the verb form of it.\n\n348\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.560\nBut to me, I get going and\nlike let me go and put in heroic, so\n\n349\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.480\nyou click on it and nothing happens.\n\n350\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.350\nThen you double-click on it and\nthen it doesn't change it.\n\n351\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.291\nIt's just gonna put heroic into the top\nof what it's searching for, and\n\n352\n00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:54.404\nthen give you the other words\nthat are similar to heroic.\n\n353\n00:18:54.404 --> 00:18:57.460\nAnd then if you go to valiant, and\nit keeps going back and forth.\n\n354\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.250\nSo to me it's like if I'm\ngonna double-click it,\n\n355\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.550\nit should replace the word that's in\nmy page, why isn't it doing that?\n\n356\n00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:08.120\nSo that's the only reason why but\nif I did wanna use fearless,\n\n357\n00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.510\nif I right-click on it, that's the way\nthat you can click on insert and\n\n358\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.620\nthen it will replace the word\nbrave with fearless.\n\n359\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.940\nSo I think it's just less\nsteps if you right-click.\n\n360\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.580\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, also I noticed when you\noriginally searched for brave,\n\n361\n00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.200\nyou got the adjective as\nwell as the verb form, but\n\n362\n00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.950\nwe didn't see the verb forms\non the right-click menu.\n\n363\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.660\nIs that because the right-click\nmenu is context based?\n\n364\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.790\nIt's trying to figure out hey,\n\n365\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:35.420\nthis is used as an adjective versus as\na verb between those two interfaces?\n\n366\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.070\n&gt;&gt; I believe so.\n\n367\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.870\nI'm sure it may be seeing\nit within the context and\n\n368\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.180\nthen showing the verb afterward\nrather than the first one.\n\n369\n00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.137\nBut I mean, I know Iook up synonyms\nall the time on Oracle and\n\n370\n00:19:46.137 --> 00:19:49.080\nit brings me out to I think thesaurus.com.\n\n371\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:54.640\nAnd it will have each one, the verb form\nor the noun form and those different ones.\n\n372\n00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.590\nSo I think it's just a regular\nthesaurus would go ahead and\n\n373\n00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.932\nput in there and just go with it.\n\n374\n00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:03.525\nSo, that'ss what I'm\ngoing to go with here.\n\n375\n00:20:03.525 --> 00:20:07.760\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthat's why we have the thesaurus for you.\n\n376\n00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.098\nNow there is some kind of cute things\nthat happen nowadays within your Office\n\n377\n00:20:12.098 --> 00:20:15.140\nproducts, it's called Smart Lookup.\n\n378\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.120\nSmart Lookup, you do have to have\nInternet connection for it, so\n\n379\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.388\nif I want to there were doors.\n\n380\n00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:26.426\nIf I right-click on the word doors and\ngo to smart lookup,\n\n381\n00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:28.534\nit's gonna bring over here on the side.\n\n382\n00:20:28.534 --> 00:20:30.339\nAnd it's look at that,\n\n383\n00:20:30.339 --> 00:20:34.873\nwhat's the first thing that comes up\nwith the doors is the band, okay?\n\n384\n00:20:34.873 --> 00:20:39.510\nAnd you see it's going out online and\nlooking for there now there's some images.\n\n385\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:45.400\nSo if I right-click on fall and then go\nto smart lookup, what is what is poem?\n\n386\n00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.160\nNow you could see on this particular word,\nthere's a verb, there's a noun, and\n\n387\n00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.740\nthen there's an autumn wikipedia article.\n\n388\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.690\nSo it's truly just going out and\nkind of taking this word and\n\n389\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.929\nusing as were to search for\nusing probably Bing,\n\n390\n00:20:58.929 --> 00:21:03.525\nI am going to assume because that's\ngoing to be their search engine.\n\n391\n00:21:03.525 --> 00:21:06.700\nAnd this gives you that yep, out there it\nsays Powered by Bing down at the bottom.\n\n392\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.020\nSo that's what it's just going out and\n\n393\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.690\nfinding the word on the Internet,\nthat's what a smart lookup is.\n\n394\n00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.263\nSo kind of fun, could be useful.\n\n395\n00:21:15.263 --> 00:21:16.223\nBut that's what it is [LAUGH].\n\n396\n00:21:16.223 --> 00:21:18.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that is smart lookup.\n\n397\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.170\n&gt;&gt; That's one of those things where you\nwill definitely have to be careful.\n\n398\n00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.460\nBut yeah, I made some images.\n\n399\n00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.530\nMake sure that you're actually\nreading the document.\n\n400\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.644\nCuz I don't think the doors,\nthe bands album\n\n401\n00:21:27.644 --> 00:21:28.507\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:21:28.507 --> 00:21:29.832\n&gt;&gt; Cover necessarily fits in\n\n403\n00:21:29.832 --> 00:21:31.340\nthe context of the story.\n\n404\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.000\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, yeah.\n\n405\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.040\nI'm gonna take a [INAUDIBLE] at that one\nalong that same lines, always proofread.\n\n406\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.580\nIt's funny because on this we have\nour notes that we print out and\n\n407\n00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.470\nright up here, episode find and replace.\n\n408\n00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.340\nAnd this says proof and print.\n\n409\n00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.810\nAnd right down here,\nit says always proofread.\n\n410\n00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.660\nI didn't do that,\nbecause I didn't even match it.\n\n411\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.040\nSo definitely go through and\nread your document.\n\n412\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.490\nBecause for example on this second\nparagraph right down here, we can see\n\n413\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:08.670\nthere should be she waked\nsadly down the middle.\n\n414\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.930\nWell, I mean I've woken up sad too,\nbut this should be walked.\n\n415\n00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:19.170\nSo there's nothing wrong it didn't pick up\nin the spell check because wait is a word.\n\n416\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.860\nSo now it's walked and\nI think there's another one.\n\n417\n00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.510\nI have holt, right there.\n\n418\n00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.690\nThere were doors around the holt.\n\n419\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.740\nNo, that should be hall, okay.\n\n420\n00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.760\nSo I can have things that are not gonna\nbe picked up in the spell check or\n\n421\n00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.840\nthe grammar check.\n\n422\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.670\nAnd still have it not make any sense\nwhen the context of what we're writing,\n\n423\n00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.240\nso always, always,\nproofread your document.\n\n424\n00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.680\nNow printing, printing, the document.\n\n425\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.850\nDoesn't Don go and curse our printer\npretty much every morning, right?\n\n426\n00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.706\n&gt;&gt; He is not by himself.\n\n427\n00:22:51.706 --> 00:22:54.700\nThe other morning I tried to print\na single page and got five copies.\n\n428\n00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.440\nI don't know what happened.\n\n429\n00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.050\nPrinting can definitely be a pain.\n\n430\n00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:03.977\nBut luckily, I'm guessing Word\nmakes it at least a little more,\n\n431\n00:23:03.977 --> 00:23:07.216\na little easier to check\nsomething [LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:23:07.216 --> 00:23:09.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is the whole idea.\n\n433\n00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.490\nSo we could go ahead and\ntell it to do all these things.\n\n434\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.060\nBut from [INAUDIBLE] from the connection\nof your computer to the printer,\n\n435\n00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.360\nthere's some weird things that happen and\n\n436\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.180\nyour printer decides to have\na complete mind of its own.\n\n437\n00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.110\nThat being said,\n\n438\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.420\nI can't help you on that one cuz we\ndon't even know how to fix our little\n\n439\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.255\ncomputer sometimes besides maybe want to\ntake it out back and make it go away.\n\n440\n00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:32.060\n[LAUGH] But anyways,\n\n441\n00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.710\nthe printing options you have in Word,\nthat's what I'd like to go over.\n\n442\n00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.840\nI'm gonna close this file.\n\n443\n00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.930\nI'm not gonna save the changes that\nyou guys can have all the same\n\n444\n00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:41.830\noptions that I have.\n\n445\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.440\nAnd there is a file called print,\n\n446\n00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.710\nmarkup options, there's a specific\nreason why I chose this one.\n\n447\n00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:53.336\nAnd while this is a little bit more of an\nadvance concept of using track changes in\n\n448\n00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:54.312\nyour document.\n\n449\n00:23:54.312 --> 00:23:59.130\nI wanted to bring this up because it does\ncorrelate into what you're going to be\n\n450\n00:23:59.130 --> 00:23:59.864\nprinting.\n\n451\n00:23:59.864 --> 00:24:02.432\nSo anyways I worked on this one.\n\n452\n00:24:02.432 --> 00:24:06.070\nI've made some changes like\nLynn says documented it.\n\n453\n00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.099\nThere are track changes on and\nthat's what you're seeing right now.\n\n454\n00:24:10.099 --> 00:24:14.645\nI also have on the review tab that\nall markup is being shown, okay?\n\n455\n00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:19.024\nIf you want more on that, go to\nExpert Series and we will talk about that.\n\n456\n00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:23.677\nNow we are just gonna talk about printing,\nbecause the print dialog box in Windows\n\n457\n00:24:23.677 --> 00:24:26.384\nfor Mac, Windows for Mac,\ndid I just say that?\n\n458\n00:24:26.384 --> 00:24:29.026\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna act like\nthat didn't happen.\n\n459\n00:24:29.026 --> 00:24:33.088\nI think you said Word for\nMac Vonne, I'm pretty sure.\n\n460\n00:24:33.088 --> 00:24:35.399\nNow rewind, it was Word for Mac.\n\n461\n00:24:35.399 --> 00:24:40.901\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Word from Mac is\ndifferent than Word for PC.\n\n462\n00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:42.634\n[INAUDIBLE] Office are very different.\n\n463\n00:24:42.634 --> 00:24:44.966\nThe PC one I will say I like\ninterface a lot better.\n\n464\n00:24:44.966 --> 00:24:48.236\nBut this one,\njust let me know where you need to go.\n\n465\n00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:51.081\nSo here's my print dialogue box.\n\n466\n00:24:51.081 --> 00:24:56.392\nNow first, you're like so all I get is\nprinting my page ranges, and that's it?.\n\n467\n00:24:56.392 --> 00:24:57.089\nReally?\n\n468\n00:24:57.089 --> 00:24:58.784\nThat's all I've got for my options?\n\n469\n00:24:58.784 --> 00:24:59.954\nNo, like I said,\n\n470\n00:24:59.954 --> 00:25:04.806\nit just doesn't have a nice side bar\ndown the side that you have on your PC.\n\n471\n00:25:04.806 --> 00:25:08.352\nYou have the different options\nright here on this drop-down.\n\n472\n00:25:08.352 --> 00:25:12.197\nNotice that there is all of these\ndifferent things like the layout,\n\n473\n00:25:12.197 --> 00:25:16.378\nthe paper handling, the pin printing,\nwhich I actually had to look up for\n\n474\n00:25:16.378 --> 00:25:16.997\nthis one.\n\n475\n00:25:16.997 --> 00:25:20.465\nThis is where you could set a code for\nyour printer.\n\n476\n00:25:20.465 --> 00:25:23.990\nAnd then if you are using maybe like\na printer that everyone uses you have\n\n477\n00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.750\nto type in the code on the printer\nbefore it goes ahead and\n\n478\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.367\naccesses it in the print queue.\n\n479\n00:25:28.367 --> 00:25:32.642\nI have never had to use something like\nthat, but that's what it could do.\n\n480\n00:25:32.642 --> 00:25:36.126\nFinally, just make sure that you\nunderstand that there are different\n\n481\n00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:37.788\noptions are in this drop-down.\n\n482\n00:25:37.788 --> 00:25:41.194\nNow, choosing which printer you're\ngoing to print to if you have,\n\n483\n00:25:41.194 --> 00:25:44.361\nsee I have Tim's office and\nI have our regular office printer,\n\n484\n00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:46.660\nbecause those are the ones I've connected.\n\n485\n00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.719\nNow, getting a printer like if\nyou're gonna need to add a printer,\n\n486\n00:25:49.719 --> 00:25:52.686\nthat goes a little bit out of\nthe scope of this particular course.\n\n487\n00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:53.643\nAnd really,\n\n488\n00:25:53.643 --> 00:25:59.481\nthe scope in anything is connecting to a\nprinter can be a whole other ball of wax.\n\n489\n00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:03.891\nUsually Macs are pretty decent\nabout finding them on their own.\n\n490\n00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:06.617\nYou just kind of say yeah,\ngo out and find it and it does.\n\n491\n00:26:06.617 --> 00:26:09.964\nI would say a little bit better than PC,\nbut I'm sure there's a bunch of people\n\n492\n00:26:09.964 --> 00:26:12.720\nout there that are gonna tell me\nI'm wrong and like no, no, no.\n\n493\n00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.355\nAnyways, get your somebody to help\nyou connect to a printer then you can\n\n494\n00:26:17.355 --> 00:26:18.755\nchoose the printer.\n\n495\n00:26:18.755 --> 00:26:23.217\nAnd depending on which one you have some\nof the options that might be available to\n\n496\n00:26:23.217 --> 00:26:24.624\nyou are going to change.\n\n497\n00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:27.005\nLike for example the paper handling.\n\n498\n00:26:27.005 --> 00:26:31.173\nIf you have a printer that has six\ntrays versus two trays, that might be\n\n499\n00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:36.206\na difference based on the printer, and the\ndrivers and all that are connected to it.\n\n500\n00:26:36.206 --> 00:26:38.693\nAnd then you also have some presets.\n\n501\n00:26:38.693 --> 00:26:42.414\nNotice that you have just a black and\nwhite, I don't want anything else.\n\n502\n00:26:42.414 --> 00:26:46.122\nAnd you can also save whatever\nthings you start doing to\n\n503\n00:26:46.122 --> 00:26:48.307\ncustomize how you wanna print.\n\n504\n00:26:48.307 --> 00:26:51.893\n,You could save it and\nthen make that your own preset which\n\n505\n00:26:51.893 --> 00:26:56.794\ncan be really really handy if you're gonna\nbe doing the same type of printing for\n\n506\n00:26:56.794 --> 00:26:58.347\na lot of your documents.\n\n507\n00:26:58.347 --> 00:27:02.957\nSo keeping that in mind, you can say,\ndo I want all pages, current pages and\n\n508\n00:27:02.957 --> 00:27:05.998\nit's giving me a preview\nof what I'm looking at.\n\n509\n00:27:05.998 --> 00:27:09.135\nAnd notice,\nif I just clicked right now and print it,\n\n510\n00:27:09.135 --> 00:27:11.716\nit's gonna print out\nall of the comments and\n\n511\n00:27:11.716 --> 00:27:15.934\nall of those changes that I have which\nyou probably you don't wanna do.\n\n512\n00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:19.894\nAnd since I use this feature a lot,\nI always have to show people and\n\n513\n00:27:19.894 --> 00:27:22.422\nmyself to say no, don't print that out.\n\n514\n00:27:22.422 --> 00:27:25.532\nAnd you can change that\nwithin the print settings.\n\n515\n00:27:25.532 --> 00:27:27.815\nYes, you can come into your Review tab and\nhide,\n\n516\n00:27:27.815 --> 00:27:31.269\nlike right over here where it says all\nmarkup, you can drop that down, and\n\n517\n00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:35.075\njust not even show it before you print it,\nand then you won't have any problems.\n\n518\n00:27:35.075 --> 00:27:37.211\nJust throwing it out there.\n\n519\n00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:38.361\nLet's go through some of these.\n\n520\n00:27:38.361 --> 00:27:42.846\nMicrosoft Word, notice here this is where\nyou can get in the whole Odd pages only,\n\n521\n00:27:42.846 --> 00:27:43.823\nEven pages only.\n\n522\n00:27:43.823 --> 00:27:47.198\nIf you were doing some type of bounding or\n\n523\n00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:51.579\nsome reason why you need to\nhave that in your ranges.\n\n524\n00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:52.587\nThere is also,\n\n525\n00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:57.643\nthere's Word options that this is\nactually getting into your preferences.\n\n526\n00:27:57.643 --> 00:28:02.322\nNotice it's a little different in\nthe dialog box maybe will show all it\n\n527\n00:28:02.322 --> 00:28:03.203\ngoing this.\n\n528\n00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:05.143\nThis is something I'm going\nto point out right now,\n\n529\n00:28:05.143 --> 00:28:06.916\ndo you see Print Background Colors and\nImages?\n\n530\n00:28:06.916 --> 00:28:10.858\nI've had this happen to people\nwhere they'll put watermarks or\n\n531\n00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:14.218\nsome type of graphic in there\nlike it's not printing.\n\n532\n00:28:14.218 --> 00:28:20.317\nYou got to make sure you turn this on\nwhen you want to have that stuff printed.\n\n533\n00:28:20.317 --> 00:28:23.868\nAnd also maybe like do a reverse print\norder, the way that your printer spits out\n\n534\n00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:27.597\nthe paper and it's always like, this\nis all backwards I have re-collate it.\n\n535\n00:28:27.597 --> 00:28:31.455\nJust change it right here in your\nsettings or your preferences, and\n\n536\n00:28:31.455 --> 00:28:33.424\nit might help you out a little bit.\n\n537\n00:28:33.424 --> 00:28:36.768\nSo those are some things that you can do,\nand then also right here,\n\n538\n00:28:36.768 --> 00:28:38.342\nsee where I said, Print What.\n\n539\n00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:42.547\nI don't wanna print the markup,\nI wanna just print the document.\n\n540\n00:28:42.547 --> 00:28:46.209\nOr I'm gonna just print out the styles\nI've just put up in the markup, so\n\n541\n00:28:46.209 --> 00:28:50.232\nthere is different options that you have\nwhen you go into the Microsoft Word from\n\n542\n00:28:50.232 --> 00:28:52.898\nthat drop-down, and\nI'll just choose Document.\n\n543\n00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:55.712\nLet's go through a couple\nof other ones Media and\n\n544\n00:28:55.712 --> 00:29:00.037\nlayout, this is where you can see if\nyou have paper feeds of different trays\n\n545\n00:29:00.037 --> 00:29:03.834\nthat you want to do like what type\nof cardstock or weight of paper.\n\n546\n00:29:03.834 --> 00:29:04.890\nThat might be a difference.\n\n547\n00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:09.636\nLayout, this is one where you can\nsay how do I want the number of\n\n548\n00:29:09.636 --> 00:29:13.118\npages that I want to be\nprinted out per sheet?\n\n549\n00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:15.080\nSo I actually printed one out.\n\n550\n00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.706\nIt's okay that you can't see it.\n\n551\n00:29:16.706 --> 00:29:18.463\nBut there's one, two,\n\n552\n00:29:18.463 --> 00:29:23.483\nI wanted the two pages per one page\nprinted of my two Word document page,\n\n553\n00:29:23.483 --> 00:29:29.356\ntwo pages of my Word document per printed\npage, that's what I'm trying to get at.\n\n554\n00:29:29.356 --> 00:29:30.508\nSo you can do that.\n\n555\n00:29:30.508 --> 00:29:34.321\nLet's see what else,\nwe have paper handling, right?\n\n556\n00:29:34.321 --> 00:29:36.745\nPages to print, that's the even-odd again.\n\n557\n00:29:36.745 --> 00:29:39.679\nThe order of your paper,\nwhether you want it to be reversed.\n\n558\n00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:44.176\nThat's something you can do just\nwithin this particular print,\n\n559\n00:29:44.176 --> 00:29:47.366\nnot necessarily your\nentire Word preferences\n\n560\n00:29:47.366 --> 00:29:51.304\nbecause that's like a much\nmore global type of setting.\n\n561\n00:29:51.304 --> 00:29:54.400\nAnd then the cover page,\nI thought this one's kinda cute.\n\n562\n00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:00.357\nSo I chose Cover Page, and I chose like\nright before, I think I chose before.\n\n563\n00:30:00.357 --> 00:30:02.957\nAnd then it has, like,\nSecret or Classified.\n\n564\n00:30:02.957 --> 00:30:05.306\nIt just says Secret, right up here.\n\n565\n00:30:05.306 --> 00:30:09.328\nAnd it has the name of the document and\nthe local host and\n\n566\n00:30:09.328 --> 00:30:14.504\nall that kind of fun stuff, so\nI just thought that was kind of a secret.\n\n567\n00:30:14.504 --> 00:30:18.132\n&gt;&gt; Well, I feel like we are about to\nget into some spy movie stuff here.\n\n568\n00:30:18.132 --> 00:30:20.825\nIt's kind of I didn't\neven know that existed.\n\n569\n00:30:20.825 --> 00:30:24.377\nI would have probably manually made\na cover page if I needed something\n\n570\n00:30:24.377 --> 00:30:24.998\nlike that.\n\n571\n00:30:24.998 --> 00:30:26.149\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nYeah, and\n\n572\n00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:29.557\nI also don't remember seeing\nthis in the Word for PC.\n\n573\n00:30:29.557 --> 00:30:32.552\nAnd if it's, I know there's a cover page.\n\n574\n00:30:32.552 --> 00:30:35.739\nWell never mind,\nit's in a completely different place and\n\n575\n00:30:35.739 --> 00:30:40.018\nthere is a cover page in there but it's\nnot within the print that I can remember.\n\n576\n00:30:40.018 --> 00:30:41.939\nSo yeah,\nI thought it was kind of fun, too.\n\n577\n00:30:41.939 --> 00:30:43.879\nAll right, what else do we have in here?\n\n578\n00:30:43.879 --> 00:30:48.177\nJust pin printing was the last thing on\nhere, and then of course Supply levels to\n\n579\n00:30:48.177 --> 00:30:51.899\nsee about your inks if it even is\nallowed to show that type of data, and\n\n580\n00:30:51.899 --> 00:30:53.141\nthen you can print it.\n\n581\n00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:57.912\nAlso notice that you can at the bottom,\nthis is more of a Mac thing that\n\n582\n00:30:57.912 --> 00:31:02.793\nyou can do printing and save to a PDF\nright from the print dialogue box.\n\n583\n00:31:02.793 --> 00:31:07.365\nCuz that's one really common way\nto go ahead and create a PDF.\n\n584\n00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:09.753\nBut you can see there's\nall sorts of other things.\n\n585\n00:31:09.753 --> 00:31:11.739\nThese are a little bit more Mac specific.\n\n586\n00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:16.581\nSave PDF to iCloud,\nthose types of things, to iBooks.\n\n587\n00:31:16.581 --> 00:31:21.463\nThose are your operating system\nfunctionalities that you could go ahead\n\n588\n00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:23.791\nand do with your Print dialog box.\n\n589\n00:31:23.791 --> 00:31:26.307\nBut, like I said, you could go ahead and\n\n590\n00:31:26.307 --> 00:31:30.382\nknow every single option in your\nPrint dialog box doesn't work.\n\n591\n00:31:30.382 --> 00:31:34.007\nAnd your printer, your physical printer\nis still gonna spit out a bunch of\n\n592\n00:31:34.007 --> 00:31:37.531\ngobbly-gook because [LAUGH] that's\njust what printers do sometimes.\n\n593\n00:31:37.531 --> 00:31:39.141\nSo just wanted to throw that out.\n\n594\n00:31:39.141 --> 00:31:43.221\nThere are a few things that you could do\nwith your page setup, but there's a whole\n\n595\n00:31:43.221 --> 00:31:47.013\nother episode where we talk about our\nmargins and our headers and footers.\n\n596\n00:31:47.013 --> 00:31:51.895\nI tend to sometimes put those together,\nbut I wanted to separate them out.\n\n597\n00:31:51.895 --> 00:31:56.080\nThis was really just going through\nthe options you have in printing a file\n\n598\n00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.524\nbecause that's kind of like\nthe last thing you usually do.\n\n599\n00:31:59.524 --> 00:32:02.097\nYou proof your document and\nthen you print it.\n\n600\n00:32:02.097 --> 00:32:07.449\nSo, and I believe that is everything\nthat I wanted to go over right now.\n\n601\n00:32:07.449 --> 00:32:10.018\nAnd, yep, I'm done.\n\n602\n00:32:10.018 --> 00:32:10.565\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\n\n603\n00:32:10.565 --> 00:32:13.440\nyou've definitely illuminated some of\nthose things I didn't know were there.\n\n604\n00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.715\nI'm sending in papers,\ngot it sent back to me.\n\n605\n00:32:15.715 --> 00:32:17.702\nHey, you're using this\nweird grammatical device.\n\n606\n00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:19.272\nI didn't know that.\n\n607\n00:32:19.272 --> 00:32:22.859\nThere are a lot of options in the Grammar\nsettings that are turned off by default,\n\n608\n00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:24.197\nthat you should go check out.\n\n609\n00:32:24.197 --> 00:32:27.854\nSo definitely, thank you for that as well\nas taking us through the Print dialog box\n\n610\n00:32:27.854 --> 00:32:31.360\nthat has so much hidden power that\nsometimes you don't even know it's there.\n\n611\n00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.705\nAnd wel, hopefully you've\nlearned something like I have.\n\n612\n00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:38.767\nBut we have more of Microsoft Word\n2016 Essentials coming at you.\n\n613\n00:32:38.767 --> 00:32:40.485\nJust stay tuned.\n\n614\n00:32:40.485 --> 00:32:42.638\nBut for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n615\n00:32:42.638 --> 00:32:45.699\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n616\n00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:46.468\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n617\n00:32:46.468 --> 00:32:47.485\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n618\n00:32:47.485 --> 00:32:53.260\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:17.319\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:21.541\nwe're back with more on our\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.911\nI'll tell you what I just say\nthat to really boost myself up.\n\n6\n00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.577\nIt makes me feel like I don't know\nlike an infomercial person or\n\n7\n00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:28.860\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n8\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.120\nBut in this episode in particular well,\nwe're gonna do character formatting and\n\n9\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.750\nluckily we have the character queen\nin studio today Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.883\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:38.697\n&gt;&gt; Character queen.\n\n12\n00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:40.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I almost want to start singing.\n\n13\n00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:42.893\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There is a song\nin there somewhere.\n\n14\n00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:46.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, there's a lot of episodes\nwhere I'd like to start singing, so\n\n15\n00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:50.621\nI'm gonna spare you all and\ntalk about [LAUGH] character formatting.\n\n16\n00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:51.741\nSo what does that mean?\n\n17\n00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:54.860\nWe're gonna format our characters,\nmeaning text.\n\n18\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.840\nSo yes,\nthis is in the topic under format text, so\n\n19\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.000\nthat's exactly what we're going to do.\n\n20\n00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.080\nWe've kind of gone over some\nintroduction stuff like\n\n21\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.920\ntyping stuff into your Word document\nabout our keyboard or input characters.\n\n22\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.890\nWe got to geek out a lot.\n\n23\n00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.250\nSo getting your text onto\nthe paper is one thing.\n\n24\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.690\nIt is another thing to\nmake it look different.\n\n25\n00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.120\nAnd I guess you'd say our digital\npaper cuz we're not really\n\n26\n00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.070\non physical paper right now.\n\n27\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.690\nSo I have a file called\ncharacterformatting.docx that I've\n\n28\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.220\nalready went ahead and opened.\n\n29\n00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.380\nI do have my show hide character\nmarks on just because.\n\n30\n00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.510\nIt does not mean that you have to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.530\nSo I also need to kinda keep myself\nat bay a little bit because when we\n\n32\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.450\nstart getting into typography and\nhow to format text,\n\n33\n00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.590\nI can talk about this stuff for\nhours, days.\n\n34\n00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.140\nI can tell you all about the anatomy\nof a font and what ligatures are,\n\n35\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.060\nand ordinals, and swashes, and glyphs.\n\n36\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.540\nThen, I'm gonna spare you all of that,\nkeep it surface level and say, all right,\n\n37\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.370\nso when you format you're making a change,\nright?\n\n38\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.110\nYou have different levels of\nformatting meaning you have\n\n39\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.530\ncharacter level formatting and\nyou have paragraph level formatting.\n\n40\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.160\nCharacters as in the text,\nthe words that you have on it.\n\n41\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.882\nParagraphs meaning, well,\nanytime that you hit Enter.\n\n42\n00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:23.735\nNow, whether that paragraph is,\nfor example, a single line, or\n\n43\n00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:29.200\nit is multiple lines it means that\nany time you hit the enter mark.\n\n44\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.950\nAnd up here on our home tab of our ribbon,\n\n45\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.230\nI do have our group names turned on we\ntalked about that in our interface.\n\n46\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.500\nThese under here named Font, this is\ngonna be your character level formatting.\n\n47\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.607\nUnder Paragraph, what do you think?\n\n48\n00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:46.540\nIt's gonna be your\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n49\n00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.920\nSo we're gonna take these\ninto two separate spots, or\n\n50\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.460\ntwo separate episodes, talk about\nthe character formatting first and\n\n51\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.290\nthen we'll move over into paragraph\nformatting in some other episodes.\n\n52\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.110\nSo let's talk about, first of all,\nyou need to select to effect.\n\n53\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.177\nYou cannot change anything\nunless you select it.\n\n54\n00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:10.849\nCuz right now with my cursor right here,\nin front of the word change, and\n\n55\n00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.676\nI drop this guy down right here\nwhich is your font chooser and\n\n56\n00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:18.690\nI choose Apple Chancery,\nnothing's gonna happen.\n\n57\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.110\nBecause nothing is selected.\n\n58\n00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.400\nSo do remember the select to effect.\n\n59\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.140\nNow, there's all of these buttons\nthat we're going to go over.\n\n60\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.140\nLet's just take it one by one and\ngo through them.\n\n61\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.810\nLet's select the word\nCharacter Formatting.\n\n62\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.540\nThis is your font.\n\n63\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.040\nAlso gotta remember, just tell them that\nthat's what it is and just be done, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.790\n[LAUGH] I'll have to tell you\njust a little bit about it.\n\n65\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.110\nWhen you have fonts, you have what\nare known as families, font families.\n\n66\n00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.400\nSo, for example, Arial, right?\n\n67\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.730\nWe have Arial, but\ndo you see there's an arrow off the side.\n\n68\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.730\nThere really is Arial Regular,\nItalic Bold, Bold Italic,\n\n69\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.950\nand Black,\nwhich is also different from Arial Narrow.\n\n70\n00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.450\nNow some programs we'll\nactually put those together but\n\n71\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.560\nthey really are two different typefaces.\n\n72\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.810\nSo they normally are separate but\njust in case they are.\n\n73\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.210\nBut notice how like Apple Chancery or\n\n74\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.690\nChauncery whatever how we're pronouncing\nthat, that doesn't have a triangle.\n\n75\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.130\nSo it doesn't have any like\nsub fonts I tend to name them.\n\n76\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.041\nSo just gonna,\n\n77\n00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:28.710\nthat's why you have these little triangles\noff the side of some of your fonts.\n\n78\n00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.450\nThey have certain families\nthat you can use.\n\n79\n00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.346\nNow, somebody will always ask me, well,\nwe have Arial of those Arial Bold and\n\n80\n00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:37.790\nthen there is Arial Italic.\n\n81\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.260\nBut wait a second you've got\nthese buttons right here.\n\n82\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.699\nThe Bold and the Italic and Underline.\n\n83\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.160\nThese are technically known as typographal\nemphasis of how it's visually changing.\n\n84\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.870\nIf I was gonna get super technical on you,\nall right, which I'm not, and\n\n85\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.020\nit's gonna be okay.\n\n86\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.470\nBut if I chose Apple Chancery and\nI made that bold and italic.\n\n87\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.650\nAnd it's not actually really\nitalic cuz it's already italic.\n\n88\n00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.400\nThat doesn't really exist\nin the real world of fonts.\n\n89\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.720\nIt's a, what's known as a local override,\nand it's more of a visual\n\n90\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.110\nrendering of making a font bold\nwhen it's not really bold.\n\n91\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.580\nIf you feel like I'm talking in circles\nright now, just nod your head and say,\n\n92\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.390\nokay, [LAUGH] because that's\njust the way Word does it, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.000\nIt will kind of break some of\nthe rules of typography and fonts and\n\n94\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.610\nfont families,\njust because that's what it does, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.950\nSo I don't want you to\nworry too much about it,\n\n96\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.231\nlike I can't make Apple Chancery bold.\n\n97\n00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:47.370\nYou can,\nthere's nothing wrong with that, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.940\nI'm just saying if you're\ntalking to a typesetter,\n\n99\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.590\na graphic designer, somebody that\nworks in other products like InDesign.\n\n100\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.540\nInDesign would bark at me if this\ndocument came in to InDesign, like nope,\n\n101\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.318\nthis font doesn't exist,\ncuz it really doesn't.\n\n102\n00:06:01.318 --> 00:06:04.870\nAll right, I'll stop right there, because\nI'm digressing a little bit too much.\n\n103\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.335\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you gave me\nthe permission to just go,\n\n104\n00:06:06.335 --> 00:06:09.210\ncuz that's what I was\ndoing the whole time.\n\n105\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.020\nThe interesting thing is to,\nnot being a typesetter or\n\n106\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.540\ngraphic designer or any of those.\n\n107\n00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.680\nA lot of times I use those overrides\nto provide either some kind of semantic\n\n108\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.005\nemphasis or semantic meaning to\nthe document that I'm writing.\n\n109\n00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:26.195\nWith total disregard to some of\nthose more technical details.\n\n110\n00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:29.205\nAnd I think for the most part\na lot of people will do just that.\n\n111\n00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:31.343\n&gt;&gt; And I want you all to do that.\n\n112\n00:06:31.343 --> 00:06:36.793\nDon't go too far down the rabbit\nhole with me but this is what I do.\n\n113\n00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:39.475\nThis is kinda my life in a sense so\n\n114\n00:06:39.475 --> 00:06:42.940\nthis is an area I do know\na decent amount about.\n\n115\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.490\nSo I'm just giving the surface level\n\n116\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.990\nlesson in typography that Word does\nbreak the real rules sometimes.\n\n117\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.520\nBut you know what?\n\n118\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.300\nThat's okay.\n\n119\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.560\nCuz that's why it's so\ncool sometimes [LAUGH].\n\n120\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.380\nBack to our font picker.\n\n121\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.440\nWhen I have my text selected,\npick one that you like, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.110\nAnd I might have font on this computer\nthat you're not going to see.\n\n123\n00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.000\nBecause I have other fonts\nfrom using different projects.\n\n124\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.700\nI've downloaded fonts.\n\n125\n00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.360\nYou also have to be careful about making\nsure that you have permissions to\n\n126\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.970\nuse fonts.\n\n127\n00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.990\nSome are paid fonts.\n\n128\n00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.810\nSo you might not have like a Futura.\n\n129\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.580\nFutura and Frutiger,\n\n130\n00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.600\nthose are two fonts that I have installed\non my computer cuz I like these fonts.\n\n131\n00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.400\nAnd notice this one like Frutiger,\nlook at how many subfonts they have.\n\n132\n00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.499\nThat's why I like this font.\n\n133\n00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:30.934\nI can save it into the same font but\ndo a lot of different formatting,\n\n134\n00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:33.990\nif you wanna say,\nby using the different parts of it.\n\n135\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.520\nOkay, so throwing that in there, so\nlet's just go ahead and use Frutiger.\n\n136\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.540\nLet's go over to the next\nbutton over to the right.\n\n137\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.100\nThat doesn't really look that fancy,\ndoes it?\n\n138\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.720\nBut you you know what, let's just go\nback to that fancy one, all right?\n\n139\n00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.220\nWe'll go to the number right here,\nthat's your font size.\n\n140\n00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.238\nBigger is bigger.\n\n141\n00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:52.741\nSmaller is smaller.\n\n142\n00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:56.006\nWhoo, that's a profound statement\nright there, isn't there, Justin?\n\n143\n00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:57.587\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll tell you what Vonne I\n\n144\n00:07:57.587 --> 00:07:58.566\ncouldn't have put it better.\n\n145\n00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:00.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n146\n00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.900\nAnd these are all in points.\n\n147\n00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.870\nIf you are worried about the measurements.\n\n148\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:10.500\nAnd notice 36 Apple Chancery is not\nthe came as like liberia, sid you see?\n\n149\n00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.020\nIt looked a little smaller.\n\n150\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.840\nSo your different fonts have this whole\nthing about like the x height and\n\n151\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.770\nthe whole how big the font\nis to begin with, and\n\n152\n00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:26.020\nthat's why a 36 point font is not\nalways the same in every font.\n\n153\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.950\nIt's just is what it is, it's fine.\n\n154\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.443\nThere's nothing wrong with it,\nit's just, but do be familiar with that,\n\n155\n00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:35.750\nthat it will flip out depending on what\nyou got These buttons over to the side.\n\n156\n00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.730\nThese are our bumper buttons where you\ncan bump up the font or bump it down.\n\n157\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.440\nRather then choosing the drop\ndown if you wanted to do that.\n\n158\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.250\n&gt;&gt; All right so Vonne, I think I have got\nthe points are relative based on some kind\n\n159\n00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.180\nof baseline set for\na particular font family.\n\n160\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.440\nReal quick question and\nmaybe I'm jumping the gun.\n\n161\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.910\nMaybe you're getting ready how to do this,\n\n162\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.544\ndo I have to pick the only\nselectable font, can I do like 8.7?\n\n163\n00:08:59.544 --> 00:09:04.954\n&gt;&gt; You can, yes nice, you can come\ninto this drop down, click in there,\n\n164\n00:09:04.954 --> 00:09:09.383\nand type in 5.5 if you really,\nthat's really small.\n\n165\n00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:13.452\nOkay, so why don't we go ahead and\ndo a 25.5.\n\n166\n00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:18.230\nAnd yes, it will do increments if you\nwanted to do that so, good question.\n\n167\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.500\nSo, all right so\nwe keep on going down through here.\n\n168\n00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.440\nWe kind of already talked about this,\nbold.\n\n169\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.530\nBold is bold.\n\n170\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.480\nAll right, it just makes the font,\nthe letters a little thicker.\n\n171\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.110\nBut these are like on and off buttons.\n\n172\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.710\nCuz I have people say like,\nwell I made something bold,\n\n173\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.000\nnow how do I make it not bold?\n\n174\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.700\nThere's no like un-bold button,\nit's just, see kinda pressed in,\n\n175\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.440\nyou just press it off again.\n\n176\n00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.430\nSo turn it on, turn it off.\n\n177\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.223\nThat's what we have bold,\nitalic, makes it leaning, right.\n\n178\n00:09:44.223 --> 00:09:48.890\nAnd there are the whole, like italic is\nemphasis but then bold is like emphasis.\n\n179\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.670\nIt's all a matter of how you use\nthe words like you were saying for\n\n180\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.060\nstylistic purposes.\n\n181\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's some weird that like\nstrong is like, this is required.\n\n182\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.820\nEmphasis for italics is like,\nhey you should pay attention to this,\n\n183\n00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.845\nbut maybe it's not quite to\nthe extent that bolded it.\n\n184\n00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:08.880\n&gt;&gt; There's a whole bunch of\nrules there and well ultimately,\n\n185\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.600\nI guess it depends on who you're\nworking with and such how you do those.\n\n186\n00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.051\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going back to grammar, like\nwe just talked about with the proofing and\n\n187\n00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:16.793\nprinting and everything so we have that.\n\n188\n00:10:16.793 --> 00:10:19.742\nThen you also have your underlines,\nwhether or not you want it underlined,\n\n189\n00:10:19.742 --> 00:10:22.923\nthere's a drop down next, I think you can\nchoose different types of underlines,\n\n190\n00:10:22.923 --> 00:10:24.047\nyou want some squiggly's.\n\n191\n00:10:24.047 --> 00:10:28.380\nBut that might look a little like\nmisspelled words But you can do that if\n\n192\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.340\nyou wanted to have some dotted lines\nin there, and those are all buttons.\n\n193\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.830\nYou do have some other\noptions in your underlines.\n\n194\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.000\nSo I'll save that for just a little layer.\n\n195\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.540\nThe other buttons as\nacross as we keep going,\n\n196\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.630\nthat's our Strikethrough,\nright if you are doing some things.\n\n197\n00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.467\nThe like, maybe you're doing proofing for\na script and you wanna strike it out,\n\n198\n00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:50.475\nyou can do that.\n\n199\n00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:51.940\nThat's what that does.\n\n200\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.180\nAnd then you have your subscripts and\nsuperscripts.\n\n201\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.540\nThat's why I have, water is H2O.\n\n202\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.370\nWhy do I write that?\n\n203\n00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.169\nBecause the 2 needs to go down.\n\n204\n00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:04.951\nDown below what is known as the baseline,\nso it makes it smaller and\n\n205\n00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:08.780\nthere's a baseline shift It just\ngoes down and makes it tinier.\n\n206\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.980\nWhat about,\nI asked you this before we started.\n\n207\n00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.450\n128 is not two to the 8th,\nit's 256, sorry about that.\n\n208\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.690\n2 to the 8th, so\nwe need the 8 to be superscript.\n\n209\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.110\nSo that's what we can do.\n\n210\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.850\nWe did talk about like the ordinals how,\n\n211\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.920\nlike the first, one way,\nI typed in, this is another one.\n\n212\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.942\nWhen you turn on the superscript,\nyou start typing.\n\n213\n00:11:29.942 --> 00:11:33.040\nIt's like it's still superscript.\n\n214\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.990\nYou got to turn that off too.\n\n215\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:40.468\nSo be a little careful about formatting\nand have it remembering the format when\n\n216\n00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:46.030\nyou like hit Enter or space off of it,\nI just need to stop making it superscript.\n\n217\n00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.090\nThis happens to me all the time, okay.\n\n218\n00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:56.650\nWe had talked about the default first and\nsecond of where it will do that.\n\n219\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.880\nAnd it does the superscripting.\n\n220\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.500\nIf you get your cursor in the wrong spot\nand it keeps typing, it will continue on,\n\n221\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.670\nso be a little careful about that.\n\n222\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.430\nThe Change case button, I love this\nbutton, I think it's the greatest.\n\n223\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.155\nIt does exactly that,\nthis is in all uppercase, correct?\n\n224\n00:12:12.155 --> 00:12:12.933\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n225\n00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:17.053\n&gt;&gt; Well, what if I wanted this right here,\nlet's take that underline\n\n226\n00:12:17.053 --> 00:12:20.630\noff on the strikethrough I\nwant that to be all uppercase.\n\n227\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.260\nDon't type it over.\n\n228\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.550\nJust change the case.\n\n229\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.430\nSelect it.\n\n230\n00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.950\nThat button right there.\n\n231\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.540\nThis button will take it to uppercase.\n\n232\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.090\nSo much easier, right?\n\n233\n00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.480\nWhat about Sentence case,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n234\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.890\nCapitalize the first letter of a sentence.\n\n235\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.330\nLet me select this one.\n\n236\n00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.490\nYou could change that\ndown to Sentence case.\n\n237\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.360\nI could have it capitalize each word.\n\n238\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.183\nI could have it do a toggle\ncase if I wanted to.\n\n239\n00:12:45.183 --> 00:12:48.254\n[LAUGH] Yeah, no,\nI don't think I would do that either.\n\n240\n00:12:48.254 --> 00:12:52.962\nBut I really, really enjoy this\nparticular button because I\n\n241\n00:12:52.962 --> 00:12:56.480\nthink it's much easier\nthan typing it over.\n\n242\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.220\nAnd I've done that many times in my life.\n\n243\n00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.730\nSo, Change case, good one to do.\n\n244\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.950\nLet's move on to the rest\nof these buttons.\n\n245\n00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.030\nThese last three over\nhere in the font group\n\n246\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.560\nis where we're getting into\na little bit more pizzaz.\n\n247\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.110\nWe're getting into some colors.\n\n248\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.690\nLet's actually start with the font color.\n\n249\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.770\nWe'll go from the end over.\n\n250\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.410\nSo we have the color of\nthe text is black right now.\n\n251\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.900\nI want it to be different.\n\n252\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.920\nDrop that down.\n\n253\n00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.750\nWe've got lots of different colors.\n\n254\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.199\nThese are your theme colors.\n\n255\n00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:29.075\nWe'll talk about design themes and how you\ncan modify your themes in another episode.\n\n256\n00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:32.472\nI actually believe that's in\nthe advanced series of Word, but\n\n257\n00:13:32.472 --> 00:13:36.139\nyou can choose a different theme,\njust like a party theme, right?\n\n258\n00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:40.099\nIf we're gonna have a My Little Pony\nparty, it's pretty much gonna be pink and\n\n259\n00:13:40.099 --> 00:13:41.899\npurple and light blue, cuz right,\n\n260\n00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:44.978\nthat's what those exact colors\nof the pink ponies, right?\n\n261\n00:13:44.978 --> 00:13:46.152\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or the My Little Ponies?\n\n262\n00:13:46.152 --> 00:13:48.365\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you have mistaken me for\na brony.\n\n263\n00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:50.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I am not one of those,\n\n264\n00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.431\nI have no idea what you're talking about,\n\n265\n00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:55.202\nI'm gonna act like this\ninteraction never happened.\n\n266\n00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:59.510\n&gt;&gt; It's funny cuz I'm talking about this,\nso I see his eyes go, what?\n\n267\n00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.500\n[LAUGH] Yes, so our theme colors,\nthere's also your standard colors,\n\n268\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.090\nand hey I don't like any of these,\nyou go to more colors, and\n\n269\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:14.690\nwith a Mac you are going to\ngo to the Mac color picker.\n\n270\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.960\nSo you have some different\noptions up here.\n\n271\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.710\nNotice right now that\nit's all black because\n\n272\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.550\nthe slider down the bottom is black.\n\n273\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.764\nIf you pull that down,\n\n274\n00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:27.780\nyou'll start getting into where\nyou see range wheel spectrum.\n\n275\n00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.250\nBut you got to pull the brightness up on\nthis and then you can move this guy around\n\n276\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:37.710\nand pick this kind of magenta or purplish,\nthat's a little bit more purple then pink.\n\n277\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.310\nAnd if that's the one you\nwant you can do that.\n\n278\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.850\nJust going across really quickly,\n\n279\n00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.790\nwe have these Other Options here in\nyour color picker for your sliders,\n\n280\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.980\nif you know your specific RGB or\nCMYK or HSB values of your logos.\n\n281\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.660\nIf you're like, I have no clue what you're\ntalking about, it's all right, all colors\n\n282\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:01.300\nhave values in different languages\nif you wanna call different sets.\n\n283\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.360\nAnd if you do know them\nyou could type them in.\n\n284\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.697\nIf that gets a little too crazy for you,\njust come on over here where you can have\n\n285\n00:15:08.697 --> 00:15:11.474\nsome named colors and\ndried basic colors in here.\n\n286\n00:15:11.474 --> 00:15:14.830\nYou can go into your crayons, remember\nwe're talking about crayons yesterday?\n\n287\n00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:15.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n288\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.000\nso that's where the crayons come from or\n\n289\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.430\nyou can go into your spectrum picker and\nuse it this way.\n\n290\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.300\nI tend to like the colored\npencils cuz I think they're cute.\n\n291\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.937\nAnd I like to be able to see them kinda\npoke out a little bit when you [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:15:28.937 --> 00:15:29.873\nhover over them.\n\n293\n00:15:29.873 --> 00:15:31.991\nIt's the small things in life that get me.\n\n294\n00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:35.492\nIf I wanted that particular\nlavender color, I could do that.\n\n295\n00:15:35.492 --> 00:15:37.557\n&gt;&gt; Vonne,\nI do enjoy the little animations.\n\n296\n00:15:37.557 --> 00:15:39.079\nIt's a little bit of nostalgia.\n\n297\n00:15:39.079 --> 00:15:43.525\nBut if we come back to the spectrum one,\nI never noticed this, there's a,\n\n298\n00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:45.374\nactually the fourth one over.\n\n299\n00:15:45.374 --> 00:15:46.398\nSorry for-\n&gt;&gt; This one?\n\n300\n00:15:46.398 --> 00:15:48.198\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a drop down.\n\n301\n00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:49.358\nWhat does that drop down provide?\n\n302\n00:15:49.358 --> 00:15:50.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why is there a drop down there?\n\n303\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.598\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, no, it's just.\n\n304\n00:15:54.598 --> 00:15:57.055\n&gt;&gt; So does that say new from file?\n\n305\n00:15:57.055 --> 00:15:57.563\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n306\n00:15:57.563 --> 00:16:01.830\nI'm wondering if maybe there is like some\nkind of file format where you can define\n\n307\n00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.519\na color set or\n\n308\n00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:06.770\nsomething like that where you have\na limited spectrum you can pick through.\n\n309\n00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:07.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n310\n00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.220\n&gt;&gt; We don't know, we're just,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.250\n&gt;&gt; It just struck me and\n\n312\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.130\nI was like, I've never seen that before\nbecause when I think spectrum I think of\n\n313\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.700\nthe ROYGBIV and\nthen brightness, effectively.\n\n314\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.738\n&gt;&gt; And\nI was trying to see if it was giving me,\n\n315\n00:16:21.738 --> 00:16:23.670\nit's not always pick a Word document.\n\n316\n00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.410\nSo it would have to be some specific\nfile format of the spectrum.\n\n317\n00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:31.220\nSo I think we have something\nto look up now, don't we?\n\n318\n00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:31.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we do.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're\n\n319\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.220\nboth learning something right now.\n\n320\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.270\nAnd well actually,\nwe're not learning anything so\n\n321\n00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.570\nwe're just gonna leave it hanging\nright there for just a second.\n\n322\n00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.440\nBut yeah, that is very interesting.\n\n323\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.470\nGoing along the same interesting part,\nI do like this little guy down here.\n\n324\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.300\nNow, it doesn't matter which one\nyou're on, but the little picker guy.\n\n325\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:53.070\nThis is where you can go out and sample\npixels that are anywhere on your screen.\n\n326\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.520\nLike I really like that color\nblue that's on my desktop.\n\n327\n00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.990\nI think that's really pretty.\n\n328\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.370\nYou click on this little\npicker color thinger, wow.\n\n329\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.630\nAnd you come out to there and\nbe like, I really like.\n\n330\n00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.840\nAnd notice that like it's got\na little square in the middle.\n\n331\n00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.060\nThat's the specific pixel that\nit is picking of the color, and\n\n332\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.350\nif I click that,\nthat will be the color that it finds.\n\n333\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.440\nSo I really like that.\n\n334\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.740\nIt does not have to be on Word,\n\n335\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.524\nit could be outside anywhere on\nyour screen within your Mac and\n\n336\n00:17:22.524 --> 00:17:27.966\nthat's how you can pick your color and\nnow I have got my text to be blue.\n\n337\n00:17:27.966 --> 00:17:29.550\nThat's how you could\nchange your font color.\n\n338\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.007\nSo your Apple color picker\ncan be really fun and\n\n339\n00:17:32.007 --> 00:17:35.919\nwe are going to figure out how we can\nget other spectrum files in there too.\n\n340\n00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:40.672\nSo you can, I just want to point this out,\nyou can choose to have\n\n341\n00:17:40.672 --> 00:17:45.608\na gradient on your text and\nthen you can get into more gradients and\n\n342\n00:17:45.608 --> 00:17:51.667\nthen you can start designating colors on\nthe color ramp t go ahead and pick them.\n\n343\n00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:55.762\nI don't wanna get too far into that in\nthis particular episode because I can get\n\n344\n00:17:55.762 --> 00:17:57.810\nreally down in there.\n\n345\n00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.120\nWe do have that in the advanced series,\nso we'll talk a little bit more about\n\n346\n00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.720\ngradients but it does work here\nif you want to have it done.\n\n347\n00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.550\nI'm just gonna stick with a solid and\n\n348\n00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.380\nalso notice that I can pick colors\nfrom over here on this task pane.\n\n349\n00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.840\nI tend to just usually just go\nthrough the dialog box, that's fine.\n\n350\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.650\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, while you are finishing\nthat up, giving us a great overview of\n\n351\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:25.690\nthose colors, that from file,\nyou can input an image, any image and\n\n352\n00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:29.740\nthen you can use that image to\nsample colors from that image.\n\n353\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.500\nYeah, yeah, that's what that is.\n\n354\n00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n355\n00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:32.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n356\n00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:37.400\nSo I did not know that,\nI've never used that before.\n\n357\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.250\n&gt;&gt; Because it's on the picture right here.\n\n358\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so from file,\n&gt;&gt; That's the picture.\n\n359\n00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:43.424\n&gt;&gt; You can find an image.\n\n360\n00:18:43.424 --> 00:18:46.810\n&gt;&gt; From File, if I-\n&gt;&gt; The image effectively becomes a color\n\n361\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:47.612\nselection.\n\n362\n00:18:47.612 --> 00:18:50.521\n&gt;&gt; And we have bishop right here.\n\n363\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.870\n&gt;&gt; And then apparently you\njust sample from that image.\n\n364\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.210\n&gt;&gt; And it's picking right here so\n\n365\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.060\nit correlates right into the color\npicker that we were talking about, but\n\n366\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.419\nI'm choosing a specific image of I really\nwant that kind of purple right there.\n\n367\n00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:10.396\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that was crazy, and I think\nyou may be able to persist those, or\n\n368\n00:19:10.396 --> 00:19:14.423\nmaybe say, hey, here are my Pantone\ncolors or whatever those would be.\n\n369\n00:19:14.423 --> 00:19:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n370\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:18.500\n&gt;&gt; Distribute those and say,\nyou have to select from this image.\n\n371\n00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.140\n&gt;&gt; And look at that.\n\n372\n00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.990\n&gt;&gt; So crazy stuff.\n\n373\n00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.732\nThe more you know.\n\n374\n00:19:20.732 --> 00:19:23.338\n&gt;&gt; I know, and\nwe both just learned that right now.\n\n375\n00:19:23.338 --> 00:19:26.205\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On this episode, so\n\n376\n00:19:26.205 --> 00:19:29.078\nthank you all for, yes just thank you.\n\n377\n00:19:29.078 --> 00:19:29.588\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:19:29.588 --> 00:19:30.108\n&gt;&gt; That was\n\n379\n00:19:30.108 --> 00:19:30.788\nfun.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n380\n00:19:30.788 --> 00:19:31.998\n&gt;&gt; I love learning new things.\n\n381\n00:19:31.998 --> 00:19:33.848\nSo [LAUGH] very, very cool.\n\n382\n00:19:33.848 --> 00:19:34.400\nAll right,\n\n383\n00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.540\nso back to our character formatting.\n\n384\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.990\nWe went over our gradients.\n\n385\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:43.100\nNow there are some other things that\nyou can do with formatting texts\n\n386\n00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.250\nthat is not available\nin just these buttons.\n\n387\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.420\nAnd I realize that we didn't go over\nthe highlighter and the other one.\n\n388\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.220\nBut we'll come back around\nin just a second, I promise.\n\n389\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.090\nSo let's just select this text right here.\n\n390\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.140\nIt is for fun.\n\n391\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.630\nYou do have your format menu and\nyou have a font dialog box.\n\n392\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.580\nNow format font dot, dot, dot.\n\n393\n00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.690\nWe've got this box that comes up.\n\n394\n00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:10.740\nAnd a lot of things that we've already\ngone over, the font, the style,\n\n395\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.010\nwhether it's bold, italic,\nthe size, the font color.\n\n396\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.740\nWe also did the underline style.\n\n397\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.220\nBut look at how many other\nunderline styles we have,\n\n398\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.690\nbesides that one drop down that we have.\n\n399\n00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:28.766\nAnd the other fun thing is that\nI could choose a different color\n\n400\n00:20:28.766 --> 00:20:34.210\nunderline than my font.\n\n401\n00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.120\nBefore, it was always going to\nbe the same color as the font.\n\n402\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.050\nSo I could have black\ntext with red underline.\n\n403\n00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:42.970\nThat could be kinda cute.\n\n404\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.260\nMaybe we'll go with purple cuz I like\npurple a little better than red.\n\n405\n00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.230\nAnd the other things that you have here,\nwe did talked about some strikethroughs,\n\n406\n00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.590\nsuperscripts and subscripts.\n\n407\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.630\nA double strikethrough?\n\n408\n00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.350\nIn case you want it.\n\n409\n00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.880\nSmall caps, I do like a small caps rather\nthan all caps with the change case.\n\n410\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.200\nSo that could be something you could do\nhere only through the font dialog box.\n\n411\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.340\nAnd if you go over to the advanced tab,\nthe advanced tab gets\n\n412\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.620\nyou into some advanced font\nformatting such as kerning.\n\n413\n00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.330\nKerning is the space between\nall of your letters.\n\n414\n00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.736\nThey don't call that here,\nthey just call it spacing.\n\n415\n00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:21.030\nThey have a spacing expanded and\n\n416\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.110\nnotice down here you have a little\npreview down at the bottom.\n\n417\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.320\nAnd if I say expand it by and\nI start bumping this up,\n\n418\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.820\nyou don't have to worry about exactly what\nthe numbers are, just look at how much it\n\n419\n00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.980\nspaces all the letters across\nthemselves and that can be kind of fun.\n\n420\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.710\nThere are some more advanced\ntypography stuff about\n\n421\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.180\nif you have a font that\ncan support ligatures.\n\n422\n00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.289\nYou're like what's a ligature?\n\n423\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.880\nIt's like two letters that\nfuse in to make one character.\n\n424\n00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.760\nOne that's really big is like\nthe letter f and the letter l,\n\n425\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.270\na lot of time you put those together they\nlook like they're one fused character.\n\n426\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.164\nSmall things about fonts and\n\n427\n00:21:58.164 --> 00:22:02.487\nhow your numbers line up in your\nstylistic steps don't worry about that,\n\n428\n00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:07.950\nit's too advanced for this particular,\nProgram and really this episode.\n\n429\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.945\nIf you really want to get\ninto advanced typography,\n\n430\n00:22:09.945 --> 00:22:13.160\nyou'd probably be using something\nelse than just Word to do it.\n\n431\n00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.978\nSo if you click OK,\n\n432\n00:22:13.978 --> 00:22:18.870\nnotice that that's the different\nformatting within the font format.\n\n433\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.740\nFormat font, dialog box.\n\n434\n00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.000\nA few last things that we're going to go\nover with character level formatting.\n\n435\n00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.200\nYour highlighter.\nRemember\n\n436\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.560\nwhen we were going over the select\ntext episode, Jess, and\n\n437\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.810\nI said I don't like to use highlight text\nbecause it has two different meanings.\n\n438\n00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.770\nThe homonyms and homonote?\n\n439\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.080\nWhatever we talked about last time.\n\n440\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.370\n&gt;&gt; There was some homo-something\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.934\n&gt;&gt; That we, those are hard to keep\n\n442\n00:22:42.934 --> 00:22:43.650\nstraight.\n\n443\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.180\n&gt;&gt; I know. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; But I definitely\nunderstand, and I misuse that.\n\n444\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.160\nI'm like, highlight the text.\n\n445\n00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.440\nWell, technically I'm selecting the text.\n\n446\n00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.990\nIt has a blue outline or\nsome kind of outline in a lot of programs.\n\n447\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.490\nIn Word for\n\n448\n00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.260\nMac, it has a blue, but then if you\nclick off it's no longer highlighted.\n\n449\n00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.820\nSo you've selected,\nyou've temporarily selected,\n\n450\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.690\nyou haven't modified anything about it.\n\n451\n00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.320\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, and that's where\nwe're splitting hairs a little bit.\n\n452\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.110\nIt is that Word that has\na different content,\n\n453\n00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.390\ndifferent meaning within\nthe context of the sentence.\n\n454\n00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.150\nHighlight the text versus\nhighlight the text\n\n455\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:19.570\nin a sense of [LAUGH] highlight the text,\nthat's just selecting,\n\n456\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:24.640\nversus select the text first and\nthen click the highlight button.\n\n457\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.150\nThat's highlight text.\n\n458\n00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.020\nSo that's just something that you can do.\n\n459\n00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.990\nNotice my technique.\n\n460\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.440\nI selected the text first,\nthen clicked the highlighter button.\n\n461\n00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.140\nAs soon as I did that, it only\nhighlighted that one selected text, and\n\n462\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.294\nthen I can move on and\nit's not gonna keep on highlighting.\n\n463\n00:23:43.294 --> 00:23:48.736\nBut sometimes I know if I'm highlighting\nin my paper, I'm gonna take the cap off my\n\n464\n00:23:48.736 --> 00:23:54.282\nhighlighter, and then it makes the little\nsound effect as it goes across the paper.\n\n465\n00:23:54.282 --> 00:23:57.697\nAnd I'm just gonna keep on going and\nkeep on going.\n\n466\n00:23:57.697 --> 00:24:02.026\nYou can do that,\nyou just have to go the other way.\n\n467\n00:24:02.026 --> 00:24:06.050\nMeaning, nothing is selected first.\n\n468\n00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.150\nClick on the highlighter, and while we're\ndoing that, I'm going to change the color.\n\n469\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.795\nI'm going to make this\na green highlighter.\n\n470\n00:24:11.795 --> 00:24:15.528\nSo I turn on the highlighter,\nI take off the cap, got the pencil.\n\n471\n00:24:15.528 --> 00:24:20.820\nThe highlighter in my hand and\nthen I drag across this word, and then I\n\n472\n00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:25.290\ndrag across this word or I single click\non that word, or double click, sorry.\n\n473\n00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:30.890\nAnd notice my cursor it looks like\na I-beam with a little highlighter on it.\n\n474\n00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:35.060\nSo it's on until I turn it to off.\n\n475\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.410\nTurn it off by clicking the button off.\n\n476\n00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.930\nAnd now I'm back to my regular selector.\n\n477\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.840\nSo there's two ways that\nyou can use a highlighter,\n\n478\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.870\nit just depends on which\nway you feel like it.\n\n479\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:51.370\nAnd the last one that we'll cover for\na moment is our text effects right here.\n\n480\n00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.180\nThe text effects is where\nyou can do things like well,\n\n481\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:59.620\nmake it have a certain fill and\nstroke or inside color, outside color.\n\n482\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.740\nMaybe like a little drop down,\nthose different things.\n\n483\n00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.550\nThis gets into more graphical elements,\nif you want to say,\n\n484\n00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:11.910\nbut they can make things look\na little fancier here, right there.\n\n485\n00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.600\nMaybe take this character and\nchoose it so you can see it a little bit.\n\n486\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.018\nThat's not a very good one.\n\n487\n00:25:17.018 --> 00:25:21.630\nAyways, you can play around with it,\nbut you notice you can't go through and\n\n488\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:26.550\nchange every specific part of it\nlike change that outline to orange.\n\n489\n00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.340\nAnd then you can change the shadow or\nreflection and the glow.\n\n490\n00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.648\nIt's the last stuff, you just get in there\nyou just kinda play around with this.\n\n491\n00:25:34.648 --> 00:25:37.770\nThis gets into, like I said,\nmore of a graphical element, but\n\n492\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.050\nit is nice to know that you can have that.\n\n493\n00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.590\nAnd depending on the character set or\nfont that you have\n\n494\n00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.310\nyou might have options like ligatures,\nnumber styles, and stylistic sets.\n\n495\n00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:53.480\nYou have to have a font that even accepts\nthat for you to even have these options.\n\n496\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.280\nIt might be, these are smaller\nthings that you probably,\n\n497\n00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.690\nI don't wanna say normal people wouldn't\nnotice, cuz that starts to be like, wait,\n\n498\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.620\nso am I normal or not normal?\n\n499\n00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:09.770\nIt's just people like me that are more\ntype geeky that I would like this.\n\n500\n00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.620\nRegular people wouldn't probably even,\nI know I'm digging myself in a hole,\n\n501\n00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.170\naren't I, Justin?\n\n502\n00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:16.810\nHe's smiling.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n503\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.714\nI'm gonna interject here real quick,\nVonne, before this gets out of hand.\n\n504\n00:26:19.714 --> 00:26:25.960\nI notice, are those styles additive?\n\n505\n00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.920\nLike if I apply two of those pre-selects,\ndo those compound or they overwrite?\n\n506\n00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.570\nCuz it seems like there were some\nweird behavior going on there, and\n\n507\n00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.950\nmaybe I'm just looking at it oddly.\n\n508\n00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.840\n&gt;&gt; No, so if I chose this one.\n\n509\n00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.400\nAnd then I choose this one,\nit is a complete override.\n\n510\n00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.540\nIt might because it's bold and italic\nstill, but no, they are replacing them.\n\n511\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.390\nThey are like presets.\n\n512\n00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.740\nAnd when you change one preset,\nit's changed into the other preset.\n\n513\n00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.840\nNow once you have one of these presets and\nthen start doing these things,\n\n514\n00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:00.600\nthen it's doing the modifications on\nthat particular option that you chose,\n\n515\n00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.290\nthat particular set that you got.\n\n516\n00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.420\nSo that's where you can\nget a little fancy.\n\n517\n00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.340\nOne last thing, I just realized,\nit's good that I have notes, right,\n\n518\n00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.030\nto keep me on track.\n\n519\n00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.440\nClear formatting.\n\n520\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.200\nWe've done a number on\nthis file haven't we?\n\n521\n00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.037\nAnd if I got a file like this,\nI'd be like [SOUND],\n\n522\n00:27:18.037 --> 00:27:20.333\nI'm just gonna just reset everybody.\n\n523\n00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:23.392\nWe're gonna go back to black,\nas I always call it,\n\n524\n00:27:23.392 --> 00:27:27.680\nin my Adobe products cuz the black\narrow is always your selection tool.\n\n525\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.290\nYou always gotta go back to do anything.\n\n526\n00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:30.760\nI'm gonna select all.\n\n527\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.730\nI just did a Ctrl+A, or\nsorry Cmd+A on my keyboard.\n\n528\n00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.180\nAnd there's this button right,\n\n529\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.140\nnope that's not that, it's this one\nright here clear all formatting.\n\n530\n00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:46.320\nI love that yes the eraser right,\nif I click on that it's like yes, no?\n\n531\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.910\nOkay, two things.\n\n532\n00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.790\nThe clear formatting does not change,\nit does not change the case.\n\n533\n00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.940\nLet's think about what\nthe actual command says.\n\n534\n00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.890\nChange case, it's not modifying and\napplying a font.\n\n535\n00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.010\nIt's like no,\nI'm changing it, all the way.\n\n536\n00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.852\nSo, those will stay, so you can see\nthat one and that one, that we did.\n\n537\n00:28:03.852 --> 00:28:06.850\nThe other thing is,\nit doesn't clear highlighting, why?\n\n538\n00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:10.660\nI don't know, it just doesn't,\nbut what you can do,\n\n539\n00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:16.040\nis I clear the formatting and\nthen I just highlight it with, None.\n\n540\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.560\nYou go back and say no highlight\ncolors on any of your text, and\n\n541\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.040\nthat gets us back to square one,\nwhere nothing is formatted.\n\n542\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.100\nEverything looks nice, and\n\n543\n00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:30.110\nthen I could start anew and do all my\nown formatting that I wanted to do.\n\n544\n00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.260\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nformatting seems to be very powerful, and\n\n545\n00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.880\ncan provide some nice accentuation\nto certain aspects of your document.\n\n546\n00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.630\nBased on those last few things,\nthose presets.\n\n547\n00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.870\nThe name alludes me already,\nmainly because you changed it.\n\n548\n00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.210\nI'm like,\nthat's really hard to read, I can't.\n\n549\n00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.360\nSo be careful about on how\nyou format things, but\n\n550\n00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.100\nthat's something that if\nyou send me a document and\n\n551\n00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.186\nI can't read a bunch of it, I'll be like,\nnow I'm gonna need you to do this again.\n\n552\n00:28:54.186 --> 00:28:54.950\nMaybe that's just me.\n\n553\n00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.460\nI dont know, what do you think about it?\n\n554\n00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.810\n&gt;&gt; No, readability is key.\n\n555\n00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:02.720\nI mean that's the whole reason why\nwe're making these documents so,\n\n556\n00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.760\nless is more sometimes.\n\n557\n00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.610\nMake sure like bigger font is always good,\n\n558\n00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.130\nnice spacing which we'll get\ninto in our paragraph episode.\n\n559\n00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.650\nSo just think,\nI don't want to put everything in orange.\n\n560\n00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.960\nLight orange text on a white paper?\n\n561\n00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.110\nThat's not going to be easy to read.\n\n562\n00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.230\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, thank you so much for\n\n563\n00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.330\nshowing us how to add a little bit of\nwrapping paper, maybe a bow on top for\n\n564\n00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.260\nthose documents that had that\nje ne sais quoi, how do you say?\n\n565\n00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.080\nWell, speaking of bows.\n\n566\n00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.040\nWe're going to go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n567\n00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.610\nBut definitely stay tuned for\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n568\n00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:37.110\nBut for now, signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n569\n00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n570\n00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.803\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:17.743\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:22.236\nwe are continuing on in our Microsoft Word\n2016 Essential for Mac series and\n\n5\n00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:26.410\nin this episode we're gonna be\ntalking about paragraph formatting.\n\n6\n00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.042\nAnd luckily, we have a paragraph phenom\nin the studio today, Miss Vonne Smith,\n\n7\n00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.735\nhow you doing today Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:36.220\nI like how you did that, paragraph\nphenom even though its a P but as an F.\n\n9\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.096\nYeah, yeah.\n\n10\n00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:39.944\nIt's false alliteration, I guess.\n\n11\n00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:41.876\n[LAUGH] I like that.\n\n12\n00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:44.010\n[LAUGH] I think that's fantastic.\n\n13\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.630\nSo yes,\nwe are continuing on with formatting.\n\n14\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.125\nWe did a bunch of stuff with\ncharacter formatting, and\n\n15\n00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.458\nwe touched upon how character formatting,\nwell,\n\n16\n00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:54.130\nwe actually did a lot of stuff\nwith character formatting.\n\n17\n00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.480\nBut we touched upon paragraph formatting,\n\n18\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.430\ndifferent levels of where the formatting\nis going to be applied to\n\n19\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.230\ncharacter formatting, to the characters,\nparagraph formatting, to the paragraphs.\n\n20\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.336\nAnd now we're done with the episode.\n\n21\n00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:14.105\n[LAUGH] It's more than just that, but when\nI say it out loud, it sounds so simple.\n\n22\n00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:18.773\nBut I'm going to show you all the nuances\nof your paragraph formatting options\n\n23\n00:01:18.773 --> 00:01:19.360\nin Word.\n\n24\n00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.043\nSo why don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n25\n00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:25.094\nI have a file called\nParagraphFormatting.docx I have it opened\n\n26\n00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:29.148\nalready, did a little character\nformatting on this first one.\n\n27\n00:01:29.148 --> 00:01:32.810\nSo now we're gonna concentrate\nover on these buttons.\n\n28\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.975\nWe have our bullets and numbering.\n\n29\n00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:39.850\nI'm just gonna tell you right now,\nI saved that out for a different episode.\n\n30\n00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.320\nSo there's a whole episode on\njust bullets and numberings, but\n\n31\n00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.900\nit is a paragraph level formatting.\n\n32\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.780\nSo it's not that I'm skipping them,\nI'm just separating it out.\n\n33\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.740\nI'm compartmentalizing for you all.\n\n34\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.008\nAll right,\nthen we have the buttons at the bottom.\n\n35\n00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:58.450\nThese are the ones that most people,\nI would say, are somewhat familiar with.\n\n36\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.550\nThese are your paragraph alignment.\n\n37\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.300\nAlign center, align right,\nor justify your text.\n\n38\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.690\nSo, this is called alignment.\n\n39\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.840\nThis is also called justification\nin some other products or\n\n40\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.070\nmaybe in some other spaces, if you wanna\nsay, that people will refer to as less,\n\n41\n00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.420\nleft justified, right justified,\ncenter justified or fully justified text.\n\n42\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.282\nSo just throwing out\nthat terminology there.\n\n43\n00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:32.282\nWell with paragraph level formatting,\nas opposed to character level formatting,\n\n44\n00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:36.928\nthe thing is you just have to be\nwith your cursor in the paragraph,\n\n45\n00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:41.170\nyou do not have to select the whole\nparagraph or words in it.\n\n46\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.711\nCursor in is all you need cuz\nif I click on this button,\n\n47\n00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:51.299\nthe only thing this button is\ngonna do is apply to the whole\n\n48\n00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.335\nparagraph not one word\nseparately then another.\n\n49\n00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:58.460\nThere's actually a little trick\nwith formatting paragraphs.\n\n50\n00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.200\nIf I put this over to the right, then\nit's gonna go to the right of the margin.\n\n51\n00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.230\nThis button is not gonna make any\ndifference right now because it's a single\n\n52\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.720\nline of text within this paragraph.\n\n53\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.650\nBut centering, centering is good.\n\n54\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.126\nI like a nice center for my title,\nso we'll go ahead and use that.\n\n55\n00:03:15.126 --> 00:03:20.583\nNow I want to point out the next\nthing about line breaks versus\n\n56\n00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:25.516\nhard breaks, or\ncharacter turns versus line breaks.\n\n57\n00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:27.510\nWe talked a little bit about\nthis in the input text.\n\n58\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.870\nI'm gonna turn on that show\nhide character button.\n\n59\n00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:35.880\nBecause if I didn't have this on,\n\n60\n00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.810\nI wouldn't know that that\nis not a hard return.\n\n61\n00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.820\nIt's not an Enter.\n\n62\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.590\nAll of these lines\nare within one paragraph.\n\n63\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.327\nSo I cannot center one\nseparate than the other.\n\n64\n00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:55.814\nIf I click here and\nselect this one paragraph, or\n\n65\n00:03:55.814 --> 00:04:00.200\nwhat I think is one paragraph,\nit's actually doing both.\n\n66\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.750\nAnd that's something that I\nthink can throw people off and\n\n67\n00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.000\nlike, I cannot get this\nto center differently.\n\n68\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.420\nI'm like well, that's because\nit's not the same paragraphs.\n\n69\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.310\nIf this needs to be different than this,\n\n70\n00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.240\nyou have to turn this little guy\nfrom a line break to a full enter.\n\n71\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.400\nBecause then,\nyou could left align this block,\n\n72\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.450\nif you wanna say, and\nthis block, separately.\n\n73\n00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.910\nThat's the whole idea, paragraph,\nformatting, bold paragraphs.\n\n74\n00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.400\nLine breaks are not a paragraph.\n\n75\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.560\nIt's just a break in\na line within a paragraph.\n\n76\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.660\nSo keep that in mind and\n\n77\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.630\nknow why you wanna keep that show\nhide button on at all times.\n\n78\n00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.990\nSome other things that we're going to talk\nabout with paragraph level formatting\n\n79\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.430\nwould be this next button.\n\n80\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.432\nNow this next button,\nI love talking about.\n\n81\n00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:55.148\nNeed some line spacing and some\nparagraph spacing because it's something\n\n82\n00:04:55.148 --> 00:05:01.420\nthat I think is a decently simple concept,\nbut it drives people crazy.\n\n83\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.150\nLike me, right over here,\nit drives me crazy and\n\n84\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.520\nI'm sure it's probably\ngonna drive you crazy.\n\n85\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.730\nLook at these paragraphs, I'm gonna scroll\nout a little bit more so you can see.\n\n86\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.890\nThese paragraphs versus these paragraphs,\nright?\n\n87\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.810\nThis is a different in line spacing,\nwhich is also referred to as letting.\n\n88\n00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.610\nLetting is the space\nbetween the base lines.\n\n89\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.970\nIt's line spacing, okay, but\nthe technical term is letting.\n\n90\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.460\nAnd then the space after paragraph,\nsee right here,\n\n91\n00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.770\nthis guy after conversation,\nthat's the end of a paragraph right there,\n\n92\n00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.380\nat the end of deep well that's\nthe end of a paragraph.\n\n93\n00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.668\nUp on here same thing but look at how\nmuch space is between the paragraphs,\n\n94\n00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:47.411\nthere are not double enters in there.\n\n95\n00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:54.186\nThe space that it's making is a paragraph\nlevel formatting of saying space\n\n96\n00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:59.576\nafter paragraph is this amount\nof measurement, perfect.\n\n97\n00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:02.110\nThat's how you should\nspace your paragraphs.\n\n98\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.656\nDouble enters no, don't do that.\n\n99\n00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:11.130\nI am suggesting to you strongly that\nyou do not do double enters okay?\n\n100\n00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.340\nYou should format the spaces\nof your paragraph.\n\n101\n00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.230\nSo those are the different\nthings that you can do here.\n\n102\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.710\nBut to remember, line spacing and\nparagraph spacing are separate.\n\n103\n00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.130\nWhen you start getting into\nsingle lined paragraphs,\n\n104\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.910\nlike they don't span across more than one\nline, sometimes it might look the same.\n\n105\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.050\nBut just know they're a little different.\n\n106\n00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.539\nAll right, how do I get these paragraphs\nto look more like these paragraphs?\n\n107\n00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.540\nI'm gonna select these paragraphs first.\n\n108\n00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.970\nAnd you say but you don't have to select.\n\n109\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.306\nWhen I'm doing multiple paragraph\nformatting, yes, you do need to select all\n\n110\n00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:52.929\nthe text to say I want all three of\nthese paragraphs to be effected,\n\n111\n00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:54.109\nnot just one of them.\n\n112\n00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:59.521\nAnd if I go into this button right here,\nI could go ahead and choose the 1.5 or\n\n113\n00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:05.521\nthe 1.15 or 1.5 and do that, and that\nwould change the space between the lines.\n\n114\n00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:06.283\nBut look,\n\n115\n00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:11.204\nthe space between those paragraphs\nare not the same are they, okay?\n\n116\n00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:12.325\nOne other side note,\n\n117\n00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:16.080\nI actually didn't mention this in\nthe character formatting episode.\n\n118\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.690\nIf you are used to PC or\nyou have used word for\n\n119\n00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.150\nPC in somewhere else,\nyou will get the live previewing,\n\n120\n00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.600\nlike if I'm hovering over this font,\nit would normally show you\n\n121\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.810\non the screen like what it's doing as it's\nchanging, Apple doesn't have that, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.791\nOffice for Mac products,\nthey don't have it.\n\n123\n00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:43.468\nWell, we can live without it.\n\n124\n00:07:43.468 --> 00:07:45.010\nI do like it though, so\n\n125\n00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:50.062\nI do tend it to miss it from time to time\nwhen I switch over to Office for Mac.\n\n126\n00:07:50.062 --> 00:07:54.809\nSo line spacing or\ngoing into the line spacing options,\n\n127\n00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:59.254\nthat brings you into\nthe dialogue box of right here.\n\n128\n00:07:59.254 --> 00:08:01.333\nThe space after.\n\n129\n00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:06.600\nNow you can have space before,\nnothing wrong with it.\n\n130\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.400\nMe, personally,\nI like to have a space after.\n\n131\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.227\nI try at all costs to not\nhave anything before,\n\n132\n00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:17.578\ncuz I'm thinking it's just we go down.\n\n133\n00:08:17.578 --> 00:08:20.771\nWe progress down the page so\nI don't like to think of\n\n134\n00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:25.940\nhaving to think about space above it,\nI always wanna think after it.\n\n135\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.720\nPersonal preference, but you can have\nsome of both or one or the other.\n\n136\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.590\nSo I'm gonna bump this space after\nto 18 to really emphasize this.\n\n137\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.980\nNotice you can change your line\nspacing right here if you wanted to.\n\n138\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.418\nAnd then you could also do like\nindividual measurements of like\n\n139\n00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:44.351\n1.65 if you wanted to.\n\n140\n00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:47.580\nWe'll just keep it at 1.5 right now,\nwe'll click OK.\n\n141\n00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:53.970\nAnd notice right there,\nthat's a big space after the paragraph.\n\n142\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.645\nSo that's really important to\nunderstand those two key concepts\n\n143\n00:08:58.645 --> 00:09:01.875\nof how your line and\nparagraph spacing work.\n\n144\n00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.950\nAnd as you can see, pretty simple, right?\n\n145\n00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.820\nAlong the same lines, if I started\na File &gt; New and I decided control,\n\n146\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.232\nsorry, command, I'm really on those\nWindows shortcuts today, aren't I?\n\n147\n00:09:14.232 --> 00:09:17.620\n[LAUGH] Cmd+N, that's for new.\n\n148\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.014\nWhen you start a brand new file in Word,\n\n149\n00:09:20.014 --> 00:09:24.980\nyou're actually making a new file off\nof what's known as the global template.\n\n150\n00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.680\nThe global template is something that\njust says, here's my new blank document.\n\n151\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.510\nIn the normal template, you have something\nknown as the normal style, right here.\n\n152\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.605\nWe'll talk a lot about\nstyles a little bit later.\n\n153\n00:09:38.605 --> 00:09:40.740\nBut notice that that is on by default.\n\n154\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.470\nThis is the same for all Word programs,\nit doesn't matter what platform.\n\n155\n00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.410\nAnd that normal paragraph\nstyle has certain paragraph\n\n156\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.929\nlevel formattings which\nincludes line spacing.\n\n157\n00:09:54.929 --> 00:10:00.840\nIn PC world, if you start typing,\nyeah, those make words, right?\n\n158\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.540\nAnd you hit Enter, you would normally\nget a little bit of space once\n\n159\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.550\nyou hit the enter, to your next paragraph.\n\n160\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.890\nBecause the normal style is set to have,\nI think it's\n\n161\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.450\neight points after paragraph, it might\nbe a little more than that, maybe nine.\n\n162\n00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.470\nFor Mac, it doesn't do that.\n\n163\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.430\nSo see, when I type, type, type, type,\ntype, hit Enter, no space is happening.\n\n164\n00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.560\nThat's just the way it works.\n\n165\n00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.200\nI just keep on, keep on,\nkeeping on, right.\n\n166\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.072\nThat's why I think people\nare inclined to do Enter,\n\n167\n00:10:34.072 --> 00:10:37.050\nEnter, right, cuz you need that space,\nEnter, Enter.\n\n168\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.660\nI need space between my paragraph.\n\n169\n00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.954\nNo, just don't do that.\n\n170\n00:10:41.954 --> 00:10:44.450\nGo ahead and\nchange your paragraph spacing, okay.\n\n171\n00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.810\nKnow that you could type this all in and\nformat it afterwards, or\n\n172\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.750\nwhen you first start, go ahead and,\nyou could even set it right before.\n\n173\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.770\nYou could go with a line spacing.\n\n174\n00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:01.770\nBump the space up to well, I've say 12\npoints and then type, type, type, Enter.\n\n175\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.420\nBecause every formatting that you do,\n\n176\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.560\nit's gonna remember the next time\nthat you make a new paragraph.\n\n177\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.730\nSo that's what I will suggest you and\ninstead of a double enters.\n\n178\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.483\nEven more so,\nI would change the normal font style, and\n\n179\n00:11:16.483 --> 00:11:18.710\nthen I'll actually update on the template,\n\n180\n00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.301\nthat's going a little bit further\noutside of this particular episode.\n\n181\n00:11:22.301 --> 00:11:25.716\nBut we will get into styles so\nyou'll know what I'm talking about there.\n\n182\n00:11:25.716 --> 00:11:28.725\nI think templates,\nI think that's in my advance series so,\n\n183\n00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:32.450\njust finding your own template of finding\nhow you want your text be format.\n\n184\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.320\nYou can make your own, I think I would\nactually go with that rather than\n\n185\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.880\nmodify the global, I would make my own.\n\n186\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.460\nAgain, I digress slightly,\n\n187\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.070\nbut giving you some foreshadowing\ninto other places you can go.\n\n188\n00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.240\n&gt;&gt; So, Vonne, I just have to ask,\nmainly because some\n\n189\n00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.880\nindividuals may be asking this, you seem\nreally been against the double enters.\n\n190\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.730\nWhat's the impetus for that?\n\n191\n00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.750\nFor me, I'm just like, well, it achieves\nthe desired look, why does it matter?\n\n192\n00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.880\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's a really good question.\n\n193\n00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.430\nI'm actually glad you asked that.\n\n194\n00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:10.435\nTold you I'm a little bit of a font geek,\nand I do a lot of work outside of Word and\n\n195\n00:12:10.435 --> 00:12:14.804\nother products such InDesign and\nIllustrator.\n\n196\n00:12:14.804 --> 00:12:18.660\nAnd I do a lot of work for clients\nfreelancing and everything like that.\n\n197\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.938\nSo they'll send me a lot\nof text in a Word document,\n\n198\n00:12:21.938 --> 00:12:25.084\nhere's all the text is\ngonna go on our textbook.\n\n199\n00:12:25.084 --> 00:12:28.313\nIf I have a 195 pages of double enters,\nthe thing is,\n\n200\n00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:31.751\nI'm gonna format cuz I'm gonna\nstylized all your texts and\n\n201\n00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:35.570\ngonna make it look good and\nreadable in a printed format.\n\n202\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:40.760\nWell, I need to format\nthe paragraph with styles that say,\n\n203\n00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.310\nI need this amount of space after\nparagraphs cuz I can control that.\n\n204\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.578\nBut double enters, I can't control that.\n\n205\n00:12:46.578 --> 00:12:50.310\nBecause that's like a fixed space so\nit starts to, if I change all paragraphs,\n\n206\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.162\nit's gonna change the one in between.\n\n207\n00:12:52.162 --> 00:12:57.252\nIt's gonna make this all this other stuff,\nso I want it to be a paragraph, paragraph,\n\n208\n00:12:57.252 --> 00:13:02.460\nparagraph, nothing in between, that's\nhow it should be and that's what I want.\n\n209\n00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nI can actually see the purpose here.\n\n210\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.480\nIt's kind of like, if you're in school and\n\n211\n00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.310\nyou have a particular project or maybe\nyou're submitting a proposal or something,\n\n212\n00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.720\na lot of times they have\nformatting requirements.\n\n213\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.180\nAnd let's say you submit it and\nit get set back to you and\n\n214\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.730\none of those requirements is you\nneed 15 points after each paragraph.\n\n215\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.822\nReadability, it needs to be one and\na half line spacing.\n\n216\n00:13:23.822 --> 00:13:26.881\nIf you have double enters,\nyou now gonna go fix all of those\n\n217\n00:13:26.881 --> 00:13:30.005\nmanually instead of just\nselecting the entire document and\n\n218\n00:13:30.005 --> 00:13:34.396\nsaying, hey, I wanna change this space\nafter paragraph to blah, blah, blah so.\n\n219\n00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:36.016\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I can see it like,\n\n220\n00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.950\nI don't do print layout.\n\n221\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.950\nWell, you may have particular\nthings in what you do.\n\n222\n00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.020\nThey require you to just take it easy\non yourself, don't get crazy, right?\n\n223\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I like where you're going\nthis because I'm definitely drown that\n\n224\n00:13:49.985 --> 00:13:51.710\nconcept home run, right?\n\n225\n00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.360\nAnd you're like, but I still do it.\n\n226\n00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.200\nThere is nothing wrong if you\ndon't do anything besides\n\n227\n00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.230\njust typing out some texts and\neverything like that.\n\n228\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.190\nAnd you're not doing any crazy formatting,\ngo ahead, do the double enters.\n\n229\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.760\nI'm not saying it's not ever allowed.\n\n230\n00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:09.390\nI personally have more control over my\nspacing when I have individual paragraphs\n\n231\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.730\nwith no extra enters in between because\nI live in the world of line spacing and\n\n232\n00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.650\nparagraph spacing.\n\n233\n00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.962\nSo that's where I need\nparagraphs as full paragraphs,\n\n234\n00:14:18.962 --> 00:14:21.011\nnot any little things in between.\n\n235\n00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:25.562\nSo great question, I'm loving this\nlittle conversation that we're having.\n\n236\n00:14:25.562 --> 00:14:28.890\n[LAUGH] But\nlet's move on to a few other things.\n\n237\n00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.711\nAnd I did wanna come back to this\nwhole idea of starting a new file\n\n238\n00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:33.051\non why you have that spacing.\n\n239\n00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:36.919\nAnd hopefully that's doing a little like,\nokay,\n\n240\n00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:40.888\nnow I understand what's going\non in both MAC and PC land.\n\n241\n00:14:40.888 --> 00:14:44.904\nI'm gonna do my command tilde right over\nher to get me back into my paragraph\n\n242\n00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:47.178\nformatting document.\n\n243\n00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:51.960\nIndents, when we talk about indents,\nyou have a couple of different types.\n\n244\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.567\nYou have a left indent, you have a right\nindent, and you have a first line indent.\n\n245\n00:14:55.567 --> 00:14:59.471\nAnd depending on where those\nare positioned, you create, well,\n\n246\n00:14:59.471 --> 00:15:03.245\na first line indent or\nsomething else known as a hanging indent.\n\n247\n00:15:03.245 --> 00:15:07.117\nLet's watch, I will scroll in just\na little bit, this is the paragraph,\n\n248\n00:15:07.117 --> 00:15:10.270\nI'm not selecting the whole paragraph.\n\n249\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.520\nI have these buttons up at the top, okay.\n\n250\n00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.169\nThis would be a increase indent,\nthis will be a decrease.\n\n251\n00:15:16.169 --> 00:15:23.090\nIf I click it right now, It's increasing\nthe left indent, the whole left indent.\n\n252\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.600\nIf I click it this button,\nit's gonna decrease the indent.\n\n253\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.841\nFine, but I usually do indents from\nthe ruler, the ruler is right here.\n\n254\n00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:37.246\nIf you don't have the ruler, go to your\nView tab and turn on the ruler, and\n\n255\n00:15:37.246 --> 00:15:41.200\nnotice that it's really small,\nI can't zoom in right now.\n\n256\n00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.532\nI don't think I have that checkbox on my\nsystems where I can show you if it's right\n\n257\n00:15:45.532 --> 00:15:48.351\nhere, obviously,\nthey're really small, okay.\n\n258\n00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:52.632\nThey're these, a white triangle pointing\ndown, a white triangle pointing up, and\n\n259\n00:15:52.632 --> 00:15:54.063\na rectangle underneath it.\n\n260\n00:15:54.063 --> 00:15:59.977\nThat's your left indent,\nthe bottom rectangle, the Left margin.\n\n261\n00:15:59.977 --> 00:16:03.154\nDon't worry about what that actually says,\nI'll tell you what that is in a minute.\n\n262\n00:16:03.154 --> 00:16:06.079\nAnd the first line, the one pointing down,\n\n263\n00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:10.919\nyou really only want to concentrate\non the first line and the rectangle.\n\n264\n00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:15.559\nBecause if I take the top triangle and\nI drag it in,\n\n265\n00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:19.660\nI'm changing the indent of the first line.\n\n266\n00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.547\nThe rectangle down below,\nthat's the whole left indent,\n\n267\n00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:28.884\nbecause I took the first and\nbrought it in.\n\n268\n00:16:28.884 --> 00:16:33.578\nWhen I pull the left, you'll see those\nare set now that I could go ahead and\n\n269\n00:16:33.578 --> 00:16:36.150\nincrease the entire left indent.\n\n270\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:40.187\nYou could drag that bottom\nrectangle independently,\n\n271\n00:16:40.187 --> 00:16:43.968\nthat's fine,\nsince it kind of works the same way.\n\n272\n00:16:43.968 --> 00:16:48.063\nBut notice how that first line is\nnot moving as opposed to grabbing\n\n273\n00:16:48.063 --> 00:16:53.070\nthe rectangle, and then moving\nin conjunction with each other.\n\n274\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.474\nWhich means you could also take\nthe first line, I call it an outdent.\n\n275\n00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.893\nI don't know what it's technically named,\nbut\n\n276\n00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:02.268\nthat's what we would usually refer\nto as a hanging indent, right?\n\n277\n00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:06.884\nFirst line outdent, full left indent,\nand that's how you could create\n\n278\n00:17:06.884 --> 00:17:10.755\nthe hanging indent, but\nthat's what you've got going on.\n\n279\n00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:13.766\nYou have a puzzling look over there,\nJustin, I'm curious.\n\n280\n00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:16.382\n&gt;&gt; So you'll have to excuse me,\n\n281\n00:17:16.382 --> 00:17:21.939\ngrabbing the bottom triangle\nversus grabbing the rectangle.\n\n282\n00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:22.915\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n283\n00:17:22.915 --> 00:17:26.383\n&gt;&gt; So if I grab the bottom triangle, that\nkeeps things bound to the top triangle, or\n\n284\n00:17:26.383 --> 00:17:27.510\ndo I have that backwards?\n\n285\n00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.477\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n286\n00:17:28.477 --> 00:17:30.242\n&gt;&gt; Okay and if I grab the rectangle,\n\n287\n00:17:30.242 --> 00:17:33.275\nthat will move independently\nof the bound top triangle?\n\n288\n00:17:33.275 --> 00:17:34.392\n&gt;&gt; Actually, you flipped them.\n\n289\n00:17:34.392 --> 00:17:37.365\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the rectangle, watch the first\n\n290\n00:17:37.365 --> 00:17:42.235\nline, if I grab the rectangle,\nthe first line moves together, right?\n\n291\n00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:45.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Take the bottom triangle,\n\n292\n00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.802\nnot the rectangle,\nnotice the first line does not move.\n\n293\n00:17:50.802 --> 00:17:52.509\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna be honest with you, Vonne,\n\n294\n00:17:52.509 --> 00:17:54.956\nthis is something that I have\nstruggled with for years.\n\n295\n00:17:54.956 --> 00:17:55.743\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n296\n00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:57.437\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm like, are you indenting?\n\n297\n00:17:57.437 --> 00:18:00.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't need you to, I mean, stop.\n\n298\n00:18:00.081 --> 00:18:00.838\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n299\n00:18:00.838 --> 00:18:04.732\n&gt;&gt; So maybe it was just this whole time,\nI wasn't paying close enough attention,\n\n300\n00:18:04.732 --> 00:18:07.302\nbecause I'm like, no,\nthat's not what I want.\n\n301\n00:18:07.302 --> 00:18:09.787\nI want these to be relative to each other.\n\n302\n00:18:09.787 --> 00:18:14.157\n&gt;&gt; Yes, relative to each other, like\nonce I set you in this distance apart,\n\n303\n00:18:14.157 --> 00:18:15.365\nyou move together.\n\n304\n00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:16.537\nYes, that's the bottom rectangle.\n\n305\n00:18:16.537 --> 00:18:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n306\n00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.529\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nbecause that's the whole left indent.\n\n307\n00:18:19.529 --> 00:18:22.008\nThe other ones are where they're\nindependent from each other.\n\n308\n00:18:22.008 --> 00:18:27.356\nYes, and I will tell you that indents\nmess people up all the time in Word,\n\n309\n00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:30.960\nokay, you always have a ruler on,\nalways look.\n\n310\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.908\nAnd notice that this paragraph\nis completely different than\n\n311\n00:18:32.908 --> 00:18:33.638\nthis one, isn't it?\n\n312\n00:18:33.638 --> 00:18:36.290\nSee how these moved over?\n\n313\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.887\nThese are here because indents\nare a paragraph level spacing.\n\n314\n00:18:39.887 --> 00:18:44.759\nI've gotten it to where, okay, so the two\ntriangles are on top of each other and\n\n315\n00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:47.257\nthis one is just slightly over this way.\n\n316\n00:18:47.257 --> 00:18:50.025\nAnd this one's over to the side,\nI'm like, why did, how did you do that?\n\n317\n00:18:50.025 --> 00:18:53.605\nI just come over here and\ndrag it back to the full margin,\n\n318\n00:18:53.605 --> 00:18:56.742\nyou've just got to know\nhow they work together.\n\n319\n00:18:56.742 --> 00:19:01.309\nFirst line, full thing, bottom, and\nthat's why the bottom triangle,\n\n320\n00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:04.265\nit's kind of like bleh,\na little wishy washy.\n\n321\n00:19:04.265 --> 00:19:06.858\nI say concentrate on the bottom\nrectangle and the top triangle,\n\n322\n00:19:06.858 --> 00:19:08.690\nthose are the ones that\nyou wanna talk about.\n\n323\n00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.993\nAnd over on the other side, the right\nside where you can also go ahead and\n\n324\n00:19:12.993 --> 00:19:14.760\nindent from the right.\n\n325\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.504\nAnd this is where rectangle, because you\nwant both of them together, bring that in,\n\n326\n00:19:18.504 --> 00:19:20.065\nlike when you were writing papers.\n\n327\n00:19:20.065 --> 00:19:24.223\nWhere if you were quoting more than four\nlines or something, you had to indent and\n\n328\n00:19:24.223 --> 00:19:25.334\nchange the spacing.\n\n329\n00:19:25.334 --> 00:19:26.534\nAt least I remember, I'm going way back.\n\n330\n00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:28.489\n&gt;&gt; One of the block level quotes or\nsomething like that?\n\n331\n00:19:28.489 --> 00:19:29.006\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n332\n00:19:29.006 --> 00:19:33.176\n&gt;&gt; You had to do block quoting,\nyeah, that was a nightmare, I just,\n\n333\n00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:35.644\nI'm gonna be honest with you, Vonne.\n\n334\n00:19:35.644 --> 00:19:37.453\nI tended to use spaces in things.\n\n335\n00:19:38.515 --> 00:19:39.934\n&gt;&gt; I know, shame on me!\n\n336\n00:19:39.934 --> 00:19:44.322\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm just like no,\nbut isn't this so much easier?\n\n337\n00:19:44.322 --> 00:19:45.134\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n338\n00:19:45.134 --> 00:19:47.701\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now that I fully understand\nwhat those things are doing,\n\n339\n00:19:47.701 --> 00:19:49.403\nand how they move relative to each other.\n\n340\n00:19:49.403 --> 00:19:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and these were things that\nI would struggle with writing papers,\n\n341\n00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.890\nof course, this is back before we\nhad really fancy stuff like this.\n\n342\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.526\nBut I'm talking like middle school and\neverything, but yeah, that's what you do.\n\n343\n00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:02.660\nYou just go ahead and type that and\njust change the spacing.\n\n344\n00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.336\nIn this sense, the indents of\nthat particular paragraph, and\n\n345\n00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:08.529\nthis paragraph is completely separate,\nso you're good, you're fine.\n\n346\n00:20:08.529 --> 00:20:11.895\nLove me some indents and\nthe ruler, let's move on,\n\n347\n00:20:11.895 --> 00:20:16.400\nthere's few other things for\nour paragraph level formatting.\n\n348\n00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.899\nThese are a little smaller, I would say,\nas opposed to the line spacing and\n\n349\n00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:21.767\nthe indents.\n\n350\n00:20:21.767 --> 00:20:27.670\nYou have shading, so I have over on\nthe Home tab, these buttons right here.\n\n351\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.651\nI have what looks like a paint bucket,\npaint bucket is shading,\n\n352\n00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:35.203\nit's paragraph level form,\nparagraph level shading.\n\n353\n00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:37.780\nNormally, notice I do not\nhave everything selected.\n\n354\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.434\nBut if I drop this down and I pick\na color, let's just go with green, boom,\n\n355\n00:20:41.434 --> 00:20:42.780\nit goes all the way across.\n\n356\n00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.580\nIt did not just go on the letters.\n\n357\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.478\nIt went all the way across to the margins\nbecause that's where the paragraph sits.\n\n358\n00:20:49.478 --> 00:20:53.482\nNow this is one of those weird things,\nif I select this text and\n\n359\n00:20:53.482 --> 00:20:56.960\nthen click the button,\nit's only gonna highlight.\n\n360\n00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.340\nIt's almost like highlighting, right?\n\n361\n00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.720\nI wish it wouldn't do that.\n\n362\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.482\nI wish that even if you\nhad selected this text,\n\n363\n00:21:03.482 --> 00:21:06.743\nit would highlight the whole paragraph,\nbecause that's what it's supposed to do.\n\n364\n00:21:06.743 --> 00:21:10.727\nSo if I just clicked, whoops,\nI have one letter selected, clicked, see,\n\n365\n00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:12.820\nit selects the whole paragraph.\n\n366\n00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.992\nI think it's a little misleading,\nI wish it wouldn't do that, but it does.\n\n367\n00:21:15.992 --> 00:21:19.251\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that seems very context\nspecific kind of controls.\n\n368\n00:21:19.251 --> 00:21:24.150\nAnd paragraphs are, I'm almost\nthinking like of block level elements.\n\n369\n00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.894\nAnd so it would make sense to me,\nbased on my experience,\n\n370\n00:21:27.894 --> 00:21:33.206\nif I'm in a paragraph and I'm going to\nfill or highlight the paragraph, shade.\n\n371\n00:21:33.206 --> 00:21:34.018\nIt should be the full width.\n\n372\n00:21:34.018 --> 00:21:38.120\n&gt;&gt; The whole thing, no matter what you\nhave selected on because that's the block.\n\n373\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.574\nAs he's talking about,\nwhen we're talking about web design,\n\n374\n00:21:40.574 --> 00:21:41.578\nthe block as a paragraph.\n\n375\n00:21:41.578 --> 00:21:45.120\nSo because, well, paragraphs are block\nlevel elements, so, there we go.\n\n376\n00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.482\nLovely, so we have some shading on there,\nand you can go through and\n\n377\n00:21:47.482 --> 00:21:48.527\npick your different colors.\n\n378\n00:21:48.527 --> 00:21:52.131\nI didn't go through all of the colors that\nwe had done in the font formatting or\n\n379\n00:21:52.131 --> 00:21:53.470\nthe paragraph formatting.\n\n380\n00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.077\nSo watch that episode if you want\nmore information about colors.\n\n381\n00:21:56.077 --> 00:21:59.240\nThe other thing you can\nis you can do borders.\n\n382\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.519\nI'm still just,\nI'll turn this paragraph button off,\n\n383\n00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:03.095\nI'm still selected in the paragraph.\n\n384\n00:22:03.095 --> 00:22:05.027\nYou have this button right here,\n\n385\n00:22:05.027 --> 00:22:08.213\nthat's going to a draw\na border around the paragraph.\n\n386\n00:22:08.213 --> 00:22:12.830\nSo if I did an outside border,\nnotice it's going to do that.\n\n387\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:19.174\nBut you could also come into more options\nfor your paragraph borders and shading.\n\n388\n00:22:19.174 --> 00:22:21.250\nYou could either go from\nthis drop down here.\n\n389\n00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:26.156\nI believe it's also in the Format menu,\nyes, and we can go to Borders and Shading.\n\n390\n00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:29.591\nAnd notice,\njust like we had with our font dialog box,\n\n391\n00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:33.710\nwe have a couple other options in here,\nlike what type of border.\n\n392\n00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:38.114\nDo I want a shadow border,\ndo I want a different line style?\n\n393\n00:22:38.114 --> 00:22:43.180\nMaybe I want some triple lines, and then\nwhat color do I want that border to be?\n\n394\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.110\nThat's something just from\nthat button you couldn't do.\n\n395\n00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:50.230\nMaybe I'll go with purple again, and\nI'll make this a little bit thicker.\n\n396\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.829\nNotice it is applying to the paragraph\nas opposed to, I believe, well,\n\n397\n00:22:53.829 --> 00:22:55.189\njust the paragraph [LAUGH].\n\n398\n00:22:55.189 --> 00:22:58.040\nI think there might be some sections and\neverything.\n\n399\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.376\nJust be careful just make sure you're\napplying it just to the paragraph.\n\n400\n00:23:01.376 --> 00:23:05.360\nI click OK, look at that,\nthat's a little fancier, right?\n\n401\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.746\nYou couldn't get that from\njust these buttons up here,\n\n402\n00:23:08.746 --> 00:23:12.793\nyou had to go through that dialog box,\nso a few more options there.\n\n403\n00:23:12.793 --> 00:23:17.423\nAll right, last little things\nabout paragraph formatting,\n\n404\n00:23:17.423 --> 00:23:21.441\nhyphens, do you have\nan opinion about hyphenation?\n\n405\n00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:24.563\n&gt;&gt; Like hyphenation at the end of a word,\nor at the end of a line, or?\n\n406\n00:23:24.563 --> 00:23:25.664\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like in paragraphs.\n\n407\n00:23:25.664 --> 00:23:29.865\n&gt;&gt; It should be,\nI'm gonna be honest with you.\n\n408\n00:23:29.865 --> 00:23:34.071\nI stay away from those unless they're\ncompound words, where it might be,\n\n409\n00:23:34.071 --> 00:23:37.361\nI can see it, but\nI'm seeing hyphens between syllables.\n\n410\n00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:39.582\nI'm actually seeing people put hyphens,\nit's like,\n\n411\n00:23:39.582 --> 00:23:41.480\nthere's not even a correct\nsyllabic like end.\n\n412\n00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n413\n00:23:42.641 --> 00:23:44.202\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, how am I supposed to read?\n\n414\n00:23:44.202 --> 00:23:46.865\n&gt;&gt; There are rules of when you're\nsupposed to hyphenate, right?\n\n415\n00:23:46.865 --> 00:23:47.607\nYes, okay, and\n\n416\n00:23:47.607 --> 00:23:50.794\nit's funny, I also kinda led you into\na little bit of a trick question.\n\n417\n00:23:50.794 --> 00:23:51.764\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:52.500\n&gt;&gt; Because,\n\n419\n00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.093\ngoing back to me being a type\nsetting geek, I don't like hyphens.\n\n420\n00:23:57.093 --> 00:24:01.254\nAnd this is also what's\nknown as a right rag Ok?\n\n421\n00:24:01.254 --> 00:24:04.177\nLike, how ragged this right line is.\n\n422\n00:24:04.177 --> 00:24:07.268\nI'm not a fan of hyphens, but\n\n423\n00:24:07.268 --> 00:24:13.480\nif you hyphenate that right rag,\ncan be less ragged.\n\n424\n00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.060\nHyphenations are not\non by default in Word.\n\n425\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.270\nIt just doesn't happen.\n\n426\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.430\nSo, if it gets too long,\n\n427\n00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.110\nit just automatically just\ngoes onto your next line.\n\n428\n00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.640\nThat's just how Word works.\n\n429\n00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.765\nBut, if you want hyphens,\nyou can turn them on.\n\n430\n00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:29.130\nI'm gonna select a couple\nof these paragraphs.\n\n431\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.897\nLet's just go with this one for now.\n\n432\n00:24:30.897 --> 00:24:34.730\nI'll zoom out just slightly, so\nyou can see this a little bit.\n\n433\n00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:39.240\nHyphenation is on a different tab,\nit's on your layout tab.\n\n434\n00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.380\nI believe it's in your format menu too,\ntools.\n\n435\n00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.760\nYeah, it's in the tools I'm sorry,\nhyphenation.\n\n436\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.970\nBut there's this button right here\nwith the hyphenation of turning it on.\n\n437\n00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.727\nNotice on none.\n\n438\n00:24:50.727 --> 00:24:54.550\nBut if I said automatic, nothing happened.\n\n439\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:59.252\nLet me bump up the font,\nI think that's where it will, there's one,\n\n440\n00:24:59.252 --> 00:25:03.296\nsee, book-shelves,\nto her great disappointment, manage.\n\n441\n00:25:03.296 --> 00:25:06.321\nSo it also depends on your font-size,\nwhether or\n\n442\n00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:08.416\nnot it's gonna hyphenate or not.\n\n443\n00:25:08.416 --> 00:25:12.430\nThat's where you can really see\nthe difference with your hyphenation.\n\n444\n00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.690\nTotally up to you, whether you want it.\n\n445\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.450\nYou can go into your hyphenation options,\n\n446\n00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.700\nbecause there's things like,\ndo you want consecutive hyphens?\n\n447\n00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.560\nIf you have six hyphens in a row,\nprobably don't want that.\n\n448\n00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.790\nSo you can limit how many\nhyphens are in there.\n\n449\n00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.640\nSo a few little things in that,\nso if you notice,\n\n450\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.980\nI can just wanna have like two consecutive\nhyphens and so on and so forth.\n\n451\n00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.678\nLittle things, but again,\n\n452\n00:25:41.678 --> 00:25:45.440\nlittle things can be really big\nwhen you're somebody like me.\n\n453\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.746\n[LAUGH] So your hypehnations, then the\nlast one that I'd like to cover in this\n\n454\n00:25:49.746 --> 00:25:54.850\nparticular episode is just gonna be a\nlittle bit of stylistic stuff, drop caps.\n\n455\n00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.310\nDrop caps, you're like what is that.\n\n456\n00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.862\nYou've seen this before,\nyou've seen it in a book.\n\n457\n00:25:58.862 --> 00:26:04.843\nMaybe like a children's book or a fancy\nbook, the first letter of a line is,\n\n458\n00:26:04.843 --> 00:26:09.156\nJustin went like this,\nyeah, it's bigger, right?\n\n459\n00:26:09.156 --> 00:26:14.100\nSo you have a really big T for the word\nthe The, that's what a drop cap is.\n\n460\n00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.300\nIt's capitalizing and\ndropping it down within the paragraph.\n\n461\n00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:24.150\nIt's in a space, it's a little funny,\nso you have to know where to find it.\n\n462\n00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:28.019\nIf I'm selecting on the paragraph,\nso I'm gonna just.\n\n463\n00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:29.110\nWhoa sorry, what am I doing?\n\n464\n00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.130\nZooming, okay.\n\n465\n00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.667\nI'm zooming in on here,\nI've put my cursor in the paragraph,\n\n466\n00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:35.735\nyou go to the insert tab.\n\n467\n00:26:35.735 --> 00:26:39.420\nLittle strange, but insert drop cap and\n\n468\n00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.880\nfrom drop cap you can go to drop and\nit made up.\n\n469\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:50.370\nIt drop made it a big E, and how many\nlines did that drop, this one did three.\n\n470\n00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.440\nBut maybe three,\nin this one might be little too much.\n\n471\n00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.430\nSo, I don't only wanna be two.\n\n472\n00:26:54.430 --> 00:27:00.200\nSo if you go into your drop cap options,\nnotice if I click on dropped,\n\n473\n00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.180\nI have an option of how many\nlines I want it to drop down.\n\n474\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.540\nSo if I only chose two,\nyou could also say like,\n\n475\n00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.950\nhow much distance you want from your text.\n\n476\n00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:13.270\nIf you want it to have a little bit more,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n477\n00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:18.150\nIn the margin, that would be like, well,\nin the margin space and not in this area,\n\n478\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.220\nI'd probably, I personally would\navoid that, because I would not want\n\n479\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.550\nanything outside my margins, because\nthat's kind of why I have a margins.\n\n480\n00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.260\nSo I click okay, and notice that I\nhave a little bit more space and\n\n481\n00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.760\nit dropped only two lines instead of\nthree, it has to be more than two.\n\n482\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.140\nIf you put one, it's not gonna happen,\nbecause It's the same line.\n\n483\n00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.380\nSo you have to have two or more.\n\n484\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.860\nSo that's just a little fun thing that you\ncan do with paragraph level formatting.\n\n485\n00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.150\nLike I said,\nthese are paragraph level formatting but\n\n486\n00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.210\nwe'll do it in another episode.\n\n487\n00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.340\nSo I think that covers just about\neverything that I want to do in all\n\n488\n00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.370\nthose buttons.\n\n489\n00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.330\nAnd yeah, there you go.\n\n490\n00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne I will tell you,\nyou have made my day.\n\n491\n00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.770\nI will no longer struggle with\nthose horrible indentation options,\n\n492\n00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.025\nthat I've become frustrated.\n\n493\n00:28:02.025 --> 00:28:06.110\nThe storm from my computer,\nonly to come back to get frustrated again.\n\n494\n00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.830\nSo thank you, and all of those of you out\nthere, you should definitely take heed\n\n495\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.750\nof all this wonderful information\nthat Vonne has given us.\n\n496\n00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.270\nAs her title of paragraph phenom.\n\n497\n00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.570\nAnd well, we are running out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n498\n00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.570\nBut definitely stay tuned for more\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n499\n00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.130\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for Office Pro Tv.\n\n500\n00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.208\nI've been your host Justin Dennison and\nI'm Vaughn Smith, and\n\n501\n00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:29.467\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n502\n00:28:29.467 --> 00:28:34.249\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.171\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\ncoming back with, well, something that\n\n4\n00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:24.378\nI'm not quite sure is going on in our\nMicrosoft Word 2016 Essentials for\n\n5\n00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:25.116\nMac series.\n\n6\n00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:27.930\nWe're gonna be talking\nabout the format painter.\n\n7\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.522\nLuckily we have someone very special\nin the studio to, well, reveal,\n\n8\n00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:33.635\nto pull back the curtain, if you will.\n\n9\n00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:35.272\nMs Vonne Smith,\nhow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:35.272 --> 00:00:38.007\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, when you were\nintroducing, I was like, what?\n\n11\n00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:38.751\nWhat's going on?\n\n12\n00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:40.809\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You got me a little\n\n13\n00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:41.704\nscared there.\n\n14\n00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:43.880\n&gt;&gt; I know the title of the episode.\n\n15\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the extent that I know.\n\n16\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.506\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, luckily I'm here to\nshow you the way, just like you said.\n\n17\n00:00:50.506 --> 00:00:53.800\nI'm gonna pull back that curtain and\ntell you all about the format painter.\n\n18\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.300\nI do love a format painter.\n\n19\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.177\nIt can be really handy, and a lot of times\nwhen I first teached this to people,\n\n20\n00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:01.807\nthey were like, this is amazing,\nI'm gonna use it all the time.\n\n21\n00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:04.162\nAnd then I'm like, yeah, but\nyou really should use styles.\n\n22\n00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:07.293\nAnd they're like, no, I don't wanna use\nthat, I wanna use the format painter.\n\n23\n00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:10.055\nIt's fun, and I'm like totally fine, so\n\n24\n00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:14.504\nthat's why I wanted to give it its own\nepisode to give it a little bit of\n\n25\n00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:18.820\na shout out there to see how\nit could be pretty cool.\n\n26\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.070\nSo what is the format painter?\n\n27\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.890\nIt's the little paintbrush that's on your\nribbon that we'll look at in a second.\n\n28\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.300\nBut what it does is it will copy formats\nto other location within your document.\n\n29\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.861\nAnd this is how I, Justin's over there\ngoing, hm, what are you talking about?\n\n30\n00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:41.198\nIt's probably easiest to demonstrate it,\nso why don't we jump down in here,\n\n31\n00:01:41.198 --> 00:01:45.420\nand I'll start talking about my analogy\nthat I have for the format painter?\n\n32\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.950\nNow, this particular paragraph right here,\nyou could see that we have some\n\n33\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.520\ncharacter level formatting and\nsome paragraph level formatting.\n\n34\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.394\nWe have purple font that is 18 Calibri and\nit's bold.\n\n35\n00:01:57.394 --> 00:02:02.150\nWe have it centered as a paragraph,\nwe also have some shading,\n\n36\n00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.951\nand we also have some border on this.\n\n37\n00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:06.475\nAnd so we've got all of that going on.\n\n38\n00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:11.795\nWell, down here where it says,\nwell, I like purple, and me too,\n\n39\n00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:18.670\nI wanna have both of these paragraphs\nformatted the same way as this paragraph.\n\n40\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.281\nNow I could go ahead and\ndo the long selection.\n\n41\n00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:25.571\nWell, I could select both of those\nwith my command and then come up and\n\n42\n00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:27.232\ndo all the formats that I just did.\n\n43\n00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:31.860\nBut wouldn't it be nice to just copy\nthe formatting from here down to there?\n\n44\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.471\nWell, that's what it does, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:35.700\nIt's like painting a house, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.428\nAnd I also tell people about this\nprocedure to think about, well,\n\n47\n00:02:39.428 --> 00:02:43.223\nyour procedure of what you need to\ndo when you need to make the painter\n\n48\n00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:46.645\nwork because that's the biggest\nproblem that people have.\n\n49\n00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:50.195\nIt's like painting a house,\nright, or painting the wall.\n\n50\n00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:52.314\nYou wanna put the wall,\nyou wanna put the wall on the paint.\n\n51\n00:02:52.314 --> 00:02:54.875\n[LAUGH] You wanna put the paint-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I will tell you, Vonne,\n\n52\n00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.181\nthat may be a difficult task.\n\n53\n00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.820\nLook, I gotta cut this wall down and\nstick it in this gallon of paint.\n\n54\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.370\nWhy?\n\n55\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.100\nThat's what I do.\n\n56\n00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.171\nThat's how I paint walls.\n\n57\n00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yeah,\nI got it a little backwards.\n\n58\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.660\nAnd so don't be backwards.\n\n59\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.070\nYou need to make sure you\ndid it the right way.\n\n60\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.670\nYou have a campaign or a roller,\nyou put the roller in the paint, right?\n\n61\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.380\nSo that the paint gets on the roller,\nand then you put it on the wall, right?\n\n62\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.560\nSo this is the paint that\nneeds to go over here, so\n\n63\n00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.750\nyou have to select the paint in\nthe bucket to put on the wall.\n\n64\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.032\nSame idea if this is the paint\nthat I want to paint\n\n65\n00:03:28.032 --> 00:03:33.195\ndown here,\nyour cursor has to be in this area.\n\n66\n00:03:33.195 --> 00:03:35.315\nNow whether you select the text, or\n\n67\n00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:39.484\nyou click once in the paragraph to\njust get the paragraph formatting,\n\n68\n00:03:39.484 --> 00:03:43.174\nthat can get a little tricky,\nI will let you know that, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:48.169\nI'm just gonna select all this text, cuz\nI wanna make sure it understands that I\n\n70\n00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.530\nwant the character formatting and\nthe paragraph formatting all to be copied.\n\n71\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.330\nSo select it, you have a single use\npaintbrush, if you wanna say, and\n\n72\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.250\nyou also could,\nwhat I call turn on the gun.\n\n73\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.860\nYou know those paint guns that\nyou can spray everywhere?\n\n74\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.934\nThat would be dangerous for me, but\nit's just like you turn on the nozzle, and\n\n75\n00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:10.640\nit just keeps on going.\n\n76\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.950\nThat's the same concept that I have for\n\n77\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.260\nif you wanna continually keep this on,\nbut single click once.\n\n78\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.650\nNotice that my mouse comes down here, and\nit looks like an I-beam with a paintbrush.\n\n79\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.637\nSo this is my can of paint,\nclick the button, click, hold,\n\n80\n00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:27.763\nand drag, boop, there you go.\n\n81\n00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:28.830\nIsn't that nice?\n\n82\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.380\nSo it just copied the formatting.\n\n83\n00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.200\nNow that was a one time application.\n\n84\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.200\nNotice that my I-beam just goes\nright back to being an I-beam, so\n\n85\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.990\nno more paint on my roller,\nif you wanna say.\n\n86\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.870\nI'm gonna undo that.\n\n87\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.290\nWhat if I wanted to keep it on?\n\n88\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.860\nThat's where you still gotta go the same\nprocedure, you gotta start here.\n\n89\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.936\nI'm just gonna single click on this one\nand just so I can get everything in there,\n\n90\n00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:56.040\nI'm going to double click\non the Format Paint tab.\n\n91\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.680\nDouble click, it's like the gun's on now.\n\n92\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.190\nIf I click hold and drag, there's that,\n\n93\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.160\nmy I-beam still looks like the paintbrush,\nclick, hold, and drag.\n\n94\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.700\nBut it's still on.\n\n95\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.310\nSo if you click here, oops, whoa, okay,\n\n96\n00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.990\nand also notice one thing\nreally quickly there.\n\n97\n00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.860\nNotice I single clicked one\nword in that paragraph.\n\n98\n00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.045\nIt changed the word very to be bigger and\npurple, but look at all the other text.\n\n99\n00:05:24.045 --> 00:05:25.270\nIt's not, is it, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.350\nSo, single clicking versus\ndouble clicking versus dragging,\n\n101\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.370\nit can get a little weird sometimes.\n\n102\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.629\n&gt;&gt; So, is this because it's applying the\nparagraph level formatting to the entire\n\n103\n00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.946\nparagraph that you've just selected, but\n\n104\n00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:40.597\nonly applying character level\nformatting to the single click word?\n\n105\n00:05:40.597 --> 00:05:42.285\nDo I have that wrong?\n\n106\n00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:44.055\n&gt;&gt; That was perfect, honestly.\n\n107\n00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:45.355\nYeah, you said that perfectly.\n\n108\n00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:47.014\nCuz, yeah, cuz it's still on, right?\n\n109\n00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.955\nThe format painter's on,\nlook at my mouse cursor.\n\n110\n00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:52.277\nIf I click and hold and\ndrag on just those, yes,\n\n111\n00:05:52.277 --> 00:05:55.170\nnow that's an even weirder one, isn't it?\n\n112\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.740\nIt's like, wait, so\nwhen I dragged across text,\n\n113\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.820\nit only applied the character\nlevel formatting, right?\n\n114\n00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.622\nBut if I single click,\nit applied the paragraph level formatting,\n\n115\n00:06:06.622 --> 00:06:11.142\nbut then only the character level\nformatting for that one part.\n\n116\n00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:12.360\nThat's weird.\n\n117\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.630\nLet's go back, okay, let's try this again.\n\n118\n00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.690\nI've gotta go back to my format painter.\n\n119\n00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.640\nBut if I click, hold, and drag across\neverything, it gets the whole thing.\n\n120\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.180\nYeah, that's what will trip you up.\n\n121\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.463\nIt trips you up so much, and\nthat's what understanding character and\n\n122\n00:06:27.463 --> 00:06:29.357\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n123\n00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:34.751\nAnd what happens with the format painter\nwhen you single click, click, hold, and\n\n124\n00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:40.010\ndrag over a couple words, or click, hold,\nand drag over the entire paragraph.\n\n125\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.850\nThat's a big deal, it's tiny,\nbut it will mess you up.\n\n126\n00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.840\nSo that's why when I did my first\nexample of like, look, it worked.\n\n127\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.900\nThey're small lines, right?\n\n128\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.070\nIf I had single clicked on,\nI like purple, look at even that one.\n\n129\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.470\nIt didn't even get even a single word.\n\n130\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.480\nIt just did the paragraph\nlevel formatting.\n\n131\n00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.840\nSo single click, single click,\nclick, hold, drag, get it all, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.518\nSo just know it's a little strange, but\nI'm trying to give you those little\n\n133\n00:07:11.518 --> 00:07:15.478\nnuances cuz I think that's one\nwhere it will frustrate people.\n\n134\n00:07:15.478 --> 00:07:17.920\nCuz it's not giving them what they want.\n\n135\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.007\nIt's just the nature of the level\nof format that you have, so\n\n136\n00:07:23.007 --> 00:07:24.402\nbe careful about it.\n\n137\n00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:28.190\nAnd the single click versus double click,\nlet's go back one more.\n\n138\n00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.330\nDouble clicking, it's like you turn\nthe gun on, you gotta turn it off.\n\n139\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.908\nIf I start dragging here and then drag\nthere, and then okay, drag there,\n\n140\n00:07:38.908 --> 00:07:44.080\nsingle click there, okay,\nI'm just going all over the place, right?\n\n141\n00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.360\nThat button is pressed on,\nyou turn it off.\n\n142\n00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.053\nAnd now it turns into a regular,\n\n143\n00:07:49.053 --> 00:07:52.020\nyou can always do your undo if\nit gets a little too crazy.\n\n144\n00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.780\nSo that's why I tend to say,\njust do maybe a single application,\n\n145\n00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.540\nunless you know what it does and\nyou can go ahead and control it.\n\n146\n00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.350\nSo, good stuff to know about.\n\n147\n00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.660\nAnd just one other little thing is that\nyou can go across multiple documents.\n\n148\n00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.098\nSo for example, let's go with,\nI'll do the paragraph formatting.\n\n149\n00:08:12.098 --> 00:08:18.622\nI'm just picking that particular file just\nbecause if I take this file right here,\n\n150\n00:08:18.622 --> 00:08:24.129\nmy Format Painter, click here,\ndouble click on the Format Painter.\n\n151\n00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:29.360\nI can come over here to this document,\nand then I can do the same thing.\n\n152\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.834\nIf I can click, hold, and drag, I could\ngo ahead and then single click there.\n\n153\n00:08:32.834 --> 00:08:36.840\nNow it's back to the same idea,\nwhat's being applied when.\n\n154\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.735\nBut you can go across multiple\ndocuments if you wanted to.\n\n155\n00:08:40.735 --> 00:08:44.810\nSo it's like, I really like what they're\ndoing over here in this document.\n\n156\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.220\nJust copy the formating.\n\n157\n00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.860\nWe're not copying text,\nwe're just copying the formatting.\n\n158\n00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.157\nSo that's why it's pretty handy.\n\n159\n00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.127\nI like it, it can be a little wonky, so\n\n160\n00:08:54.127 --> 00:08:57.780\njust be careful about all those\ndifferent levels that I talked about.\n\n161\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:04.030\nAnd hopefully, you'll be able to paint\na bunch of purple on your files as well.\n\n162\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I'm definitely glad\nthat we covered character level and\n\n163\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.980\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n164\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.895\nAnd if you haven't watched those,\ndefinitely go check those out,\n\n165\n00:09:09.895 --> 00:09:10.440\nrewatch this one.\n\n166\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.030\nBecause it'll probably make a little more\nsense at that time, finding those nuances.\n\n167\n00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.600\nAnd just like this episode,\na little bit shorter,\n\n168\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.170\nI have a feeling we should probably use\nthe format painter in a very subtle,\n\n169\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.690\njust a little sprinkle here and there.\n\n170\n00:09:24.948 --> 00:09:27.822\nI get you.\nI can see how this would be very difficult\n\n171\n00:09:27.822 --> 00:09:31.497\nto keep replicate cuz you're\nalways opening a document, and\n\n172\n00:09:31.497 --> 00:09:33.910\nit's hard to maintain what did I do.\n\n173\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.263\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's where I'm telling you the styles.\n\n174\n00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:40.813\nOnce you get into knowing what a style\ndoes, how to apply it and how they work,\n\n175\n00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:45.293\nyou're gonna be like no, this a way\nbetter way that I can control things in\n\n176\n00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:48.032\nhow I'm formatting my\ntext if I use my styles.\n\n177\n00:09:48.032 --> 00:09:51.170\nBecause it's all connected\nto one central place.\n\n178\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.288\nAnd I can change that,\nand it changes everything.\n\n179\n00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:57.720\nThat's even that much cooler, so.\n\n180\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I tend to like that one, but I\ncan see the utility of the format painter.\n\n181\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.110\nSo thank you so much, Vonne, for, well,\nhighlighting how to use that, but\n\n182\n00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.300\nalso describing some of those nuanced\nminutia that may trip, well, me and\n\n183\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.500\nyou and everybody up.\n\n184\n00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.790\nAnd luckily I know what the episode's\nabout now, so that's wonderful.\n\n185\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.620\nBut this episode is one and done.\n\n186\n00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.400\nSo we're gonna go ahead and wrap this up.\n\n187\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.450\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n188\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:20.991\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n189\n00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:22.150\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n190\n00:10:22.150 -->

Good to see you too.\n\n10\n00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for being here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes thank you and yes we\nare going to be talking about lists.\n\n12\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.170\nWe did go through our paragraph level\nformatting in another episode and\n\n13\n00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.850\nI did mention in that one that bullets and\n\n14\n00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.260\nnumbering are a paragraph\nlevel formatting.\n\n15\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.220\nBut I wanted to keep them separate because\nthere's a decent amount of things to go\n\n16\n00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.190\nthrough them.\n\n17\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.490\nSo we're gonna go and\nlook at our bullet characters,\n\n18\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.510\nwe're going to be defining our own list,\nwe're gonna be formatting,\n\n19\n00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.515\nwe're gonna be numbering and then\nrenumbering and all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:57.170\n&gt;&gt; Good deal.\n\n21\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, lots of fun, so why don't\nwe just go ahead and get started.\n\n22\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.870\nI've got a document already pulled up for\nus called Bullets and Numbering.docx,\n\n23\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.110\nand we have some paragraphs in here.\n\n24\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.055\nJust gonna throw on that Show and\nHide Character, just so you can see that\n\n25\n00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:17.505\nthere is a line break right\nhere versus a paragraph.\n\n26\n00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:20.345\nBecause just like I finished saying,\nthat bullets and\n\n27\n00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:22.875\nnumbering are a paragraph-level\nformatting.\n\n28\n00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:26.135\nThat means it's only going\nto create a bullet or\n\n29\n00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:32.085\nnumbering character at each change\nin paragraph, not a change in line.\n\n30\n00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:35.315\nNow these down here,\nyes they're lines, but\n\n31\n00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:38.820\nthey're still paragraphs\nbecause we did that enter.\n\n32\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.010\nAnd knowing whether or not you have\na hard return, an actual paragraph, or\n\n33\n00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.770\na soft return, or a line break,\nthat's going to make a big difference\n\n34\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.880\non where you're going to\nsee bullet characters.\n\n35\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.370\nSo always be careful about that, and\njust always, you probably know by now,\n\n36\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.050\nalways turn that Show and Hide Character\nbutton on, it's very, very important.\n\n37\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.730\nSo, why don't we just go ahead and take\nthese first three paragraphs right here,\n\n38\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.830\nand I'm gonna select them just to\nreally emphasize where does that bullet\n\n39\n00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.500\ncharacter come into play\nwith our paragraphs.\n\n40\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.860\nI have them selected,\nwe're gonna come up here to our Paragraph\n\n41\n00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.930\ngroup on our Home tab,\nclick this little button right here.\n\n42\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.850\nSo these buttons,\n\n43\n00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.299\nwe have the bullets, we have numberings,\nwe'll also talk about multi-level list.\n\n44\n00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.692\nSo I'm just gonna click it and\n\n45\n00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:27.130\nit puts the bullet character in there,\njust like if I have the text selected and\n\n46\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.060\nI wanted to make it bold, or\nI wanted to make it underlined.\n\n47\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.960\nIf you wanna turn off the underline or\nbold, or in this case the bullets,\n\n48\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.080\nyou just click the buttons on and off.\n\n49\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.720\nSo bullets on, bullets off, okay.\n\n50\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.130\nBecause I get a lot of times when\npeople say well I format in bullets but\n\n51\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.800\nI don't know how to undo them.\n\n52\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.530\nI'm like okay, just turn them off, because\nit's just like any type of formatting\n\n53\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.830\nyou can apply and you can unapply.\n\n54\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.005\nIs that the right word?\n\n55\n00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:53.760\n[LAUGH] Disapply?\n\n56\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.875\n&gt;&gt; Apply less.\n\n57\n00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.890\nSo, just not have it happen anymore.\n\n59\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.044\nSo we've got that going on at\nevery different bullet, or sorry,\n\n60\n00:03:03.044 --> 00:03:04.560\nevery paragraph.\n\n61\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.306\nLet's come down here and show you a few\nother ones, because, yes we have,\n\n62\n00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:10.221\nwe can put bullets at each paragraph.\n\n63\n00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:13.546\nLet's go ahead and do that again,\nand this is just a default line.\n\n64\n00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:16.246\nAnd by the way,\nif you're putting your bullets on and\n\n65\n00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:19.246\nyour like it's not doing that\ncute little diamondy thing,\n\n66\n00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:23.326\nthat's because I was playing around with\nthis before and this was the last type of\n\n67\n00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:27.380\nbullet character that I was messing\naround with, within this document.\n\n68\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.660\nLet me just show you really quickly.\n\n69\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.700\nLet me make the File, New,\nlet's just type One, Two,\n\n70\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.200\nThree, if I can type, Four, so\nI've got four paragraphs here.\n\n71\n00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.140\nIf I select these and\n\n72\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.590\nthen click that button, well it's\nstill gonna go ahead and give it.\n\n73\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.620\nI thought it was gonna be\n&gt;&gt;

There you go, awesome.\n\n106\n00:05:13.144 --> 00:05:16.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's like a list,\nthese are actually called nested lists, so\n\n107\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.370\nit's a list within a list.\n\n108\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.130\nCuz if you could say well down\nthe rabbit hole, then pool of tears, and\n\n109\n00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.510\nlet's say this one is like\nunderneath this category.\n\n110\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.580\nSo it's all about your different\nlevels of what we're talking about.\n\n111\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.620\nNow I'm just using random chapters here so\nit doesn't have to necessarily make sense.\n\n112\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.700\n&gt;&gt; Well because I'm 150 years old,\n\n113\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.680\nI remember my teachers they just\ncalled these sub-paragraphs.\n\n114\n00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there you go yeah that works.\n\n115\n00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.780\nSo like right here if One, what's our\nfirst thing that we're going to do?\n\n116\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.740\nAnd then I hit Enter,\nnow I was hitting the Tab\n\n117\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.910\nkey because I honestly think\nthat's the easiest way to do it.\n\n118\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.550\nBut there are buttons up here for\nyou to increase the indent or\n\n119\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.710\ndecrease the indent.\n\n120\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.800\nAnd we did talk about that in our\nparagraph level forming when we were just\n\n121\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.300\ndoing regular indents.\n\n122\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.590\nBut when you have it applied with bulleted\nlists, when you, whoops, wrong way.\n\n123\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.670\nWell if you go ahead and increase\nthe indent, it's indenting in, and so\n\n124\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:16.360\nI could say that this is Topic 1, and then\nEnter, Topic 2, and let's finish that.\n\n125\n00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.460\nAnd then let's say hey, under Topic 2,\nthere needs to be another list in that.\n\n126\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.470\nSo if I hit Enter, it's staying,\n\n127\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.580\nevery time you hit Enter it's gonna\nstay within that same level that\n\n128\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.840\nyou are currently in, within that\nbulleted list, but if I hit Tab again.\n\n129\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.950\nYes, it's going to indent on in and\nthen I could say, I guess this would\n\n130\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.590\nbe Sub sub 1,\nwe really should say Sub-topic.\n\n131\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.550\nSo on and so forth,\nI think you guys get the idea here.\n\n132\n00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.870\nI'm just making an outline\nthat you would do for\n\n133\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.850\nwriting a paper or any of those things.\n\n134\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.110\nNow I'm just using bullets.\n\n135\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.040\n&gt;&gt; Very helpful.\n\n136\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.030\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times when you're doing things\nwith like an outline for, say, a project\n\n137\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.540\nin school, you're probably gonna use like\na 1, then an A, then a Roman numeral.\n\n138\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.470\nWhich we'll come back over in here and\ntalk about these multi-level lists, but\n\n139\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.720\njust a foreshadowing\nthere a little bit there.\n\n140\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.030\nNow if I'm typing,\n\n141\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.980\ncuz a lot of times we might be writing\nout a list as we're typing out.\n\n142\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.840\nI mean, let me back up.\n\n143\n00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.305\nIn a sense, whoops, wrong one.\n\n144\n00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.370\n[LAUGH] This is already typed out,\n\n145\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.550\nright, so I had every single paragraph\nin here and I'm just formatting.\n\n146\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.030\nBut, we don't always think that way.\n\n147\n00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.920\nI think it's a little bit better if we\njust get everything on the paper and\n\n148\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.080\nthen format second,\nthat's the easiest personally.\n\n149\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.430\nBut, to teach, I do it too,\nI start making a list,\n\n150\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.300\nI just start typing, tab, tab, tab, tab.\n\n151\n00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:47.130\nStart thinking okay, now I need to\ncome back out and make a Sub-topic 3.\n\n152\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.430\nI don't need to be in this sub sub, so\n\n153\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.470\nif I hit Enter from here I'm staying\nwithin that same level like I just said.\n\n154\n00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.783\nBut if you can Tab to go in,\nyou can Shift-Tab to get out.\n\n155\n00:07:56.783 --> 00:08:00.976\nHold that Shift key, hit the Tab key,\nand boom, you're out to this level.\n\n156\n00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:03.529\nWhat if I wanted to go\nall the way back out?\n\n157\n00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:05.063\nAnd come to this level.\n\n158\n00:08:05.063 --> 00:08:08.859\nSo as long as I can just keep on holding\nthat Shift key and click, click,\n\n159\n00:08:08.859 --> 00:08:11.978\nclick the tab it'll take you\nall the way back to as far out.\n\n160\n00:08:11.978 --> 00:08:17.894\nAnd we just say this is the main level and\nthen hit Enter, tab in.\n\n161\n00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:21.580\nOops, I just hit Enter twice [LAUGH] and\nit takes you out.\n\n162\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.410\nBut notice I am just using like my\nbackspace key and so on and so forth.\n\n163\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.920\nSo you can come in and out of your levels.\n\n164\n00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.140\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I can tell that you\nmake lists and check them twice.\n\n165\n00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.351\n&gt;&gt; You know, Zach, yes,\nyou should always do that.\n\n166\n00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:34.086\nCheck it and check it twice.\n\n167\n00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:37.792\nBut this is actually a good\nkind of way to say it,\n\n168\n00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:41.200\ncuz I just hit the Enter key twice.\n\n169\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.230\nSo when I hit Enter and then Enter again,\ndo you see what it just did?\n\n170\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.330\nI did not do a Shift+Tab right there.\n\n171\n00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.020\nIt actually cycled me back.\n\n172\n00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.860\nAnd if I hit Enter one more time, it's\ngonna actually take me out of my list.\n\n173\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gone.\n\n174\n00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.560\n&gt;&gt; So it is one way that\nyou can kind of come in and\n\n175\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.450\nout if you just keep hitting\nyour Enter a couple of times.\n\n176\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.150\nCuz I've had people do that as well.\n\n177\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.130\nMe too, where I keep on going, I say five.\n\n178\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.688\nOkay, we'll go with fife.\n\n179\n00:09:07.688 --> 00:09:08.222\n&gt;&gt; Fife.\n\n180\n00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:09.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then more.\n\n181\n00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.820\nAnd then I'm like okay, I'm done.\n\n182\n00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.490\nSo Enter Enter and\nthen I'm out of my list.\n\n183\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.950\nAnd then I can keep on typing my regular\nparagraphs, and so on and so forth.\n\n184\n00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.060\nSo yeah, that double Enter,\ndoing the Enter twice is the same thing.\n\n185\n00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.292\nI tend to just use the Tab and\n\n186\n00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:25.983\nShift+Tab cuz I feel like it's\na little bit more control.\n\n187\n00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:29.940\nYou can always use these buttons\nif you want to add your typing.\n\n188\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.610\nBut I feel like that's\njust more jumping around,\n\n189\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.230\nso-\n&gt;&gt; So nested lists,\n\n190\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.190\nthat's what we're doing here.\n\n191\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.260\nThat's how we create this and\nthat's what we call them.\n\n192\n00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.630\nAnd that's important to remember.\n\n193\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or\n\n194\n00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.740\nyou could say list within a list or\nsubparagraphs, however we wanna say it.\n\n195\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.550\n&gt;&gt; I like the nested list.\n\n196\n00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense.\n\n197\n00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.242\n&gt;&gt; And it's just a whole organization\nof this is under this, under this,\n\n198\n00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:50.866\nunder that.\n\n199\n00:09:50.866 --> 00:09:53.480\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so let's switch over to here.\n\n200\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.298\nAnd I am using my command tilde key in\ncase you're wondering how I'm switching\n\n201\n00:09:58.298 --> 00:10:02.318\nback and forth from open documents\nwithin the same application.\n\n202\n00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:05.480\nThat is a nice little short cut,\nso I like that.\n\n203\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.970\nSo I have these, let's just take these.\n\n204\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.808\nLet's take these here.\n\n205\n00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:12.367\nAnd we'll make just a regular bullet here,\n\n206\n00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:15.418\njust make an extra Enter\njust to separate those out.\n\n207\n00:10:15.418 --> 00:10:16.700\nThat's the only reason I'm doing that.\n\n208\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.680\nIf I take this and select these bullets,\nand I want to make the text,\n\n209\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.100\nI'm selecting the paragraph.\n\n210\n00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.010\nIf I change the color of the font to,\nlet's say green.\n\n211\n00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.210\nIt's also changing,\nlet's change the font size.\n\n212\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.710\nI don't know why it does that.\n\n213\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.580\nThis is like this weird-\n&gt;&gt; I've noticed that too.\n\n214\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.240\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n215\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.025\n&gt;&gt; Like the bottom bullets are smaller.\n\n216\n00:10:39.025 --> 00:10:40.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I don't know why.\n\n217\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.371\nIt's done that to me a couple times.\n\n218\n00:10:42.371 --> 00:10:44.357\nI don't know.\nI'm gonna call this a bug.\n\n219\n00:10:44.357 --> 00:10:46.562\nI'll be completely honest.\n\n220\n00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:50.180\nI don't know exactly what's happening,\nbut it has happened a couple of times.\n\n221\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:50.770\n&gt;&gt; We'll look into it.\n\n222\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n223\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.800\nSo let's just pretend\nthat that last one is-\n\n224\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.610\n&gt;&gt; Just fine.\n\n225\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.570\nIt's a just fine bullet.\n\n226\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.496\n&gt;&gt; But as you can see, when I change\nthe font size and the color of the text,\n\n227\n00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:03.069\nthe bullet character is\ndoing the same thing.\n\n228\n00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:06.923\nBecause it's a paragraph format and\nI'm formatting with a paragraph, so\n\n229\n00:11:06.923 --> 00:11:07.980\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n230\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.360\nBut what if I didn't want\nthe bullets to be green?\n\n231\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.620\nI want the bullets to be orange and\nthe text to be green.\n\n232\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.880\nSo that's something different\n&gt;&gt; That's a trick.\n\n233\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when you're doing your font\nformats it ties together, unless you\n\n234\n00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.390\ncome back into where you can choose\ndifferent types of bullet characters.\n\n235\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.680\nAnd I can go into define new bullets.\n\n236\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.670\nSo we're gonna combine\na couple topics together.\n\n237\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.860\nYes, I can choose some\nof these default ones.\n\n238\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.680\nLike I want check boxes instead of a dot.\n\n239\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.910\nI want a diamond.\n\n240\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.590\nThose are ones.\n\n241\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.430\nBut maybe I want little yin yang signs.\n\n242\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.300\nI want little kitty cats for\nmy bullet characters.\n\n243\n00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.530\n&gt;&gt; Kitty cat.\n&gt;&gt; And I want an orange kitty cat and\n\n244\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.510\na different bullet size\ndifferent than the text.\n\n245\n00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:54.410\nSo all of that combined,\ncome down to Define New Bullet.\n\n246\n00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.740\nThis is where you have font, bullet,\npicture, these three buttons.\n\n247\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.920\nIf I go to bullet this is where I\ncan choose different characters and\n\n248\n00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:12.440\ndifferent fonts that are more symbol\nbased, or like icons rather than text.\n\n249\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.120\nSymbol is a font that will do that.\n\n250\n00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.900\nAnother one are your Webdings,\ngood old Webdings-\n\n251\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.594\n&gt;&gt; Webdings.\n\n252\n00:12:18.594 --> 00:12:20.060\n&gt;&gt; And your Wingdings.\n\n253\n00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:20.600\n&gt;&gt; Wingdings.\n\n254\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.680\n&gt;&gt; So with our Wingdings-\n&gt;&gt; Webding Wingding.\n\n255\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.225\nWe're gonna have a Webding Wingding and\nI mean it right now.\n\n256\n00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:28.377\n[SOUND] Sorry, I'm done, I'm done.\n\n257\n00:12:28.377 --> 00:12:32.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So if I go over here\nto my bullet, what is that?\n\n258\n00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.360\nThat's my yin-yang sign and\n\n259\n00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.980\nI click OK, notice I have changed\nthat particular bullet character.\n\n260\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.680\nThat's step one.\n\n261\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.040\nThe other one is I wanna change\nthat color I come over to the font.\n\n262\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.290\nNow it looks like I'm\nin the font dialog box.\n\n263\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.690\nBut I'm in the bullet character\nfont not my regular type.\n\n264\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.818\nSo if I change this to red,\njust for contrast,\n\n265\n00:12:55.818 --> 00:12:59.120\nnotice that the bullet color's\nchanging red, not the text.\n\n266\n00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.550\nOnce I click OK there we go.\n\n267\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.110\nI have a different character.\n\n268\n00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.697\nI have the text and\nthe bullet character should be\n\n269\n00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:11.330\ndifferent because I formatted them in two\nseparate places, which is a good thing.\n\n270\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.360\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n271\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.810\n&gt;&gt; So now, I've gotten this.\n\n272\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.650\nI like it, but look at how close\nthe text is to the bullet character.\n\n273\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.951\nI don't like that spacing anymore.\n\n274\n00:13:19.951 --> 00:13:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, move it out.\n\n275\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can move it out.\n\n276\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.990\nSo up here, up in these little\ntriangles right there, you see,\n\n277\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:32.730\nthis is where we talked about our indents\nand spacing in the paragraph episode.\n\n278\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.590\nThis first triangle pointing\ndown is the first line indent.\n\n279\n00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.230\nWhen you're talking about this\nwith relationship to bullets,\n\n280\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:43.710\nit still is the first line But this\nstarts to become where the bullet sits.\n\n281\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.714\nNow notice, I took that top triangle and\nI started moving it over.\n\n282\n00:13:46.714 --> 00:13:49.260\nAnd you're like, whoa,\nit just kinda did some jumpy things.\n\n283\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.080\nLet's not worry about that for\n\n284\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.430\nright now because that actually\ntalks about tab-stops.\n\n285\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.890\nJust keep going with me.\n\n286\n00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.880\nThe bottom one,\nthe bottom triangle pointing up,\n\n287\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.510\nthat's the one that we\nreally need to talk about.\n\n288\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.660\nThis is the one where it's going to\ncontrol the space before the text sits\n\n289\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.200\nin relationship to the bullet.\n\n290\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.920\nNow I know in the other episode you said,\ndon't grab that triangle,\n\n291\n00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.745\nalways grab the rectangle.\n\n292\n00:14:14.745 --> 00:14:15.940\nYeah, but now we're in a different place.\n\n293\n00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.560\nSo we have this, so now you see\nthat the space between the text and\n\n294\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.610\nthe bullet character is\na lot further apart.\n\n295\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.650\nAnd that definitely is a big\ndifference when you start getting into\n\n296\n00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.220\nbigger font sizes and\n\n297\n00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.930\nbullet characters that have a little bit\nmore of a width with it, a with with it.\n\n298\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.104\n&gt;&gt; Width, width, width.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's hard [LAUGH].\n\n299\n00:14:36.104 --> 00:14:37.277\n&gt;&gt; So I take this.\n\n300\n00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:42.036\nAnd then so just to show you again,\nif I take those paragraphs, notice here,\n\n301\n00:14:42.036 --> 00:14:44.922\nthat's gonna change\nthe spacing of the text.\n\n302\n00:14:44.922 --> 00:14:47.655\nThis is gonna change\nwhere the bullet sits.\n\n303\n00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:50.295\nSo the two triangles, tops and bottoms,\n\n304\n00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:55.125\nis where you can control your spacing\nwith your bullets, which is pretty cool.\n\n305\n00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:56.745\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, Vonne, the options are unlimited.\n\n306\n00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:59.405\nI mean, there's so\nmany different changes you can make.\n\n307\n00:14:59.405 --> 00:15:00.565\nIt's so customizable.\n\n308\n00:15:00.565 --> 00:15:02.385\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, so it's a good thing.\n\n309\n00:15:02.385 --> 00:15:05.580\nNow I'm spending a lot of\ntime on these bullets because\n\n310\n00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.400\nthe numbers are gonna be\npretty much the same.\n\n311\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.710\nThe same way you're doing your bullets.\n\n312\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:15.222\nAnd the other thing with numbers is like\nhow many different ways can you say one,\n\n313\n00:15:15.222 --> 00:15:18.032\ntwo, three, four, five, six [LAUGH].\n\n314\n00:15:18.032 --> 00:15:19.568\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]\n&gt;&gt; That is true, yes,\n\n315\n00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:21.454\nif we're saying it out loud.\n\n316\n00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:23.940\nBut you have Roman numerals, ABC's.\n\n317\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.690\nSo there's not as many variations,\nI would say, with it.\n\n318\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.770\nBut you still can get there.\n\n319\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.040\nAnyways, let's keep on\ngoing because if you all\n\n320\n00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.710\nnoticed there was that little\nbishop as a bullet character.\n\n321\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Because you can go over\nhere to the Find New Bullets.\n\n322\n00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.450\nAnd notice that I did have a picture\nhere because I clicked on picture.\n\n323\n00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.805\nIt takes you out to this default.\n\n324\n00:15:46.805 --> 00:15:49.568\nLook, I'm way down in my bullets folder,\nin my resources.\n\n325\n00:15:49.568 --> 00:15:53.075\nIf I move over, okay,\nI'm pretty far over into this cuz I'm in\n\n326\n00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:55.663\nmy resources files\nwithin Microsoft Office.\n\n327\n00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:56.299\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n328\n00:15:56.299 --> 00:16:00.763\n&gt;&gt; So it is pulling some of the other\nones that you do find by default in\n\n329\n00:16:00.763 --> 00:16:02.072\nMicrosoft for PC.\n\n330\n00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:03.938\nAnd so that's why you have\nsome of these pictures.\n\n331\n00:16:03.938 --> 00:16:05.158\nBut you don't have to pick these.\n\n332\n00:16:05.158 --> 00:16:07.944\nI just went out to my Desktop,\nI went to my Images.\n\n333\n00:16:07.944 --> 00:16:10.700\nAnd I basically here, let's bring in Mr.\nFuego, all right?\n\n334\n00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.102\nSo now when I take in\nmy picture of Fuego and\n\n335\n00:16:14.102 --> 00:16:18.584\nclick Insert,\nnotice that it's a bullet character.\n\n336\n00:16:18.584 --> 00:16:23.495\nIt's gonna be really hard to see\nthe actual photograph of Fuego in a top\n\n337\n00:16:23.495 --> 00:16:25.753\nhat because it's a tiny piece.\n\n338\n00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:26.534\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, tiny, tiny.\n\n339\n00:16:26.534 --> 00:16:29.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can go ahead and\nuse your own pictures.\n\n340\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.750\nI don't know,\nif you're using a regular photograph,\n\n341\n00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.600\nmight not give you the results\nyou might be looking for.\n\n342\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.028\nSo you might wanna stay with,\nif it's a photograph,\n\n343\n00:16:40.028 --> 00:16:43.905\nsomething kind of easy or-\n&gt;&gt; The picture of an eye, an eye ball?\n\n344\n00:16:43.905 --> 00:16:47.577\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that could work,\nthat might actually give you some more\n\n345\n00:16:47.577 --> 00:16:50.507\nrepresentation of what's\nit really looks like.\n\n346\n00:16:50.507 --> 00:16:52.454\nBut that beach ball,\n\n347\n00:16:52.454 --> 00:16:58.518\nthat's kind of an old iconic word\npicture one from back in the day.\n\n348\n00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.161\nSo that's why I was it ws like, and\n\n349\n00:17:00.161 --> 00:17:02.563\nthen it looks really\npixelated at least on my end.\n\n350\n00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:05.114\nActually not so\nbad [LAUGH] on the other screens.\n\n351\n00:17:05.114 --> 00:17:08.395\nBut it does look really pixelated,\ncuz it's not really smooth.\n\n352\n00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:09.015\n&gt;&gt; A little pixilated, yeah.\n\n353\n00:17:09.015 --> 00:17:10.959\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we got going on there.\n\n354\n00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:16.509\nSo now let's go over to the numbering,\nand so I've got all of these.\n\n355\n00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:18.352\nLet's take these guys right here now.\n\n356\n00:17:18.352 --> 00:17:20.386\nYes, I have words to say two,\nthree, four, but\n\n357\n00:17:20.386 --> 00:17:22.783\nthose, remember I was just\nphysically typing in words.\n\n358\n00:17:22.783 --> 00:17:26.011\nIf I wanted this to be instead of bullets,\nI wanted them to be numbers,\n\n359\n00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.778\nthen you just hit the numbers button.\n\n360\n00:17:27.778 --> 00:17:29.814\nAnd then there you go, one,\ntwo, three, four, five.\n\n361\n00:17:29.814 --> 00:17:35.511\nThe cool thing about using a numbers\nlist is what if I decided okay,\n\n362\n00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:40.230\nI have one, two,\nthis one right here is out of sort.\n\n363\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.261\nIf I take this, and notice I'm not\nactually selecting the bullet or\n\n364\n00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:45.827\nthe number in character.\n\n365\n00:17:45.827 --> 00:17:48.055\nIf I hit the Delete key, and I keep going,\n\n366\n00:17:48.055 --> 00:17:50.683\nyou see it actually change\nthe numbering for me.\n\n367\n00:17:50.683 --> 00:17:55.383\nSo that's the reason why you want to use\nnumbers as opposed to you physically\n\n368\n00:17:55.383 --> 00:17:57.009\ntyping one period space.\n\n369\n00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:01.315\nBecause it's going to remember,\nif you start adding paragraphs in between.\n\n370\n00:18:01.315 --> 00:18:04.544\nIf I hit Enter here,\nnotice it rechanges the numbers.\n\n371\n00:18:04.544 --> 00:18:06.953\nSo I can just type in more stuff,\ntype in more stuff.\n\n372\n00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:09.522\nOkay, no, I don't need that one,\nchange the numbering.\n\n373\n00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:12.435\nLet's take this one off,\nso on and so forth.\n\n374\n00:18:12.435 --> 00:18:16.633\nSo it's really nice to go ahead and\nformat your paragraphs with bullets or\n\n375\n00:18:16.633 --> 00:18:20.710\nwith sorry, with a numbered list\nbecause it keeps the order of things.\n\n376\n00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.031\nBut if you don't want them to be one,\ntwo, three, four, five,\n\n377\n00:18:25.031 --> 00:18:29.069\ndrop these down, you have your ABCs in\ndifferent ways that they're formatted.\n\n378\n00:18:29.069 --> 00:18:33.849\nWhether it's with a period or with\nthe parentheses over there, lowercase,\n\n379\n00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:35.771\nuppercase, roman numerals.\n\n380\n00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:38.387\nYou can go in to find a new number format,\nso\n\n381\n00:18:38.387 --> 00:18:42.407\nlet's click on this just like we\ndid with our bullet characters.\n\n382\n00:18:42.407 --> 00:18:44.597\nNow, you're not gonna get\ninto Webdings and Wingdings,\n\n383\n00:18:44.597 --> 00:18:46.796\ncuz they're be there in bullets,\nthey're not numbers.\n\n384\n00:18:46.796 --> 00:18:51.286\nAnd notice here that they do have\na couple like first, second, third.\n\n385\n00:18:51.286 --> 00:18:54.197\nAnd that's what I was saying, how many\nways could you change the numbering?\n\n386\n00:18:54.197 --> 00:18:59.578\nWell you could do some serial\nnumbers in here, like the 001, 002.\n\n387\n00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:00.147\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n388\n00:19:00.147 --> 00:19:03.122\n&gt;&gt; Depending on how you want to do that,\nfirst, second, third.\n\n389\n00:19:03.122 --> 00:19:05.123\nBut those are the ones you\nprobably wanna stick with this.\n\n390\n00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:10.622\nYou could make a new on if you wanted to,\nbut you ought to just stick with these.\n\n391\n00:19:10.622 --> 00:19:14.505\nBut you gotta also say where do you\nwant the number lettering to start.\n\n392\n00:19:14.505 --> 00:19:17.002\nSo that's something you might wanna do,\nand\n\n393\n00:19:17.002 --> 00:19:21.222\nthis was also in defining our bulleted\nlist, where it has a text positions.\n\n394\n00:19:21.222 --> 00:19:24.621\nYou can totally do this by typing them in,\nI was showing you how to,\n\n395\n00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:27.317\nI'm gonna click Cancel,\nhow to do it on the ribbon.\n\n396\n00:19:27.317 --> 00:19:32.111\nI think it's easier to have it visually\nrather than trying to do it numerically.\n\n397\n00:19:32.111 --> 00:19:35.644\nBut you can type in those\ndifferent like indents and\n\n398\n00:19:35.644 --> 00:19:40.425\nwhere the bullet starts within\nthose defined bullets dialog boxes.\n\n399\n00:19:40.425 --> 00:19:44.296\nI just feels it's a little\nbit easier the other way.\n\n400\n00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:48.444\nNow to move on to our Multilevel Lists.\n\n401\n00:19:48.444 --> 00:19:49.243\nThe Multilevel list,\n\n402\n00:19:49.243 --> 00:19:51.691\nthis is the one we were just talking\nabout with the outlines, right?\n\n403\n00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:56.291\nI remember, I always have to regress\nback into middle school days.\n\n404\n00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:58.670\nBut you'd always have to go ahead\nlike this is your outline and\n\n405\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.068\nthis is your main topic and\nthese are your supporting topics.\n\n406\n00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:01.902\n&gt;&gt; Three basic topics.\n\n407\n00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:02.649\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n408\n00:20:02.649 --> 00:20:04.637\n&gt;&gt; Right up front, and\nthen tell about them.\n\n409\n00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:06.798\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely,\n\n410\n00:20:06.798 --> 00:20:09.945\nthat was something you always had\nto deal with about writing a paper.\n\n411\n00:20:09.945 --> 00:20:10.581\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n412\n00:20:10.581 --> 00:20:12.840\n&gt;&gt; So the same way, if I went ahead and\nselect this at this point,\n\n413\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.801\nyou're like that doesn't\nlook too much different.\n\n414\n00:20:14.801 --> 00:20:18.070\nIt's when you start doing your\nMultilevels or your indents and\n\n415\n00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.114\noutdents of where it starts changing.\n\n416\n00:20:20.114 --> 00:20:25.009\nSo if I hit Enter and hit the Tab key,\nnotice how that went from a 2 to a a and\n\n417\n00:20:25.009 --> 00:20:27.512\nthen all the other numbers changed.\n\n418\n00:20:27.512 --> 00:20:31.076\nSo I type in something here,\nEnter, Tab again, and\n\n419\n00:20:31.076 --> 00:20:33.347\nnow it makes that Roman number i.\n\n420\n00:20:33.347 --> 00:20:38.624\nSo that's like a common format of 1,\na, i, and then oops, sorry, let's Tab.\n\n421\n00:20:38.624 --> 00:20:42.178\nAnd then it goes back to a one with\na double parentheses around it.\n\n422\n00:20:42.178 --> 00:20:46.309\nSo this is a common use\nof Multilevel Lists, and\n\n423\n00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:49.834\nyou can go, so on and so forth like that.\n\n424\n00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:54.954\nAnd use your indents and outdents for how\nyou need to change them, and reformatting.\n\n425\n00:20:54.954 --> 00:20:57.078\nMaybe this needs to come back out.\n\n426\n00:20:57.078 --> 00:21:00.700\nClick your cursor in the paragraph,\nhit your Shit+Tab key.\n\n427\n00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.832\nAnd then you can change it, and\neverything's gonna go ahead and\n\n428\n00:21:03.832 --> 00:21:05.863\nfollow down through, very, very nice.\n\n429\n00:21:05.863 --> 00:21:10.705\nOne thing to notice,\nthat if you take any of your lists,\n\n430\n00:21:10.705 --> 00:21:13.809\nand they are Multilevel like this.\n\n431\n00:21:13.809 --> 00:21:15.458\nIf you select this and\n\n432\n00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:20.506\nthen turn them off like I don't\nwant this to be numbered anymore.\n\n433\n00:21:20.506 --> 00:21:23.232\nNotice that the indents are gonna stay,\n\n434\n00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:28.215\nthey don't go back to being like\na perfectly left justified paragraph.\n\n435\n00:21:28.215 --> 00:21:33.107\nIt remembers that you hit the Tab key,\nso it's gonna tab in and\n\n436\n00:21:33.107 --> 00:21:35.376\nremember that you did that.\n\n437\n00:21:35.376 --> 00:21:39.801\nOkay, now it doesn't show a tab character,\nso I don't want to confuse it with that.\n\n438\n00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:43.481\nThat's why I wanted to turn on this Hide\nCharacters, it's there is no tab there.\n\n439\n00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:45.955\nI hit the Tab key, but it didn't do it.\n\n440\n00:21:45.955 --> 00:21:51.512\nIt didn't make a character, but it does\nremember the indent levels that it did.\n\n441\n00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:55.894\nSo same thing here, if I took this and\nalso like well is this a Bulleted,\n\n442\n00:21:55.894 --> 00:21:59.445\na Multilevel, just click\nwhatever button and turn it off.\n\n443\n00:21:59.445 --> 00:22:04.068\nNotice that it stays in that level,\nso if you needed to bring\n\n444\n00:22:04.068 --> 00:22:09.540\neverything back out to perfectly\nflush against your left margin.\n\n445\n00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.660\nYou are gonna need to come into here\neven though it's kind of ghost and\n\n446\n00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.640\nyou're like everything is over there,\nbut it's not.\n\n447\n00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.412\nJust click this, and you see how as soon\nas I click those triangles to line up.\n\n448\n00:22:19.412 --> 00:22:24.038\nThat becomes where all my indent levels\nare gonna and everything's back to zero.\n\n449\n00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:29.448\nSo unformatting your Bulleted list\ncan be a little weird sometimes\n\n450\n00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:35.445\nof how it uses the different Multilevels,\nso just be careful about that.\n\n451\n00:22:35.445 --> 00:22:40.981\nAnd then the last thing I'd like to show\nis the continuing of your numbering,\n\n452\n00:22:40.981 --> 00:22:42.610\nthat's kind of nice.\n\n453\n00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.784\nLet's select all of this, I'm gonna\ndelete everything to start from scratch.\n\n454\n00:22:46.784 --> 00:22:50.196\nLet's go ahead and say Hello, Goodbye.\n\n455\n00:22:50.196 --> 00:22:51.331\n[LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:22:51.331 --> 00:22:52.240\n&gt;&gt;

Good, we can continue on with that.\n\n461\n00:22:56.953 --> 00:23:00.769\nSo I'll select these two and I'll make\nthese 1 2, cuz that's what I want.\n\n462\n00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:04.714\nI hit Enter twice to stop the numbering,\n\n463\n00:23:04.714 --> 00:23:09.230\nmaybe I'll say like Normal text here.\n\n464\n00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.984\nAnd then I want to hit Enter, and\nthen I want to start numbering again.\n\n465\n00:23:12.984 --> 00:23:15.879\nSo if I go ahead and say, what do we say?\n\n466\n00:23:15.879 --> 00:23:16.575\n&gt;&gt; How are you?\n\n467\n00:23:16.575 --> 00:23:17.230\n&gt;&gt; How are you?\n\n468\n00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.532\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, good to see you.\n\n469\n00:23:21.532 --> 00:23:23.240\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n470\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.902\n&gt;&gt; If I select those,\ncome back up to numbering.\n\n471\n00:23:25.902 --> 00:23:29.952\nNotice it's going back to 1,\n2, but I don't want that.\n\n472\n00:23:29.952 --> 00:23:31.112\nThe smart tag.\n\n473\n00:23:31.112 --> 00:23:34.603\nSo good, 1 2, Normal text here.\n\n474\n00:23:34.603 --> 00:23:37.752\n1, 2, now continue numbering.\n\n475\n00:23:37.752 --> 00:23:38.882\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so cool.\n\n476\n00:23:38.882 --> 00:23:39.901\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's nice.\n\n477\n00:23:39.901 --> 00:23:40.840\nSo that's-\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n478\n00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.835\n&gt;&gt; Where I can say continue numbering-\n&gt;&gt; That worked out well.\n\n479\n00:23:43.835 --> 00:23:47.321\n&gt;&gt; And it keeps on going, and that's nice\nbecause what if I came back up here and\n\n480\n00:23:47.321 --> 00:23:47.928\nI hit Enter?\n\n481\n00:23:47.928 --> 00:23:50.292\nNotice that my numbering re-numbers,\n\n482\n00:23:50.292 --> 00:23:53.423\nthere are times where you\ndon't want that to happen.\n\n483\n00:23:53.423 --> 00:23:55.238\nI want 1, 2 paragraphs.\n\n484\n00:23:55.238 --> 00:23:58.953\n1, 2 then just ignore the smart tag.\n\n485\n00:23:58.953 --> 00:24:00.223\n&gt;&gt; The smart tag, yeah.\n\n486\n00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:01.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't need to answer it.\n\n487\n00:24:01.725 --> 00:24:06.830\nYou don't need to say that's okay,\njust stop and ignore and keep on going.\n\n488\n00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:11.766\nCuz I do a lot of step by step tutorials,\nand a lot of times I need to\n\n489\n00:24:11.766 --> 00:24:16.443\nput in a little note or something,\nbut I wanna keep my steps.\n\n490\n00:24:16.443 --> 00:24:21.933\nI used this continue numbering quite\nfrequently, and it's pretty, pretty nice.\n\n491\n00:24:21.933 --> 00:24:22.900\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n492\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.384\n&gt;&gt; So I wanted to let you know that, and\nyou know I did forget one little thing.\n\n493\n00:24:25.384 --> 00:24:26.812\n&gt;&gt; Neat trick.\n\n494\n00:24:26.812 --> 00:24:29.155\n&gt;&gt; That I'd like to do, all I did was,\n\n495\n00:24:29.155 --> 00:24:33.152\nnotice I formatted this with\nbullets then I unformatted it.\n\n496\n00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:36.796\nIt's kind of like,\nit's a little trick to like just stop it,\n\n497\n00:24:36.796 --> 00:24:38.981\ncuz it was numbered and renumbered.\n\n498\n00:24:38.981 --> 00:24:42.665\nI wanted all my paragraphs just to\nbe back the way that they were.\n\n499\n00:24:42.665 --> 00:24:45.050\nLet's go ahead and\napply a bullet right here.\n\n500\n00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.780\nBecause I was showing you that you\ncould select the paragraphs and\n\n501\n00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.150\nyour bullets don't get selected.\n\n502\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.075\nIt doesn't happen,\nthe bullet is part of the paragraph.\n\n503\n00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:56.132\nSo if you've got that paragraph,\nyou're gonna change it.\n\n504\n00:24:56.132 --> 00:24:59.121\nWe talked about this when we were\nchanging the font color and the size.\n\n505\n00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:04.070\nBut you can,\nif I click on the bullet character itself.\n\n506\n00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:09.060\nNotice how it grays all of the bullets\nwithin these paragraphs even though like\n\n507\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.563\nthat first one is probably hard to see.\n\n508\n00:25:11.563 --> 00:25:15.181\nThat first one has got like\nthe blue selection highlight and\n\n509\n00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:16.997\nthe rest of them are all gray.\n\n510\n00:25:16.997 --> 00:25:20.300\nAnd it doesn't maybe feel like you\nhave all the bullets selected.\n\n511\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.526\nBut I could change the bullet\ncharacter right from here.\n\n512\n00:25:23.526 --> 00:25:27.829\nAnd just skip that whole dialog box\nthat I had gone to from down in here.\n\n513\n00:25:27.829 --> 00:25:32.420\nSelect the bullets,\ncome into like the purple.\n\n514\n00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.857\nAnd you see how that is\nchanging the bullet formating,\n\n515\n00:25:36.857 --> 00:25:40.341\nnot the paired after the text formatting.\n\n516\n00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:44.064\nSo that's a cute little trick in case\nyou dont wanna have to go down in here.\n\n517\n00:25:44.064 --> 00:25:48.112\nSelecting the text versus\nselecting the bullet character.\n\n518\n00:25:48.112 --> 00:25:48.837\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n519\n00:25:48.837 --> 00:25:51.262\n&gt;&gt; And doing the formatting from there.\n\n520\n00:25:51.262 --> 00:25:55.516\nSo it's just kind of coming back around\nto where we had done the formatting of\n\n521\n00:25:55.516 --> 00:25:58.055\nthe bullets and\nnumbering in the dialog box.\n\n522\n00:25:58.055 --> 00:26:02.888\nJust do it right here, and I believe,\nif I'm looking at my list right now of my-\n\n523\n00:26:02.888 --> 00:26:03.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n524\n00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:04.794\n&gt;&gt; Notes, I think I've covered\n\n525\n00:26:04.794 --> 00:26:06.319\neverything that I needed to cover.\n\n526\n00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:07.141\n&gt;&gt; Great job, Vonne.\n\n527\n00:26:07.141 --> 00:26:11.026\nWonderful episode, and\nthis is Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n528\n00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:15.341\nYou wanna make sure you watch every single\nepisode of Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n529\n00:26:15.341 --> 00:26:18.462\nYou'll be glad you did, help you with\nexams and it's good for your mind.\n\n530\n00:26:18.462 --> 00:26:21.800\nAnd make sure you visit our course\nlibrary, it's hundreds of videos there.\n\n531\n00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.638\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n532\n00:26:24.638 --> 00:26:27.227\nAnd make sure you tell everybody\nyou know about OfficeProTV.\n\n533\n00:26:27.227 --> 00:26:28.837\nThey'll be glad you did,\nthanks for watching.\n\n534\n00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:29.676\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n535\n00:26:29.676 --> 00:26:30.361\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:15.571\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:21.010\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, and\nthis is Word 2016, Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.990\nTabs, I'm gonna hover on that, tabs.\n\n6\n00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.260\nAnd who's gonna teach us and\nshow us the way?\n\n7\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.020\nIt is Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.480\nVonne, so nice to have you back.\n\n9\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.300\nThank you so much.\n\n10\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.128\n&gt;&gt; I really like the way\nyou just introduced that,\n\n11\n00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:36.925\n[LAUGH] because tabs are very\nmuch like that, God, tabs.\n\n12\n00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some people kinda get a little scared\n\n13\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.740\nwhen they start talking about tabs,\ncuz I think it's cuz they\n\n14\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.930\ndon't really understand them, and they\ndon't really know how to work with them.\n\n15\n00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.524\nAnd what can I do to make it\nactually line up all the right way?\n\n16\n00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:51.290\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna do it Vonne,\nI know you are.\n\n17\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.822\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you introduced it a little\nbit with that ominous characteristic.\n\n18\n00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:56.559\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This kinda has that.\n\n19\n00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.180\nThat's okay, like you said, I'm here\nto help you really understand tabs.\n\n20\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.793\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n21\n00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:03.637\n&gt;&gt; I love tab stops.\n\n22\n00:01:03.637 --> 00:01:05.470\nI love formatting tabs.\n\n23\n00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.740\nI think they're so much fun.\n\n24\n00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.630\n&gt;&gt; Really useful.\n\n25\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.790\n&gt;&gt; But I didn't like them at first, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.755\nI was like, no these things,\ncuz I didn't understand it.\n\n27\n00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:16.537\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't understand how they worked, so\n\n28\n00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:18.207\nI just cursed at them a lot.\n\n29\n00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:19.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.350\n&gt;&gt; But now that I know what they do and\n\n31\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.320\nhow to format them,\nI've really kind of adapted them and\n\n32\n00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.487\nlove to teach people about tab stops.\n\n33\n00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.339\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n34\n00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:33.710\n&gt;&gt; So I have a file that I've got open\nright now called tabs, I know, crazy.\n\n35\n00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.945\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I don't believe it.\n\n36\n00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:36.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense.\n\n37\n00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.880\n&gt;&gt; Nope, not at all.\n\n38\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.747\n&gt;&gt; Stop.\n\n39\n00:01:38.747 --> 00:01:40.923\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we have some here.\n\n40\n00:01:40.923 --> 00:01:44.280\nAnd this is just giving me\nsomething to get us started with.\n\n41\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.460\nAnd we have talked about default\ntab stops in some other episodes,\n\n42\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.610\ncuz it's one of those things\nwhen we're stating to type.\n\n43\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.810\nWhat does it mean when\nyou hit the tab key?\n\n44\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.750\nIt is not that you go over five spaces.\n\n45\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.520\nYes, in the olden days with typewriters,\nit did have a fixed amount of space that\n\n46\n00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.830\nany time no matter where you hit the tab\nit's gonna go over that many spaces.\n\n47\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n48\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.205\n&gt;&gt; Totally fine, but\nthat was the old days.\n\n49\n00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:11.130\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; This is the virtual days.\n\n50\n00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.024\nI don't know where I'm\ngoing with this [LAUGH].\n\n51\n00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:13.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways,\n\n52\n00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.660\nit doesn't work that way because how tabs\nword in Word is it's going to stop on\n\n53\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.150\nevery half inch on the ruler.\n\n54\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.070\nSo having this ruler up is going\nto be very important when we're\n\n55\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.240\nformatting tab stops.\n\n56\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.470\nAnd just to remind you, that's on that\nview tab and you go over to that ruler.\n\n57\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.490\n&gt;&gt; So this is very much like\nthe tabs that used to be on the old\n\n58\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.520\ntypewriters if people might remember them.\n\n59\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.775\nI know I do cuz I'm 150 years old.\n\n60\n00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:38.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But this is a digital version of\n\n61\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.080\nit, isn't it?\n\n62\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.160\nIf you will.\n\n63\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think, if I can remember,\n\n64\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.575\ncuz I do have memories of typing on\nthe typewriter when I was a child.\n\n65\n00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:47.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; There are these little\n\n66\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.290\nbuttons that you would move, right?\n\n67\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.138\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nThey're little sliders and\n\n68\n00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:53.188\nyou'd slide them over to\nwherever you wanted to stop at.\n\n69\n00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:54.558\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And it would stop.\n\n70\n00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:56.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It was automatic.\n\n71\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.240\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we're doing here,\nZach.\n\n72\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.740\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n73\n00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay, wonderful.\n\n74\n00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.328\n&gt;&gt; So you can relate!\n\n75\n00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:01.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can.\n\n76\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.710\n&gt;&gt; So yes, that's definitely how it works.\n\n77\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.098\nBut the default, like I said,\nis every half inch on the ruler.\n\n78\n00:03:07.098 --> 00:03:12.110\nBut we wanna take those sliders and say\nhey, instead of doing what you normally\n\n79\n00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.290\ndo and stopping on that half inch mark,\nI want you when you hit the tab or\n\n80\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.290\nsee a tab character to go to\nthis particular space and stop.\n\n81\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.350\nAnd then I'm going to tell you how to\nalign yourself at that stopping point\n\n82\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.410\nwhether you left justify, or\nleft align, center align, right align.\n\n83\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.865\nOr if I'm working with decimal points,\nI want to line up the decimal points.\n\n84\n00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:36.220\nSo lots of cool stuff that you can do.\n\n85\n00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Awesome\n&gt;&gt; Definitely have your ruler on,\n\n86\n00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.020\nthat's one.\n\n87\n00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.340\nGo back over to your home tab,\nturn on your show high characters,\n\n88\n00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.919\nbecause I did this on purpose.\n\n89\n00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.750\nCuz tabs can be kind of sneaky in there.\n\n90\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.230\nWe said that every half inch on the ruler,\nso\n\n91\n00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.265\nyou can see that on\nthe ruler there's the stop.\n\n92\n00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:57.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; There's that one.\n\n93\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; There's another one.\n\n94\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.346\nThere is another tab in here,\nyou just don't see it.\n\n95\n00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:06.454\n&gt;&gt; Very very tricky.\n\n96\n00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:09.496\nSo right in here,\nnotice it looks like a space.\n\n97\n00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:14.266\nBut if I select this text just to make\nit a little bit bigger, there you go.\n\n98\n00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:15.770\nThey can lurk in there.\n\n99\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.450\n&gt;&gt; He's lurking.\n\n100\n00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and where you can't really see it,\nbut it is doing the formatting.\n\n101\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.840\nAnd it was stopping on the next half inch.\n\n102\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.100\nBut it is so right up next to where\nthe half inch was in the ruler\n\n103\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.500\nthat you didn't even see any\nof the physical space, and\n\n104\n00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.430\nyou didn't even see the special\ncharacter with that show hide item.\n\n105\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.780\nAnd I've had this happen to me.\n\n106\n00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.410\nI was like, why is this text moving\naround the way it's doing it?\n\n107\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.750\nIt's because there's usually really\nsneaky, hidden tabs in there.\n\n108\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.730\nAnd just know that's something\nyou need to always look for\n\n109\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.370\nwhen you're looking at your text.\n\n110\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.290\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we've got on these,\n\n111\n00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.880\nnotice that this is a paragraph and\nI don't have anything on this ruler.\n\n112\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.020\nJust giving you something to look for\nin a little bit.\n\n113\n00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.870\nBecause how you're going to move those\nsliders that you were talking about.\n\n114\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Like on the old typewriters.\n\n115\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.290\nYou're gonna have to use this\nruler to tell it where that\n\n116\n00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.640\nslider if you wanna say needs to stop.\n\n117\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.750\nSo right here, I have this particular\nparagraph of use the ruler.\n\n118\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.590\nAnd I have a tab character right there,\nI hit the tab key.\n\n119\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.450\nI don't want it to stop here.\n\n120\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.270\nI want it to stop way out here.\n\n121\n00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.570\nIt's very small and\nI can't really zoom in on it\n\n122\n00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.150\nbecause I don't have that functionality\non my computer right this moment.\n\n123\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.130\nBut in the top left hand corner\nwhere the two rulers intersect,\n\n124\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.780\nthere's a very small little button up\nthere that looks like there's like\n\n125\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.120\na little arrow going this way.\n\n126\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.870\nAnd if I single click on it, all I'm doing\nis I am cycling through that little thing.\n\n127\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.435\nAnd do you see, it's very small.\n\n128\n00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:48.110\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So I know you guys can\n\n129\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.950\nhopefully see it.\n\n130\n00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.730\nSo let me go ahead and [INAUDIBLE].\n\n131\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.898\nRight there.\nYou can see it moving around.\n\n132\n00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:53.611\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n133\n00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:54.450\n&gt;&gt; In there.\n\n134\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.300\nAll I'm doing when I'm clicking on\nthis is I'm basically telling what\n\n135\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.340\ntype of tab stop I want.\n\n136\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.720\nNotice, nothing's on the ruler right now,\nright?\n\n137\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.050\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; I have not put the tab on the ruler.\n\n138\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.960\nI'm just getting to where\nI want it to be aligned.\n\n139\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.490\nAnd if I hover and stop for a minute,\nit should bring up a tool tip,\n\n140\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.660\nit doesn't want to.\n\n141\n00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.490\nOkay, that's all right.\n\n142\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.790\nThat is a left align tab stop.\n\n143\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.634\nThat's a decimal tab stop,\nthat's a bar stop.\n\n144\n00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:21.115\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Totally different than maybe what you\n\n145\n00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:22.499\nthink about in college.\n\n146\n00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:24.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But then there's that.\n\n147\n00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.160\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there.\n\n148\n00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.460\n&gt;&gt; I know, I like that joke.\n\n149\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.140\nSorry.\n\n150\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.770\nSo you've got the left tab\nof where if I cycle through,\n\n151\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.350\nfind the one I want to add on the ruler,\nclick on the ruler.\n\n152\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.900\nLook at where that tab has stopped.\n\n153\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.690\nI told it,\ndon't go to your default position.\n\n154\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I told it to go here, and it's really\n\n155\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.340\ntiny, and that's where tabs, you've got to\nbe very precise as to what you're doing.\n\n156\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.480\nSo, all I did was I click through\nwhat type of tab stop I want.\n\n157\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.790\nClicked on the ruler, and\n\n158\n00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.640\nbecause there was a tab character\nin there, it went ahead and jumped.\n\n159\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.630\nNow once you have this tab stop on\nthe ruler, notice I can click and hold.\n\n160\n00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:13.550\nAnd I can drag this to move the tab stop,\ncuz maybe I want it to move over to there.\n\n161\n00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.030\nMaybe I wanted to move over here.\n\n162\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.530\nBut notice if I moved, oops,\nthere, about right there.\n\n163\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.550\nSo you have an x,\n\n164\n00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.170\ncuz that's the other way that you\ncan actually remove the tab stops.\n\n165\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.610\nMoving it left and right, let go.\n\n166\n00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.780\nDon't want that any more?\n\n167\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.760\nLet's not have that tab stop any more?\n\n168\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.350\nClick hold, drag down off the ruler,\n\n169\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.320\nkinda like taking the magnet\noff the refrigerator.\n\n170\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.690\nAnd bloop.\n\n171\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.830\nI do like a little graphic thing.\n\n172\n00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.135\n&gt;&gt; The bloop, I like the bloop, yeah.\n\n173\n00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:37.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it comes off, and\n\n174\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.960\nthen where does your tab stop back at?\n\n175\n00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.160\nYour default tab position.\n\n176\n00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.290\nSo that's how it works.\n\n177\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.370\nTabs are paragraph level formatting,\nwhich means if I chose this one here,\n\n178\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.110\nit's not gonna change this paragraph.\n\n179\n00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.480\nNotice no tabs stops here.\n\n180\n00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.580\nSo each paragraph can have\na different set of tabs\n\n181\n00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.485\nstops that you're overriding the defaults.\n\n182\n00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:01.758\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n183\n00:08:01.758 --> 00:08:06.140\nSo let's come down here to\nsomething such as this.\n\n184\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.604\nLet's do this, let's go Name,\n\n185\n00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:13.935\nRegarding, and we'll type Name, tab,\n\n186\n00:08:13.935 --> 00:08:18.778\nand we'll say Vonne, Regarding OfficePro.\n\n187\n00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:22.383\nNotice each one of them has a single tab,\nbut\n\n188\n00:08:22.383 --> 00:08:28.260\nbecause of the length of the text\nit's stopping in different places.\n\n189\n00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.947\nI want these to be lined up.\n\n190\n00:08:29.947 --> 00:08:32.476\nNormally people would just go and\ndo double tabs.\n\n191\n00:08:32.476 --> 00:08:33.499\nNo, don't do that.\n\n192\n00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:34.405\nDon't do that.\n\n193\n00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:35.091\nBad.\n\n194\n00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:35.694\n&gt;&gt; Bad.\n\n195\n00:08:35.694 --> 00:08:36.472\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's okay.\n\n196\n00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:37.910\n&gt;&gt; Bad, bad, bad.\n\n197\n00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.640\n&gt;&gt; It's just an easier way to do this.\n\n198\n00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.360\nI want to format both of these tabs\nto stop at a certain position.\n\n199\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.064\nSo we select the text,\nI have the left align tab stop here,\n\n200\n00:08:49.064 --> 00:08:54.537\nready to go, and if I didn't,\nI would just click to cycle through.\n\n201\n00:08:54.537 --> 00:08:59.090\nOops, one more, and\nthen I click once towards the bottom,\n\n202\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:04.390\nnot too far down, right there, and\nthen, I've got it all aligned.\n\n203\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:09.321\nSo that single tab stop can go ahead and\nline up to where I want it to be,\n\n204\n00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:10.437\nwhich is nice.\n\n205\n00:09:10.437 --> 00:09:14.424\nNow just like any type of formatting,\nif I come to the end of this\n\n206\n00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:19.466\nRegarding OfficePro paragraph, and\nI hit enter, that tab stop is gonna stay,\n\n207\n00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:24.003\nbecause it's continuing on the formatting\nof where I started typing.\n\n208\n00:09:24.003 --> 00:09:25.244\nI'm gonna hit enter.\n\n209\n00:09:25.244 --> 00:09:28.189\nSo if I said Host, right,\nand then I hit my tab,\n\n210\n00:09:28.189 --> 00:09:33.083\nnotice it's gonna jump over to the next\nspace, because that's what we want.\n\n211\n00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:36.190\nSo we'll say Zach, and there we go.\n\n212\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.690\nI can keep on taking this and\nusing my tabs and that's great.\n\n213\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.780\nIf I don't want this to be there anymore,\n\n214\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.090\nI'm in a new paragraph ,we just select\nit and drag it off, and there we go, and\n\n215\n00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.600\nthat paragraph is back to our regular\ndefault tab stops, so pretty cool.\n\n216\n00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.360\nLet's come down to this one.\n\n217\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.750\nSo I have First Last Department.\n\n218\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.020\nNow this is another one of, there is a tab\nstop in there, you just can't see it, and\n\n219\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.188\nI did that on purpose.\n\n220\n00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:04.270\nSo if I selected this, and\n\n221\n00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.970\nthis is where when you start getting\ninto where you wanna make columns.\n\n222\n00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.690\nI am using air quotes here,\nbecause they're not really columns, but\n\n223\n00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.810\nit's simulating columns, like first, last,\ndepartment, and I wanna keep on going.\n\n224\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.025\nI started here.\nThere is a tab in between\n\n225\n00:10:23.025 --> 00:10:24.960\nFirst Last Department.\n\n226\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.900\nSo there's two stops that I need to make.\n\n227\n00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.934\nThis is going to be where I want\nthe last to go right about here.\n\n228\n00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:34.510\nI've got my left align tab stop.\n\n229\n00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.336\nI'm just gonna click, and notice that\nthe first tab jumps over and stops here.\n\n230\n00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:40.960\nSee my other tabs?\n\n231\n00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.860\nI want the next one to go here.\n\n232\n00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.920\nBeautiful.\n\n233\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.600\nPerfect.\n\n234\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.876\nSuper easy.\nThe thing that gets people tripped up\n\n235\n00:10:47.876 --> 00:10:52.085\nis like, let me go ahead, and they might\nget kind of crazy and they click this one,\n\n236\n00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:54.800\nand they're like, wait,\nwhat just happened?\n\n237\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.960\nWell, you have to think.\n\n238\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.937\nSingle tab, first stop,\nsecond tab, second stop.\n\n239\n00:11:00.937 --> 00:11:04.490\nThis one doesn't matter anymore,\nbecause there's no third one.\n\n240\n00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.361\nSo you have to match how many\ntabs you have in a paragraph\n\n241\n00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:11.151\nto how many stops you have on the ruler.\n\n242\n00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:14.845\nWhen you start adding them, you're like,\nI didn't want you to stop there.\n\n243\n00:11:14.845 --> 00:11:18.340\nIt's okay, just take it off,\njust click hold, drag down, and,\n\n244\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.380\nthen we've got these back here.\n\n245\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.750\nCool.\n\n246\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.614\nNow, what if I realize, [COUGH] this\ndepartment, I really wanted that to\n\n247\n00:11:26.614 --> 00:11:31.265\nbe right aligned, and this last name,\nI wanted this to be centered.\n\n248\n00:11:31.265 --> 00:11:36.722\nYou could drag them off, come over here,\ncycle through, put them back on,\n\n249\n00:11:36.722 --> 00:11:41.094\nor you can also format your tab\nstops right here on the ruler.\n\n250\n00:11:41.094 --> 00:11:44.040\nSo you gotta be very careful\nabout double-clicking on this.\n\n251\n00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.630\nIt's gotta be right on\nthe little triangle-y thing.\n\n252\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.260\nIt's really small.\n\n253\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.561\nDon't go to the left,\ndon't go to the right,\n\n254\n00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:53.998\ngo right on top of it, cuz that's\ngonna bring up the Tabs dialog box.\n\n255\n00:11:53.998 --> 00:11:55.628\nLet me just show you.\n\n256\n00:11:55.628 --> 00:11:57.458\nIf I double-clicked\na little bit over here.\n\n257\n00:11:57.458 --> 00:12:02.160\nWell, one [LAUGH] I just added\na new tab stop by mistake,\n\n258\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.590\nand two, I'm in the Document dialogue\nbox where I can change my margins,\n\n259\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.440\nthat's also, you're like.\n\n260\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.852\nYes, that's a shortcut,\nyou can double-click on your ruler, and\n\n261\n00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:14.025\nit'll bring up your,\nbasically your page setup dialog box.\n\n262\n00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:17.790\nBut that's not what I want, and\nI didn't want that second tab.\n\n263\n00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.870\nSo I need to take that off, pull that off,\ndouble-click right here, and\n\n264\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.210\nget into the Tab dialog box.\n\n265\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.889\nOne of the biggest things that trips me\nup, me personally, trips me up about this,\n\n266\n00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:34.340\nis I always forget to make sure I select\nwhich tab I wanna format, because right\n\n267\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.580\nnow I'm thinking in my brain, I wanna\ngo ahead and right-align this tab stop,\n\n268\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.490\neven though I know I double-clicked\non that one, just go with me.\n\n269\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.110\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, if you want to right,\nyou were creating the column right, and\n\n270\n00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.032\nyou wanted to put something, a word,\nDeJesus, or maybe the name of another\n\n271\n00:12:51.032 --> 00:12:55.795\nplace, under DeJesus, can you just go\nto the end of the word DeJesus, and\n\n272\n00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:58.370\nthen click that, and\nit will automatically go there, or no?\n\n273\n00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.210\n&gt;&gt; Well that would be no.\n\n274\n00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.953\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n275\n00:13:01.953 --> 00:13:05.923\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it has to be a new paragraph.\n\n276\n00:13:05.923 --> 00:13:08.989\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cuz, and\nthat's where we're making columns.\n\n277\n00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:09.804\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n278\n00:13:09.804 --> 00:13:13.471\n&gt;&gt; If you were in a table or something\nlike that, you could use your mouse to go\n\n279\n00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:17.495\ndown, your down arrow or something like\nthis, but since these are paragraphs,\n\n280\n00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:20.340\nI would actually have to go\nto the end of the paragraph.\n\n281\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:20.865\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n282\n00:13:20.865 --> 00:13:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Hit enter.\n\n283\n00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.532\nIt has to have a first name and a last,\nnow I can just hit the tab without typing\n\n284\n00:13:26.532 --> 00:13:30.828\nany text ,and it will make a blank in\nthe first, put the text in the middle.\n\n285\n00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:32.933\nYes, they are paragraphs.\n\n286\n00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:35.660\nWe do still have to treat\nthem as paragraphs.\n\n287\n00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.710\n&gt;&gt; Follow that formula, got it.\n\n288\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.640\n&gt;&gt; All right so back to this.\n\n289\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.832\nThe biggest thing that trips me\nup is I forget to choose which\n\n290\n00:13:42.832 --> 00:13:44.151\ntab stop I wanna format.\n\n291\n00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:48.571\nIf I'm thinking in my brain,\nI want this one to be right-aligned,\n\n292\n00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:54.385\nI have to click on that tab stop, and yes,\nit's at 4.31, I'm just randomly picking\n\n293\n00:13:54.385 --> 00:13:59.266\nlike doing visual marks, but I have to\nselect that one before I come over and\n\n294\n00:13:59.266 --> 00:14:03.190\nchange the alignment to Right,\ncuz this is what I wanna do.\n\n295\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.084\nI'm bringing up this format tabs\ndialogue box and when I click OK,\n\n296\n00:14:06.084 --> 00:14:08.159\nthen it goes ahead and\nright-aligns that one.\n\n297\n00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:13.510\nI can't tell you how many times I've gone\nto something like here, I did it again.\n\n298\n00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.952\nI just added another\n[LAUGH] one I didn't want.\n\n299\n00:14:14.952 --> 00:14:17.002\nNo, I didn't, I'm good.\n\n300\n00:14:17.002 --> 00:14:21.901\nOkay [LAUGH] well I double-clicked here,\nand I just forgot to click the right one,\n\n301\n00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:26.445\nand notice I double-clicked on that\nlast one, and it's still going back to\n\n302\n00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:30.360\nthat 2.38, so it's going down\nthe list of how it's listed.\n\n303\n00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.925\nSo make sure you select this one first,\n\n304\n00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:36.596\nthen the different type of formatting,\nthen click OK.\n\n305\n00:14:36.596 --> 00:14:39.200\nThere is a way that you could\nclear them all right from here.\n\n306\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.740\nIf you have a lot of tab stops,\nyou could just go into this and\n\n307\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.020\njust say just, take them all off,\n\n308\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.360\ninstead of physically dragging all\nthe different stops along the ruler.\n\n309\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.199\nSo it's one way that you could do that,\nall right.\n\n310\n00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:53.068\nSo going back to what you said.\n\n311\n00:14:53.068 --> 00:14:56.308\nSee if I get back here\nto Career Concierge,\n\n312\n00:14:56.308 --> 00:14:58.920\nthat's kind of hard to say [LAUGH].\n\n313\n00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.693\n&gt;&gt; Career Concierge.\n&gt;&gt; I come down here to Zach, and\n\n314\n00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:08.059\nthen I go to, let me, yep,\nwords [LAUGH], and then go right there.\n\n315\n00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:09.474\nSo now I can go ahead and continue.\n\n316\n00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:10.473\n&gt;&gt; As the paragraph.\n\n317\n00:15:10.473 --> 00:15:11.241\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n318\n00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:11.762\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n319\n00:15:11.762 --> 00:15:12.482\nPerfect.\n\n320\n00:15:12.482 --> 00:15:12.982\nI like that.\n\n321\n00:15:12.982 --> 00:15:17.151\nYou know I had a resume once for\nmy professional acting resume, and\n\n322\n00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:20.660\nI was trying to do this, and\nI did not know how to do this.\n\n323\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.312\nI wish you had been around then.\n\n324\n00:15:21.312 --> 00:15:22.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n325\n00:15:22.578 --> 00:15:23.111\nThank you so much.\n\n326\n00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:25.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes tabs can be a little weird so.\n\n327\n00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cool.\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n328\n00:15:26.602 --> 00:15:28.058\nthat's where we can go here.\n\n329\n00:15:28.058 --> 00:15:29.293\nI have some multiple tabs.\n\n330\n00:15:29.293 --> 00:15:33.553\nLet's go down to another example\nthat I would like to show you.\n\n331\n00:15:33.553 --> 00:15:35.298\nI think I'm zooming it the wrong way,\nthere we go.\n\n332\n00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:37.681\nLeaders.\n\n333\n00:15:37.681 --> 00:15:38.282\n&gt;&gt; Leaders.\n\n334\n00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:40.363\nFollow the leader.\n\n335\n00:15:40.363 --> 00:15:40.954\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n336\n00:15:40.954 --> 00:15:44.885\n&gt;&gt; If I have somebody going down, and\nthere's people that go behind you,\n\n337\n00:15:44.885 --> 00:15:46.337\nthat's what a leader is.\n\n338\n00:15:46.337 --> 00:15:47.230\nYou've seen these.\n\n339\n00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.833\nYou just didn't know what their names are.\n\n340\n00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:52.720\nI'm gonna turn off the paragraph sign,\nor the show/hide.\n\n341\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.200\nThere is a tab here, so\nyou all can see that.\n\n342\n00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.709\nI turned this off so\nyou can see the final result.\n\n343\n00:15:57.709 --> 00:16:01.132\nI did this, because this is where you\nnormally see them, in table of contents.\n\n344\n00:16:01.132 --> 00:16:03.111\nI'm gonna select all these texts.\n\n345\n00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:03.929\nParagraphs.\n\n346\n00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:06.896\n[LAUGH] We are going to come over here.\n\n347\n00:16:06.896 --> 00:16:10.974\nI'm going to choose\na right-aligned tab stop,\n\n348\n00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:17.548\nbecause I would like the numbers of\nthe pages to go over here and right-align.\n\n349\n00:16:17.548 --> 00:16:23.490\nAnd that's why I have 1, 15, 134, 5000,\ncuz I don't want them left-aligned.\n\n350\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.520\nI want them right-aligned and\nthen everything goes that way.\n\n351\n00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.119\nSo get the right type of tab,\nput it on the ruler.\n\n352\n00:16:31.119 --> 00:16:32.543\nAnd that looks nice, okay.\n\n353\n00:16:32.543 --> 00:16:33.410\nEverything's looking good.\n\n354\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.045\nThe leaders, that's where you go back and\ninto that tab dialogue box.\n\n355\n00:16:38.045 --> 00:16:40.240\nDouble-click on that tab stop.\n\n356\n00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.810\nI only have one, so I don't have to\nworry about which one I need to select.\n\n357\n00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.210\nThese little dots,\nlet's just click this one.\n\n358\n00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.740\nI click okay, doesn't that look familiar?\n\n359\n00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.564\n&gt;&gt; Yay, table of contents.\n\n360\n00:16:50.564 --> 00:16:53.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\nyou see this a lot in books.\n\n361\n00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:54.893\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n362\n00:16:54.893 --> 00:16:59.320\nthat's what these little dots\nare known as leaders on a tab stop.\n\n363\n00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.120\n&gt;&gt; Right, I may know.\n\n364\n00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.650\n&gt;&gt; Now you know, so, very easy to do.\n\n365\n00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.520\nOnce you understand a concept,\ndon't double-tab,\n\n366\n00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.320\nthere is a single tab in each one\nof these, and I told you to stop.\n\n367\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.410\nFormat right-aligned and\nuse my leader marks.\n\n368\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.919\nVery cool.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, it is cool.\n\n369\n00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:19.311\n&gt;&gt; Let's move down to here, up\n&gt;&gt; Let's do the decimal first before we do\n\n370\n00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:21.950\nthe, we'll stop by,\nwe'll end on the bar stops.\n\n371\n00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.550\nYou know, the bar tabs.\n\n372\n00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.863\n&gt;&gt; The bar tabs.\n&gt;&gt; That's usually where you\n\n373\n00:17:24.863 --> 00:17:25.549\nwanna end, right?\n\n374\n00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:26.722\n&gt;&gt; We're going to the bar stops.\n\n375\n00:17:26.722 --> 00:17:28.145\nThe bar stops in Bar Harbor.\n\n376\n00:17:28.145 --> 00:17:33.995\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so let's go\n&gt;&gt; Here, there are some tabs in there,\n\n377\n00:17:33.995 --> 00:17:39.145\nnotice I have $12.00, $123.00,\ncuz I don't want them to be left-aligned.\n\n378\n00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:42.439\nLet's go ahead and just go through them,\nand I'll move this back over so\n\n379\n00:17:42.439 --> 00:17:43.144\nyou can see it.\n\n380\n00:17:43.144 --> 00:17:44.277\nNext, I'll write a line.\n\n381\n00:17:44.277 --> 00:17:48.657\nIf I click that, yeah, it writes a line,\nbut well actually in this sense,\n\n382\n00:17:48.657 --> 00:17:51.267\nit does go ahead and\nline the decimals too [LAUGH].\n\n383\n00:17:51.267 --> 00:17:55.607\nBut if I had some other\ncharacters in here,\n\n384\n00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:58.243\nnotice that now\nthe decimals don't line up.\n\n385\n00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:04.097\nOkay, so kinda just backfire on me but\nwait, I guess you could use whatever\n\n386\n00:18:04.097 --> 00:18:09.480\nI told you, do what we want, but in this\ncase, I do want the decimal to line up.\n\n387\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.639\nSo this type of tab,\nI'm just gonna take it off the ruler.\n\n388\n00:18:12.639 --> 00:18:16.880\nI'm gonna cycle through that one right\nthere, the little dot on the bottom,\n\n389\n00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.860\nclick on that.\n\n390\n00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.590\nNow you can see, especially if I click,\nhold, and drag, that's where the decimal\n\n391\n00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.810\nlines up, and that's where\nthe decimal tab stop is going to be.\n\n392\n00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.650\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n393\n00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.950\n&gt;&gt; These up here,\nthis is where you have a bar stop.\n\n394\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.111\nNow, notice it's really just creating,\nalmost like We're talking about columns.\n\n395\n00:18:35.111 --> 00:18:35.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n396\n00:18:35.673 --> 00:18:38.650\n&gt;&gt; It's creating almost\nphysical columns here.\n\n397\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.340\nI didn't create that, it did it for me.\n\n398\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.560\nIf you look at how this is formatted,\nif I click my cursor in here, and\n\n399\n00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.630\nit's really hard to see so I apologize.\n\n400\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.870\nBut definitely,\nlook on your copy of the exercise file.\n\n401\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.100\nHere is that right there.\n\n402\n00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.179\nIt's very small, but\nthere's like a little line right there.\n\n403\n00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:58.988\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n404\n00:18:58.988 --> 00:18:59.966\n&gt;&gt; That's the bar stop.\n\n405\n00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:00.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n406\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.308\n&gt;&gt; Tab\n&gt;&gt; Here is the left-align tab stop,\n\n407\n00:19:05.308 --> 00:19:08.799\nbar stop, right-align tab stop.\n\n408\n00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:14.910\nSo there's only text, tab, text,\ntab that was not physically typed in.\n\n409\n00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.424\nWatch, if I click over here, and\nI hit enter, they're already there.\n\n410\n00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:21.621\nBut the lines or the bar stops are there,\n\n411\n00:19:21.621 --> 00:19:24.410\nbecause I'm continuing\nonto the next paragraph.\n\n412\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:29.708\nSo if I go ahead and\ntype in Zach tab memos tab\n\n413\n00:19:29.708 --> 00:19:34.380\nhost, you can see right there,\nthe bars keep on going.\n\n414\n00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So now, how did I set this up.\n\n415\n00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.656\nSo let's just maybe [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how did you set it up.\n\n416\n00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:43.180\n&gt;&gt; I'll go with first, tab, last,\n\n417\n00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.080\nenter, and Vonne tab Smith.\n\n418\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.600\nSelect these paragraphs, right, and\nyou didn't have to type the text in first.\n\n419\n00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.420\nYou could actually go ahead and\nset up all your tabs and\n\n420\n00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.460\nthen just start typing, okay?\n\n421\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.170\nSometimes, it's a little easier if you\nhave at least something to get you\n\n422\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:58.730\nstarted.\n\n423\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.330\nI'm going to cycle through\nto get my left tab stop.\n\n424\n00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.210\nDoesn't matter which order you do this in,\nby the way.\n\n425\n00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.081\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nget the tab stop first.\n\n426\n00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:12.076\nI'm gonna click and put that, like\nsomewhere between 0.2 and 2 and a half.\n\n427\n00:20:12.076 --> 00:20:14.183\nI want the bar to go in the middle.\n\n428\n00:20:14.183 --> 00:20:17.840\nCycle through, 1, 2, 3, 4, there it is.\n\n429\n00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.290\nThat tiny little line right there?\n\n430\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n431\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.244\n&gt;&gt; Click somewhere.\n\n432\n00:20:21.244 --> 00:20:23.270\nI'll just click like right about here.\n\n433\n00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.468\nAnd then that's it, okay?\n\n434\n00:20:24.468 --> 00:20:29.149\nSo it makes a line and\nthen it moves over to the top.\n\n435\n00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:30.230\nThat's it.\n\n436\n00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.470\n&gt;&gt; I think that's fantastic.\n\n437\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.035\n&gt;&gt; It's where the line\ngoes between the tab.\n\n438\n00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:36.170\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n439\n00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay? So that's how.\nYou still have to go ahead and format.\n\n440\n00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.900\nLet's come back over to\nthese paragraphs right here.\n\n441\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.835\nI'll turn this off.\n\n442\n00:20:41.835 --> 00:20:46.056\nI could go ahead and move this tab, but\nyou see, if this line needs to move,\n\n443\n00:20:46.056 --> 00:20:48.260\nI'd have to move that one too.\n\n444\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.620\nOops, I just made a second one,\nsorry guys.\n\n445\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.230\n&gt;&gt; You did, interesting.\n\n446\n00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.700\n&gt;&gt; They're so small,\nlet's take, come here.\n\n447\n00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.725\nAll right, you know what,\nwe will take that My goodness,\n\n448\n00:21:00.725 --> 00:21:03.170\nI'm just getting myself\nall sorts of confused.\n\n449\n00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.740\nWe're going to double.\n\n450\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.212\nI cannot get on, here,\nwhy don't we go here?\n\n451\n00:21:08.212 --> 00:21:09.090\nWe'll double-click on that.\n\n452\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.640\nThat's where I wanna go.\n\n453\n00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.025\nI couldn't double-click on the bar stop.\n\n454\n00:21:13.025 --> 00:21:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's what I was\n\n455\n00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.905\nhaving such trouble to get into this.\n\n456\n00:21:15.905 --> 00:21:18.560\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's where I need to get rid of,\n\n457\n00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.290\nI have to think, this is one inch.\n\n458\n00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.520\n106, and it actually tells me,\nthat's the barstop.\n\n459\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.260\nThis is the one that I want to take off.\n\n460\n00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.520\nSo you see this little minus button?\n\n461\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.641\nI'm actually glad I did this,\nbecause I didn't plan on going here.\n\n462\n00:21:32.641 --> 00:21:35.170\n&gt;&gt; Live action debugging,\nteachable moment.\n\n463\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I don't want that second.\n\n464\n00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.804\nThe first, I guess I should say.\n\n465\n00:21:38.804 --> 00:21:42.451\nThis one right here,\nit's at the 106 mark on there.\n\n466\n00:21:42.451 --> 00:21:43.990\nI just hit the minus sign down here.\n\n467\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.070\nGo away, your done,\nclick okay, and there you go.\n\n468\n00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.600\nSo notice I couldn't really\ntry to drag it off the roller\n\n469\n00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.650\nlike I could with these cuz it's so\nhard to get.\n\n470\n00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.786\nSo getting into that tabs dialogue box and\nactually, I believe you can come into Yes,\n\n471\n00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:05.409\nin case you didn't want to try to get into\nthat double-clicking on the tab stops to\n\n472\n00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:10.404\nget into that dialog box, You can always\ncome up into your format menu and\n\n473\n00:22:10.404 --> 00:22:13.850\ngo to tabs and\nit brings you right into it.\n\n474\n00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.790\nAnd you know,\nsince I have really emphasized this,\n\n475\n00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.620\nyou got to choose which one you want,\nand then go ahead and format it.\n\n476\n00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.950\nYou could clear them all if you wanted to,\nand move along.\n\n477\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.840\nSo that's how you can get\nformatting with your tab stops.\n\n478\n00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.470\nAnd hopefully, that gives you a little bit\nof clarity as to what they do by default,\n\n479\n00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.170\nand how to work with them.\n\n480\n00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.270\nI do wanna end with one last little thing,\n\n481\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.990\nbecause this starts to\nlook like a table to me.\n\n482\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.620\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n\n483\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.860\nI was gonna say that, Vonne.\n\n484\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because what are tables made of?\n\n485\n00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.030\nThey're made up of rows and columns.\n\n486\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.900\n&gt;&gt; Rows and columns, yeah.\n\n487\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.330\n&gt;&gt; We keep talking about these columns.\n\n488\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:56.070\nOkay, if I really wanted to,\nI could have just made a table and\n\n489\n00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.020\nput the first name and\nthe last name and the department.\n\n490\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.368\nTotally fine,\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n491\n00:23:00.368 --> 00:23:03.519\nAnd maybe, if you're more comfortable\nwith formatting in tables,\n\n492\n00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:04.780\nthat might be the way to go.\n\n493\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.060\nOn that same kind of premise,\nlet's go back up into here.\n\n494\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.181\nLet's scroll up.\n\n495\n00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:16.936\nEvery time that there is a tab, if we're\ntalking about that as being like a column,\n\n496\n00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:22.963\nwell there's something with text to tables\nand tables to text, which is converting.\n\n497\n00:23:22.963 --> 00:23:27.290\nI could convert this\nright here into a table.\n\n498\n00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:34.100\nAnd saying, every place where you\nsee a tab make an actual column.\n\n499\n00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.720\nSee another tab, column.\n\n500\n00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.287\nYou see an enter, make a row.\n\n501\n00:23:38.287 --> 00:23:42.870\nAnd that's how you start\nconverting your text into a table.\n\n502\n00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.400\nWe have a whole section on tables-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there is.\n\n503\n00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.210\n&gt;&gt; In other episodes or other shows.\n\n504\n00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.554\nSo don't worry that if this\nis kinda getting into tables.\n\n505\n00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:53.644\nBut if I go to, I believe it is.\n\n506\n00:23:53.644 --> 00:23:55.167\nNow, I just realized I\ndon't remember where it is.\n\n507\n00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:58.778\nIt's in your Insert, Table.\n\n508\n00:23:58.778 --> 00:24:01.081\nAnd then it actually\nconverted that to a table.\n\n509\n00:24:01.081 --> 00:24:01.778\n&gt;&gt; Ka-bang.\n\n510\n00:24:01.778 --> 00:24:04.306\n&gt;&gt; If I'm back here, I can go back\nto Table, that's where it is.\n\n511\n00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:09.758\nAnd then I can also go ahead and\nconvert this table to text.\n\n512\n00:24:09.758 --> 00:24:10.670\n&gt;&gt; That is amazing.\n\n513\n00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:15.990\nSo we can go from paragraph\nformat to a table, back again.\n\n514\n00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.270\nI mean, this is incredible.\n\n515\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.400\nThe options are amazing.\n\n516\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I use this a lot because\nthere are times where it might come\n\n517\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.770\nin as a table but I wanna format a tabs.\n\n518\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.488\nWhy, I don't know.\nI'm just feeling spunky that day.\n\n519\n00:24:26.488 --> 00:24:27.618\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n520\n00:24:27.618 --> 00:24:31.126\nthen at night I kinda went\nthrough it a little quickly.\n\n521\n00:24:31.126 --> 00:24:34.067\nBut when I went into the Table,\nI actually went into the Insert\n\n522\n00:24:34.067 --> 00:24:35.351\nmenu first cuz-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n523\n00:24:35.351 --> 00:24:36.645\nI started to forget where it is.\n\n524\n00:24:36.645 --> 00:24:37.766\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's where you went [LAUGH].\n\n525\n00:24:37.766 --> 00:24:42.849\n&gt;&gt; But I select this back when\ntheir paragraphs convert.\n\n526\n00:24:42.849 --> 00:24:44.943\nAnd notice that I have\nConvert Text to Table.\n\n527\n00:24:44.943 --> 00:24:46.686\nThat's the one I was\nactually really looking for.\n\n528\n00:24:46.686 --> 00:24:49.271\n&gt;&gt; I just realized I kinda\nstumbled upon it [LAUGH].\n\n529\n00:24:49.271 --> 00:24:52.116\n&gt;&gt; Well here again, options,\nthere's so many options.\n\n530\n00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.374\n&gt;&gt; Live debugging, right,\nis that what you said [LAUGH]?\n\n531\n00:24:54.374 --> 00:24:55.300\n&gt;&gt; Live-action debugging, yeah.\n\n532\n00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.298\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nI can convert the text to table.\n\n533\n00:24:58.298 --> 00:25:02.912\nAnd this is what I was also looking for\nso I could explain a little bit better.\n\n534\n00:25:02.912 --> 00:25:07.833\nBut you did see it, you said you could\nsee it, it's saying let's go ahead and\n\n535\n00:25:07.833 --> 00:25:09.651\nget the number of columns and\n\n536\n00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:13.767\nthen it's gonna find that it is\nseparating the text at the tabs.\n\n537\n00:25:13.767 --> 00:25:18.030\nThat's the delimiter as we call it,\nsome type of separator character.\n\n538\n00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.880\nAnd that's where it's\ngonna make the columns and\n\n539\n00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.805\nthen all the paragraphs become rows.\n\n540\n00:25:21.805 --> 00:25:25.230\nNow get your contextual tabs up here.\n\n541\n00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.375\nTalk about formatting tables later.\n\n542\n00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:28.410\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n543\n00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.540\n&gt;&gt; Come back over.\n\n544\n00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.374\nConvert it.\n\n545\n00:25:30.374 --> 00:25:33.689\nNow if I have as a table back to text,\nit's gonna say, well,\n\n546\n00:25:33.689 --> 00:25:37.981\nwhat type of separators do you want me to\nput where I had every change in column?\n\n547\n00:25:37.981 --> 00:25:41.983\nI just wanna head into tabs but\nnotice you could have it as a comma.\n\n548\n00:25:41.983 --> 00:25:46.563\nMaybe you need this to be taken out into\nsomewhere where it needs to be in a CSV\n\n549\n00:25:46.563 --> 00:25:50.126\nfile format or\nsome type of comma separator, delimiter,\n\n550\n00:25:50.126 --> 00:25:51.959\nrather than a tab delimiter.\n\n551\n00:25:51.959 --> 00:25:57.404\nSo you can change it depending on how you\nwant that text to come out of that table,\n\n552\n00:25:57.404 --> 00:26:01.393\nso just a little foreshadowing, a little-\n&gt;&gt; That is so cool.\n\n553\n00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:05.346\n&gt;&gt; Telling you about some other\nthings that are in some other shows.\n\n554\n00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:09.941\nIt is in the advanced, it's not in\nthe essential series, so look for that.\n\n555\n00:26:09.941 --> 00:26:12.776\nAnd like you say, always look in\nour course library for [CROSSTALK]\n\n556\n00:26:12.776 --> 00:26:15.193\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n557\n00:26:15.193 --> 00:26:16.795\nIt looks like I've come\nto the end of my list.\n\n558\n00:26:16.795 --> 00:26:19.577\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wonderful episode as usual.\n\n559\n00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:23.030\nTabs, Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n560\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.704\nWatch every single episode of this series\nand, by the way, as Vonne was saying,\n\n561\n00:26:27.704 --> 00:26:29.229\ngo to our course library.\n\n562\n00:26:29.229 --> 00:26:32.980\nThere's hundreds of videos all\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n563\n00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.740\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about Office ProTV.\n\n564\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.051\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n565\n00:26:36.051 --> 00:26:36.687\nThanks for watching.\n\n566\n00:26:36.687 --> 00:26:37.559\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n567\n00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:38.245\n&gt;&gt;

A\n\n23\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.451\nprimer\n&gt;&gt; A what?\n\n24\n00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.779\n&gt;&gt; A primer, so to speak\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a primer,\n\n25\n00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:09.726\nprimer\n&gt;&gt; Primer,\n\n26\n00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:10.460\nprimer\n&gt;&gt; Primavera?\n\n27\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.824\n&gt;&gt; You say tomato I say tomato\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Primavera I always go to food.\n\n28\n00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.649\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH] but yes that's what we want\n\n29\n00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.741\nto do, primer, primer\n&gt;&gt; Primer primer.\n\n30\n00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:23.369\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH] because styles are awesome.\n\n31\n00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.079\nThey're amazing, they'll make your life so\n\n32\n00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.990\nmuch easier if you can\nstart implementing them.\n\n33\n00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.605\nAnd the nice thing is that it's so\nbuilt into Word if you wanna say it,\n\n34\n00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:35.095\nit's right there.\n\n35\n00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.215\nThat just using the default\nof what they give you\n\n36\n00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:41.565\ncan really lend it to be easier for\nyourself.\n\n37\n00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:44.885\nTo be able to format large documents,\nsmall documents.\n\n38\n00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:49.333\nTo go ahead and\nget the consistency to look good and nice.\n\n39\n00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:55.475\nSo, I have a file that we have for\nan example down here, styles example.docx.\n\n40\n00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:56.950\nYou've probably seen\nthis quite a few times.\n\n41\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.430\nThe text is all the same.\n\n42\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.415\n&gt;&gt; Alice in Wonderland?\n\n43\n00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:02.135\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really, I know, crazy.\n\n44\n00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:04.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you look at this, and\n\n45\n00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.814\nlet me zoom out a little bit to see,\nyou have some consistency of the headings.\n\n46\n00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:13.734\nNow this is something that even if you're\nlike I don't know what a style is,\n\n47\n00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.262\nyou've seen this throughout\neverything okay?\n\n48\n00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:22.344\nIf you've gone to school and\nhad a textbook you've encountered styles.\n\n49\n00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:24.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I can almost guarantee it because like\n\n50\n00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:28.074\nall of your chapters\nare formatted a certain way.\n\n51\n00:02:28.074 --> 00:02:32.751\nAnd different topics have different\nheadings that let's you know this is where\n\n52\n00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:36.516\nwe're gonna talk about the World War I,\nand then you have okay,\n\n53\n00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:39.180\nthen this is where whatever I'm getting.\n\n54\n00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.700\nI don't know why I choose history because\nI wasn't very good at that subject.\n\n55\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.453\nSo I was like okay why don't colors,\nthere we go.\n\n56\n00:02:46.453 --> 00:02:47.233\n&gt;&gt; Colors.\n\n57\n00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.805\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back to something that I know.\n\n58\n00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:54.563\nHere's colors, and that would be formated\nin like a big, bolder, larger font.\n\n59\n00:02:54.563 --> 00:02:56.190\nCuz that's gonna be like the main topic.\n\n60\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.135\nAnd then underneath it\nyou would have purple.\n\n61\n00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:04.576\nAnd we're going to talk about purple, but\nthat is formatted a little bit smaller,\n\n62\n00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:05.598\nmaybe not as bold.\n\n63\n00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:12.130\nBut you know that purple is a topic of\ncolors which is the topic of Design 101.\n\n64\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.913\nIt's all about how your text is formatted\nto know the structure of your document.\n\n65\n00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:21.546\nYour hierarchy of what\nwe're looking at and\n\n66\n00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:25.188\nwhat goes underneath different headings.\n\n67\n00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:27.281\nWe talked a little bit\nabout on the lists right?\n\n68\n00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.790\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Where we did our hierarchies and\n\n69\n00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.630\nour sub-lists or\nour sub-paragraphs we talked about.\n\n70\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.990\nSame thing here, so\nin styles, the definition,\n\n71\n00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.770\nmy definition,\nis it's just a named group of formatting.\n\n72\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.520\nLike right here, this down the rabbit\nhole, this is formatted with Calibri, 16,\n\n73\n00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.560\nit looks a little bolder even though it's\nnot necessarily on the bold right here.\n\n74\n00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.903\nAnd that looks exactly like this one,\nsame thing so\n\n75\n00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:59.657\nyou could see that these\nare going to be like main topics.\n\n76\n00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:05.279\nThis one Advice from a Caterpillar,\nthat's a little bit smaller so\n\n77\n00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.938\nit would be like title, main, sub, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:13.240\nAnd this is another sub because it's\nthe same font size for that consistency.\n\n79\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.090\nLook at some other ones in here where it\nsays she found herself falling deep in a,\n\n80\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.808\nwait you can read that.\n\n81\n00:04:19.808 --> 00:04:21.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My brain's gonna look too crazy\n\n82\n00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:24.840\nlike I can just gonna pretend,\nyou can read that right there.\n\n83\n00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.984\nAnd it looks the same right here,\nI wonder what was going to happen next.\n\n84\n00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:31.363\nWow it's kind of hard when you start\nreading out loud to people and\n\n85\n00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:32.590\nyou're like I'm tripping up.\n\n86\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.870\n&gt;&gt; And then I went to the door.\n\n87\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.626\n&gt;&gt; Yea exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:39.035\n&gt;&gt; So but it looks the same, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:42.604\nAnd your like that's just bold and italic.\n\n90\n00:04:42.604 --> 00:04:45.159\nIt's a little bit more than that, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.320\nBecause you're thinking, well yeah,\nI just go ahead and format this all.\n\n92\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.178\nOr I selected them cuz we learned how to\ndo multi level selection with our command\n\n93\n00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:55.580\nkey and so we could have selected this.\n\n94\n00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.470\nHold our command key selected this and\njust hit the bold and italic button.\n\n95\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.080\nWhere's the real power of using styles,\n\n96\n00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.240\nthese are all styles by the way,\nI didn't format this manually.\n\n97\n00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.300\nThe real power is if you use a style\nit's all connected to one source.\n\n98\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.150\nUp here, in our Home tab,\ndo you see over here where it says styles?\n\n99\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.100\n&gt;&gt;

I've got it, it's gonna override it.\n\n286\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.226\n&gt;&gt; But\njust trying to get that concept in here,\n\n287\n00:16:27.226 --> 00:16:31.460\ncuz it's the hardest one that people say,\nbut I did what you told me to.\n\n288\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.719\nBut then I changed it.\n\n289\n00:16:32.719 --> 00:16:35.346\nDidn't change it necessarily\nin the right place.\n\n290\n00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:40.323\nAll right, back to the other\ndocument of why I love that styles\n\n291\n00:16:40.323 --> 00:16:42.728\npane is how would I know that?\n\n292\n00:16:42.728 --> 00:16:45.630\nHow would I know that\nthat is a local override?\n\n293\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.501\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask you that.\n\n294\n00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:49.583\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what that check box is.\n\n295\n00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:50.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n296\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.841\n&gt;&gt;

it's always that whole, well,\n\n23\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.320\nyou think it's easy cuz\nyou do it all day long.\n\n24\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.800\nI'm like, well, yeah, but\nit's really just right there.\n\n25\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.710\nI'm pointing at my screen\nlike you guys can see this.\n\n26\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.930\nBut it's right there on\nthe Home tab of our ribbon.\n\n27\n00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.940\nAnd so if it's as easy as just\nclick the button then we'll just,\n\n28\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.380\nwell, click the button, won't we?\n\n29\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.950\n&gt;&gt; Clicking buttons are fun.\n\n30\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.511\n&gt;&gt; They are, yes.\n\n31\n00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:42.220\nAnd styles are fun because anything that\nmakes your life easier, is fun to me.\n\n32\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.970\nSo that's where we're gonna go.\n\n33\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.780\nSo we don't we go ahead and jump down into\na file that I have called styles.docx.\n\n34\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.040\nI've already got it open.\n\n35\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.435\nAnd I do have my show and\n\n36\n00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:55.636\nhide character marks just on because\nyou know I like to have them on.\n\n37\n00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.150\nNow, my resolution is a little bit lower.\n\n38\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.920\nSo you're not gonna see as much.\n\n39\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.010\nAnd I might go ahead and\nextend this out just a little bit so\n\n40\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.790\nyou can see a few more of the styles\nthat are going to be available for\n\n41\n00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.150\nyou on the Home tab like I said before.\n\n42\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.880\nSo we can move ahead and use that.\n\n43\n00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.062\nI do like to use the styles pane.\n\n44\n00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:16.190\nRemember this from the introduction.\n\n45\n00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.020\nWhere it brings up our dialogue.\n\n46\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.056\nIt's not actually a dialogue box.\n\n47\n00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:24.176\nI might call it a panel,\npanes, it's the same thing.\n\n48\n00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.697\nThat thing on the right-\n&gt;&gt; That thing on the right.\n\n50\n00:02:26.697 --> 00:02:27.944\n&gt;&gt; That just kinda hangs out.\n\n51\n00:02:27.944 --> 00:02:31.170\nAnd we'll just,\nmake sure that we use that.\n\n52\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.640\nBut we do have the top up here.\n\n53\n00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.950\nAnd notice that there is little droppy\ndown thing that you can grab and\n\n54\n00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.890\nit will show you more of the styles.\n\n55\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.890\nCuz there are more in there by default.\n\n56\n00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.090\nLike the emphasis, and the strong,\nand the quote, you just don't see it.\n\n57\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.960\nBut again,\nyou might have resolution that's so\n\n58\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.280\nmuch bigger that you see all of these,\nlike all the way across.\n\n59\n00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.730\nYou don't have to necessarily have that\ndrop down thing that brings you more.\n\n60\n00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.380\nAnd there's also this clear\nformatting button down at the bottom.\n\n61\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.889\nThis is the same as this button.\n\n62\n00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.954\nAnd we talked about in\nthe character formatting episode.\n\n63\n00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:12.242\nSo, they are the same thing, don't\nthink they are only related to styles,\n\n64\n00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:15.660\nit's just formatting in general because,\nwhat is a style?\n\n65\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.860\nIt's just a name group of formatting.\n\n66\n00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.456\nAnd we've gotten our Heading 1s and\nHeading 2s, our default structure tags,\n\n67\n00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:27.082\nas they call them in HTML,\nto structure a document.\n\n68\n00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:31.472\nAgain talking about that in our last\nepisode about how you're organizing\n\n69\n00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:36.655\ninformation because that's really another\nreason why you want to use your headings.\n\n70\n00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:41.161\nTo say, this is the main, and these are\nthe subs, and this is another main, and\n\n71\n00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:44.279\nthis a sub, so\nthat's how you can use it accordingly.\n\n72\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.741\nSo how am I going to apply\none of these styles?\n\n73\n00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:52.010\nWell, one of them is\nalready applied by default.\n\n74\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.490\nAnd that's that Normal style.\n\n75\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.060\nNormal style is what everything\nin Word is based off of.\n\n76\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.140\nWhen you start a new file you're\ntyping in the Normal style.\n\n77\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.006\nNow I do wanna make a note on\nthis particular file itself,\n\n78\n00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:07.330\nbecause remember we talked\nabout in the introduction?\n\n79\n00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.900\nStyles are file specific.\n\n80\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.390\nSo the Normal style in\nthis particular document\n\n81\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.140\nis not the same normal in a File New, why?\n\n82\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.270\nCuz I changed it.\n\n83\n00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.390\nThe other reason why it's gonna be\na little different is because this\n\n84\n00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.910\nfile was originally created in Word for\nPC.\n\n85\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.970\nSo that's where the normal style\n\n86\n00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.120\non a PC has that spacing we talked\nabout space after paragraph marks.\n\n87\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.920\nThat's so very important in our\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n88\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.810\nSo I do want you to be aware of\nthat in this particular document.\n\n89\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.070\nAnd it has I think it's an eight\npoint space after paragraph and\n\n90\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.200\nthe line spacing is\na little bit different.\n\n91\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.988\nJust to demonstrate this, I just did\na Ctrl, sorry, Cmd+N for File New.\n\n92\n00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:57.856\nAnd if I start typing,\nnotice when I hit Enter,\n\n93\n00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:02.596\nI'm not having that same space\nthat I do in this particular\n\n94\n00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:07.742\ndocument where there is a lot\nmore space after each paragraph.\n\n95\n00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:11.648\nThat's again back to that\nNormal paragraph style and\n\n96\n00:05:11.648 --> 00:05:15.130\nhow they are different and\ndocument specific.\n\n97\n00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.640\nAll right, so everybody's Normal.\n\n98\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.830\nThere are no direct formatting guides.\n\n99\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.070\nThere's no direct formatting there, so\nI can see there are no local overrides, so\n\n100\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.910\nI can see everybody is starting at this\nparticular document's normal, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.435\nI would like to have Alice in\nWonderland to be the title,\n\n102\n00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:34.535\nbecause well that's the title.\n\n103\n00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:35.165\n&gt;&gt; That's the title.\n\n104\n00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:35.893\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n105\n00:05:35.893 --> 00:05:38.456\nI mean it's at the top so\nit should probably be the title, right?\n\n106\n00:05:38.456 --> 00:05:42.090\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So how do I format that as a title?\n\n107\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.500\nI'm gonna start at the top,\nI'm gonna pull this down.\n\n108\n00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.930\nAnd I'm just gonna click on it.\n\n109\n00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.680\nNotice that my cursor is just\nhanging out in the paragraph,\n\n110\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.550\nI'm not flushing the text.\n\n111\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.440\nCome back around to that in a little\nbit because this is a paragraph-level\n\n112\n00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.130\nformatting, this is a paragraph style.\n\n113\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.300\nSo if I click it,\nit changes the whole paragraph,\n\n114\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.780\nit automatically makes it that\nbigger font, a little bit bolder,\n\n115\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.260\nthe whole nine, love it, fantastic and\nthat's all you need to do.\n\n116\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.000\nIf you want the entire paragraph\nto have that particular style,\n\n117\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.900\nclick on the paragraph like this one,\nwe're gonna do a subtitle, and\n\n118\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.850\nI have made some little tips,\ntricks, what are, directions?\n\n119\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.065\nThat's what I'm trying to do.\n\n120\n00:06:24.065 --> 00:06:26.950\n[LAUGH] Wherer it says,\nTitle-Alice-in-Wonderland, subtitle, for.\n\n121\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.532\nHeading 1, you probably don't\nwanna type the word Heading 1.\n\n122\n00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:33.006\n[LAUGH] That's just more like\na roadmap for this particular episode.\n\n123\n00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:36.420\nSo I click here,\nlet's go over here in the panel.\n\n124\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.940\nAnd we can see Subtitle, down there\nat the bottom, or towards the bottom.\n\n125\n00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.800\nI click it and\nthen it goes ahead and applies it.\n\n126\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.670\nHeading 1, think you get the idea.\n\n127\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.780\nClick here, apply Heading 1, perfect,\nclick here, apply Heading 2, wow!\n\n128\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.485\nThat's so easy and just like, just in\na small little space right there, you can\n\n129\n00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:59.419\nsee doesn't that, it just looks cleaner,\nit looks professional, doesn't it?\n\n130\n00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.185\n&gt;&gt; It does, it also looks very easy to do,\n\n131\n00:07:01.185 --> 00:07:04.055\nas opposed to having to retype\neverything in a different font.\n\n132\n00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:05.198\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense.\n\n133\n00:07:05.198 --> 00:07:10.096\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and you actually brought\nup something that is kind of a good\n\n134\n00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:14.110\nthing to talk about here,\ntype all of your text out first.\n\n135\n00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.160\nI know I do the same thing.\n\n136\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.020\nA lot of people,\nthey wanna format as they go.\n\n137\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.820\nLet's go ahead and type some words,\nselect it all, go ahead and\n\n138\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.250\ndo the format,\nhit Enter then keep on going.\n\n139\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.250\nWell it's a lot easier if you\njust go ahead get the content and\n\n140\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.235\nthen format it afterward.\n\n141\n00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n142\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.620\n&gt;&gt; It's hard to kind of get\nin that mind set honestly.\n\n143\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.170\nCuz we wanna just go and do as we go.\n\n144\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.290\nTry, just try it.\n\n145\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.235\nTry to do it afterwards.\n\n146\n00:07:41.235 --> 00:07:43.630\nBecause now I'm just\ngonna come through here.\n\n147\n00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.950\nLike for example, if I wanna go ahead and\nclick there, Heading 2.\n\n148\n00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.220\nAnd there's a couple of them.\n\n149\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.560\nNow, I don't have to do\neach one individually.\n\n150\n00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.472\nWe do have our multiple selections.\n\n151\n00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:56.042\nI've clicked over here\non my selection area.\n\n152\n00:07:56.042 --> 00:08:00.056\nIf I scroll down,\nhold my Cmd key and single-click And\n\n153\n00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:04.070\nthen single click with the command key and\nthen again,\n\n154\n00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.081\nnotice what I am doing here is,\nI am just going ahead and\n\n155\n00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:13.530\nselecting all of them at one time and\nthen applying the heading one.\n\n156\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.530\nSo just making it a little faster for me\nright here to go ahead and just get some\n\n157\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.370\nof this stuff already applied so\nwe can kind of move on from there.\n\n158\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.033\nLets see if there's a heading too.\n\n159\n00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:26.598\nAnd I'm zoomed out just for\na little bit so\n\n160\n00:08:26.598 --> 00:08:29.500\nyou can see that I'm just selecting them.\n\n161\n00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.512\nGoing all the way down, one more,\nthere's a heading one and perfect.\n\n162\n00:08:34.512 --> 00:08:37.896\nLet's zoom back in and\nsorry, trying to make it so\n\n163\n00:08:37.896 --> 00:08:42.842\nyou guys can see this and that's a little\ntoo much so why don't we come out here.\n\n164\n00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:46.490\nAnd we'll scroll back up into here.\n\n165\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.950\nSo the whole clicking in the paragraph and\n\n166\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.498\njust selecting the specific style,\nand it applies to the whole paragraph.\n\n167\n00:08:54.498 --> 00:08:57.517\nGreat, wonderful.\n\n168\n00:08:57.517 --> 00:09:02.036\nThere's sometimes, depending on the style,\nthat that's not gonna work.\n\n169\n00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:04.775\nSo I'm gonna click here in this paragraph,\n\n170\n00:09:04.775 --> 00:09:08.720\nI'm just clicking on the word there,\njust for fun.\n\n171\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.520\nClick on Heading 1,\nwhole paragraph changes.\n\n172\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.443\nI'm gonna undo, or Cmd-Z, there.\n\n173\n00:09:13.443 --> 00:09:18.100\nThere is a style, I'm gonna come over here\nto the Style pane, I'm gonna scroll down.\n\n174\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.380\nThere is a style called Emphasis,\nor there's Intense Emphasis.\n\n175\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.950\nAll right, so I'm thinking I\ncould do the same thing, right?\n\n176\n00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.170\nMy cursor's on the word there,\nI click on that particular style, and\n\n177\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.110\nit just does that one word.\n\n178\n00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.910\nWhy didn't it do the whole paragraph?\n\n179\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.510\nWell, because intense emphasis\nis a character style.\n\n180\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.990\nCharacter styles only\napply to the characters,\n\n181\n00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.280\nthe words, not the whole paragraph.\n\n182\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:50.340\nNow if I selected, let's go ahead and\nselect all of the words.\n\n183\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.440\nAnd then click it.\n\n184\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.046\nOkay, now that worked, so\nI just wanted to make sure that you\n\n185\n00:09:55.046 --> 00:09:58.375\nunderstand the difference\nbetween a character level or\n\n186\n00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:01.310\na character type of style and\na paragraph style.\n\n187\n00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.115\nIt doesn't always work the same way and\nthis also goes into,\n\n188\n00:10:05.115 --> 00:10:09.185\nwhat do I have selected before I apply it?\n\n189\n00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:12.655\nIf I select like, Dina was the cat.\n\n190\n00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:16.345\nAnd then choose this particular\ncharacter style, wonderful.\n\n191\n00:10:16.345 --> 00:10:20.235\nI want to show you a,\nI wanna call this a trick.\n\n192\n00:10:20.235 --> 00:10:21.355\n&gt;&gt; Another trick.\n\n193\n00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:27.147\n&gt;&gt; I call this word,\nbreaking the rules I'll say, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:27.147 --> 00:10:31.026\nSo if we're talking about styles in\nthe general sense, not the Word styles,\n\n195\n00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:32.820\ncuz styles are everywhere.\n\n196\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:40.460\nIn Design, Excel,\nWeb design, you cannot apply\n\n197\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.430\na paragraph of a style to\nsingle words in a paragraph.\n\n198\n00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.440\nIt would have to be a character style.\n\n199\n00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.242\nThere's no way around it,\nthat's just paragraph, below paragraph,\n\n200\n00:10:52.242 --> 00:10:53.668\ncharacter or words.\n\n201\n00:10:53.668 --> 00:10:57.929\nBut Word will allow you to\nselect individual words\n\n202\n00:10:57.929 --> 00:11:02.803\nwithin a paragraph and\napply a paragraph-level style.\n\n203\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.186\nTechnically you shouldn't be\nable to do that but it does.\n\n204\n00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:12.258\nSo notice this text right in\nhere is formatted as a heading\n\n205\n00:11:12.258 --> 00:11:18.670\nto paragraph style but\nit's only applying to specific words.\n\n206\n00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.927\nDifferent than if I had just selected\none word and clicked Heading 2,\n\n207\n00:11:22.927 --> 00:11:25.070\nnotice it applies to everything.\n\n208\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.624\nSo you can get around that.\n\n209\n00:11:28.624 --> 00:11:30.340\nI understand why Word does this.\n\n210\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.200\nBecause they don't wanna get\n\n211\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.560\ntoo nitty-gritty into like\nthe character versus the paragraph.\n\n212\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.140\nAnd how do I know this?\n\n213\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.820\nLook over here in the Styles spanning.\n\n214\n00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.250\nDo you see this little icon right here?\n\n215\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.280\nLooks like a Paragraph.\n\n216\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.210\nThat looks like a letter A.\n\n217\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:52.950\nThat is showing you this is a character\nstyle, this is a paragraph style.\n\n218\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.470\nSo that's your indication there of\nwhat type of ones that they are but,\n\n219\n00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.120\nlike I said, it's breaking\nthe rules allowing you to apply\n\n220\n00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.630\nthis type of level of formatting to Word.\n\n221\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.716\nI'm getting a little too much in the wee,\nand you're probably like, I don't know,\n\n222\n00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:09.420\nI just want it to look like that, fine.\n\n223\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.020\nGo for it.\n\n224\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:15.570\nOkay, it's available, you can do that,\nbut just know it's kind\n\n225\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:21.010\nof skirting around the rules\nof the levels of styles.\n\n226\n00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:21.530\nIt's okay.\n\n227\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.230\n&gt;&gt; There's so many options, aren't there?\n\n228\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n229\n00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.874\n&gt;&gt; And that's where I like that\nWord is giving the options.\n\n230\n00:12:26.874 --> 00:12:33.555\nAnd it's not kind of relying on you as\na user to understand the rules of styles,\n\n231\n00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:38.810\nand the rules of character and\nparagraphical styles.\n\n232\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.750\nSo it's just kind of like yeah sure\nyou can do it if you like the way\n\n233\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.101\nthat looks go right ahead,\nwe'll let you, fine.\n\n234\n00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:47.294\n[LAUGH] It's okay.\n\n235\n00:12:47.294 --> 00:12:52.268\nSo now, once I've gotten my Styles applied\nbecause maybe I would like to have\n\n236\n00:12:52.268 --> 00:12:56.630\nsome character styles, maybe I want\nthis intense emphasis here and\n\n237\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.025\nI want as a long hall.\n\n238\n00:12:58.025 --> 00:13:00.280\nThere we go,\nshe found herself in a long, low hall.\n\n239\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.012\nMaybe I'll make that an intense emphasis,\nand maybe some of these words,\n\n240\n00:13:05.012 --> 00:13:06.297\nintense emphasis.\n\n241\n00:13:06.297 --> 00:13:10.716\nWhy wouldn't I just go ahead and select\nthat and make it blue, and bold, and\n\n242\n00:13:10.716 --> 00:13:11.530\nitalic?\n\n243\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.578\nBecause the whole idea of styles\nis having that source formatting.\n\n244\n00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:19.690\nIf you change the source,\nit changes where everything is applied.\n\n245\n00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.920\nSo, let's get into that.\n\n246\n00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:26.310\nLet's modify some of these styles cuz\nmaybe blue isn't your color, right?\n\n247\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:31.200\nI want my heading ones to be purple and\nI would also like them to be centered.\n\n248\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.360\nBecause I have it as a style, I have\nHeading 1 applied quite a few different\n\n249\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.400\nplaces, I just need to go to\nthe style itself and modify it.\n\n250\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.000\nOne suggestion.\n\n251\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.690\nMake sure your cursor is\nsomewhere in a paragraph or\n\n252\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.190\nword that has that particular\nstyle applied to it.\n\n253\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.730\nBecause if you do this it's going,\nwherever your cursor is,\n\n254\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.380\nthat's where the style usually goes to.\n\n255\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.340\nSo it's just kinda one of those\nlike why did it apply there?\n\n256\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.990\nCuz your cursor was there.\n\n257\n00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.010\nSo I have my cursor in Heading 1, I'm\ngoing to come up to Heading 1 on the top.\n\n258\n00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.660\nI'm going to right click on this.\n\n259\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.620\nNot left, right click,\nand I can go to Modify.\n\n260\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.330\nYou can also go down here into,\n\n261\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.620\nyou can actually see how Heading 1 is\nthe current style that is selected.\n\n262\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.890\nI can use the drop down here, and\ngo to Modify Style, or I can also come and\n\n263\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.470\nfind it down in this list, right there.\n\n264\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.280\nAnd then off to the right-hand side,\nthat will let you, whoops,\n\n265\n00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.170\nthat's the wrong one,\ngo into the Modify option.\n\n266\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:34.798\nLots of different ways to get to it, I'm\ngonna go back up here and select modify,\n\n267\n00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:38.337\ncuz now I'm into the modify style\ndialog box and I can, well,\n\n268\n00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:40.062\nchange anything I want here.\n\n269\n00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:43.897\nThey have a lot of the buttons that you\nsee up in the Home tab here where we\n\n270\n00:14:43.897 --> 00:14:47.342\ncould change like the font,\nthe size, the bold, all of this,\n\n271\n00:14:47.342 --> 00:14:50.678\nand the nice thing down here,\nit gives you a little preview.\n\n272\n00:14:50.678 --> 00:14:57.000\nAnd this is listing all of the formattings\nthat this particular style has.\n\n273\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.210\nNotice it has like the default font,\nthe theme heading.\n\n274\n00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:02.770\nWe'll get into that in another episode.\n\n275\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.280\nWe have a style sets and themes.\n\n276\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.505\nYeah, I'm pretty sure that's\nthe title of the episode,\n\n277\n00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:09.080\n[LAUGH] that talks about that.\n\n278\n00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.750\nAnd that also talks about this accent\ncolor, accent one, well it's blue.\n\n279\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.780\nIt's accent one, technically.\n\n280\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:22.504\nAnd all of the other formats that\nare with this particular style.\n\n281\n00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:24.835\nBut what about that line spacing, right?\n\n282\n00:15:24.835 --> 00:15:27.478\nBecause we talked about the normal\nline spacing and all of that.\n\n283\n00:15:27.478 --> 00:15:32.260\nYou have other options down here\nin the bottom left hand corner.\n\n284\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.800\nI actually did this.\n\n285\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.800\nYou didn't see it off-screen.\n\n286\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.502\nYou saw that didn't you?\n\n287\n00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:37.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying there's options for\n\n288\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.761\nthe option's options.\n\n289\n00:15:38.761 --> 00:15:40.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n290\n00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.900\nYes and this is the left.\n\n291\n00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.298\nSo if I go to here,\nnotice I have Pair of tabs, frame.\n\n292\n00:15:47.298 --> 00:15:51.201\nBecause everything that you can\napply in either character and\n\n293\n00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.213\nparagraph level formatting\nis all available.\n\n294\n00:15:54.213 --> 00:15:56.629\nLike the borders,\nthe shading, stuff like that.\n\n295\n00:15:56.629 --> 00:16:01.447\nSo if l wanted to go into the paragraph,\nthis is where l have the indents and\n\n296\n00:16:01.447 --> 00:16:04.895\nspacing and\nl have right there the The space before.\n\n297\n00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:09.245\nRemember, we talked about this in\nthe paragraph formatting episode,\n\n298\n00:16:09.245 --> 00:16:11.645\nI'm a fan of space after, not before.\n\n299\n00:16:11.645 --> 00:16:15.580\nBut this is the default, so I'm like,\nthat's fine, I'll leave it there.\n\n300\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.242\nBut just let you know that if you\ndid need to change it, you have more\n\n301\n00:16:20.242 --> 00:16:25.343\noptions in the Options options options,\n[LAUGH], so I'll cancel that.\n\n302\n00:16:25.343 --> 00:16:28.889\nWe are gonna stick with some easy stuff\nright here, like let's just make it,\n\n303\n00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:30.105\nI said, purple, right?\n\n304\n00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:35.229\nYeah, and let's make it centered,\ncuz I'm changing it at the style level.\n\n305\n00:16:35.229 --> 00:16:38.325\nI click OK and then, yep, you guessed it,\n\n306\n00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:42.458\nevery one of the heading 1s\nare going to change this way.\n\n307\n00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.304\nBeautiful, you have-\n&gt;&gt; Easy.\n\n308\n00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:47.172\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, two pages,\nwhat if you had 200 pages?\n\n309\n00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.228\n&gt;&gt; Really easy.\n\n310\n00:16:48.228 --> 00:16:52.219\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, so that's the way\nto go, is to use those styles,\n\n311\n00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:55.921\njust use the heading 1,\nif you don't like it, just modify it.\n\n312\n00:16:55.921 --> 00:17:00.163\nYou don't have to go and make your own,\nif you don't want to, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:00.163 --> 00:17:04.734\nBut we'll get around to, well, I really\ndo want to, we're getting to that.\n\n314\n00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:09.255\nSo that's one way that you could\ngo ahead and modify a style.\n\n315\n00:17:09.255 --> 00:17:14.282\nThe other way it's kinda like,\nwe went to the source, and then hit Apply.\n\n316\n00:17:14.282 --> 00:17:19.082\nWell, you can stay here, at where it's\napplied, and it changes the source,\n\n317\n00:17:19.082 --> 00:17:20.627\nI'll show you, [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:17:20.627 --> 00:17:22.796\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Please, please.\n\n319\n00:17:22.796 --> 00:17:25.362\n&gt;&gt; It made sense in my brain\nwhen I explained it, [LAUGH].\n\n320\n00:17:25.362 --> 00:17:28.137\nAll right, so here, heading 2.\n\n321\n00:17:28.137 --> 00:17:33.305\nI'm here at my, well,\ndocument level, if you wanna say.\n\n322\n00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:37.754\nI've selected this text,\nand let's make it red,\n\n323\n00:17:37.754 --> 00:17:42.831\nlet's make it a little bit smaller,\nwe'll make it bold.\n\n324\n00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:48.833\nLet's change the shading for\nfun, red and yellow.\n\n325\n00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:51.953\nOoh, that's just looking not so\ngreat, [LAUGH,] but\n\n326\n00:17:51.953 --> 00:17:53.745\nyou get the idea, so there we go.\n\n327\n00:17:53.745 --> 00:17:58.027\nAnd by the way, I clicked off of\nthat because I have realized that\n\n328\n00:17:58.027 --> 00:18:02.165\nthe shading was only going for\nthe words that I have selected.\n\n329\n00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.971\nSo I just put my cursor where\nI was in the paragraph, and\n\n330\n00:18:04.971 --> 00:18:06.740\nthen clicked the shading button.\n\n331\n00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.059\nAnd that way it went across\nthe entire paragraph,\n\n332\n00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:12.437\ncuz that's the look that I wanted.\n\n333\n00:18:12.437 --> 00:18:13.810\nAnd, you know what, why not?\n\n334\n00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.563\nLet's go ahead and center it.\n\n335\n00:18:15.563 --> 00:18:18.509\nNow, the thing is,\nI just applied overrides,\n\n336\n00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:22.868\nthat direct format that we talked\nabout in the introduction episode.\n\n337\n00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:27.443\nNotice, it's not just heading 2,\nin the purest sense.\n\n338\n00:18:27.443 --> 00:18:32.379\nI have plus this other text formatting and\nthis accent color, and\n\n339\n00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:38.230\nthe centering and aligning, and\nall of that, that's that local override.\n\n340\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.664\nIf I went and changed it the other\nway that I had showed you before,\n\n341\n00:18:40.664 --> 00:18:43.067\nnone of this would change,\nbecause remember local overrides.\n\n342\n00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:48.163\nWhatever's closest wins, so it's going\nto override the style, but I like this.\n\n343\n00:18:48.163 --> 00:18:53.903\nAnd I want this particular formatting\nto be applied to all of the heading 2s,\n\n344\n00:18:53.903 --> 00:18:56.035\nwe're going the other way.\n\n345\n00:18:56.035 --> 00:19:01.856\nNow what you can do is you can take this\nselection and match it to the style.\n\n346\n00:19:01.856 --> 00:19:05.881\nLet me show you,\nif you come up to heading 2, right click,\n\n347\n00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:08.774\ndo you see Update to match selection.\n\n348\n00:19:08.774 --> 00:19:12.292\nCool, so if I click that,\nlook at what just happened,\n\n349\n00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:15.207\nall of the heading 2s\nhave now been changed.\n\n350\n00:19:15.207 --> 00:19:18.100\nDo you see where I'm talking about,\n\n351\n00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.654\ninstead of going this way,\nwe went this way?\n\n352\n00:19:21.654 --> 00:19:23.704\nForwards, backwards, backwards, forwards,\n\n353\n00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.810\nit all gets to the same place,\nbasically, [LAUGH].\n\n354\n00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:31.546\nSo, I usually do that, because I like to\nsee it in the wild, if you want to say.\n\n355\n00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:36.410\nI want to see it on the page, do all the\nformatting, and then say, yep I like that.\n\n356\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:41.194\nLet's make that the new formatting for\nthis particular style that I have.\n\n357\n00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:44.549\n&gt;&gt; Once again, just because I\nlove to hear you repeat yourself.\n\n358\n00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:48.882\nYou did say, it's good to put it all\ndown or lay it all down in the normal,\n\n359\n00:19:48.882 --> 00:19:51.956\nas normal and then go back in and\ndo modifications.\n\n360\n00:19:51.956 --> 00:19:54.603\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and it's always going to be\nnormal, no matter what you start with.\n\n361\n00:19:54.603 --> 00:19:56.124\n&gt;&gt; That's the default.\n\n362\n00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:56.728\n&gt;&gt; The default style.\n\n363\n00:19:56.728 --> 00:19:57.471\n&gt;&gt; The default setting.\n\n364\n00:19:57.471 --> 00:20:02.392\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, so if I took this and\nwent to that other, the File, New, yes,\n\n365\n00:20:02.392 --> 00:20:04.868\nnormal is always your starting point.\n\n366\n00:20:04.868 --> 00:20:06.424\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Always, always, always.\n\n367\n00:20:06.424 --> 00:20:09.907\nSo that's where you type everything\nin normal and then you can move on.\n\n368\n00:20:09.907 --> 00:20:13.316\nAnd yeah, we did talk about those\nstyle overrides, now, another thing,\n\n369\n00:20:13.316 --> 00:20:15.006\nlike let's go back over to this one.\n\n370\n00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:21.793\nWhat if I went to here and here's\nthis heading 1, and I highlighted it,\n\n371\n00:20:21.793 --> 00:20:26.930\nand then I also made it red,\nand I made it a right align.\n\n372\n00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:33.600\nThat is a style override, but I don't\nwant that, I want to clear the overrides.\n\n373\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.792\nThe easiest way to clear an override,\nlet's just click in here.\n\n374\n00:20:36.792 --> 00:20:41.058\nNotice I can see all of that,\njust apply the same heading, or\n\n375\n00:20:41.058 --> 00:20:46.426\nthe same style, sorry, this is\na heading 1, that's why it's a heading.\n\n376\n00:20:46.426 --> 00:20:49.180\nIf I just click on this,\ndo you see how it, notice it says,\n\n377\n00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.718\ndo you want to update the style?\n\n378\n00:20:50.718 --> 00:20:54.236\nNo, do you want to reapply the formatting\nof the style to the selection?\n\n379\n00:20:54.236 --> 00:20:55.691\nYes, that's what I want.\n\n380\n00:20:55.691 --> 00:21:00.390\nAnd notice that, well, it didn't do that,\nso [LAUGH], I want to really just,\n\n381\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.899\nokay, there we go.\n\n382\n00:21:01.899 --> 00:21:05.360\nI know why it wasn't doing it,\nit's that highlighting.\n\n383\n00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.627\nThe highlighting gets you every time, you\nhave to let re-highlight it nothing, okay?\n\n384\n00:21:09.627 --> 00:21:13.515\nBut, what I was trying to get at\nis that I really just wanted to\n\n385\n00:21:13.515 --> 00:21:15.201\napply the regular style.\n\n386\n00:21:15.201 --> 00:21:19.520\nFor example, if I took this and centered\nit, nope, I just want the regular title.\n\n387\n00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.695\nWe go back up to here.\n\n388\n00:21:20.695 --> 00:21:25.035\nWe click title again, it's trying to do\nthe same thing, reapply the formatting and\n\n389\n00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:27.123\nestablish the selection, there we go.\n\n390\n00:21:27.123 --> 00:21:31.115\nAnd so now it went back to the way it\nwas supposed to go, so just go ahead and\n\n391\n00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:31.973\ntake that off.\n\n392\n00:21:31.973 --> 00:21:34.748\nOr the other thing is,\nyou could just clear it all together.\n\n393\n00:21:34.748 --> 00:21:38.436\nYou could just clear the whole thing,\nif it's doing some weird things.\n\n394\n00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:41.964\nLike it's not letting go completely,\njust clear it, and\n\n395\n00:21:41.964 --> 00:21:46.358\nthen reapply it that way, so\nsometimes it's a little easier to do that.\n\n396\n00:21:46.358 --> 00:21:50.053\nAll right, now,\nwhat if l wanted to make my own style?\n\n397\n00:21:50.053 --> 00:21:54.579\nl don't like the whole,\nlet's just use heading 1, and\n\n398\n00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.328\nformat it the way l like it to look.\n\n399\n00:21:57.328 --> 00:22:00.927\nI can make a style called Vonne,\ncuz you know my-\n\n400\n00:22:00.927 --> 00:22:01.612\n&gt;&gt; As you should.\n\n401\n00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.249\n&gt;&gt; Cuz everybody wants to do that, right?\n\n402\n00:22:03.249 --> 00:22:07.915\nEverybody wants their own stuff, and this\ncan be a paragraph or character level,\n\n403\n00:22:07.915 --> 00:22:09.550\ndoesn't matter which one.\n\n404\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.214\nSo what if I take this this text, and\n\n405\n00:22:11.214 --> 00:22:13.437\nI just did an enter just\nto make a new paragraph.\n\n406\n00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:17.091\nI want this to be,\nlet's go with more colors.\n\n407\n00:22:17.091 --> 00:22:20.624\nLet's go with some pink,\nlet's go ahead and make that.\n\n408\n00:22:20.624 --> 00:22:21.158\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't look pink.\n\n409\n00:22:21.158 --> 00:22:22.911\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nope, there we go.\n\n410\n00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:26.185\nLet's go pink, and we'll make it bold.\n\n411\n00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:31.121\nWe'll make it Apple Chancery, just cuz I\ndon't like to scroll through all my fonts\n\n412\n00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:34.732\nwhen I'm teaching, and\nlet's make it a little bit bigger.\n\n413\n00:22:34.732 --> 00:22:38.285\nBeautiful, this needs to be its own style.\n\n414\n00:22:38.285 --> 00:22:41.331\nSo select the text, do your formatting,\n\n415\n00:22:41.331 --> 00:22:45.081\ncome over here to New Style\nwithin the Styles pane.\n\n416\n00:22:45.081 --> 00:22:48.518\nAnd now we get this dialog\nbox again of where we can go.\n\n417\n00:22:48.518 --> 00:22:52.024\nSo now let's give it a name,\nlet's go with Vonne.\n\n418\n00:22:52.024 --> 00:22:52.639\n&gt;&gt; Vonne's style.\n\n419\n00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:55.786\n&gt;&gt; Vonne's style, there we go, yeah.\n\n420\n00:22:55.786 --> 00:22:57.504\nWhat type do you want it to be?\n\n421\n00:22:57.504 --> 00:23:01.509\nDo you want it to be a paragraph or\na character?\n\n422\n00:23:01.509 --> 00:23:03.065\nI would just keep it as paragraph.\n\n423\n00:23:03.065 --> 00:23:05.402\nCuz remember that whole\nyou can break the rule and\n\n424\n00:23:05.402 --> 00:23:08.258\nyou can still just select\nindividual words and apply this.\n\n425\n00:23:08.258 --> 00:23:11.370\nSo I would go ahead and keep it this way.\n\n426\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.473\nI get a little bit more specific if I know\nI'm only gonna ever use it as a character\n\n427\n00:23:15.473 --> 00:23:18.305\nstyle, I'll go ahead and\nchange it, but it's okay.\n\n428\n00:23:18.305 --> 00:23:23.876\nWe could take that, now,\nthese next two, Styles based on and\n\n429\n00:23:23.876 --> 00:23:27.744\nStyles following, they're important.\n\n430\n00:23:27.744 --> 00:23:30.382\nAnd a lot of people overlook them, and\n\n431\n00:23:30.382 --> 00:23:33.523\nI think it's why people\nget tripped up on it.\n\n432\n00:23:33.523 --> 00:23:36.135\nNotice it says, Styles based on normal.\n\n433\n00:23:36.135 --> 00:23:42.634\nOkay, if I keep that,\nwhat that means is that if normal changes,\n\n434\n00:23:42.634 --> 00:23:46.305\nthis has the potential of changing.\n\n435\n00:23:48.755 --> 00:23:49.858\n&gt;&gt; It has the potential.\n\n436\n00:23:49.858 --> 00:23:51.785\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very, yes, it's.\n\n437\n00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:52.482\n&gt;&gt; It could possibly do it?\n\n438\n00:23:52.482 --> 00:23:55.663\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, so\nit's like, eh, okay.\n\n439\n00:23:55.663 --> 00:23:59.359\nLet me try to demonstrate this, so\nit can really drive the point home, and\n\n440\n00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:02.054\nthen I'll talk about the other\none in a minute, too.\n\n441\n00:24:02.054 --> 00:24:05.391\nSo let's just click OK Everything's great.\n\n442\n00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:09.981\nAll right, so if I change the normal\nstyle it could like I said,\n\n443\n00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:12.592\nit could potentially change this.\n\n444\n00:24:12.592 --> 00:24:13.300\nLet me show you.\n\n445\n00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.971\nI'm going to right click, go to Modify,\n\n446\n00:24:17.971 --> 00:24:21.713\nand I'm going to make this Bold.\n\n447\n00:24:21.713 --> 00:24:23.490\nWe'll make it Center.\n\n448\n00:24:26.495 --> 00:24:29.540\nLook at how that centered itself too,\ndidn't it?\n\n449\n00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.340\nWhy?\n\n450\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:36.793\nBecause the Vonne style is\nbased off of the normal style.\n\n451\n00:24:36.793 --> 00:24:44.430\nNow that's not Bold, notice the B is not\nchanged on this, but the centering is.\n\n452\n00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:48.050\nAnd that's why I'm saying it's not\nnecessarily going to change all of it.\n\n453\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.380\nBecause in the Vonne style,\nlet me go up to Modify,\n\n454\n00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.250\nI didn't specify whether it was Left,\nCentered, or Right.\n\n455\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.170\nIf I had specified that\nit was right aligned,\n\n456\n00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.950\nthen when I went to the normal and\nmade it centered it wouldn't have changed.\n\n457\n00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:09.435\nBecause it was like two competing\nlevels or two of the same things.\n\n458\n00:25:09.435 --> 00:25:15.650\nThe alignment well I specifically\nsaid that Vonne was right.\n\n459\n00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.250\nSo change the normal to center\nwouldn't have applied it.\n\n460\n00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.660\nJust like the font right?\n\n461\n00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:25.300\nI said, the font in here is\nApple Chancery, not Bold.\n\n462\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.340\nSo by me making normal Bold,\nit didn't change this one.\n\n463\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.580\nSo it has to be where if there\nis something on the same,\n\n464\n00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:38.989\nalmost like a line item, if it's on the\nsame line or the same type of formatting,\n\n465\n00:25:38.989 --> 00:25:43.922\nthat has a specific thing,\nhere in the cell not gonna change.\n\n466\n00:25:43.922 --> 00:25:48.910\nIf it's left open, if it's left blank\nnot defined, then it's gonna take\n\n467\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.990\nwhatever the normal style definition and\nthat's what's going to happen.\n\n468\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.000\nSo that's where it can get a little weird.\n\n469\n00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000\nSome people like this.\n\n470\n00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.890\nSome people say, yes,\nI want it to be when I change the normal,\n\n471\n00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.420\nchange anything that's based off of it.\n\n472\n00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.140\nThere's other times that was like,\nI don't want you to have any,\n\n473\n00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.150\nI don't have anything to do with that,\nokay?\n\n474\n00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:11.080\nI want absolutely no connection\nto any other style so\n\n475\n00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.035\nthat way it is completely autonomous.\n\n476\n00:26:14.035 --> 00:26:19.620\nAnything that changes somewhere else is\nnot going to affect this particular style.\n\n477\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.580\nThat tends to be how I go\nwith things more than not,\n\n478\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.270\nso just letting you know\nthat let me Undo this, okay?\n\n479\n00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.740\nLet me go ahead and just Undo back\nto where it were all left aligned,\n\n480\n00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.315\nif I come back up into the Vonne style and\nI'm gonna modify.\n\n481\n00:26:36.315 --> 00:26:41.544\nLet's go with\n\n482\n00:26:41.544 --> 00:26:46.360\n[LAUGH]\nI forgot where I was going honestly.\n\n483\n00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.920\n[LAUGH] I wanna make this\nbased off of no style, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.928\nNo style at all, click OK.\n\n485\n00:26:52.928 --> 00:26:58.740\nAnd one other thing that I needed to point\nout that I didn't really tell you about\n\n486\n00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:04.746\nbefore, is that notice here that it still\nsays that it's normal plus all of this.\n\n487\n00:27:04.746 --> 00:27:10.452\nIt's weird, when you go ahead and\nmake a new style off your selected text,\n\n488\n00:27:10.452 --> 00:27:13.457\nit doesn't apply the style to itself.\n\n489\n00:27:13.457 --> 00:27:14.520\nIt's a weird thing.\n\n490\n00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.790\nSo you have to come back and make sure\nthat you click on the style itself and\n\n491\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.639\nokay, good.\n\n492\n00:27:19.639 --> 00:27:23.719\nNow that's permanently attached to\nthe Vonne style not the normal plus\n\n493\n00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:27.010\nthe overrides, it's a small little thing.\n\n494\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.957\nYou make it then you apply it.\n\n495\n00:27:28.957 --> 00:27:32.314\nAll right, so now coming back here to\nnormal just to whoops that's not what I\n\n496\n00:27:32.314 --> 00:27:33.240\nwanted to do [LAUGH].\n\n497\n00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.590\nBut that is how you can\nselect them if you want to.\n\n498\n00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:39.490\nIf I right click go to\nModify make this Centered,\n\n499\n00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.160\nclick OK that didn't change did it?\n\n500\n00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.700\nNope, because it's not\nbased off the normal style.\n\n501\n00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.540\nSo that's why it didn't change.\n\n502\n00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:52.069\nJust trying to again demonstrate,\nreally demonstrate why that based on is so\n\n503\n00:27:52.069 --> 00:27:57.869\nimportant to understand the concept of it\nand whether you want it or not, right?\n\n504\n00:27:57.869 --> 00:28:01.790\nI mean, that's up to you but\nyou just understanding what it does.\n\n505\n00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.650\nThe other one that's in that style\ndefinition dialogue box was that.\n\n506\n00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.060\nWhat about the next style?\n\n507\n00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.560\nThis is kind of the big one, because\nthat whole applying as we go, right?\n\n508\n00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.360\nIf I hit, Enter and I start typing,\ntype, type, type, type, type.\n\n509\n00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.706\nI'm in the Vonne style and I hit, Enter,\nI'm still pink and Apple Chancery.\n\n510\n00:28:23.706 --> 00:28:28.150\nI really wanna be when I type\nthat one paragraph and hit Enter.\n\n511\n00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:33.280\nThe next thing that I want it to be is\nnot the same thing that it came from.\n\n512\n00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.147\nI want it to go back to being normal\nagain, so that's where the next style or\n\n513\n00:28:38.147 --> 00:28:43.344\nstyle following paragraph once you hit\nEnter, what do you want it to go back to?\n\n514\n00:28:43.344 --> 00:28:47.398\nDo you want it to continue on\nwith what you already have or\n\n515\n00:28:47.398 --> 00:28:54.090\ndo you wanna go back to a different style,\nnormal which is usually the default.\n\n516\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.990\nThen you click OK, type, type,\ntype, comma, catch up, type,\n\n517\n00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.786\ntype, type, type, type.\n\n518\n00:28:58.786 --> 00:28:59.912\nBack to normal [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:28:59.912 --> 00:29:01.470\n&gt;&gt; Ye hey.\n\n520\n00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:06.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a big difference and I do\nthat a lot, especially if I'm using my\n\n521\n00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.900\nheadings because I tend to assign\nkeyboard shortcuts to my headings.\n\n522\n00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.740\nI just told you that I type everything\nfirst, and then go back and\n\n523\n00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.220\napply once you get pretty good with it.\n\n524\n00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.200\nI'll go ahead and type, use a keyboard\nshortcut to apply that heading, hit Enter,\n\n525\n00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.030\nand then keep on going on my normal.\n\n526\n00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.780\nAnd just to show you where that assigning\nkeyboard shortcuts in case you're like,\n\n527\n00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:28.620\nwhere is that?\n\n528\n00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.410\nIt's down here.\n\n529\n00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:34.230\nNotice there is a shortcut key that\nyou can assign to any of your styles.\n\n530\n00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.040\nSo that way, if you are a formatting\nas you type type person,\n\n531\n00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.852\nyou use your shortcut keys.\n\n532\n00:29:39.852 --> 00:29:45.491\nAnd then having what style follows\nyour paragraphs after you hit Enter,\n\n533\n00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:50.380\nyou can get pretty quick on\nmaking everything look cool.\n\n534\n00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.710\nAnd as you go, and it's pretty,\npretty nice that way.\n\n535\n00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:55.620\n&gt;&gt; Impressive.\n\n536\n00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:00.879\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty impressive I will say,\nso but again just to kind of recap.\n\n537\n00:30:00.879 --> 00:30:07.286\nRemember, cells are document specific if I\ncome over here to this other document two,\n\n538\n00:30:07.286 --> 00:30:14.060\nthis other Blank Document, notice that in\nmy styles pane there is no Vonne style.\n\n539\n00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.570\nThe heading1 is back to\njust being blue and normal.\n\n540\n00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:22.020\nMy normal paragraph style does\nnot have that space after.\n\n541\n00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:27.580\nSo any New Document,\nthey're not going to have the same styles\n\n542\n00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:32.200\nas the other ones because they're document\nspecific, so, just keeping that in mind.\n\n543\n00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.400\nBut if you can just start\napplying even just the defaults.\n\n544\n00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.957\nYou know how to modify the defaults.\n\n545\n00:30:37.957 --> 00:30:39.710\nYou know how to make your own.\n\n546\n00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:40.990\nYou know how to apply them.\n\n547\n00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.190\nYou know the whole concept of it.\n\n548\n00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:47.560\nYou're sitting there going,\nthis is really cool.\n\n549\n00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.950\n&gt;&gt; It is really cool.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna totally use this.\n\n550\n00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:55.530\nAnd you start going and stylizing your\ndocuments, and it's good stuff so.\n\n551\n00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.920\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\nwonderful job Vonne, as usual.\n\n552\n00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.120\nShe got me excited about doing this,\nand I'll

00:00:16.140\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.208\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with Word 2016, Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:24.370\nThis would be styles applied\npart two this episode.\n\n6\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.050\nAnd we've asked Vonne Smith, could you\nplease, pretty please, help us with this?\n\n7\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.800\nAnd she said she would absolutely do that.\n\n8\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.320\nVonne, great to have you back,\nthanks so much.\n\n9\n00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.220\n&gt;&gt; I always love to help everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah she does.\n\n11\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.190\n&gt;&gt; Especially with styles cuz it's one\nof my favorite subjects in Word, and\n\n12\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.820\nreally anywhere, any program.\n\n13\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.550\nYou guys have heard me say that before.\n\n14\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.550\nSo, I had to come back with a part two\nbecause I felt there was just like\n\n15\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.720\na little bit of extra something I wanted\nto let you all know about styles.\n\n16\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.520\nAnd especially with copying and\npasting them into other documents,\n\n17\n00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.680\nbecause it's something I\nknow I do all the time.\n\n18\n00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.410\nAnd we did talk about copy and\n\n19\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.480\npaste in the other episode where we\ntalked about the paste options and\n\n20\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.900\nhow important they are, and\nunderstanding what that smart tag does.\n\n21\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.890\nBut I want to just take it a little\nfurther with styles because\n\n22\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.440\nthere are some nuances that you should\njust be aware of and just to kind of okay.\n\n23\n00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.970\nI know why that's doing that.\n\n24\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.080\nAnd when if you don't want it to do\nthat how to well, make it not do that.\n\n25\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.270\n&gt;&gt; Make it not do [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n26\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.220\nSo it's all just being aware.\n\n27\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.660\n&gt;&gt; So you could make it do that and\nmake it not do that.\n\n28\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.280\nExactly that's usually a question\nof like okay that's how it works.\n\n29\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.040\nAnd everybody goes well can we\nmake it do something different or\n\n30\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.670\nnot do what it's supposed to do?\n\n31\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.605\nAnd I can actually tell\nyou how that works.\n\n32\n00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:43.700\n[LAUGH] So\nI just wanted to kind of come back.\n\n33\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.710\nAnd I also wanted to get\ninto some list styles.\n\n34\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.346\nAnd say that we're going to make list\nstyles but not actually use a list.\n\n35\n00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:53.837\nI'll show you.\n\n36\n00:01:53.837 --> 00:01:56.910\n[LAUGH] So anyway that's why part two.\n\n37\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.806\nI left our part one and just like.\n\n38\n00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.280\nI need a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n39\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.400\nSo here we are.\n\n40\n00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.990\nWhy don't we jump down into my computer.\n\n41\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.482\nAnd I have a couple of files that\nwe're gonna be working with.\n\n42\n00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:11.400\nI have styles, apply list copy so\nI know which file I'm using,\n\n43\n00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.560\nwhen I'm doing this particular episode.\n\n44\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.000\nAnd I'm using my command today to\nswitch to my other open document which\n\n45\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.280\nis styles example copy paste.\n\n46\n00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.460\nAnd in this document,\n\n47\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.850\nlet's look at this one first,\nI have done some style redefinition.\n\n48\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.130\nI took this title right here and let's\nopen up that styles thing because it's\n\n49\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.390\nalways good to go ahead and give us\na little view into what we're doing.\n\n50\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.720\nSo you can see this is the title and\nthere's no overrides in this.\n\n51\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.020\nI went ahead and\ndid some formatting to it, and\n\n52\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.840\nthen said I want to match\nstyles to selection.\n\n53\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.300\nRemember we did something to\nthe effect of where if I changed let's\n\n54\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.580\nsay like the color here.\n\n55\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.180\nNow I have that override.\n\n56\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.950\nI just went into the title, and\nwe'll come up here and do it.\n\n57\n00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.640\nAnd I right-clicked on it, and\ndid the Update to Match Selection.\n\n58\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.710\nAnd just in case you hear me keep saying\nredefine style, because in InDesign and\n\n59\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.600\nsome other of the Adobe applications,\nthat's what they call it.\n\n60\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.480\nIt says redefine style, but\nit does the same thing.\n\n61\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.440\nIn your Office products they\ncall update to match selection.\n\n62\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.120\nSo just in case you hear me using\nthat terminology, that's what I mean.\n\n63\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.510\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and undo that,\njust cuz I kinda wanna keep it yellow.\n\n64\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.170\nI'm not feeling the orange with the green.\n\n65\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.530\nSo that's what we have here.\n\n66\n00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.520\nI also did the same thing\nwith the Heading one.\n\n67\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.520\nYou can see, still just straight\nHeading one but I made it purple and\n\n68\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.950\ncentered and bold.\n\n69\n00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.490\nHeading two is the way it is\nnormally in a new document, or\n\n70\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.040\nin this particular style set, if we'll\ngo ahead and throw that topic back in.\n\n71\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.210\nAnd then I made my own right here.\n\n72\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.040\nYou know what?\n\n73\n00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.985\nThis is one of those things.\n\n74\n00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:53.530\n[LAUGH] Always being aware,\nI made my own style.\n\n75\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.850\nYou can see it says Vonne Pink.\n\n76\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.400\nBut look at over here.\n\n77\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.570\nIt doesn't say Vonne Pink.\n\n78\n00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.310\nIt's not actually attached to it.\n\n79\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.980\nThis is a thing that happens that I kind\nof, I mentioned it really quickly, but\n\n80\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.240\ncoming back to re-emphasize it, It's\none of these weird things that happens.\n\n81\n00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.380\nLet's just go over this one more time.\n\n82\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.240\nLet's take this and make it.\n\n83\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.210\nWe'll make this one orange, bold.\n\n84\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.110\nAnd we'll change this to\nthis particular font.\n\n85\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.920\nAnd make it a little bit bigger,\njust to kinda get some formatting.\n\n86\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.150\nI wanna make this into my own style.\n\n87\n00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.130\nWanna make a new style.\n\n88\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.350\nSo I do the formatting, come over to the\nnew cell, just a little bit of a review,\n\n89\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.150\nand I say my new style because\nI can't think of anything else.\n\n90\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.120\nAnd we do want it a paragraph.\n\n91\n00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.730\nAnd I don't want it based on anything\nto have it not connected to normal and\n\n92\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.280\nthe following style meaning after I\nhit enter we'll just go ahead and\n\n93\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.560\ndo that to be normal and I click OK.\n\n94\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.840\nTake note though.\n\n95\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.940\nI made the style but look.\n\n96\n00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.770\nThis text did not get\nattached to that style.\n\n97\n00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.450\nIt's still showing the normal\nplus all the overrides.\n\n98\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.450\nIt's one of those weird\nthings that I would assume,\n\n99\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.590\nhey I'm making this into a style,\nthen go ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.110\napply this style to the text\nthat I actually have selected.\n\n101\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.440\nYou gotta get one extra step of then\nattaching the style to that text where\n\n102\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.320\nnow I have applied the My News\nstyle to the text that I use.\n\n103\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.650\nStyle, weird kinda circular thing that\ndoesn't actually connect sometimes.\n\n104\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.522\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of circles\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:31.522 --> 00:05:32.237\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n106\n00:05:32.237 --> 00:05:36.380\na lot of times of how I explain\nit kinda doing a couple circles.\n\n107\n00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.220\n&gt;&gt; But here again,\n\n108\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.120\nthough, because we're doing this on\nthe wonderful method of taping it.\n\n109\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.280\nWe have it on video.\n\n110\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.910\nWe can review this and\nalso there will be show notes, too,\n\n111\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.780\nbecause you're awesome about all that.\n\n112\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.100\nYeah, I do like to provide all\nthe files as much as possible.\n\n113\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.280\nI mean, the notes are in my talk,\n\n114\n00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.824\nso sometimes if somebody else is\ndoing them, I don't understand that.\n\n115\n00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:55.781\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's Vonne speak.\n\n116\n00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:59.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] exactly, so you have\nto kinda translate it a little bit.\n\n117\n00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.950\nBut anyway, I just wanted to point that\nout, and that's what happened here.\n\n118\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.520\nNotice that this paragraph is still\nusing that, so let me go ahead and\n\n119\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.840\nattach that Vonne Pink style to this\nparticular document that's always good.\n\n120\n00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.040\nAnd I just used the style paint over here\ninstead of using it up in the ribbon,\n\n121\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.500\njust a different place to go to it.\n\n122\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.400\nAll right, so\nnow I've got this all set up.\n\n123\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.670\nCopying and pasting with styles attached.\n\n124\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.240\nLets move over to this file.\n\n125\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.660\nSo this one over here,\nit has a style, wait, a title style.\n\n126\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.650\nIt has a heading one and I have a heading\ntwo that in this particular file I went\n\n127\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.930\nahead and did some customization to it.\n\n128\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.940\nSo as you can see it Orange and the.\n\n129\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.850\nAll that wonderful stuff.\n\n130\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.230\nWhen I'm here and\nI select text that has a style.\n\n131\n00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.478\nLet's start with this one.\n\n132\n00:06:55.478 --> 00:06:56.850\nThis is Vonne Pink.\n\n133\n00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.410\nThis is the one that I made, right?\n\n134\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.970\nCustom style that does not\nlive in this document.\n\n135\n00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.740\nDoesn't exist, if I take this,\nselect the paragraph or\n\n136\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.950\ntext, copy it, and I'm gonna do a Cmd+C.\n\n137\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.780\nI'll right click so\nyou guys can see what I'm doing.\n\n138\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.850\nSo I'll go ahead and copy it,\nCmd+tilde to switch my document.\n\n139\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.350\nLet's come down here and\nlet's just enter a few times,\n\n140\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.980\nlet's zoom in just a little bit.\n\n141\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.550\nAnd now I'm just going to paste or Cmd+V.\n\n142\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.900\nNow when I paste it\nautomatically it doesn't really,\n\n143\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.840\nit doesn't bring over my style at first.\n\n144\n00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.830\nSo this is where understanding this paste\noption is going to be really important.\n\n145\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.080\nNotice if I say,\nthis is saying keep the source formatting,\n\n146\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.050\nwell it's not actually doing that.\n\n147\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.570\nSo let's go ahead,\nyou know what let's try this again\n\n148\n00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.000\nbecause that was not the way it's suppose\nto work, lets try it one more time.\n\n149\n00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.423\nAll right, so let's take this, and\nwe will select it, we will copy it, CMD+C.\n\n150\n00:07:57.423 --> 00:08:00.109\nCome over here, CMD+V,\nthat's what I was trying to get it to do.\n\n151\n00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:03.343\nI don't know exactly why it tripped\nup a little bit that first time,\n\n152\n00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:04.323\ncuz I'm like wait.\n\n153\n00:08:04.323 --> 00:08:06.388\n&gt;&gt; It wanted to make\nsure you were serious.\n\n154\n00:08:06.388 --> 00:08:10.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it really wanted\nto kinda test me, and like, wait,\n\n155\n00:08:10.238 --> 00:08:13.112\nI'm gonna do it the way\nwe don't normally do it.\n\n156\n00:08:13.112 --> 00:08:17.310\n[LAUGH] This is the way it's supposed\nto do it and look what happened.\n\n157\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:23.170\nIt pasted it in, and\nit also brought in that style.\n\n158\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.833\nSee, Vonne pink now lives in this\ndocument, remember we said document,\n\n159\n00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:28.322\nstyle of document specific.\n\n160\n00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:30.017\nGreat, so that sounds like fun.\n\n161\n00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:34.727\nAny style that does not already currently\nexist into the documents that your\n\n162\n00:08:34.727 --> 00:08:38.039\ndestination document normally,\nit will go ahead and\n\n163\n00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:42.913\nbring in that style and retain all of\nthe formatting and everything's great.\n\n164\n00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:45.506\nWonderful, now of course\nyou could mask for\n\n165\n00:08:45.506 --> 00:08:48.109\ndestination format and keep the text only.\n\n166\n00:08:48.109 --> 00:08:51.945\nIf you do keep the text only then notice\nthat none of the style comes over.\n\n167\n00:08:51.945 --> 00:08:55.381\n&gt;&gt; Gee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you didn't want the style\n\n168\n00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:59.717\nto come in you can erase it and\njust have it to be text or\n\n169\n00:08:59.717 --> 00:09:05.159\nyou could go ahead and\nthen do the match destination formatting.\n\n170\n00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:09.818\nThe destination formatting,\nremember Vonne Pink doesn't live in there.\n\n171\n00:09:09.818 --> 00:09:15.818\nSo if I do that, it just turns it back\nto normal with the bold overwrite or\n\n172\n00:09:15.818 --> 00:09:18.419\nthe bold, just the boldness.\n\n173\n00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:19.404\n&gt;&gt; Boldness.\n\n174\n00:09:19.404 --> 00:09:20.280\n&gt;&gt; They call a bold.\n\n175\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.078\n&gt;&gt; The bolden.\n\n176\n00:09:21.078 --> 00:09:22.525\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nI can't remember what they called it.\n\n177\n00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:23.350\n[LAUGH] That's okay.\n\n178\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.235\nYou got it, it's bold.\n\n179\n00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:26.180\nSo wonderful, great.\n\n180\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.270\nIt's brought in the style\ninto this document.\n\n181\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:36.018\nBut when you have conflicting styles,\nmeaning this one right here our title.\n\n182\n00:09:36.018 --> 00:09:41.546\nThe title in this document is different\nthan the title in this document.\n\n183\n00:09:41.546 --> 00:09:46.040\nSo what's going to happen when that goes?\n\n184\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.567\nLet me put this back to normal so\nwe can see it.\n\n185\n00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:50.470\nSo let's go ahead and select this text.\n\n186\n00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.832\nWe will copy it, or\nright click so you can see it.\n\n187\n00:09:52.832 --> 00:09:59.014\nClip it on over to here and\nthen let's go ahead and paste And notice.\n\n188\n00:09:59.014 --> 00:10:00.850\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, what did it do?\n\n189\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.485\nDid you see what it did there, Zack?\n\n190\n00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:08.020\n&gt;&gt; It just duplicated the title\nstyle that was on the page already.\n\n191\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nYes, because it said, it's a title.\n\n192\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.126\nYou're coming into a document\nthat has a title, and\n\n193\n00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:19.926\nI'm going to match it to this\nparticular document's style definition.\n\n194\n00:10:19.926 --> 00:10:23.182\nWhich it could be good or bad,\ndepending on which way you like it.\n\n195\n00:10:23.182 --> 00:10:26.810\nBut this is where it is using\nthe destination styles.\n\n196\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.030\nThat's the default way\nof how it's pasting in.\n\n197\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:34.190\nBut I really like the formatting\nwith the green and the yellow.\n\n198\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.805\nSo you could keep the source formatting,\nand it still does that.\n\n199\n00:10:37.805 --> 00:10:45.358\nBut it does not change\nthe title style definition.\n\n200\n00:10:45.358 --> 00:10:48.469\nSo there's no I'm taking this title,\n\n201\n00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:53.870\nkeeping it in the way it's formatting,\nand redefining this one.\n\n202\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.207\nNo, it doesn't do that.\n\n203\n00:10:55.207 --> 00:10:58.725\nTitle stays as it's formatted\nwithin this document.\n\n204\n00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.435\nAnd now this text becomes, look,\n\n205\n00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:06.388\nan overwriting definition where\nit's still normal plus all of\n\n206\n00:11:06.388 --> 00:11:11.447\nthose other customizations that\nyou have which is what it does.\n\n207\n00:11:11.447 --> 00:11:15.634\nAgain, just being aware of\nhow everything kinda works.\n\n208\n00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:19.861\nNo conflict or\nany definition brings in the style.\n\n209\n00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:26.627\nAlready used styles that has a conflict,\n\\you can have it mask the destination.\n\n210\n00:11:26.627 --> 00:11:31.534\nOr keep the source formatting but\nit doesn't take the style with it.\n\n211\n00:11:31.534 --> 00:11:36.534\nNow of course, if you're like but\nreally want this formatting to\n\n212\n00:11:36.534 --> 00:11:41.478\nbe the new definition style definition for\nthis document's title.\n\n213\n00:11:41.478 --> 00:11:43.784\nYou can keep your cursor in here.\n\n214\n00:11:43.784 --> 00:11:48.465\nCome over to the title and I'm just\ndoing it through the styles panel.\n\n215\n00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:52.134\nI can then drop this down right here and\nI can match the update or\n\n216\n00:11:52.134 --> 00:11:54.970\nupdate match selections\nright behind my head.\n\n217\n00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.367\nSo you can see that if I click on this,\nthen, now, the title,\n\n218\n00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:02.341\ndefinition, matches what I brought in.\n\n219\n00:12:02.341 --> 00:12:03.739\n&gt;&gt; It's magical.\n\n220\n00:12:03.739 --> 00:12:08.597\nYeah, so small little things\nthat I think people overlook,\n\n221\n00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:14.314\nthat's why we're going to slow it down and\nreally re-emphasizing all\n\n222\n00:12:14.314 --> 00:12:19.479\nthe different things that happen\nwithin your documents there.\n\n223\n00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:24.724\nAnd so just one more you can see the\nheading to in this particular document,\n\n224\n00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:28.399\nthe Apply list copy,\nit's regular if we wanna say.\n\n225\n00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:33.357\nSelecting this, copying it,\nCmd+C, Cmd+tilde.\n\n226\n00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:38.540\nComing down here, and\nthen we'll just do a Cmd+V.\n\n227\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.340\nIt's saying, okay what do you want to do?\n\n228\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.466\nThis is where we can\nmatch the destination.\n\n229\n00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:47.070\nKeep the source formatting, but\nit's not really keeping the heading, too.\n\n230\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.845\nThis is where I think Word is wanting\nto just kind of mess with me again.\n\n231\n00:12:50.845 --> 00:12:51.857\nBut that's all right.\n\n232\n00:12:51.857 --> 00:12:55.286\nWe could always bring it in and\nsay well I really want the heading too,\n\n233\n00:12:55.286 --> 00:12:56.066\nto be applied.\n\n234\n00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:58.697\n[CROSSTALK] So\nthere's other ways to go about it.\n\n235\n00:12:58.697 --> 00:13:01.840\nJust watch what happens when you copy and\npaste.\n\n236\n00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.940\nUnderstand these paste options and\nwhat you can do with it.\n\n237\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.870\n&gt;&gt; So, question from the peanut gallery.\n\n238\n00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:11.790\nCan you take the entire page,\ncopy the entire page?\n\n239\n00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.529\nOr no?\nAnd then keep all your styles,\n\n240\n00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:16.240\nall you're different\nstyles from that one page.\n\n241\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.739\n&gt;&gt; From this one?\n\n242\n00:13:17.739 --> 00:13:18.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n243\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.462\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can select and copy anything.\n\n244\n00:13:21.462 --> 00:13:24.016\n&gt;&gt; But you can't put it into\nanother document that's already got\n\n245\n00:13:24.016 --> 00:13:25.880\nestablished styles?\n\n246\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.119\nWell there would be a lot of it,\nso let's do it.\n\n247\n00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:34.173\nSo right here, okay, and I'm gonna do\na Command Enter to get out of here.\n\n248\n00:13:34.173 --> 00:13:36.319\nLet's put this back to\nnormal to start with.\n\n249\n00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:41.735\nAnd then I paste It will retain all of,\nor at least most,\n\n250\n00:13:41.735 --> 00:13:47.171\nsee, that went back to heading\none cuz it's matching.\n\n251\n00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:50.772\nAnd heading two is\nmatching the destination.\n\n252\n00:13:50.772 --> 00:13:53.122\nSo it kind of does like\na whole hodge-podge of it.\n\n253\n00:13:53.122 --> 00:13:55.858\nSo It's totally possible and\n\n254\n00:13:55.858 --> 00:14:00.790\nit will do all of the things\nthat we just talked about.\n\n255\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:06.045\nThe heading one matched the, cuz remember\nit was purple here, and it's blue here.\n\n256\n00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:11.956\nSo it's going blue, the down down down,\nit brought that over, right?\n\n257\n00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:18.484\nThe heading two that looked like this,\nnormal or blue in this document.\n\n258\n00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:20.379\nIn the Paste, it goes to orange.\n\n259\n00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:22.510\nSo you see,\nit did everything that we talked about.\n\n260\n00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.869\n&gt;&gt; It just gets sketchy if\nyou try to do it that way.\n\n261\n00:14:24.869 --> 00:14:26.194\n&gt;&gt; It's just a lot more to deal with.\n\n262\n00:14:26.194 --> 00:14:26.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n263\n00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.695\n&gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong with it.\n\n264\n00:14:29.695 --> 00:14:32.259\nIf you're like,\nthis is exactly what I want it to do.\n\n265\n00:14:32.259 --> 00:14:34.120\nPerfect, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.501\nIt's just that if you wanted\nto kinda do pieces of it,\n\n267\n00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:41.270\nit might be easier to do it in pieces or\ndo it the whole thing.\n\n268\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.321\nThe other thing that you can\nalways do is if this is like, man,\n\n269\n00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:46.446\nthis is getting like way too complicated.\n\n270\n00:14:46.446 --> 00:14:51.070\nCan I just go back to having\nit all be regular or whatever?\n\n271\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.009\nYou could just select it all.\n\n272\n00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:55.659\nYou could,\nyou could clear all the formattings.\n\n273\n00:14:55.659 --> 00:15:00.111\nJust have it just straight text, and\nthen you reformat it after the fact.\n\n274\n00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:01.964\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Coming in back into like,\n\n275\n00:15:01.964 --> 00:15:05.106\nokay here lemme go back\nheading ones as regular, so.\n\n276\n00:15:05.106 --> 00:15:10.464\nI mean because styles it's more like, okay\nget the definition and then just apply it.\n\n277\n00:15:10.464 --> 00:15:13.057\nSo it's really kind of, what is it,\nhalf dozen which way or the other?\n\n278\n00:15:13.057 --> 00:15:14.944\n&gt;&gt; Six of one and\nhalf a dozen of the other.\n\n279\n00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:17.409\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I can never say that word,\nthat saying properly.\n\n280\n00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:18.636\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, I'm older than you Missy.\n\n281\n00:15:18.636 --> 00:15:20.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I know these things.\n\n282\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.600\n&gt;&gt; Well Daniel does the same thing,\nI'm like, I'll just go ahead and say it.\n\n283\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.258\nAnd he's like, that's not right.\n\n284\n00:15:24.258 --> 00:15:26.753\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can lead a horse to water but\n\n285\n00:15:26.753 --> 00:15:28.215\nthere's two birds in the bush.\n\n286\n00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:30.116\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH], exactly, [LAUGH].\n\n287\n00:15:30.116 --> 00:15:31.019\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n288\n00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:35.280\n&gt;&gt; It's really just being aware of what it\ndoes to your styles, what you want it to\n\n289\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.240\ndo, whether redefining it,\nnot redefining it, and so on and so forth.\n\n290\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.013\nSo it's pretty cool.\n\n291\n00:15:41.013 --> 00:15:41.992\n&gt;&gt; Options, options.\n\n292\n00:15:41.992 --> 00:15:42.545\n&gt;&gt; Options, options.\n\n293\n00:15:42.545 --> 00:15:47.333\nAnd actually I still have a copy, if I\ndo a command N, which is file new, and\n\n294\n00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:48.330\nthen paste it.\n\n295\n00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:53.077\nNotice everything's coming over\nbecause it all just matches and\n\n296\n00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:55.761\nlook at all of my styles right there.\n\n297\n00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:57.887\nHow all the styles work, my heading ones,\n\n298\n00:15:57.887 --> 00:16:01.389\ncuz there's nothing in there to begin\nwith which is a blank document.\n\n299\n00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:05.055\nSo it's like [SOUND] I'm gonna\njust do exactly what you said.\n\n300\n00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:07.371\nOr we can go ahead.\n\n301\n00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:08.382\nLet's do that.\n\n302\n00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:09.842\nLet's get rid of all that.\n\n303\n00:16:09.842 --> 00:16:11.803\nOops, wrong one.\n\n304\n00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:14.706\nWell let's just go ahead and,\nlet's [LAUGH].\n\n305\n00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:18.060\nThere we go, trying to get there.\n\n306\n00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.910\nIf I pasted it, you should have down here.\n\n307\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.260\nYou still have your paste options for\nthe whole document.\n\n308\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.400\nAnd I can keep the source formatting,\nI can match the destination formatting.\n\n309\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.275\nAnd notice then that goes to\na completely different look.\n\n310\n00:16:32.275 --> 00:16:35.100\nBut, options, options.\n\n311\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.097\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n312\n00:16:36.097 --> 00:16:40.544\n&gt;&gt; And it's up to you how you want\nto determine what you want to do.\n\n313\n00:16:40.544 --> 00:16:43.420\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, more circles, [LAUGH] All right.\n\n314\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.720\n&gt;&gt; But they're happy little circles.\n\n315\n00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.565\nThey can paint them just so they look\nlike clouds, floating in the sky.\n\n316\n00:16:48.565 --> 00:16:53.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so\nback to the, this one.\n\n317\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.590\nOkay, so back over here to apply,\nlist, copy.\n\n318\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:01.520\nSo, I did wanna touch on the lists,\nand I'm going to do this as well,\n\n319\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.810\nbecause I'm kind of got myself\nall mixed matched again.\n\n320\n00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.150\nLet's go ahead and close these files and\nnot save, and then open them back up, so\n\n321\n00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.720\nwe have a place to start with our text.\n\n322\n00:17:14.852 --> 00:17:19.230\nOkay, so lists, we talked about lists\nin another episode, which is cool.\n\n323\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.330\nSo, we could, we redefined some lists,\nsome bullets in there.\n\n324\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:28.140\nSo notice up here that the ones from the\nother episodes, like we did the yin yang,\n\n325\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.050\nwe did bishop as a picture, and\nall of those different things.\n\n326\n00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.350\nNotice they're staying, it's not really\n\n327\n00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:41.050\nattached to a specific document\nwhen I define a new bullet.\n\n328\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.700\nIt's more living in Word, we'll say.\n\n329\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.200\nNot document specific.\n\n330\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.040\nAnd so it will remember.\n\n331\n00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.610\nSo, I have an example right here,\nwhere I have a paragraph, and\n\n332\n00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.010\nI have a bullet attached to it,\nI have that pink flower.\n\n333\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.802\nBut the text is blue, it's bigger,\nit's got that apple type, or\n\n334\n00:17:59.802 --> 00:18:01.170\nAmerican typewriter.\n\n335\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:06.081\nI also have a right tab, or\nsorry, not a tab, a right indent.\n\n336\n00:18:06.081 --> 00:18:10.370\nSo lots different formatting\nthat I've got going on here.\n\n337\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.670\nDoing a list style is really up here.\n\n338\n00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.335\nIf I come up here to like\nthis particular paragraph,\n\n339\n00:18:17.335 --> 00:18:21.080\ncome down here it's like,\nthere's the pink flower.\n\n340\n00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.320\nClick on it,\nit does apply the pink flower, but\n\n341\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.520\nit does not apply the same\nformatting that's in here.\n\n342\n00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.280\nSo if I come into here, this paragraph,\nselect that, it doesn't match\n\n343\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.550\nall of the character and\nparagraph formatting of the text.\n\n344\n00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:42.560\nIts just remembering how I\ndefined the bullet character.\n\n345\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.213\nAnd also notice it didn't do\nthe same spacing here of the next\n\n346\n00:18:47.213 --> 00:18:51.840\nline indent, the up here,\nthe little triangles right?\n\n347\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.120\nI wanted the space between the bullet and\nthe text character.\n\n348\n00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.540\nThat's not remembering this either, so\nI'd like this to become a style right?\n\n349\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.740\nBecause that's why we make styles make an\neasier set of formatting and let's try it.\n\n350\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.540\nI'm going to click my cursor in\nthe paragraph, just in the paragraph.\n\n351\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.942\nI'm going to come over to my styles pane.\n\n352\n00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:15.580\nI'm gonna go to new style, and\n\n353\n00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:21.060\nthis is where it gets a little just making\nsure you understand the Style Type.\n\n354\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.370\nWhen I drop this down there,\nit's like there's a list style.\n\n355\n00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.230\nI'm making a list.\n\n356\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.020\nSo I should do this, right?\n\n357\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.820\nWell, let's just check this and\nsee what happens.\n\n358\n00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.800\nLook at the dialog box.\n\n359\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.150\nDo you see how it starts, it goes\ncompletely different types of formatting.\n\n360\n00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.360\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; This is just formatting in the bullet.\n\n361\n00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.630\nJust like we had done from\nthe dropdown on the ribbon.\n\n362\n00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.730\nThis is not the type of style\nyou want to create out of this.\n\n363\n00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.520\nSo don't get confused of like\nI wanna make a list style and\n\n364\n00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.130\nchoose a list type when\nyou're making a new style.\n\n365\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.890\nNo, you wanna make a paragraph style,\n\n366\n00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.630\nbecause the paragraph\nstyle is going to do.\n\n367\n00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.110\nLook you can actually see it down\nhere in the style definition.\n\n368\n00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.250\nThat's gonna get the font,\nthe size, the indents, the spacing.\n\n369\n00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:08.390\nAll of that stuff that you want to retain,\nand the bullet character.\n\n370\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.470\nBecause bullets and numbering is\na paragraph level formatting, so\n\n371\n00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.670\nyou can make that\nparagraph style out of it.\n\n372\n00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.330\nThat's how you want it.\n\n373\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:23.602\nSo if I make this my new list style,\nstyle, for lack of better terms.\n\n374\n00:20:23.602 --> 00:20:27.070\nWe all understand that they're based on,\nif I don't wanna connected\n\n375\n00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:31.400\nit to this default list\nparagraph style that's in Word,\n\n376\n00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.270\nI can just say detach it from\neverything and no style.\n\n377\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.590\nAnd then the following,\nmaybe I'll just put that back to normal.\n\n378\n00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.210\nAnd this is what you wanna create when\nI click okay, now I've got, remember,\n\n379\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.840\ngotta apply it.\n\n380\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.440\nClick it back on there, so\nnow this is attached to it.\n\n381\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.080\nSo when I come into this paragraph and\nchoose this paragraph style,\n\n382\n00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:56.080\nnow it looks and gets all the formatting\nthat I want to apply to my paragraph.\n\n383\n00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.310\nSame thing here, and so on and so forth.\n\n384\n00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.170\nAnd I did some space after paragraph,\n\n385\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.700\nI did a lot of different\nformatting in there.\n\n386\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.570\nSo just clarifying about\n\n387\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:10.070\nusing the lists with the paragraph styles,\nnot a list style.\n\n388\n00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.730\nList styles are up here and\ndoesn't retain anything\n\n389\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.090\nthat you normally would want to be\nattached to it, at least for me.\n\n390\n00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.920\nSo, those are the last two.\n\n391\n00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.320\nThose are two main topics that I\nwanted to cover in this part two.\n\n392\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.100\nThe what happens when you copy and\npaste styles between documents.\n\n393\n00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.180\nAnd the conflict or the no conflict and\nthen the list styles and\n\n394\n00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.320\nreally just making it a paragraph\nstyle with the list character.\n\n395\n00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.290\nOr the list, the bullet character.\n\n396\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.995\nSorry, boom, back and forth, right?\n\n397\n00:21:38.995 --> 00:21:39.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n398\n00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.210\nit was a quick blip of me up there.\n\n399\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.500\nI was gonna say, thanks for the addendum.\n\n400\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.780\nThat's fantastic,\npart two of Styles Apply, part two.\n\n401\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.590\nAnd make sure you see\nStyles Apply part one, and\n\n402\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.720\nsee everything in the Word 2016\nEssentials for Mac series.\n\n403\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.950\nYou're gonna be very glad you did.\n\n404\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.410\nAnd check out all the videos\nin the course library.\n\n405\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.808\nThey're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n406\n00:21:59.808 --> 00:22:01.611\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about OfficeProTV.\n\n407\n00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:02.861\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n408\n00:22:02.861 --> 00:22:04.551\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n409\n00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:05.318\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n410\n00:22:05.318 --> 00:22:07.192\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n411\n00:22:07.192 -->

Of course.\n\n40\n00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.808\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we dont get into adding images and\n\n41\n00:01:53.808 --> 00:01:58.102\nthat thing it says one, two, three,\nthat's known as a smart art graphic.\n\n42\n00:01:58.102 --> 00:02:01.907\nThat's stuff that we do in\nthe advanced level show, so\n\n43\n00:02:01.907 --> 00:02:06.554\nif you want to know how to do that\nIt is there, just not in this show.\n\n44\n00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:08.063\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Course library, course library.\n\n45\n00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, yes.\n\n46\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.361\nWhat do we say?\n\n47\n00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:13.379\nYou always watch all of them cuz you\ncan learn all sorts of wonderful,\n\n48\n00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.006\nyou say it much better than I do, so.\n\n49\n00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:16.783\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Visit the course library,\n\n50\n00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:19.064\nhundreds of videos all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n51\n00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:20.574\n&gt;&gt; See, this is why we have him.\n\n52\n00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:24.168\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I can't remember how to say that.\n\n53\n00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:26.594\n&gt;&gt; It's true though, my gosh.\n\n54\n00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:30.550\n&gt;&gt; So I have this document\nformatted a specific way and\n\n55\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.794\nthat's something else that's going\nto tie into this whole theme,\n\n56\n00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:41.873\nis that you do need to use the Heading 1s,\nthe Heading 2s, the normal style.\n\n57\n00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:45.119\nIn the episode that we talked\nabout with the styles apply,\n\n58\n00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.716\nwe can make our own, right?\n\n59\n00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:50.511\nAnd you totally could,\nyou could just forego all the defaults and\n\n60\n00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:54.388\njust make everything customized\nwith no connection to anything.\n\n61\n00:02:54.388 --> 00:03:00.728\nWell then that's where some of the stuff\nisn't gonna work, cuz it is tied to that.\n\n62\n00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:04.831\nThere's a reason why they have a default\nHeading 1, Heading 2, a title, and\n\n63\n00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:05.394\na normal.\n\n64\n00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:09.747\nBecause it utilizes that in\na lot of different places and\n\n65\n00:03:09.747 --> 00:03:11.979\nthis is one of those places.\n\n66\n00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:15.498\nSo I'm gonna keep this zoomed out just for\nvisual purposes,\n\n67\n00:03:15.498 --> 00:03:19.782\nif you can't read the text,\nthat's not what we're going for right now.\n\n68\n00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:23.601\nIt's really just more of the overall look\nand the colors and I'm gonna turn this\n\n69\n00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:26.806\nshow in high characters just so\nmaybe it's a little easier to see.\n\n70\n00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:30.788\nAll right, so just don't worry\nif you can't see it super clear.\n\n71\n00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:33.262\nI'm going to go over\nhere to the Design tab.\n\n72\n00:03:33.262 --> 00:03:37.231\nCuz on the Design tab we have a lot of\ndifferent things that we're going to talk\n\n73\n00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:39.810\nabout in the design of\nthis particular document.\n\n74\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.946\nAnd we'll start over here with Themes.\n\n75\n00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:46.821\nNow if you have used PowerPoint, this\nis probably going to look very similar\n\n76\n00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:49.877\nbecause you have design\nthemes in PowerPoint.\n\n77\n00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:53.281\nAnd especially when you have your slides,\nit has even more\n\n78\n00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:57.529\nthan just what we're gonna have here,\nwith the colors and everything.\n\n79\n00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:01.362\nBut it gets into the background,\nimages, for the slides,\n\n80\n00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:03.287\nbut they have the same names.\n\n81\n00:04:03.287 --> 00:04:06.504\nSo if you're like these look\nvery familiar, that's why.\n\n82\n00:04:06.504 --> 00:04:10.173\nNow you probably don't have\nthe Vonne Pink up here.\n\n83\n00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:14.410\nI'll come back to the custom\nthemes in just a little bit.\n\n84\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.637\nSo the built-in ones,\nyou could see we have feathered galleries.\n\n85\n00:04:17.637 --> 00:04:24.058\nYou don't have the live preview,\nlike you have in Word for PC.\n\n86\n00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:28.022\nWord from Mac, you actually have\nto click on it, to apply it,\n\n87\n00:04:28.022 --> 00:04:30.559\nto be able to see what it's going to do.\n\n88\n00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:35.235\nAnd just like a party,\nthe theme is going to do the font,\n\n89\n00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:39.624\nthe colors, and\nalso the effects on your graphics.\n\n90\n00:04:39.624 --> 00:04:41.552\n&gt;&gt; That's another time saver,\nit's just right there.\n\n91\n00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:44.997\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, so\nif I click on, let's say gallery.\n\n92\n00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:50.080\nAnd then, look, the text is different,\nthe colors are different.\n\n93\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.494\nAnd I'll zoom in on this in a little bit.\n\n94\n00:04:52.494 --> 00:04:57.087\nEven the effects of what\nthe shapes look like change.\n\n95\n00:04:57.087 --> 00:04:59.036\nLet's go over here with Badge.\n\n96\n00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:00.709\nWow, that's a completely different font.\n\n97\n00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:05.160\nNow it's very yellow and\ngreen, well, maybe sage.\n\n98\n00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.861\nMaybe we'll go with sage for that color.\n\n99\n00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.686\n&gt;&gt; Sageish, yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:06.686 --> 00:05:07.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sageish.\n\n101\n00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:09.888\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sageish.\n\n102\n00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:12.430\n&gt;&gt; And we'll go down here to Slice.\n\n103\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.886\nSo you notice that everything is changing.\n\n104\n00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:21.985\nWhat font is in the title\nversus the normal.\n\n105\n00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:23.924\nWhat colors are your default.\n\n106\n00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.510\nIf I come over,\nlet's go to the Ion board room.\n\n107\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.940\nAnd you'll know the reason why\nI like to choose this one,\n\n108\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.675\nlet's go back over here to the Home tab,\nthe colors, right?\n\n109\n00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:38.635\nAll of these are my theme colors and\nevery time you have a different theme,\n\n110\n00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:40.876\nyou have different shades of it.\n\n111\n00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:47.367\nLike a 10%, or this is lighter 80%,\nI would call this 100, 80, 60, 40, 20.\n\n112\n00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:49.852\nBut they just go the other way.\n\n113\n00:05:49.852 --> 00:05:52.858\nAll right, but\nthat's where you could see where we had,\n\n114\n00:05:52.858 --> 00:05:55.622\nwhen I looked at the Heading\n1 in our other episode.\n\n115\n00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:59.773\nI kind of pointed out that\nthat Accent 1 color and\n\n116\n00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:03.935\nthe default theme font is\nall pulling from that.\n\n117\n00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:06.701\nThe default theme is\njust the Office theme,\n\n118\n00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:09.253\nthat's what it always starts off with.\n\n119\n00:06:09.253 --> 00:06:13.616\nAnd the Office theme has\nthat particular color set,\n\n120\n00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:18.079\nthe particular fonts,\nthe Calibri, is it Calibri,\n\n121\n00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:22.361\nyeah, Calibri, body and\nthen the heading style.\n\n122\n00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:25.054\nAnd so that's where it all comes from.\n\n123\n00:06:25.054 --> 00:06:28.352\nSo you can come in and\nchange them if you want.\n\n124\n00:06:28.352 --> 00:06:33.814\nAnd like I said, the reason why\neverything is changing so beautifully and\n\n125\n00:06:33.814 --> 00:06:40.259\noverall is because I'm using all of the\ndefault Heading 1, 2, normal, and title.\n\n126\n00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.222\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n127\n00:06:41.222 --> 00:06:43.741\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's where you can go with your themes.\n\n128\n00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:47.420\nNow a theme, like I said,\nhas fonts, colors, and\n\n129\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.825\neffects as all part of the theme.\n\n130\n00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:53.131\nLet's say I really like,\nlet's go with this badge,\n\n131\n00:06:53.131 --> 00:06:57.107\njust cuz it's that visual difference\nof that font right there.\n\n132\n00:06:57.107 --> 00:07:01.781\nI like this font scheme going on here,\nbut I don't like the colors,\n\n133\n00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:04.653\nI'd like to have more of the pink colors.\n\n134\n00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:06.712\nWell then you can come over here and\n\n135\n00:07:06.712 --> 00:07:10.121\nchange the color set that is\nwith this particular theme.\n\n136\n00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:12.332\nSo it's like you start with a theme and\n\n137\n00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:17.265\nthen you kind of modify it to say, I'd\nreally like to have the red violet color.\n\n138\n00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:21.952\nCool, now everything's more purple but\nI still have the same font set.\n\n139\n00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:23.144\nIf you want to say, hm,\n\n140\n00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:26.689\nwell if they can change the colors\nyou could also change the font sets.\n\n141\n00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:30.196\nMaybe I would like it to\nbe more of a Trebuchet.\n\n142\n00:07:30.196 --> 00:07:31.020\nI love that font.\n\n143\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love to say it too.\n\n144\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.639\nSo we have the Trebuchet font, and notice\nthat it's gonna go ahead and change that.\n\n145\n00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.621\nSo I can start with a theme, but\nthen go through and modify the different\n\n146\n00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.938\npieces of what the theme is\ncomprised of by coming over here and\n\n147\n00:07:45.938 --> 00:07:50.590\nchoosing a different color set,\nchoosing a different font set for\n\n148\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:56.344\nthe heading levels and the normal, what\nthey also call as the body fonts in there.\n\n149\n00:07:56.344 --> 00:07:59.623\nSo that's pretty neat that you can\ncome through and change everything.\n\n150\n00:07:59.623 --> 00:08:03.174\nNow that's what we have with the themes,\nand\n\n151\n00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:06.917\nthen you also have what\nare known as style sets.\n\n152\n00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:10.945\nStyles, keep on saying it,\nHeading 1, 2, normal, title.\n\n153\n00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:15.925\nYou then have a whole different\nway that it's going to change\n\n154\n00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:19.645\nthe formatting of those particular styles.\n\n155\n00:08:19.645 --> 00:08:21.317\nLet's start clicking on them.\n\n156\n00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:24.112\nIf I click on this on,\nwow that is way different, isn't it?\n\n157\n00:08:24.112 --> 00:08:24.788\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n158\n00:08:24.788 --> 00:08:28.764\n&gt;&gt; See how this is a title,\ntitle Heading 1, Heading 2.\n\n159\n00:08:28.764 --> 00:08:30.144\n&gt;&gt; I feel like a Mary Kay consultant.\n\n160\n00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:31.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n161\n00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:32.965\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n162\n00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:34.245\n&gt;&gt; Kinda.\n\n163\n00:08:34.245 --> 00:08:36.692\n&gt;&gt; Sorry,\nthat just kinda hit me pretty good.\n\n164\n00:08:36.692 --> 00:08:42.578\nWell because also my house\nis like Mary Kay pink.\n\n165\n00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:43.126\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n166\n00:08:43.126 --> 00:08:45.680\n&gt;&gt; Because the person that we bought\nit from was a Mary Kay consultant.\n\n167\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.341\n&gt;&gt; That's too funny.\n\n168\n00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:48.964\n&gt;&gt; So that's why it's kind\nof hitting home, literally.\n\n169\n00:08:48.964 --> 00:08:50.825\n&gt;&gt; A little inside\ninformation there isn't it?\n\n170\n00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:51.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n171\n00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.806\n&gt;&gt; Literally hitting home cuz\nit's the color of my house.\n\n172\n00:08:53.806 --> 00:08:56.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we didn't change it.\n\n173\n00:08:56.989 --> 00:08:57.833\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty awesome.\n\n174\n00:08:57.833 --> 00:08:59.273\n&gt;&gt; Good I think it sounds great.\n\n175\n00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:00.515\n&gt;&gt; So even more pink right?\n\n176\n00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:02.947\nAnd you can see that it's changing.\n\n177\n00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:04.985\nLook at this and\nlook at how much it changed.\n\n178\n00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:05.646\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n179\n00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:08.932\n&gt;&gt; The paragraph spacing, right,\nor the line spacing, I should say,\n\n180\n00:09:08.932 --> 00:09:09.962\nof the normal style.\n\n181\n00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:15.558\nSo each one of these styles\nsets just has an overall feel.\n\n182\n00:09:15.558 --> 00:09:20.864\nI want to try not using the word theme,\nbecause a theme versus a style set.\n\n183\n00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:27.118\nTheme, scheme feeling genre,\nI don't know if we can call genre.\n\n184\n00:09:27.118 --> 00:09:28.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n185\n00:09:28.024 --> 00:09:31.951\nyou could see just all those different\nwords that we can use for it,\n\n186\n00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:37.158\nthat's the overall look of this particular\ndocument, which is pretty, pretty neat.\n\n187\n00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:41.326\nSo all of this is changeable\nthrough this design tab.\n\n188\n00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:47.281\nThemes, style sets, and then over here,\nyou add the paragraph space.\n\n189\n00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:50.288\nAnd you saw some different examples of\nthese style sets that were showing.\n\n190\n00:09:50.288 --> 00:09:53.397\nSome that were more relaxed.\n\n191\n00:09:53.397 --> 00:09:54.419\nLet's click on that.\n\n192\n00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:56.601\nAnd see how everything just\nbecomes a little bit more relaxed.\n\n193\n00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:58.261\nThat's the line spacing in there.\n\n194\n00:09:58.261 --> 00:09:59.969\nWhat if we wanted to go with double?\n\n195\n00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:02.530\nNow everything,\nthat normal paragraph style,\n\n196\n00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.159\nbecomes double spaced\ninstead of single spaced.\n\n197\n00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:09.443\nI could go into compact, everything\njust sucks up a a little bit more.\n\n198\n00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:14.516\nNo paragraph space, okay,\nwell that didn't really change much for\n\n199\n00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:18.626\nthis particular style except\nthat you get the whole idea\n\n200\n00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:22.745\nof how you can go back through\nthe different style sets.\n\n201\n00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:27.507\nBut then changing some of the spacing,\nchanging the fonts, change the colors,\n\n202\n00:10:27.507 --> 00:10:31.498\njust going with the first set, or\nthe first thing all together, and\n\n203\n00:10:31.498 --> 00:10:34.318\nyou can really go ahead and\nmodify things a lot.\n\n204\n00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:37.768\nI do still have,\njust drive home as much, you know me,\n\n205\n00:10:37.768 --> 00:10:40.403\nI like to really drive home these points.\n\n206\n00:10:40.403 --> 00:10:43.002\nWith this particular document,\n\n207\n00:10:43.002 --> 00:10:48.381\nthis was the one I didn't close this\nfile down from our styles apply,\n\n208\n00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:53.416\nbecause I wanted to show the idea\nof these themes and style sets.\n\n209\n00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:57.501\nWe went and changed the Heading 1,\nwe changed the Heading 2,\n\n210\n00:10:57.501 --> 00:11:00.441\nwe also made my own style\ncalled Vonne style.\n\n211\n00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:05.062\nOkay, let's zoom out of\nthis just a little bit.\n\n212\n00:11:05.062 --> 00:11:08.940\nWe're going for\noverall look of everything.\n\n213\n00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.580\nSo you can see a little bit of everything.\n\n214\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:16.094\nIf I come over here to my Design tab,\nI can change the theme.\n\n215\n00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:20.911\nBut notice that it's still using the same\nstyle overrides that I had used like\n\n216\n00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:23.072\nthe Heading 1 and the Heading 2.\n\n217\n00:11:23.072 --> 00:11:26.131\nIt changed some of the colors,\ncuz I was using theme colors, so\n\n218\n00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:27.472\nit's not yellow anymore.\n\n219\n00:11:27.472 --> 00:11:30.247\nIt has that sage-ish color\nthat we were talking about.\n\n220\n00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:34.369\nBut if I come up here to my style sets,\nthat changes everything, okay.\n\n221\n00:11:34.369 --> 00:11:39.050\nMy Heading 1 and Heading 2 does go,\nfor the most part,\n\n222\n00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:44.231\nto whatever that style set,\nexcept for my Vonnestyle wasn't\n\n223\n00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:49.329\naffected by the theme,\nbecause I didn't use a theme color.\n\n224\n00:11:49.329 --> 00:11:56.914\nAnd it also was not affected by the style\nset, because I made my own, so.\n\n225\n00:11:56.914 --> 00:11:57.693\n&gt;&gt; It was custom.\n\n226\n00:11:57.693 --> 00:12:02.633\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, and all of these sets and\nthemes, or really more style sets,\n\n227\n00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:07.132\nare going to be attached to that\nHeading 1 or Heading 2, the normal.\n\n228\n00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:10.710\nEven the heading threes and\nfours will go there too,\n\n229\n00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.936\nbut if you make your own,\nthis super poof, look everything so\n\n230\n00:12:14.936 --> 00:12:19.597\ncool looking, it's not going to apply for\nyou if you go that route.\n\n231\n00:12:19.597 --> 00:12:22.870\nNothing wrong with it,\nthat's just what's going to happen.\n\n232\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.180\nNow, when I go back over here to\ngive you a few more options on, hey,\n\n233\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.241\nhow did you make that Vonne's colors,\nthat's really cool.\n\n234\n00:12:32.241 --> 00:12:37.966\nWell, this was a little bit of work around\nhonestly, because look at the bottom.\n\n235\n00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.938\nIf I scroll down here,\nactually a little bit behind head.\n\n236\n00:12:40.938 --> 00:12:47.229\nNormally in PC, Word for PC, you would\nhave an option of create custom colors.\n\n237\n00:12:47.229 --> 00:12:51.838\nAnd you can go right into here and\ngo ahead and make a custom color set,\n\n238\n00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:54.555\nit's not an option here in Word for Mac.\n\n239\n00:12:54.555 --> 00:12:56.354\nBut then how did you do that?\n\n240\n00:12:56.354 --> 00:12:59.698\nI actually did this in PowerPoint, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:59.698 --> 00:13:04.400\n&gt;&gt; I went over to PowerPoint, and I'll\njust, so I can show you really quickly.\n\n242\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.305\n&gt;&gt; You are a magician.\n\n243\n00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:11.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, I just consulted the oracles.\n\n244\n00:13:11.238 --> 00:13:13.826\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm like wait, where's this option,\n\n245\n00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:14.512\nI know you can.\n\n246\n00:13:14.512 --> 00:13:18.868\nSo if I just went into PowerPoint and\njust started a brand new presentation,\n\n247\n00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:23.034\nover here on Design, and if you come\nover into here where it says colors.\n\n248\n00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:26.157\nSee, that's where you\nhave customized colors.\n\n249\n00:13:26.157 --> 00:13:31.900\nYou make it in here and then it can\nbe used in Word, because themes,\n\n250\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.221\nthemes are not program or\napplication specific.\n\n251\n00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:38.712\nThey're Office specific.\n\n252\n00:13:38.712 --> 00:13:44.379\nSo the one where I have Vonne's colors,\nI made it in PowerPoint, but switching\n\n253\n00:13:44.379 --> 00:13:49.466\nover to Word, it is now an option of\ncolor sets that I can choose in Word.\n\n254\n00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:53.425\nThe same thing with this theme here,\nthis Von pink.\n\n255\n00:13:53.425 --> 00:13:56.688\nI actually made than in,\nwhoops, wrong short cut.\n\n256\n00:13:56.688 --> 00:14:01.642\nSorry, I'm switching over to PowerPoint, I\nmade that as a design theme in PowerPoint,\n\n257\n00:14:01.642 --> 00:14:04.830\nand then it's going to go ahead and\napply it over in Word.\n\n258\n00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.312\nThat's where the crossover comes.\n\n259\n00:14:07.312 --> 00:14:11.421\nAnd how you can make your own color sets.\n\n260\n00:14:11.421 --> 00:14:14.881\nIt's just you gotta go into another\nOffice application to do it.\n\n261\n00:14:14.881 --> 00:14:19.874\nNow with the fonts, creating your\nown font theme, or font group,\n\n262\n00:14:19.874 --> 00:14:24.971\nthat is not available; and\nI can't find it in a PowerPoint either.\n\n263\n00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:29.709\nI can't come into my fonts and\nthen it doesn't have the option,\n\n264\n00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:31.833\ncreate a custom font group.\n\n265\n00:14:31.833 --> 00:14:37.417\nSo I'm going to claim right now that\nit is not an option in Office for\n\n266\n00:14:37.417 --> 00:14:40.030\nMac to create a new font group.\n\n267\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:44.470\nNow, I could be wrong, and there could be\nsome other weird work around, but it's not\n\n268\n00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.230\nan option in any of your drop-down\nmenus of just choose a new font set.\n\n269\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.657\nSo if you're looking for\nthat same equivalence from the PC version,\n\n270\n00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:52.555\nit's not there.\n\n271\n00:14:52.555 --> 00:14:57.864\nThe other thing you don't see in\nthe Word for Mac in the design and\n\n272\n00:14:57.864 --> 00:15:04.659\nchanging your themes is how you can change\nyour default effects on your graphics.\n\n273\n00:15:04.659 --> 00:15:08.784\nI mean, zoom in over on this\nparticular page, this 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n274\n00:15:08.784 --> 00:15:13.699\nWhen you start changing themes,\ndo you see how it will change,\n\n275\n00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:19.561\nsometimes the dropdowns, see that one,\nit's a little bit more beveled.\n\n276\n00:15:19.561 --> 00:15:21.897\nOr like, yeah, it's raised up.\n\n277\n00:15:21.897 --> 00:15:22.836\n&gt;&gt; More three dimensional.\n\n278\n00:15:22.836 --> 00:15:25.224\n&gt;&gt; There you go, and\nthen there's another one,\n\n279\n00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:28.541\nwhere it will, see the borders\nare a little bit different.\n\n280\n00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:30.921\nAnd that's what I mean by the effects.\n\n281\n00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:36.378\nAnd where you could set in the PC version\nlike your default effects with your theme.\n\n282\n00:15:36.378 --> 00:15:39.799\nYou don't have that option in Word for\nMac,\n\n283\n00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:44.158\nat least directly in here,\nand that's what you can do.\n\n284\n00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:49.933\nNow, let's say that you have spent\nsometime, really customizing your themes,\n\n285\n00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:53.293\nyou have gone through and\nchanged your colors.\n\n286\n00:15:53.293 --> 00:15:56.098\nYou could, if you wanted to,\n\n287\n00:15:56.098 --> 00:16:01.269\nyou could save your own theme,\nbased on what you have.\n\n288\n00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:03.649\nAnd that would also carry\nover into PowerPoint.\n\n289\n00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:07.134\nSo you could either start in Word and\ncarry it over to PowerPoint, start in\n\n290\n00:16:07.134 --> 00:16:10.923\nPowerPoint, save your themes and colors,\nthen come over and apply it in Word.\n\n291\n00:16:10.923 --> 00:16:16.368\nWhichever way you want to go,\nI'm not going to go, actually save it.\n\n292\n00:16:16.368 --> 00:16:20.999\nBut I wanna bring this into this dialogue\nbox because I wanted to show you\n\n293\n00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:22.243\nwhere you're at.\n\n294\n00:16:22.243 --> 00:16:25.923\nYou're way down in here to\nwhere I have the different,\n\n295\n00:16:25.923 --> 00:16:29.604\nthat's why I was trying to\ngo back over into my themes.\n\n296\n00:16:29.604 --> 00:16:32.995\nI'm in my user content down in\nmy group containers libraries.\n\n297\n00:16:32.995 --> 00:16:38.288\nYou're in the themes folder in\nyour application of Office,\n\n298\n00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:42.146\nso that's where it goes\nacross all of them.\n\n299\n00:16:42.146 --> 00:16:46.327\nIt's not just particularly\none application.\n\n300\n00:16:46.327 --> 00:16:50.428\nSo if you wanted and you go through all of\nyour different changes, you can do that.\n\n301\n00:16:50.428 --> 00:16:53.960\nYou can also save your own style sets.\n\n302\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.570\nThat's where if I really wanted to,\n\n303\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:03.167\nI could take all of that fancy\nstuff that I did here, yes.\n\n304\n00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:06.490\nWhere I did my heading ones and\nheadings twos and\n\n305\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.576\nall my different styles,\nI could save that as a style set.\n\n306\n00:17:10.576 --> 00:17:15.115\nStyle sets, themes, they are a little,\nthey are separate, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:15.115 --> 00:17:19.656\nSo you could go through and change that\nbecause that might be something good where\n\n308\n00:17:19.656 --> 00:17:23.813\nyou want to be able to quickly apply\nthat style set to multiple documents.\n\n309\n00:17:23.813 --> 00:17:28.725\nSo you could save it there but just to let\nyou know that those options are there,\n\n310\n00:17:28.725 --> 00:17:33.714\nsaving your own style sets And, and or\nsaving your custom themes, which is your\n\n311\n00:17:33.714 --> 00:17:38.500\ncolors, fonts and your effects that go\nacross all of your Office programs.\n\n312\n00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.357\nSo fun stuff, cool.\n\n313\n00:17:40.357 --> 00:17:43.532\nUse the default settings in the sense\nof like headings one, two and threes,\n\n314\n00:17:43.532 --> 00:17:44.383\nand all that stuff.\n\n315\n00:17:44.383 --> 00:17:46.032\nCome in here, click a button.\n\n316\n00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:47.530\nAnd then poof, look at that.\n\n317\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.981\nI made this amazing looking document.\n\n318\n00:17:48.981 --> 00:17:52.349\nA Mary Kay document, right,\nwith all of our pink.\n\n319\n00:17:52.349 --> 00:17:56.098\nAnd you can go ahead and just, with\na single click and a couple color changes.\n\n320\n00:17:56.098 --> 00:17:58.568\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:25.253\nAnd this is going to be,\nkeep options, breaks, and columns.\n\n6\n00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:28.127\nAnd Vonne Smith is here, once again,\nto help us out with that information.\n\n7\n00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:29.353\nVonne, good to see you.\n\n8\n00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:30.622\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you, too.\n\n9\n00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:33.349\nYes, this is one of my,\nmy episodes, [LAUGH].\n\n10\n00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:34.295\n&gt;&gt; My!\n\n11\n00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:37.312\n&gt;&gt; Keep options, breaks, and columns, my!\n\n12\n00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:40.239\nSo that's just one of those-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.103\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you got it?\n\n14\n00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:41.655\n&gt;&gt; I get the

00:00:46.095\n&gt;&gt; Breaks and columns, my!\n\n18\n00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:47.056\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n19\n00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:49.365\nSo I like to keep things\nin threes too sometimes.\n\n20\n00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:54.222\nSo this is actually really\nimportant concepts in\n\n21\n00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:58.374\nWord that I think it a little passed over.\n\n22\n00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:02.737\nBut it is so\nessential to understanding all sorts of\n\n23\n00:01:02.737 --> 00:01:05.687\ndifferent things in page layout.\n\n24\n00:01:05.687 --> 00:01:09.511\nBecause that's the topic that we're in\nright now, is page layout, and how to,\n\n25\n00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:11.042\nwell, lay out your page [LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:13.505\nAnd understanding section breaks,\n\n27\n00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:17.800\nespecially continuous section breaks,\nand why you want them.\n\n28\n00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.390\nWhen to use them, and\nhow to put them in is pretty important,\n\n29\n00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.721\njust like I think everything is important.\n\n30\n00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:29.218\nAnd I think everything's fun and\namazing and so\n\n31\n00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:33.778\nessential to what you need to\nknow in Word, so let me show you.\n\n32\n00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:35.805\nAll right, so why don't we go ahead and\nopen up the file?\n\n33\n00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:39.528\nI have a file called,\nKeep Options Custom Headings,\n\n34\n00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:42.351\nnow why did I call them custom headings?\n\n35\n00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:48.513\nWell, because I needed to override\nsome of the default settings.\n\n36\n00:01:48.513 --> 00:01:54.083\nSo we can go ahead and talk about\nthe concepts of keep options, all right?\n\n37\n00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:57.541\nSo there's my little disclaimer right now,\n\n38\n00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:03.093\nis that these are custom headings that\nI have turned off these features.\n\n39\n00:02:03.093 --> 00:02:07.927\nThat will be on by default in a new file,\nand so on and so forth, which, of course,\n\n40\n00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.116\nyou know I'll demonstrate for you.\n\n41\n00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:14.028\nBut that's the reason why I\nhave this file named this.\n\n42\n00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:18.610\nKeep options, widows and orphans,\nthat sounds so depressing,\n\n43\n00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.622\nit's like, what are we talking about?!\n\n44\n00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:25.528\nAnd this is in the sense of how\nit's treating lines within your\n\n45\n00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:26.894\nparagraphs, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:30.829\nSo, let's scroll on down,\nfor example, right here,\n\n47\n00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.866\nnotice that in this paragraph,\nAlice was not a bit hurt.\n\n48\n00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:39.788\nIt's just a single sentence that's\njust kinda hanging out by itself on\n\n49\n00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:41.520\nthe bottom of this page.\n\n50\n00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.588\nAnd then rest of the paragraph, here,\nlet's turn on that show hide paragraph\n\n51\n00:02:44.588 --> 00:02:46.458\njust so\nwe can see that it's all one paragraph.\n\n52\n00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:50.365\nThe rest of it's down here,\nthat's not the best break point.\n\n53\n00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:52.044\n&gt;&gt; Is that what you call an orphan?\n\n54\n00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:55.906\n&gt;&gt; That would be a widow,\nI had to look it up [LAUGH].\n\n55\n00:02:55.906 --> 00:03:01.237\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the widow, the widow is when\nthe last, wait, no, you're right.\n\n56\n00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:03.799\nOkay, the orphan is the first, yep,\n\n57\n00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.092\nthe first line at the bottom of the page,\nsorry.\n\n58\n00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:11.297\nAnd a widow is the last line of\nthe paragraph on the top of the next page,\n\n59\n00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:12.184\nso yes.\n\n60\n00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:12.748\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n61\n00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:16.269\n&gt;&gt; This would be an orphan, this would be,\n\n62\n00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.564\nthere's one down somewhere,\nwhere, well, it went away.\n\n63\n00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:26.271\nSo that would be, [LAUGH] the other\none would be a widow, right?\n\n64\n00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:31.181\nSo, it just doesn't really make sense, or\nit just doesn't look good, personally,\n\n65\n00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.573\nto have-\n&gt;&gt; No it doesn't, it doesn't.\n\n66\n00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:37.343\n&gt;&gt; A single sentence on the top of the\npage is just kinda, if you had like two.\n\n67\n00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:39.265\nOr maybe two or three together,\n\n68\n00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:43.121\nthat would be a little bit better\nof this is one whole paragraph.\n\n69\n00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.723\nSo that's what they mean by widow and\norphan control.\n\n70\n00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:50.466\nThis is on, I'm using a normal style,\nlike I said,\n\n71\n00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:55.073\nthat I turned it off, cuz it is on\nby default that you can format.\n\n72\n00:03:55.073 --> 00:03:57.800\nNow I'm going to go into\nthe File Settings, because,\n\n73\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.653\nI think you should always use files.\n\n74\n00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:02.342\nAnd that's where you should control\nevery bit of your formatting from.\n\n75\n00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:07.075\nBut you can go and format this\nindividually, like per paragraph, or\n\n76\n00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:09.449\ndo individual overrides on this.\n\n77\n00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.677\nSo, I just wanted to show you\nthat to format paragraphs,\n\n78\n00:04:12.677 --> 00:04:15.184\nwe're going to go into the Line and\nBreaks.\n\n79\n00:04:15.184 --> 00:04:19.045\nOr Line and Page Breaks to talk about\nthis particular type of pagination or\n\n80\n00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:19.866\nkeep options.\n\n81\n00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:23.549\nSo it's here, I'm just gonna do\nit through the style definition.\n\n82\n00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:28.636\nSo let's get into the Normal style and\nmodify down at the bottom.\n\n83\n00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:33.146\nWe're gonna come into the Paragraph\nright here and right there,\n\n84\n00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:34.956\nWidow/orphan control.\n\n85\n00:04:34.956 --> 00:04:39.420\nWhat that means, when you check that on,\nor if it's already on,\n\n86\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.738\nthat it's going to try to avoid\ngiving you widows and orphans.\n\n87\n00:04:43.738 --> 00:04:45.490\n&gt;&gt; So it'll do it automatically, Vonne?\n\n88\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.354\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n89\n00:04:46.354 --> 00:04:47.194\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n90\n00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:54.011\n&gt;&gt; It understands where it wants or\nwhere it should break your pages up.\n\n91\n00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:57.243\nSo let's turn this on and just,\njust to kinda remind us, remember,\n\n92\n00:04:57.243 --> 00:04:58.935\nthere was that one line right here.\n\n93\n00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:04.063\nBut I click OK, and then click OK again,\nnotice that, where did it go?\n\n94\n00:05:04.063 --> 00:05:06.584\nIt was two by itself-\n&gt;&gt; It was adopted!\n\n95\n00:05:06.584 --> 00:05:08.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right, yes.\n\n96\n00:05:08.335 --> 00:05:11.299\nIt was adopted into the rest of the\nparagraph, I like the way you said that!\n\n97\n00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:12.763\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's what happens!\n\n98\n00:05:12.763 --> 00:05:17.378\n&gt;&gt; So it determined that that was not\na good break point of that particular\n\n99\n00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:18.249\nparagraph.\n\n100\n00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.971\nSo to change the pagination across pages,\nit went ahead and\n\n101\n00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:25.702\nforced that line down,\nbecause that's how it needs to go.\n\n102\n00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:29.585\nSo that's what that means with widow and\norphan control.\n\n103\n00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:33.333\nNow I'm doing a command N, for\nfile new, so I have a new document.\n\n104\n00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.577\nAnd if you look at the normal style,\nnotice that in the paragraph formatting,\n\n105\n00:05:37.577 --> 00:05:40.747\nthat's already gone, so\nit's gonna do that by default.\n\n106\n00:05:40.747 --> 00:05:44.307\nAnd some people are like, I started\ntyping and the line just jumped down.\n\n107\n00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:49.999\nOr it went ahead and put the second\nsentence back up on the other page,\n\n108\n00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:54.923\nbecause it'll do two lines and\nthen it'll break the page.\n\n109\n00:05:54.923 --> 00:05:57.930\nBut if it determines that's not\nenough space, it'll take that one and\n\n110\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.044\nbring it all the way down.\n\n111\n00:05:59.044 --> 00:06:03.667\nAnd the same for the bottom of the page,\nlike it has to be two or\n\n112\n00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:06.408\nmore to go ahead and stay together.\n\n113\n00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:11.743\nNow, I say that, that's different\nthan this, Keep lines together.\n\n114\n00:06:11.743 --> 00:06:16.274\nKeep lines together means\nthat it will keep the whole\n\n115\n00:06:16.274 --> 00:06:21.325\nparagraph intact and\nit will not jump across paragraphs.\n\n116\n00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:26.526\nFor example right here, see, right here,\nthis paragraph, it went ahead and did two.\n\n117\n00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:29.673\nRemember, l was looking for this before,\nbecause once l turned the widow and\n\n118\n00:06:29.673 --> 00:06:30.504\norphan control on.\n\n119\n00:06:30.504 --> 00:06:35.689\nIt said, to help break up the pages,\nl can put two more sentences down here,\n\n120\n00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.272\nor two more lines of this\nparagraph on the next page.\n\n121\n00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:42.298\nI don't have the keep it\nall on the other one, so\n\n122\n00:06:42.298 --> 00:06:45.503\nthat was that widow and\norphan control in effect.\n\n123\n00:06:45.503 --> 00:06:49.627\nBut if I took in, going into\nthe style definition for this one.\n\n124\n00:06:49.627 --> 00:06:54.476\nIf I went back into the Paragraph\nformatting and the Line and\n\n125\n00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:56.223\nPage Break options.\n\n126\n00:06:56.223 --> 00:07:01.888\nIf I chose Keep lines together, watch\nwhat happens, click OK, click OK there.\n\n127\n00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:07.414\nIt all jumped, it said, I'm saying,\nin this paragraph style,\n\n128\n00:07:07.414 --> 00:07:11.537\nkeep them together,\ndo not break across pages.\n\n129\n00:07:11.537 --> 00:07:13.134\n&gt;&gt; Reunited and it feels so good.\n\n130\n00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:14.717\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n131\n00:07:14.717 --> 00:07:16.037\nI feel like I need to start swaying now,\n[LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:07:16.037 --> 00:07:18.687\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's what\n\n133\n00:07:18.687 --> 00:07:23.600\nit means by Keep lines together,\nwhich, again, it's a personal choice.\n\n134\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.831\nBut it does sometimes tend to create,\n\n135\n00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:29.816\nlook at all that kind of white blank\nspace at the bottom of this page.\n\n136\n00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:32.863\nIf that's something that you're just like,\nooh,\n\n137\n00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:36.895\nthat's bothering me,\nthen don't keep the lines together, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:36.895 --> 00:07:39.405\nAnd that's not on by default, but\n\n139\n00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:44.002\nit is something that it's good\nto understand what that means.\n\n140\n00:07:44.002 --> 00:07:46.179\nTo go ahead and\nkeep all the lines together.\n\n141\n00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:51.102\nNow there's another one that says,\nKeep with next.\n\n142\n00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:55.772\nI wouldn't necessarily choose\nthis particular option on\n\n143\n00:07:55.772 --> 00:07:58.161\nthe normal paragraph style.\n\n144\n00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:02.916\nWhere I'd really put the keep with\nnext would be on a heading and\n\n145\n00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:04.629\nthat's back up here.\n\n146\n00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:09.814\nThis Ace of Hearts, you don't want\na heading at the bottom of the page and\n\n147\n00:08:09.814 --> 00:08:14.574\nthen the next paragraph that it's\nassociated with like a normal,\n\n148\n00:08:14.574 --> 00:08:16.622\nthey're separated apart.\n\n149\n00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:21.611\nThat's where I would say,\nkeep with the next paragraph.\n\n150\n00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:27.163\nThis heading needs to always be\nconnected to the next paragraph.\n\n151\n00:08:27.163 --> 00:08:28.438\nThat's where I would use that one.\n\n152\n00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:31.883\nSo, I'm putting my cursor\nhere on Ace of Hearts,\n\n153\n00:08:31.883 --> 00:08:35.668\nright clicking up on the Heading 2,\nmodifying that.\n\n154\n00:08:35.668 --> 00:08:39.810\nGoing into the Paragraph,\nformatting and keeping, nope.\n\n155\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.306\nKeep with Next, that's what I just said.\n\n156\n00:08:41.306 --> 00:08:42.747\n[LAUGH] So we'll take that.\n\n157\n00:08:42.747 --> 00:08:46.864\nWe'll click OK, and see, jumps down, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:46.864 --> 00:08:50.633\nSo all of these I would\nset in your styles, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:54.926\nI would probably put at all of my\nheadings as keep with next because I want\n\n160\n00:08:54.926 --> 00:08:59.434\nto make sure that it keeps next,\nI would always keep the, we don't know for\n\n161\n00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:01.384\norphan controls on the normal.\n\n162\n00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:06.096\nIf it was something that I just\nnever wanted my paragraphs to\n\n163\n00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:07.799\nbreak across pages.\n\n164\n00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:12.936\nThen I would choose that keep lines\ntogether within the style definitions,\n\n165\n00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:16.398\nand everything will stay\ntogether pretty nicely.\n\n166\n00:09:16.398 --> 00:09:21.736\nNow there's one that I didn't\nreview right at this moment,\n\n167\n00:09:21.736 --> 00:09:24.674\nand that was adding a page break.\n\n168\n00:09:24.674 --> 00:09:26.642\nThe reason why is cuz well,\nI didn't talk about page breaks [LAUGH].\n\n169\n00:09:26.642 --> 00:09:29.029\n&gt;&gt; No, we haven't.\n\n170\n00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:29.744\n&gt;&gt; No, we haven't.\n\n171\n00:09:29.744 --> 00:09:34.511\nBut just notice that there is\nan option in your keep options,\n\n172\n00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:40.689\nI call them keep options where it says,\npage break before, keep that in mind.\n\n173\n00:09:40.689 --> 00:09:43.892\nAnd also that I would be doing\nthis in a style definition.\n\n174\n00:09:43.892 --> 00:09:46.270\nYou're like all right,\ngot that in my brain.\n\n175\n00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.064\nLet's move on to what does it\nmean to do a page break [LAUGH].\n\n176\n00:09:51.064 --> 00:09:53.008\nIt means you break to another page.\n\n177\n00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:54.227\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sounds right.\n\n178\n00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:57.995\n&gt;&gt; My classic just go ahead and\nuse in the definition in the actual name\n\n179\n00:09:57.995 --> 00:10:02.318\nof the thing that we're talking about and\ncompletely makes sense, right?\n\n180\n00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:08.079\n[LAUGH] Let's show you Mock Turtle Story,\nwe'll call it a title,\n\n181\n00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:12.173\neven though I really\ncalled it my heading one.\n\n182\n00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:15.657\nRight down here, the Cheshire Cat.\n\n183\n00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:19.889\nI would really like for\nthis to start on the next page.\n\n184\n00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:22.531\nLet's zoom out so\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n185\n00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:26.063\nSee, I don't really want\nthis to be in the same page.\n\n186\n00:10:26.063 --> 00:10:27.664\nSorry, I just went in the wrong place.\n\n187\n00:10:27.664 --> 00:10:28.767\nThere we go.\n\n188\n00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:31.717\nI want this to be on the next page.\n\n189\n00:10:31.717 --> 00:10:33.792\nThat's where you would enter a page break.\n\n190\n00:10:33.792 --> 00:10:36.489\nDon't do this.\n\n191\n00:10:36.489 --> 00:10:40.540\nDon't Enter, Enter, Enter,\nEnter, Enter and force it down.\n\n192\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.925\nNo, I try to avoid saying bad.\n\n193\n00:10:43.925 --> 00:10:44.767\nBad, don't do that.\n\n194\n00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:47.838\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There is a better way.\n\n195\n00:10:47.838 --> 00:10:52.621\nWhat you could say is right here on my\ncurser is this is where I want my new\n\n196\n00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:55.150\npage to start, insert a page break.\n\n197\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:59.110\nNow you can go through the Insert tab and\nyou can come over here to Pages,\n\n198\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.136\nyou might see these across, remember\nmy resolution is a little lower and\n\n199\n00:11:03.136 --> 00:11:04.988\nyou can see there is a Page Break.\n\n200\n00:11:04.988 --> 00:11:09.977\nThere's also over here in design,\nno not design, sorry, Layout,\n\n201\n00:11:09.977 --> 00:11:12.138\nthere's Breaks right here.\n\n202\n00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:15.492\nNow, we'll talk about sections\nin just a little bit, but\n\n203\n00:11:15.492 --> 00:11:17.892\nnotice there is a Page Break right there.\n\n204\n00:11:17.892 --> 00:11:20.087\nYou could also, if you wanted to,\n\n205\n00:11:20.087 --> 00:11:24.781\nyou could do a keyboard shortcut of\nCmd+Enter, not just regular enter,\n\n206\n00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:29.040\nthat's a regular paragraph,\nCmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter on a PC.\n\n207\n00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.151\nAnd it will do the same thing,\nand it broke the page.\n\n208\n00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:39.058\nSo now you can see that these pages break.\n\n209\n00:11:39.058 --> 00:11:43.774\nNow if I may, whoa, show and\n[LAUGH] hide character marks off,\n\n210\n00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:48.145\nyou're like but\nthat's just a bunch of enters, right?\n\n211\n00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:53.930\nThat's why understanding the importance\nof this button is so very important,\n\n212\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.436\ncuz it lets me know there is\na manual page break as it stop here.\n\n213\n00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:03.457\nBreak the page and go to the next one,\nhuge, easy, right?\n\n214\n00:12:03.457 --> 00:12:07.204\nBut understanding what it does, let's go\nback behind my head just because you wanna\n\n215\n00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:09.914\nsee, cuz I wanna stay in zoomed\nout version so you could see.\n\n216\n00:12:09.914 --> 00:12:12.998\nI want this to be\nthe start of the next page.\n\n217\n00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:16.215\nCursor in the place where\nyou want the page to start.\n\n218\n00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:18.858\nI'm gonna do a Cmd+Enter right there, and\n\n219\n00:12:18.858 --> 00:12:22.079\nnotice that it is broken into page and\nit starts here.\n\n220\n00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:26.322\nSo you can force your pages\nto start by inserting a page\n\n221\n00:12:26.322 --> 00:12:29.161\nbreak which would be really great.\n\n222\n00:12:29.161 --> 00:12:34.650\nNow do notice that I basically\ndid a manual page break\n\n223\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:41.652\nin front of every heading one, or\nwhat I had deemed as heading one.\n\n224\n00:12:41.652 --> 00:12:46.580\nWell, if you wanted this to be happening\nevery single time that you have this\n\n225\n00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.969\nparticular style, and you want this\nto be on the start of a new page,\n\n226\n00:12:50.969 --> 00:12:53.050\nput it in the style definition.\n\n227\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.109\nKinda going back around.\n\n228\n00:12:54.109 --> 00:12:59.345\nSo I'm gonna Undo those, so\nI'm just doing Cmd+Z right there to Undo.\n\n229\n00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:05.918\nIf I come into Modify this particular\nstyle, go back into my Paragraph,\n\n230\n00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:11.543\nLine and Page Breaks, and\nput a page break before, click OK.\n\n231\n00:13:11.543 --> 00:13:13.059\nClick OK there.\n\n232\n00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:15.378\nIt did the exact same thing.\n\n233\n00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.208\nPretty neat.\n\n234\n00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:19.798\nHowever, you don't see that, do you?\n\n235\n00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:24.472\nLike right here,\nI don't see why is it doing that?\n\n236\n00:13:24.472 --> 00:13:29.782\nYou tucked into the style which I\nthink is pretty effective honestly,\n\n237\n00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:35.283\nbut it could be a little misleading\nto people that might not understand.\n\n238\n00:13:35.283 --> 00:13:40.045\nThat it is in a style definition and\nit is part of your paragraph keep\n\n239\n00:13:40.045 --> 00:13:43.880\noptions rather than putting\nin those manual breaks.\n\n240\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.964\nLike I said, I like this,\nI think it's a little bit more elegant,\n\n241\n00:13:46.964 --> 00:13:49.238\nif you want to say,\na little bit more efficient.\n\n242\n00:13:49.238 --> 00:13:51.606\nBut doing it the other\nway that I showed you,\n\n243\n00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:55.255\nwhere you're manually adding\nthe page breaks, totally up to you.\n\n244\n00:13:55.255 --> 00:13:58.617\nSame idea, different way of getting to it.\n\n245\n00:13:58.617 --> 00:14:01.486\nSo that's how you can go ahead and\n\n246\n00:14:01.486 --> 00:14:06.214\nforce your pages to break is\nusing a manual page break.\n\n247\n00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:11.011\nNow, let's move on to some other things\nthat you can do with changing your page\n\n248\n00:14:11.011 --> 00:14:11.601\nlayout.\n\n249\n00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.763\nAnd I'm kinda back to square one,\nI just did a bunch of Undos.\n\n250\n00:14:14.763 --> 00:14:22.289\nLet's come over to our Layout, and\nwe're going to go with the Columns.\n\n251\n00:14:22.289 --> 00:14:24.585\nThis is a single column right now.\n\n252\n00:14:24.585 --> 00:14:26.933\nIt's always in a single\ncolumn that's by default.\n\n253\n00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:30.086\nMaybe I wanna do more of like\na newsletter type of layout.\n\n254\n00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:33.973\nI want to have two columns on the page.\n\n255\n00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:37.196\nCome over here to Columns,\ngo to Two and boom, there you go.\n\n256\n00:14:37.196 --> 00:14:41.060\nNow I did it for the entire document.\n\n257\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.718\nThat's good in the sense\nthat's how you want it.\n\n258\n00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:50.952\nWhat if I wanted to only have I'm just\ndid of control or commands data Undo.\n\n259\n00:14:50.952 --> 00:14:55.728\nI only want the Cheshire Cat\nto be in two columns and\n\n260\n00:14:55.728 --> 00:15:00.618\nthe Mock Turtle Story [LAUGH]\nto be in one column, and\n\n261\n00:15:00.618 --> 00:15:03.935\nthis other one to be in one column.\n\n262\n00:15:03.935 --> 00:15:09.298\nThis is where you're going to\nget into section breaks, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:09.298 --> 00:15:13.475\nI will say that in this drop-down,\nbecause just clicking here and\n\n264\n00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.534\ngoing to Two,\nwe already saw that it was going for\n\n265\n00:15:16.534 --> 00:15:20.058\nthe whole page because right\nnow there are no sections.\n\n266\n00:15:20.058 --> 00:15:24.582\nThere's just one section by default and\nI don't have it broken up into others.\n\n267\n00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:28.432\nLet me just show you down here in\nthe More Columns, if I go to here,\n\n268\n00:15:28.432 --> 00:15:33.056\nnow also make sure remember my cursor is\nright here, in front of Cheshire cat.\n\n269\n00:15:33.056 --> 00:15:38.095\nIf I go to Columns and go to More Columns,\nthere is an option down\n\n270\n00:15:38.095 --> 00:15:44.386\nhere to where it says Apply to Whole\ndocument by default or This point forward.\n\n271\n00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:48.323\nIf I click that, click OK.\n\n272\n00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:51.003\nSorry, I forgot to push two [LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:15:51.003 --> 00:15:52.327\nLet's try that again.\n\n274\n00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:57.546\nLet's go with More Columns, Two,\nand then from This point forward,\n\n275\n00:15:57.546 --> 00:16:00.737\nbecause it was doing\nit In a single column.\n\n276\n00:16:00.737 --> 00:16:03.207\nSo at this point forward, click OK.\n\n277\n00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:06.582\nWell you're like that's doing\nexactly what I want it to do.\n\n278\n00:16:06.582 --> 00:16:12.570\nTotally fine, but do take notice\nthat right here, what does that say?\n\n279\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.780\nIt says section break,\na continuous section break.\n\n280\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.480\nCuz that's the whole idea of\na continuous section break,\n\n281\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.920\nor any type of section breaks.\n\n282\n00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.240\nIt's just, well, what is a section?\n\n283\n00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.978\nIt's like, here's one section.\n\n284\n00:16:26.978 --> 00:16:28.960\nIt's like seatings, right?\n\n285\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.893\nGo in to, go to a hockey game,\nyou sit in section 301, or\n\n286\n00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:36.876\nyou go, do 307 in area.\n\n287\n00:16:36.876 --> 00:16:40.508\nThat's where all the super fans sit and.\n\n288\n00:16:40.508 --> 00:16:44.731\nBut those are different sections\nwithin the same arena, right?\n\n289\n00:16:44.731 --> 00:16:47.060\nSame idea here with the Word Document.\n\n290\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.050\nI can have one file or\none whole document and\n\n291\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.890\nthen section it off,\nwhy would I ever wanna do that?\n\n292\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.680\nFor things exactly like this, for\ndifferent page layouts, I only want from\n\n293\n00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:05.340\nhere to let's say here to be in columns.\n\n294\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.930\nWell, then you'd say\nwell this is section 1.\n\n295\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.880\nThis is section 2.\n\n296\n00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.320\nThis is section 3.\n\n297\n00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.276\nBecause then I can pick section 2,\nchange the columns, change the margins,\n\n298\n00:17:16.276 --> 00:17:20.719\nI could change the page layout,\nI could change the page orientation.\n\n299\n00:17:20.719 --> 00:17:25.848\nIt's like a whole different\nset of page layout options for\n\n300\n00:17:25.848 --> 00:17:30.296\na piece of a document,\nnot the whole thing.\n\n301\n00:17:30.296 --> 00:17:33.140\nSo they're very,\nvery efficient and very handy for\n\n302\n00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.790\nyou to start customizing your documents\ndifferently in different places.\n\n303\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.350\nSo that's where I'm gonna undo because\n\n304\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.740\nthis point forward\nautomatically does that.\n\n305\n00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.780\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo that like one, two, three.\n\n306\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.550\nThat whole demonstration\nthat I was doing before.\n\n307\n00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.580\nSo I would like to have from here to here,\n\n308\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.320\nthe cursor was already there,\nbut I'm just reemphasizing.\n\n309\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.030\nI wanna take that and\nmake this is where my new section starts.\n\n310\n00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.880\nIf I come over here to my breaks.\n\n311\n00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.050\nRemember, cursor in the place where\nyou want the new thing to start.\n\n312\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.220\nThat always trips people out,\n\n313\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.970\nit's like, where your cursor is, and\nwhen you need to go ahead and select this.\n\n314\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.030\nWe're going to choose a Continuous.\n\n315\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.750\nWhy would I choose a Continuous,\nI'm not breaking the page.\n\n316\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.540\nI don't want this to force\nit down into the next page.\n\n317\n00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.150\nLike, well that sounds like a page break,\na manual page break.\n\n318\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.740\nKind of.\n\n319\n00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.870\nIt is doing a page break, but\nit's creating a separate section.\n\n320\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.140\nA page break is within the same section,\n\n321\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.740\nit does not make sections\nwhen you do a page break.\n\n322\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:49.760\nIf you do a next page section break,\nbut it makes a section.\n\n323\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.015\nI feel like I'm just spinning\nin circles right now.\n\n324\n00:18:53.015 --> 00:18:54.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense but\n\n325\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.270\nlet's see how it all comes together.\n\n326\n00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:03.450\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so if I click Continuous,\nno spacing, just there's my section.\n\n327\n00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.901\nAlso take notice down here.\n\n328\n00:19:04.901 --> 00:19:06.735\nYou see where it says Section 2.\n\n329\n00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:11.745\nLet me put my cursor A sub hearts,\nit says, section 1.\n\n330\n00:19:11.745 --> 00:19:14.379\nCheshire-Cat, section 2.\n\n331\n00:19:14.379 --> 00:19:17.790\nThat's why having that there is\nvery important on your status bar.\n\n332\n00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.670\nNow I wanna make another\nsection right here,\n\n333\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.600\ncursor in the place where my new\nsection or new thing needs to be.\n\n334\n00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.910\nCome up here to Breaks, go with\nContinuous Section Break and there it is.\n\n335\n00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:34.680\nYou gotta be careful here if it's like\na really long last line of your paragraph.\n\n336\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.140\nSometimes this little indication can\nget really, really, really tiny.\n\n337\n00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.640\nWatch your status bar,\nit's very important.\n\n338\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.450\nSo I have three separate sections.\n\n339\n00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.130\nNow in the Cheshire Cat,\nwith my cursor here, and\n\n340\n00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:55.100\nthen I choose two columns,\nnotice that this didn't change.\n\n341\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.690\nThis is all one.\n\n342\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.780\nThis is two, this is one.\n\n343\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:05.276\nBecause it understood and it could\nidentify that, you're just in section 2.\n\n344\n00:20:05.276 --> 00:20:08.950\nWell that's something that I'm gonna go\nahead and apply only to this section.\n\n345\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.950\nLet me come back into that more columns,\ninto the options.\n\n346\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.680\nNotice it says apply to this section.\n\n347\n00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.860\nThat wasn't an option before\ncuz I hadn't made sections yet.\n\n348\n00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.380\nSo that's what's gonna\nhappen with your columns and\n\n349\n00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.490\nmaking sure with sections in\na document it's going to apply.\n\n350\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:31.040\nThe other thing while I'm here,\nin this more options dialogue box,\n\n351\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.250\nyou can do this line between,\nthat's kind of cute.\n\n352\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.075\nYou can also change\nthe width of your columns or\n\n353\n00:20:38.075 --> 00:20:40.257\nthe spacing between your columns.\n\n354\n00:20:40.257 --> 00:20:43.588\nLet's bump that up so\nwe can see it a little bit differently.\n\n355\n00:20:43.588 --> 00:20:44.340\nClick OK.\n\n356\n00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:51.880\nSo notice the spaces and the line for\nthe columns in this particular section.\n\n357\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.517\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n358\n00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:56.930\nthat's good to know about the options for\nyour columns.\n\n359\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:57.630\nCool, so.\n\n360\n00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:04.100\nSections, very, very important to\nunderstand and I'm gonna undo a few times\n\n361\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.690\njust to get back where we do not\nhave any sections in our document.\n\n362\n00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.940\nI'm checking out my status bar\nto make sure that that was that.\n\n363\n00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.633\nThose are continuous section breaks.\n\n364\n00:21:14.633 --> 00:21:22.760\nBut if I wanted to, I could make it\nto where I wanted a next page break.\n\n365\n00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.430\nTalked about that.\n\n366\n00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:28.650\nSo notice, there it goes, but\nit made a separate section.\n\n367\n00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.870\nSo page break plus a section\nis what it's doing.\n\n368\n00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:38.150\nThe other one I wanted to\nshow you is a column break.\n\n369\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:43.218\nThe only way that you can have a column\nbreak is if you have hmm, columns.\n\n370\n00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:47.530\nI wanted to make a section,\nbut back to where were before.\n\n371\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.990\nLet me get a setup to where,\nhere's a section, and here's a section.\n\n372\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.540\nKinda go on, oops, that's a new page.\n\n373\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.690\nLet's go with continuous.\n\n374\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.260\nIf I come here and\nput this in two columns,\n\n375\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.260\nnotice that my heading is\nalso in the column, isn't it?\n\n376\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.330\nBut I don't want that title\nto go all the way across.\n\n377\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.750\nI don't want it to be on the one column.\n\n378\n00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:15.279\nI want it to go all the way across and\nthen the columns to start here.\n\n379\n00:22:15.279 --> 00:22:20.172\nA few ways, you could have went ahead and\nmade the continuous section break\n\n380\n00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:23.851\nhere instead of here in\nfront of the mock turtle.\n\n381\n00:22:23.851 --> 00:22:26.032\nThis is another one.\n\n382\n00:22:26.032 --> 00:22:27.670\nHow about getting rid\nof that section break?\n\n383\n00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.780\nI do not want that section break.\n\n384\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.934\nYou definitely need to have your show and\nhigh character marks on it.\n\n385\n00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:38.930\nYou put your cursor in front of it and\nuse your forward delete key.\n\n386\n00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.892\nMeaning for me, I have to,\nsince I'm in a virtual machine,\n\n387\n00:22:41.892 --> 00:22:45.041\nI have to use my function delete,\nto go ahead and get rid of that.\n\n388\n00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:49.588\nAnd notice that now\nthe section break is gone.\n\n389\n00:22:49.588 --> 00:22:51.180\nYou just put it here.\n\n390\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.850\nIf I put my cursor in\nthe next paragraph and\n\n391\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.010\nthen insert the continuous section break.\n\n392\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.770\nThere we go!\n\n393\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.150\nNow the section starts from here down, and\n\n394\n00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:08.000\nif I change this into two columns see\nhow that title stays across, very nice.\n\n395\n00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.954\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n396\n00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:12.291\n&gt;&gt; Now a column break would\nhave to have a column and\n\n397\n00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:15.640\nthen it's just breaking\non to the next column.\n\n398\n00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.449\nMaybe I would like queen of hearts\nto be starting on the next column.\n\n399\n00:23:20.449 --> 00:23:23.100\nDon't do this, we know that that's\nnot what we are supposed to do\n\n400\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.860\n&gt;&gt; That is a no, no.\n\n401\n00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.890\n&gt;&gt; We can put in a column break.\n\n402\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.000\nSo put in your cursor in where you\nwant your new column to start.\n\n403\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.980\nCome up to your breaks.\n\n404\n00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.970\nIt's not in your columns.\n\n405\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.727\nI know you wanna go there, at least I do.\n\n406\n00:23:33.727 --> 00:23:37.107\n[LAUGH] I go into a column break, and\n\n407\n00:23:37.107 --> 00:23:42.014\nthen it [SOUND] forces that\nup into the next column.\n\n408\n00:23:42.014 --> 00:23:45.180\nSo that's what we would do for\ncolumn breaks.\n\n409\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.780\nAnd there we go.\n\n410\n00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.720\nPerfect.\nNow it does kind\n\n411\n00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.350\nof throw off my spacing in here.\n\n412\n00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.240\nSo I might wanna get ahead and\nget rid of that.\n\n413\n00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.050\nIf I don't want that there, again,\nput in your cursor in the front.\n\n414\n00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.188\nForward delete.\n\n415\n00:23:58.188 --> 00:23:59.828\nOkay, get rid of that.\n\n416\n00:23:59.828 --> 00:24:02.813\nAnd so we can take that off.\n\n417\n00:24:02.813 --> 00:24:04.140\nPretty cool.\n\n418\n00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.020\nSo you can see where sections\ncan do a lot for you.\n\n419\n00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.610\nYou can start changing the layout\nof your pages in different places.\n\n420\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.469\nRemoving them, that's always\nan important thing to say, hey,\n\n421\n00:24:16.469 --> 00:24:20.483\nI want to get rid of that,\nputting it in front and forward deleting.\n\n422\n00:24:20.483 --> 00:24:23.004\nNotice that all my columns went away too.\n\n423\n00:24:23.004 --> 00:24:24.235\nWait, I was in the wrong section.\n\n424\n00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:26.710\n[LAUGH] Making sure you're\nin the right section.\n\n425\n00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:27.740\nThat's always important.\n\n426\n00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.470\nBut you can go ahead and\nformat that differently.\n\n427\n00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:36.010\nAnd again, just to say that if you\nwanted to put this on to the next page,\n\n428\n00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:43.670\nyou could go ahead and make a section,\na continuous section break.\n\n429\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:49.964\nAnd then do a page break, but\nthen you're double breaking.\n\n430\n00:24:49.964 --> 00:24:53.927\nYou don't really need to,\nthere's nothing wrong with this,\n\n431\n00:24:53.927 --> 00:24:58.887\nit's just you can go ahead and accomplish\nit all in one with doing a next break.\n\n432\n00:24:58.887 --> 00:25:03.952\nAnd then using all of those options within\na style can even make it a little bit more\n\n433\n00:25:03.952 --> 00:25:09.040\nefficient, understanding the widows and\norphans and the keep lines together.\n\n434\n00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.639\nTo me, as somebody that\ndoes a lot of page layout,\n\n435\n00:25:12.639 --> 00:25:16.429\nthis is the be all and\nend all of everything that I do.\n\n436\n00:25:16.429 --> 00:25:23.154\nBecause the flow of your text, the\nreadability of the book that I lay out,\n\n437\n00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:28.049\nmaking sure that this all\nflows nicely is important.\n\n438\n00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:33.665\nAnd it might be things that you don't\neven really notice as a normal person.\n\n439\n00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:37.253\nNow that you're taking all my classes,\nyou're not normal, you're gonna be like\n\n440\n00:25:37.253 --> 00:25:40.788\nme where you're going to start looking at\nevery single piece of literature you get\n\n441\n00:25:40.788 --> 00:25:43.790\nand seeing where they changed things and\nthe spacing of everything.\n\n442\n00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.520\nAnd you're gonna be like, wow,\nthis is really hard to read.\n\n443\n00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.769\nThey really need to increase\ntheir leading, line spacing.\n\n444\n00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:54.181\nSo you're gonna start seeing\nthe same things that I do, and\n\n445\n00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:58.870\nhopefully that way it is not even\nnoticeable to normal people.\n\n446\n00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.442\nIt just reads beautifully.\n\n447\n00:26:00.442 --> 00:26:05.306\nBut how to control your pagination,\nwhere things break, how things flow\n\n448\n00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:10.719\nthroughout your document, and how to apply\nthose different types of page layouts\n\n449\n00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:16.536\nto different parts of your documents, the\nsections that's so very important in Word.\n\n450\n00:26:16.536 --> 00:26:21.638\nAnd hopefully, this is kind of like\nsometimes kinda the boring stuff,\n\n451\n00:26:21.638 --> 00:26:23.516\nor at least people [NOISE].\n\n452\n00:26:23.516 --> 00:26:24.917\nI don't think it's boring.\n\n453\n00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:26.812\nI hope you don't think it's boring.\n\n454\n00:26:26.812 --> 00:26:32.648\nI hope, again, you're getting those\nnow I know why Word keeps doing that,\n\n455\n00:26:32.648 --> 00:26:36.673\nand where I can go to control it,\nand with my styles.\n\n456\n00:26:36.673 --> 00:26:38.861\nAnd hopefully you've learned a few things.\n\n457\n00:26:38.861 --> 00:26:41.762\nAnd I think I'm gonna go ahead and\napply the brakes right now and\n\n458\n00:26:41.762 --> 00:26:43.240\nsay that we're done.\n\n459\n00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.195\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful, well,\nit's very artistic, isn't it?\n\n460\n00:26:45.195 --> 00:26:46.650\nIt's not just literary.\n\n461\n00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.300\nIt becomes artistic when you're really\nworking on styles and formats and layouts.\n\n462\n00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.010\nSo keep options, breaks, columns.\n\n463\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.000\nWonderful episode.\n\n464\n00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.190\nMake sure you see everything in the Word\n2016 Essentials for Mac series.\n\n465\n00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.810\nCheck out all the other\nvideos in the course library,\n\n466\n00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.640\nall of Vonne's great videos\nthat she has in there too.\n\n467\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.885\nYou'll be glad you did, and\nit's designed to help you go further.\n\n468\n00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:07.840\nAnd

00:00:16.900\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n4\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.590\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.310\nLittle look at blank page and\ncover page and\n\n6\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.780\nVon Smith I'm gonna help you again\nbecause I care and she really does care,\n\n7\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.160\nshe really does but I'm great to\nhave you here, thank so very much.\n\n8\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.280\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.\n\n9\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.230\nI do care and so much so\n\n10\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.330\nthat I originally titled this, keep\noptions, breaks, and columns part two.\n\n11\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.570\nBut I don't really like that, so I\nfigured I'd switched up a little bit, and\n\n12\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.985\ncall it exactly what\nwe're gonna be covering.\n\n13\n00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:49.310\nBlank pages and cover pages.\n\n14\n00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.315\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n15\n00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:51.643\n&gt;&gt; Imagine that, right?\n\n16\n00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:52.175\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n17\n00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:55.025\n&gt;&gt; But it is all part of the layout and\n\n18\n00:00:55.025 --> 00:01:00.515\nhow to control, how the flow of your\ndocument goes across multiple pages.\n\n19\n00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:06.870\nSo that's why it is part of this topic,\nand it does involve breaks and with our\n\n20\n00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.850\npage breaks and so on and so forth so\nit kind of falls along that same line.\n\n21\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.990\nBut I wanted to keep it\na little bit separate.\n\n22\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\nWell, how do we get started and\n\n23\n00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.650\nwhat are we gonna be looking at?\n\n24\n00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.430\n&gt;&gt; Well let's jump on down.\n\n25\n00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.930\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n26\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.490\n&gt;&gt; Let's look through\nthe looking glass actually it's\n\n27\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.595\njust because that's one\nof the titles right here.\n\n28\n00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:28.380\n[LAUGH] in a file called brakes.docx.\n\n29\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.840\nAll right so, yes, I could go ahead and\nput my cursor in here and\n\n30\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.570\nagain we're not really necessarily\nconcentrating on reading the text,\n\n31\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.570\nit's more looking at the pages.\n\n32\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.800\nIf I put my cursor in front\nof the t in through and\n\n33\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.430\nI did my command enter that\nwas our keyboard shortcut for\n\n34\n00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.430\npage break, notice that that goes\nahead and break the page and\n\n35\n00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.660\ngets the text that you add your\ncursor in the start of the next page.\n\n36\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.520\nThat is not the same as\ninserting a blank page.\n\n37\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.962\nNow inserting a blank page\njust sends a blank page.\n\n38\n00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:02.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.440\n&gt;&gt; But if you do it here,\n\n40\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.620\nlet me show you the difference.\n\n41\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.040\nIt is going to do that double breaking,\nand I talked about a double break\n\n42\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.430\nin our previous episode where\nI said you could go ahead and\n\n43\n00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.830\nmake a continuous section break and\nthen a manual page break,\n\n44\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.550\nwhy don't you just go ahead and put it all\ntogether and do a section next page break?\n\n45\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.920\nWell, this is where if I put my cursor in\nfront of the t in through, and I go to\n\n46\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.950\ninsert, and I go to blank page, which is\nunder the pages group, watch what happens.\n\n47\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.610\nIt broke the page.\n\n48\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.070\nBut then it put a whole other blank page,\nand\n\n49\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.120\nthen, through the looking\nglass starts here.\n\n50\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.500\nSo that's where it is a double page break.\n\n51\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.475\nAnd if you think about, we'll insert\na blank, there's your blank page.\n\n52\n00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:56.470\n[LAUGH] It's a full blank page, and\ndepending on where you put this,\n\n53\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.240\nit will make a difference of how much\nwhite space, if you want to say,\n\n54\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.320\nyou are going to get.\n\n55\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.690\nI just did a command Z for undo.\n\n56\n00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.900\nFor example, if I had it here,\nto where, now actually that,\n\n57\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.030\nwhat should I do here for this Alice in\nWonderland, I should definitely do that\n\n58\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.790\nkeep with next in the style definition so\nit would be on the next page.\n\n59\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.910\nBut if I came here in\nthe down the rabbit hole and\n\n60\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.890\nI went to the insert blank page notice\nhere, it's just like a singe page\n\n61\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.820\ncuz it was already automatically going\nthrough but it is a full blank page.\n\n62\n00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.660\nSo just don't get yourself too\nkind of turned around on, well,\n\n63\n00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.390\nthis one's only a single break.\n\n64\n00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.640\nWell, yeah, because of where it\nactually all flowed within the text.\n\n65\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.450\nIf I came down here and\nstarted typing more stuff,\n\n66\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.610\ndo you see how there's the extra\nblankness, and then there's another page,\n\n67\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.890\nbut if I needed another blank page, I just\nwanted to show the concept of putting it\n\n68\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.190\nright in the middle of verses where it\nwas already kinda stopping automatically,\n\n69\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.160\nso that is insert blank page.\n\n70\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.810\nWhy would you wanna do that?\n\n71\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.505\nWell, if you have a really long document,\nif you start getting into,\n\n72\n00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:14.220\nwe're talking 40, 50, 80 pages.\n\n73\n00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.080\nSometimes you might want to put\na blank page between chapters, right?\n\n74\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.810\nYou've seen it all of your novels,\nyour text books,\n\n75\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.070\nsometimes a page is intentionally left\nblank because it needs to have a certain\n\n76\n00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.130\ntotal number of pages for possibly like\nprinting because when you start getting\n\n77\n00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.460\ninto sending this off to a commercial\nprinter to have this mass produced.\n\n78\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.690\nThey're not taking single pages of\neight and a half by eleven pages and\n\n79\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.747\nstapling them all together or whatever.\n\n80\n00:04:44.747 --> 00:04:50.600\nYou're getting large sheets of paper and\nthey're in positioning multiple pages\n\n81\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.500\non one sheet of paper then sending it\nto the press then cutting it down,\n\n82\n00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.720\nand [INAUDIBLE] in positioning and\nthen going ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.770\nputting the signatures together\nthen go ahead and staple it.\n\n84\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.940\nI do a lot of stuff with printing and\nmy husband works at a print shop.\n\n85\n00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.080\nSo I know about all stuff, you be like I\nhave no idea what you're talking about.\n\n86\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.980\nJust know that your final format isn't\n\n87\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.910\nalways at the page size\nit starts off with.\n\n88\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.390\nAnd for cost effectiveness depending\non whether your signature is like\n\n89\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.780\nyou want them in either eights or\n16s or fours.\n\n90\n00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.790\nIt's usually four, eight,\n16 or some type of four or\n\n91\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.580\neight type stuff of how much they put on\nthe page maybe for cost effectiveness.\n\n92\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.343\nYou can get it into a certain\nnumber of pages divisible by eight.\n\n93\n00:05:34.343 --> 00:05:38.308\nWell, let's say you have 80 and\n\n94\n00:05:38.308 --> 00:05:43.378\nI need [LAUGH] 82 and\nI need to get it to 88.\n\n95\n00:05:43.378 --> 00:05:47.767\nWow, I'm doing really bad at math, but you\nsee what I'm saying is if you need to add\n\n96\n00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:51.680\na couple extra pages to get to\nnext level for cost effectiveness.\n\n97\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.110\nThat's why you might want to go ahead and\n\n98\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.630\nthrow in blank pages to help with\nthe flow of the document, and\n\n99\n00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.340\nit could be for your cost effectiveness\non your printing that you need to do.\n\n100\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.890\nSo just throwing in\nthose actionable things.\n\n101\n00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.000\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; So that's what a blank page does.\n\n102\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.550\nWhat does a cover page do?\n\n103\n00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.170\nI remember having to write book reports\nback when you had to actually write\n\n104\n00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.070\nthem by hand back in\nfourth grade I believe.\n\n105\n00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.140\nAnd you had like the, remember the\ntransparent covers and you did the little\n\n106\n00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.920\n&gt;&gt; Little window in the front.\n\n107\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that thing that\nlooks like a triangle that you\n\n108\n00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.700\nwould seal it all together.\n\n109\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.930\nIt was,\nI have very fond memories of those.\n\n110\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.280\n&gt;&gt; In days gone by.\n\n111\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n112\n00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.470\nAnd you'd always have to write\na cover page for your book, right?\n\n113\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.335\n&gt;&gt; Or the title page too it\nwhat we call it sometimes.\n\n114\n00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:41.607\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n115\n00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:44.530\nSo a cover page is exactly that, but\n\n116\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.030\nthe cool thing about doing it\nWord is like they have a bunch\n\n117\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.090\nof pre-made templates that you can choose\nand add a cover page automatically.\n\n118\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.880\nLet me show you.\n\n119\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.530\nSo back on the same document\nwe'll stay on this one for now.\n\n120\n00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.170\nIt does not matter where you're at.\n\n121\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.900\nI could be down here on page three.\n\n122\n00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.830\nI am clicking in the middle\nof somewhere there.\n\n123\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.210\nI can come up to insert, go to cover page.\n\n124\n00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:14.385\nNow I choose the drop down, look at\nall the different like fancy looking\n\n125\n00:07:14.385 --> 00:07:17.215\ncover pages of title\npage if you call that.\n\n126\n00:07:17.215 --> 00:07:21.165\nAnd the latest they have some with\nsome different graphics on them,\n\n127\n00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:25.955\nsome different colors and\nmaybe with some grass.\n\n128\n00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:29.435\nLet's go with this feathers, why not?\n\n129\n00:07:29.435 --> 00:07:32.010\nSo I click on this and\nit added right there.\n\n130\n00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.560\nNotice, it did not add the cover page\nback down on the beginning of page three,\n\n131\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.410\nit went to the beginning of your\ndocument and added a cool page.\n\n132\n00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.640\nIt does do a page break right here, so\nit does all of that automatically, and\n\n133\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.990\nit gives me some default pieces\nthat I can work with, and\n\n134\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.000\nnotice all of this is customizable,\nso if I wanted to come in.\n\n135\n00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.030\nYou're like, sorry, I'm trying to\nget this view towards one page.\n\n136\n00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.400\nThere we go,\nthat's what I was looking for.\n\n137\n00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.320\nMore like,\nwhy does it have these things and\n\n138\n00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.230\nwhy are they in like\na brackets right there?\n\n139\n00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.915\nAnd let me turn this off just so\nthis gets a little misleading.\n\n140\n00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:13.430\nWell, this is tied into something\nthat's document properties.\n\n141\n00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.580\nI did this one specifically because\nthis particular document does not have\n\n142\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.005\nany properties defined.\n\n143\n00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.730\nThat makes you think, well,\nyou can define properties.\n\n144\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.670\nAnd once you define the properties it\nwill automatically pull that into it.\n\n145\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.660\nYes, it can and I'll show you an example.\n\n146\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.700\nBut for now I don't have it but\nthat's okay, just take this and\n\n147\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.760\njust click in there and just type in\nAlice in Wonderland, so you don't\n\n148\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.450\nhave to use what they have there,\nlike where it says document subtitle,\n\n149\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.040\nI don't want a subtitle, just click\nin there and just backspace over it.\n\n150\n00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.940\nSince it's, these are known as\nfields that you can add into your\n\n151\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.700\ndocument manually if you wanted to,\nbut it's usually in its fields and\n\n152\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.780\nits kind of just giving you a way\nof getting to where you need to go.\n\n153\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.010\nMaybe you don't want the company name and\nmaybe you don't want Lance Bass.\n\n154\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.190\nAnd why is it saying Lance Bass there?\n\n155\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.540\nThat's just because of, whoops sorry.\n\n156\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:10.650\nThat's the name of the person that is\nattached to this particular file that was\n\n157\n00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.300\nmade because that's the, it's the account\nthat I made it under in this [INAUDIBLE].\n\n158\n00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, I remember that.\n\n159\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.650\n&gt;&gt; So I just actually took that\nwhole thing and deleted it.\n\n160\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.310\nThis does get into, notice up here,\nshapes and picture formats.\n\n161\n00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:28.630\nSo in the word advanced, we talk a lot\nabout being able to format all of this.\n\n162\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:34.140\nSo I don't want you to get too confused or\nlike, this isn't exactly what I want.\n\n163\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.890\nIt is meant to pretty much be how it is,\nlike you like the feathers.\n\n164\n00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.540\nYou could go ahead and change maybe the\nfill color of this particular shape, but\n\n165\n00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.890\nthen sometimes it's like there's\nmultiple shapes that are combined\n\n166\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.470\nin together to make one.\n\n167\n00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.850\nSo sometimes you're like I'm trying\nto change the color of it, but\n\n168\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.320\nit's not actually applying.\n\n169\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.840\nIt's just the nature of how it's created.\n\n170\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.930\nAnd the more you know about shapes and\n\n171\n00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.790\nformatting them in words\ngonna get a little easier.\n\n172\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.740\nSo you can see I think you can\nchange it from blue to green and\n\n173\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.900\nI can do some other things.\n\n174\n00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.900\nThis is a whole picture that I can\ndo some formatting things to it.\n\n175\n00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.620\nAnd so I can change some colors.\n\n176\n00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.520\nI'm getting into more things\nthat are in other shows, but\n\n177\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.630\nthis is fully customizable\nif you wanted to.\n\n178\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.900\nIt's nice that it has a lot of\nthings that to start with and\n\n179\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.320\nyou can kind of play around with it.\n\n180\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.940\n&gt;&gt; Now just a silly little question but,\nthis is all open source right?\n\n181\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.940\nYou can use this material without fear of,\nhey you can't use that.\n\n182\n00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.145\n&gt;&gt; Like copyrights and things like that\n&gt;&gt; I would say yes.\n\n183\n00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:36.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would think it is.\n\n184\n00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.720\n&gt;&gt; Well it's also part of Office so\nlike this whatever graphic this is,\n\n185\n00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.760\nI mean if it's being used in like\na general format, it'll fine.\n\n186\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.090\nSo I don't think it would work.\n\n187\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.440\nNow if you put your company logo on it and\nthings like that and then brand it for\n\n188\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.520\nyourself, in a sense,\nI could put the ITProTV logo down there.\n\n189\n00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.920\nThat gives into inserting more\npictures and so on and so forth.\n\n190\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.616\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; But [CROSSTALK]\n\n191\n00:10:56.616 --> 00:10:57.552\n&gt;&gt; That's residual.\n\n192\n00:10:57.552 --> 00:11:02.029\n&gt;&gt; The nice thing is that it does\nhave a nice gallery of pretty\n\n193\n00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:06.060\ndecent looking things to\npick from in your Insert.\n\n194\n00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.450\nSorry, I forgot where I was going.\n\n195\n00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.930\nNow if I am back here,\nlet me just zoom out so\n\n196\n00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.920\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n197\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.860\nHm, maybe I don't like that\nparticular cover page.\n\n198\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.440\nIf I go into here and go to cover page,\nI could pick this badge one.\n\n199\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.850\nYou're thinking,\ndoes that mean I'm gonna get a double?\n\n200\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.410\nNope, it just goes ahead changes whatever\n\n201\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.550\nlayout of that current\ncover page that you have.\n\n202\n00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.310\nIt doesn't add a second cover page.\n\n203\n00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.830\nSo, just in case you were wondering that\nand maybe I'll go over to this one, or\n\n204\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.810\nlet's go over to this one, so on and so\nforth, you can see that it replaces.\n\n205\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.880\nBut now maybe I don't\nwant a cover page at all.\n\n206\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.450\nLet's just take this off.\n\n207\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:49.930\nYou could take it from here and\njust go down to remove cover page.\n\n208\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.190\nTake it all out, and\n\n209\n00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:56.180\nnow Alice in Wonderland is the very\nfirst page of that particular document.\n\n210\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.420\nThat's where adding in say,\na cover page, and then a blank page,\n\n211\n00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.780\nbecause in a regular book,\nif you look at any of your books,\n\n212\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.220\nyou don't start If I'm looking at a page,\nyou don't start the page over here,\n\n213\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.300\nyou always start the text on\nthe right side of a book.\n\n214\n00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.190\nIt's very rare that you\nstart it on the left side.\n\n215\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.760\n&gt;&gt; I would say just about every hardcover\nbook I have, the very first page is blank.\n\n216\n00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.280\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nYeah, yeah, and\n\n217\n00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.020\nit's just the way of pagination, and\nstarting the text from the right-hand\n\n218\n00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.762\nside, it's just It's just the you\nknow convention of books I guess.\n\n219\n00:12:27.762 --> 00:12:29.680\n[LAUGH] You can start on left if you want.\n\n220\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.580\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But that's why\n\n221\n00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.170\nusing a cover page understand like\ninserting blank pages can be really handy.\n\n222\n00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:39.120\nNow back over to those fields,\nthose document properties.\n\n223\n00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.070\nNow we get in the document properties\nin the expert level of Word.\n\n224\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.660\nBut I have one called\nWelcome to Word here.\n\n225\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.650\nAnd at first glance you're like\nthere's not any different.\n\n226\n00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.794\nBut if I go in to insert the cover page.\n\n227\n00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:59.220\nAnd let's choose let's choose this one,\nokay?\n\n228\n00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.530\nIf I click on that,\nnotice it puts in the date,\n\n229\n00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.010\nit also welcome to word\ndocument properties.\n\n230\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.700\nWow, look at that Justin Timberlake,\nOfficePro TV,\n\n231\n00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.220\nall of those different things\nwere added automatically\n\n232\n00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.210\nbecause I have document properties\nin this particular fields, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:23.270\nIf I go into File and\nI go to Properties, I can\n\n234\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:30.720\nadd in a whole bunch of meta data into my\ndocument that's not just like the file\n\n235\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.150\nname, the title and\nthe file name are not the same thing.\n\n236\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.570\nNotice they're totally different here.\n\n237\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.640\nAnd the subject and the author,\nI can also add in custom fields.\n\n238\n00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.630\nThey're not necessarily being pulled\nfrom in this particular template\n\n239\n00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.930\nof the cover page, but\nthese are all things that you can\n\n240\n00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.980\nadd into your document that's not\nnecessarily in the surface level,\n\n241\n00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:57.260\nthat's what they call metadata that can be\npulled, but it is using this information\n\n242\n00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.750\nto pull in things like\nJustin Timberlake as the author,\n\n243\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:07.280\nOffice Pro TV as the company,\nIntroduction to MS Word as the subject,\n\n244\n00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.890\nand so that's why you get\npre-populated information when I add\n\n245\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.980\nthe cover page to this particular document\nas opposed to The Alice in Wonderland.\n\n246\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.670\nLet's just zoom in a little bit.\n\n247\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:26.490\nIf I added that cover page, the same one,\nsame one, it just has the field.\n\n248\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.460\nAnd I put Alice in Wonderland from\nthe last one so that's why it's pulling.\n\n249\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.540\nBut document, subtitle,\ncompany name, company address.\n\n250\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.620\nNone of those fields in the documents\nproperties are populated.\n\n251\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.670\nSo that's why the title is right there.\n\n252\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.870\nBut that's why they're different.\n\n253\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.280\nYou have to have the properties\nto make it do that so.\n\n254\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.970\nBut again you could delete all of them.\n\n255\n00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.800\nEven in this one maybe I don't want\nto have this just select it and\n\n256\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.780\nhit delete Again getting into the shapes\nversus the text and the shapes.\n\n257\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.270\nThat can get a little wonky for\npeople if you don't understand how to even\n\n258\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.530\nwork with that particular type\nof content then your document.\n\n259\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.230\nThen I say hey just use the template,\nfill in the pieces that you want,\n\n260\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.750\ndelete the parts you don't want.\n\n261\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:15.270\nCome over here and figure out that you\ncan change the fill color of them.\n\n262\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.650\nNotice it does both cuz it's grouped.\n\n263\n00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.050\nOkay, but anyways, we can get into that.\n\n264\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.950\nBut anyways, pretty cool stuff,\npretty easy to do too.\n\n265\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.600\nYou just add a cover page,\nadd a blank page and\n\n266\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.500\nhave your document flow however you so\ndesire.\n\n267\n00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.780\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic work Yvonne.\n\n268\n00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.220\nThanks so very much, and so excited now.\n\n269\n00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.850\nYou can do all these things that\nyou might not known before and\n\n270\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.420\nI'm one of those people, so\nI'm actually gonna explore more that.\n\n271\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:45.180\nThis has been blank page and cover page\ninside of the Word 2016 essentials or Mac.\n\n272\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.840\nMake sure you watch every single episode,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n273\n00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.810\nTake a look at the other\nvideos in our course

00:00:17.000\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n4\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.010\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with Word 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.310\nWe're gonna be looking at margins,\nheaders, and footers.\n\n6\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.580\nAnd we've asked Vonne Smith once again to\ncome on in here and help us out with that,\n\n7\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.050\nbecause she knows what we need to know.\n\n8\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.240\nWe have Vonne,\nglad to have you here, thank you.\n\n9\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.580\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.170\nYes, I do know a little bit about\nheaders and footers, and margins.\n\n11\n00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.780\n&gt;&gt; She does.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.670\n&gt;&gt; And we were talking.\n\n13\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.300\nThis is another one of those my episodes,\ncuz I like to keep things in threes.\n\n14\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.770\n&gt;&gt; Margins and headers and footers, my.\n\n15\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Margins and headers and footers.\n\n16\n00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.000\n&gt;&gt; Well it's kind of a half my.\n\n17\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.930\n&gt;&gt; Half?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if we can half a third.\n\n18\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.150\n&gt;&gt; Now we're getting into math,\nI'm getting scared, [LAUGH] but.\n\n19\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.380\nAs you can see with the punctuation\nit's margins comma headers and footers.\n\n20\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.030\n&gt;&gt; Headers and footers.\n\n21\n00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so headers and\nfooters we kinda keep together.\n\n22\n00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.980\nThey're not necessarily\ntwo separate entities.\n\n23\n00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.060\nIt goes back to another one of my favorite\nsayings is the together yet separate.\n\n24\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.880\nBut we'll get to what a header and\nfooter is really all about.\n\n25\n00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.570\nBecause this is all about page layout.\n\n26\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.690\nHow do I want my pages to look like?\n\n27\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.530\n&gt;&gt; and we've talked a little bit about\nkeep options and we did some columns.\n\n28\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.678\nWe talked about the all-important section,\nvery very important there.\n\n29\n00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:28.710\nAnd we're gonna be hitting up\nsome sections again today because\n\n30\n00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.105\nchanging the margins of your page.\n\n31\n00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:32.845\nSo let's talk about that first.\n\n32\n00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:33.915\nWhat is the margin?\n\n33\n00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:38.145\nThe margin is the white\narea around your page.\n\n34\n00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:40.195\nLike if we have this,\nmy little show notes,\n\n35\n00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:43.465\nall this white area around the sides,\nthat would be the margin.\n\n36\n00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:47.815\nAnd you can control that and depending on\nwhether you have a larger margin, that\n\n37\n00:01:47.815 --> 00:01:52.260\nwould make more white space, or you have\na smaller margin, has less white space.\n\n38\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.640\nYou can fit more content on the page.\n\n39\n00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.420\nSo that really kind of determines how,\n\n40\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.430\nit's a part of how we have our\ntext flow through our document.\n\n41\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.070\nAnd there's a lot of times I tend\nto like to put on narrow margins,\n\n42\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.050\ncuz I wanna try to get more\non a page then those things.\n\n43\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.760\nAnd I also remember\nwriting papers in school.\n\n44\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.940\nIt was always that you have to\nhave a one-inch margin all around.\n\n45\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.850\nIt had to be like a 12 point,\nTimes New Roman, double spaced,\n\n46\n00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.563\nall those kind of specific requirements\nthat you would need to have for\n\n47\n00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:23.610\nhow you would turn in your paper.\n\n48\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.550\nAnd luckily, now if you just want\na one-inch margin, you just click a little\n\n49\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.440\nbutton because we have a bunch of presets,\nwhich is always very nice.\n\n50\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.000\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njump in to a file called Page Layout.\n\n51\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.140\nI've already got it opened up.\n\n52\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.060\nAnd again we're not concentrating on\nthe text, so if you can't see it too well,\n\n53\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.610\nyou can't read it, that's all right.\n\n54\n00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.960\nWe're really gonna be concentrating\non the edges of the paper.\n\n55\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.790\nAnd what we're going to do is,\nwell, change our margins.\n\n56\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.590\nNow there's a couple different ways that\nyou can get to modifying your margins.\n\n57\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.740\nSo let me show you\na couple different places.\n\n58\n00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.000\nSince this is page layout,\nwe have the layout tab on the ribbon.\n\n59\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.740\nSo on this layout tab, you can see right\nover here, on the left, we have, Margins.\n\n60\n00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:09.005\nAnd that whole just click to find\nthat one-inch margin all around?\n\n61\n00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:10.475\nWell, there you go.\n\n62\n00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:14.385\nMine's actually on it right now and\nthey are calling this preset Normal.\n\n63\n00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:20.445\nAnd you can notice right here that it has\nthe specific measurements on all the top,\n\n64\n00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:24.510\nbottom, left, right, for\nyou to go and find right there.\n\n65\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.870\nAnd this last Custom setting,\nthat's always gonna be there.\n\n66\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.300\nIt's gonna change to the last\nsetting you had, kind of apropo-ly.\n\n67\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.570\nApropoly, is apropoly a word?\n\n68\n00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.370\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's have a consent.\n\n69\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.870\nApropoly?\n\n70\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.960\nYeah!\nYeah, they said yes, no.\n\n71\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, in my vocabulary, I make up\nall sorts of wonderful words, so.\n\n72\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.790\n[LAUGH] I don't know if they're wonderful,\nbut they're interesting.\n\n73\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.390\nSo you can see how it will change.\n\n74\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.380\nNow let's go and change some of\nthese presets really quickly, so\n\n75\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.980\nwe can see how it adjusts.\n\n76\n00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.370\nIf I go to a narrow margin,\nwatch all the content.\n\n77\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.580\nYou see how now, less whitespace around\nthe edges, so I can get more words.\n\n78\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.438\nIf I go into a wider margin,\nthat means the margin is wide so\n\n79\n00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:10.158\nyou have less area for your content.\n\n80\n00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:14.356\nSo, all right sometimes for\nme it like it's almost backwards cuz\n\n81\n00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:19.334\nI'm thinking narrow, this to me would\nbe narrow and then this would be wide.\n\n82\n00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:22.448\nCuz I'm looking more at\nthe content of what's being fit.\n\n83\n00:04:22.448 --> 00:04:24.518\nBut no, we're talking about\nwhite space with margins.\n\n84\n00:04:24.518 --> 00:04:29.400\n&gt;&gt; And so, Vonne, when you're do that, are\nyou changing the size of your text or no?\n\n85\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.330\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n86\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.720\nThat's a good point,\nall the content, the font size,\n\n87\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.560\nthe spacing, all of that stays the same.\n\n88\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.750\nIt's really just the space\naround it that is adjusting.\n\n89\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.750\nCuz you might kind of see a change in that\nway, but all the content stays the same.\n\n90\n00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.230\n&gt;&gt; I think it's just\na trick of the eye too.\n\n91\n00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.880\nI mean, it looks like the text might\nbe changing size, but it's not.\n\n92\n00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, it is one of those things,\nlike, is that the same?\n\n93\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.530\nSo, good point, very good point.\n\n94\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.580\nSo, we have the layout tab and\nour margins for our presets right there.\n\n95\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.030\nThere's a couple other places you\ncan get to changing your margins.\n\n96\n00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.526\nYou can go into the Format menu and\nthen go to Document.\n\n97\n00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:09.980\nThis is actually a place that we're going\nto be going to quite frequently in this\n\n98\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.920\ntopic area of page layout,\n\n99\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.442\nbecause it's the easiest way to get\nto the place that you need to go.\n\n100\n00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:19.980\nCuz we're formatting your document which\nis where you go into your margins and\n\n101\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.850\nalso into your page layout.\n\n102\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.090\nThat we'll get into in\nsome other episodes.\n\n103\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.690\nBut there's another place\nthat you can get to it.\n\n104\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.090\nI'm gonna cancel this.\n\n105\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.040\nYou can go into the Page Setup, and\nthat's normally where I'd go to\n\n106\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.210\ntalk about setup of your page\nwhen I'm teaching Word on PC.\n\n107\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.210\nWhen you teach Word on a Mac,\nyou can still get to it.\n\n108\n00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.810\nIt's File &gt; Page Setup.\n\n109\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.380\nBut it's not as quick.\n\n110\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.130\nI have to go three different hops,\nor three different clicks,\n\n111\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.280\nto get to the same place this.\n\n112\n00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.880\nCuz I go from Page Setup and\nit's like all right, well,\n\n113\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.550\nI'm just talking about how it's\nformatting for the printer.\n\n114\n00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.660\nThen you have to change\nthis drop-down at the top.\n\n115\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.430\nGo to the Page Setup for Word,\nand then it gets into this.\n\n116\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.520\nAnd then it's talking about, how do\nI want to change, the whole document,\n\n117\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.780\nor this point forward.\n\n118\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.420\nAnytime you see this point\nforward in any of your options,\n\n119\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.350\nwhether we talked about columns or\n\n120\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.190\npage setup, you're gonna automatically\nmake a continuous section break.\n\n121\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.072\nSo always keep in mind, that at this\npoint forward, you will have sections.\n\n122\n00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:27.030\nBut notice from here, I gotta go to\nmargins and then from margins I can\n\n123\n00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.790\nget back in to the same place\nwhere I'm formatting my document.\n\n124\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.890\nSo again, I think just go to the Format\nmenu, it's a little bit easier.\n\n125\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.870\nAnd then down at the bottom,\nit goes back to page setup so\n\n126\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.165\nyou can kind of,\nyou feel like you're doing loops around.\n\n127\n00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:42.310\n[LAUGH] But\nyou can get to these different places.\n\n128\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.950\nThese different options\nfrom different places.\n\n129\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.380\n&gt;&gt; Options, options, options.\n\n130\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.994\n&gt;&gt; Always, right?\n\n131\n00:06:46.994 --> 00:06:49.190\n&gt;&gt; Lots of options.\n&gt;&gt; There's always 15 ways to get to\n\n132\n00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.160\nthe same place in pretty much\nall of your applications.\n\n133\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.100\nBut I tend to probably go to the layout,\nand then go to the drop-down,\n\n134\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.950\nchoose a lot of the presets but\nthen, hey, there's another one.\n\n135\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.830\nGo to the Custom Margins\nfrom that drop-down and\n\n136\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.950\nit gets you to the same place.\n\n137\n00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.680\nBecause this is somewhere where\nmaybe the presets aren't in any\n\n138\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.450\nmeasurement that you need.\n\n139\n00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.690\nBecause a lot of companies maybe\nhave a printed stationery,\n\n140\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.380\nlike letterhead, that you're going to\nbe printing like an official document.\n\n141\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.520\nAnd you might need two and\n\n142\n00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.190\na half on that top margin to be able\nto get all of that to go through.\n\n143\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.850\nAnd as I'm talking this out,\n\n144\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.780\nI realize I think I missed a key\npoint on talking about margins.\n\n145\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.470\nIs that it's going for\nthe entire document right now.\n\n146\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:38.305\nYou see how right here, every page,\nif I added more content, the margin is\n\n147\n00:07:38.305 --> 00:07:43.820\ngonna stay the same for every single\npage because I have no sections.\n\n148\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.970\nOkay, there's the key right there.\n\n149\n00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.595\nKeep going back to that,\nwhy do I want sections?\n\n150\n00:07:48.595 --> 00:07:50.039\nIf I did have a section,\n\n151\n00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:53.949\nI could then designate different\nmargins in different places.\n\n152\n00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:57.217\nLet me come back over here,\nturn on the show and hide.\n\n153\n00:07:57.217 --> 00:08:00.315\nSo right now,\nwe have a wide margin on all of it.\n\n154\n00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:02.823\nIf I come over here to this right.\n\n155\n00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:08.011\nLet's go to through the looking glass,\nand I put my cursor in front of the T,\n\n156\n00:08:08.011 --> 00:08:11.266\nand I want to put in\na continuous section break.\n\n157\n00:08:11.266 --> 00:08:14.994\nAnd, right now,\nthat really wouldn't do anything visually.\n\n158\n00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:18.324\nBut now, looking down there,\nI'm in section two,\n\n159\n00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:22.653\nI'm in a completely different division or\nsection of my document.\n\n160\n00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:25.821\nI could come and change the margins here.\n\n161\n00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:28.489\nAnd then, notice,\nI have two different types or\n\n162\n00:08:28.489 --> 00:08:31.821\nsettings of my margins because\nI'm in different sections.\n\n163\n00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:36.686\nSo, that would be the only time that\nyour margins could be different on\n\n164\n00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:39.906\ndifferent pages if you\nthrow that section in.\n\n165\n00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:41.499\nBecause sections will allow you for\n\n166\n00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:43.684\nall sorts of different\npage layouts from there.\n\n167\n00:08:43.684 --> 00:08:46.471\nSo, good point to notice.\n\n168\n00:08:46.471 --> 00:08:48.675\nAnd then the other thing\nI wanted to show you,\n\n169\n00:08:48.675 --> 00:08:52.286\nthere was one last place that I wanted\nto show you where your margins live.\n\n170\n00:08:52.286 --> 00:08:53.295\nAnd that's in the ruler.\n\n171\n00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:57.933\nAnd I'm going to zoom in on this one, so\nyou can kind of see it a little clearer.\n\n172\n00:08:57.933 --> 00:09:01.730\nWe talked about the rulers when we were\ndoing indents and we were doing tabs.\n\n173\n00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.907\nAnd we have all these little\ntriangles up here and\n\n174\n00:09:04.907 --> 00:09:08.947\nthen the little guy at the bottom,\nand then which one to grab.\n\n175\n00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:12.360\nWell, I'm gonna go to the right side\nfirst, cuz it's easier to show.\n\n176\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.980\nWhen I'm over here, see,\nright there on the triangle pointing up,\n\n177\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.984\nthat's my right margin.\n\n178\n00:09:15.984 --> 00:09:18.171\nBut if I go a little further up,\n\n179\n00:09:18.171 --> 00:09:23.151\nyou see how my mouse cursor changes\nto two arrows going back and forth?\n\n180\n00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:26.157\nIt's because I can change\nmy margin right here,\n\n181\n00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:30.202\nI can visually change the size of\nthe margin by dragging that out.\n\n182\n00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:34.164\nAnd notice that, let me scroll out\na little bit more, well, that's this way,\n\n183\n00:09:34.164 --> 00:09:35.125\noops, wrong way.\n\n184\n00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:39.099\nThere we go, so now you can see\nthat the margin is changing,\n\n185\n00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:40.699\nthat is not the indent.\n\n186\n00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:43.630\nThe indent's here, and\nthat's for the paragraph,\n\n187\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.594\nlet me put my cursor in a paragraph.\n\n188\n00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:50.005\nSee, there's an indent,\nnot the same as a margin for\n\n189\n00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:54.919\nthe whole page, so\nyou can drag the margins from the ruler.\n\n190\n00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:58.822\nThe thing is, on the left-hand side for\nthe left margin,\n\n191\n00:09:58.822 --> 00:10:03.616\nit's a little harder to find the two\npointed arrow to get to the margin.\n\n192\n00:10:03.616 --> 00:10:08.952\nSo a lot of times what you need to do is\nyou need to grab the bottom rectangle,\n\n193\n00:10:08.952 --> 00:10:11.092\nwhich is for the left indent.\n\n194\n00:10:11.092 --> 00:10:15.756\nPull this in a little bit, then you\ncan get the visual two pointed arrow,\n\n195\n00:10:15.756 --> 00:10:16.764\nhold that out.\n\n196\n00:10:16.764 --> 00:10:21.506\nAnd then readjust this back over to hit\nflush with the margin be able to get\n\n197\n00:10:21.506 --> 00:10:23.311\nthose mouse cursor icons.\n\n198\n00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:24.064\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n199\n00:10:24.064 --> 00:10:29.019\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's kind of hidden,\nyou've got to move some things around,\n\n200\n00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:33.422\nbut at least it is a visual way of\nchanging the amount of margins.\n\n201\n00:10:33.422 --> 00:10:35.324\nSo, lots of different options for\nyour margins.\n\n202\n00:10:35.324 --> 00:10:36.327\n&gt;&gt; Options, options.\n\n203\n00:10:36.327 --> 00:10:40.039\nWhat I was going to say though, like on\nthe custom, I can make the left side,\n\n204\n00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.362\nmaybe, well, we'll call it an inch, right?\n\n205\n00:10:42.362 --> 00:10:44.102\nAnd I could make the right side two or\n\n206\n00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:46.952\nthree inches because I might\nwant to add an illustration.\n\n207\n00:10:46.952 --> 00:10:50.748\n&gt;&gt; Illustration or, that's a good point,\nlet's go there right now,\n\n208\n00:10:50.748 --> 00:10:53.047\nbecause you just pointed something out.\n\n209\n00:10:53.047 --> 00:10:54.859\nNot necessarily in the illustration part,\nbut\n\n210\n00:10:54.859 --> 00:10:56.405\nyou made me think about something else.\n\n211\n00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.237\n&gt;&gt; Another thing.\n\n212\n00:10:57.237 --> 00:11:01.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, we're going down the path\nof the gutter, so that's something,\n\n213\n00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:03.099\nbut yes, you are right.\n\n214\n00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:06.251\nYou can come into this and\nnotice it's like 1.31 and\n\n215\n00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:09.753\n.81 because that's was where\nI was visually changing it.\n\n216\n00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.373\nBut yes, I could designate it,\n\n217\n00:11:11.373 --> 00:11:14.378\ngoing back to that letterhead\nthat I started down the path.\n\n218\n00:11:14.378 --> 00:11:16.358\nWe're kind of moving around today.\n\n219\n00:11:16.358 --> 00:11:18.116\n&gt;&gt; Weaving is good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n220\n00:11:18.116 --> 00:11:24.236\nif I wanted a two inch top margin,\nmaybe a one inch bottom margin,\n\n221\n00:11:24.236 --> 00:11:28.040\na left of 1.25 and a right of 0.5.\n\n222\n00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.931\nJust to kind of really mess it up.\n\n223\n00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:34.773\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The gutter, so what is the gutter?\n\n224\n00:11:34.773 --> 00:11:38.459\nIf you are having a book\nthat's being bound,\n\n225\n00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:42.827\nlike the spiral bound,\njust spiral bound notebook.\n\n226\n00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:43.740\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n227\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.253\nYeah, you know what I'm saying.\n\n228\n00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:51.315\nThat's where you'd want to accommodate\nroom for the actual spiraling.\n\n229\n00:11:51.315 --> 00:11:52.090\n&gt;&gt; Or the binding.\n\n230\n00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.496\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly, yes, thank you,\nthe binding [LAUGH].\n\n231\n00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:57.210\nWhere it is actually going to\ndrill the holes in that space.\n\n232\n00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.530\nBut you don't want to necessarily\nuse that for your margin.\n\n233\n00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.159\nBecause then if you use that for\nthe margin,\n\n234\n00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:07.229\nthen the text is going to be off center,\nisn't it?\n\n235\n00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:11.630\nYeah, so you want the same amount\nof white space on your page, but\n\n236\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.686\nyou need to make room for\nthe actual binding.\n\n237\n00:12:14.686 --> 00:12:15.772\nThat's what a gutter is.\n\n238\n00:12:15.772 --> 00:12:16.430\n&gt;&gt; That's a gutter.\n\n239\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.064\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n240\n00:12:17.064 --> 00:12:21.053\n&gt;&gt; So it's not the same as the left\nmargin, it is for the binding, and\n\n241\n00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:25.269\nso, if I wanted to bump up, and\nyou can actually see the visuals here.\n\n242\n00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:28.701\nMaybe I need to accommodate\na one-inch gutter from the, and\n\n243\n00:12:28.701 --> 00:12:32.552\nthat's something you would probably\nwant to get from the printer.\n\n244\n00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:34.014\nWhatever specifications that they needed.\n\n245\n00:12:34.014 --> 00:12:35.380\n&gt;&gt; And they would probably tell you.\n\n246\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a lot of times, you could\nprobably just bring in the document, and\n\n247\n00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:39.395\nthey'll adjust it all for you.\n\n248\n00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:40.021\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n249\n00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:43.139\nif you're having to do it automatically,\nor manually, you can do it.\n\n250\n00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:46.798\nAnd notice that the gutter position,\nwe have left and we also have top.\n\n251\n00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:49.308\nSo maybe it's supposed to be\nthis way instead of this way, so\n\n252\n00:12:49.308 --> 00:12:50.601\nyou could change that gutter.\n\n253\n00:12:50.601 --> 00:12:55.452\nAnd that is something that you could\nonly get from the dialog box that allows\n\n254\n00:12:55.452 --> 00:12:57.539\nyou to adjust for your margins.\n\n255\n00:12:57.539 --> 00:13:01.663\nAnd notice right now, since I do have a\nsection designated to have section one and\n\n256\n00:13:01.663 --> 00:13:03.798\ntwo, cuz remember, I put in that break.\n\n257\n00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:09.279\nIt gives me those options of where do I\nwant this particular setup to be applied.\n\n258\n00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:13.654\nThis section only, this point forward,\nwhich would put it in another section, or\n\n259\n00:13:13.654 --> 00:13:14.786\nthe whole document.\n\n260\n00:13:14.786 --> 00:13:19.296\nSo make sure you understand that this\ndrop down is important when you start\n\n261\n00:13:19.296 --> 00:13:21.412\ngetting into multiple sections.\n\n262\n00:13:21.412 --> 00:13:24.177\nAnd then we'll go, yeah,\nwe'll say this section right there,\n\n263\n00:13:24.177 --> 00:13:25.797\nand that's a pretty big margin.\n\n264\n00:13:25.797 --> 00:13:29.234\nAnd so now you can see that\nin this particular section,\n\n265\n00:13:29.234 --> 00:13:33.135\nI've got more space that's\njust accommodating the gutter.\n\n266\n00:13:33.135 --> 00:13:37.536\nAnd those special margins\nthat I designated, beautiful.\n\n267\n00:13:37.536 --> 00:13:39.809\nSo let's do, it's for a quick,\n\n268\n00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:44.373\neasy way to get me kind of back to\nsquare one, we're gonna do this.\n\n269\n00:13:44.373 --> 00:13:49.377\nWe're gonna do a File, Close, which is\ncommand+W, which I love to do shortcuts.\n\n270\n00:13:49.377 --> 00:13:53.185\nI'm not gonna save the changes,\nso then it's back to square one,\n\n271\n00:13:53.185 --> 00:13:54.616\nI'm gonna re-open it.\n\n272\n00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:57.118\n&gt;&gt; You're reverting.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n273\n00:13:57.118 --> 00:14:00.707\nI do this a lot for you all, so\nI don't mess up your files and\n\n274\n00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:02.111\nyou can follow along.\n\n275\n00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:02.713\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n276\n00:14:02.713 --> 00:14:05.034\n&gt;&gt; Because we're going to get\ninto headers and footers now.\n\n277\n00:14:05.034 --> 00:14:10.304\nNow, I will tell you that I left\npage numbering for the next episode.\n\n278\n00:14:10.304 --> 00:14:15.338\nAnd I didn't call it part two, because\nit is very specific for page numbering.\n\n279\n00:14:15.338 --> 00:14:18.124\nPage numbers can be\na little wonky sometimes.\n\n280\n00:14:18.124 --> 00:14:21.907\nSo that's why I kind of wanted to give it\nits own episode and its own attention.\n\n281\n00:14:21.907 --> 00:14:23.858\nBut what is a header and footer?\n\n282\n00:14:23.858 --> 00:14:27.262\nWell, headers and\nfooters are the tops of the pages and\n\n283\n00:14:27.262 --> 00:14:30.082\nthe bottom of the pages,\nheader and footer.\n\n284\n00:14:30.082 --> 00:14:32.354\nNow I don't have any on this page,\nby the way, [LAUGH].\n\n285\n00:14:32.354 --> 00:14:33.828\n&gt;&gt; That might be too technical for me.\n\n286\n00:14:33.828 --> 00:14:35.218\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n287\n00:14:35.218 --> 00:14:37.201\nHead and foot, exactly.\n\n288\n00:14:37.201 --> 00:14:43.572\nSo and it does appear on the head and\nfoot of every page.\n\n289\n00:14:43.572 --> 00:14:47.599\nSo that's where we want to put in\nthings like maybe the file name,\n\n290\n00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:50.320\nmaybe the company name, the date, right?\n\n291\n00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.957\nThere's a lot of stuff that, and\n\n292\n00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:55.068\nyou might actually have things\nthat your company designates.\n\n293\n00:14:55.068 --> 00:14:58.855\nLike every document has to\nhave this in the footer.\n\n294\n00:14:58.855 --> 00:15:03.161\nIt has to have the company name,\nthe date, the path, the file path,\n\n295\n00:15:03.161 --> 00:15:04.960\nwhich is always important.\n\n296\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.598\nSo they know where it is in the network\ndrive and those types of things,\n\n297\n00:15:07.598 --> 00:15:08.279\nmaybe your name.\n\n298\n00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:12.998\n&gt;&gt; And then a lot of books for the header,\nthey'll have just the title of the book,\n\n299\n00:15:12.998 --> 00:15:15.896\nor the text right at the top,\nevery single page.\n\n300\n00:15:15.896 --> 00:15:16.838\n&gt;&gt; I like where you're going.\n\n301\n00:15:16.838 --> 00:15:18.728\nBecause even on that book example,\n\n302\n00:15:18.728 --> 00:15:22.265\nsometimes you might have the name\nof the book on the left hand side.\n\n303\n00:15:22.265 --> 00:15:24.465\nBut then the name of the chapter\non the right hand side.\n\n304\n00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:25.052\n&gt;&gt; That, too.\n\n305\n00:15:25.052 --> 00:15:27.701\n&gt;&gt; And then if you change to chapter\nthree, it says chapter three,\n\n306\n00:15:27.701 --> 00:15:29.772\nchange to chapter four,\nit goes to chapter four.\n\n307\n00:15:29.772 --> 00:15:34.179\nBut it repeats through chapter four,\nand then goes up to five and\n\n308\n00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:35.738\nit repeats on to five.\n\n309\n00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:38.568\nSo that's actually getting us\ninto another cool concept.\n\n310\n00:15:38.568 --> 00:15:43.763\nOf, okay, well, do I want to have the same\nheader and footer for the entire document?\n\n311\n00:15:43.763 --> 00:15:48.622\nOr do I want to have different content on\ndifferent parts of the document that I\n\n312\n00:15:48.622 --> 00:15:50.505\nwant to have unique content?\n\n313\n00:15:50.505 --> 00:15:53.259\nSo, I'm going to put you on\nthe hot spot there, Zach.\n\n314\n00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:56.400\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n&gt;&gt; If I want to have maybe a different\n\n315\n00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.092\nsetup on certain pages,\nwhat am I going to need to add?\n\n316\n00:16:01.092 --> 00:16:05.176\nGoing to have to add a different section.\n\n317\n00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:07.221\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you got it.\n\n318\n00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:08.379\n[LAUGH] You like that?\n\n319\n00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:09.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:09.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n321\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.815\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say that before you did\n\n322\n00:16:10.815 --> 00:16:11.369\nthat.\n[LAUGH]\n\n323\n00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:13.846\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was helping you out, so, yes,\n\n324\n00:16:13.846 --> 00:16:15.752\nwe need a section break.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n325\n00:16:15.752 --> 00:16:17.736\n&gt;&gt; So, you can change your page setup if\n\n326\n00:16:17.736 --> 00:16:22.199\nyou have section breaks, so, we're\ngonna do both of those types of things.\n\n327\n00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:24.074\nLet's look down at this page again,\n\n328\n00:16:24.074 --> 00:16:27.036\nwe got the page layout and\nwe'll zoom in just a little bit so\n\n329\n00:16:27.036 --> 00:16:29.320\nwe can see maybe a couple\npages altogether.\n\n330\n00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.050\nNow headers and\nfooters do reside in your margins.\n\n331\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:38.190\nSo if you have a very small top or bottom\nmargin you're only gonna be able to get so\n\n332\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.330\nmuch stuff, you're only gonna be able to\nhave the content within the header and\n\n333\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.940\nfooter be a specific size,\nyou don't want to make it too big.\n\n334\n00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.640\nAnd I will say that,\nif you start adding headers and\n\n335\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.820\nfooters with really small margins,\nsometimes, they will like automatically,\n\n336\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:17:00.490\nadjust your page setup to where\nthe text flow might be adjusted.\n\n337\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.750\nOkay, so just watch that,\n\n338\n00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.870\nif you're like, I can't have\nthe text change in any places,\n\n339\n00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.450\nbe a little careful about adding your\nheader and footer, I can show you where\n\n340\n00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.540\nyou can designate how much space that\nparticular area is going to accommodate.\n\n341\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.210\nMight as well just throw\nit in there right now,\n\n342\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:20.820\nbecause we will add it just a little while\nago and remember our format document and\n\n343\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:26.000\nin the layout, notice right here, there\nis a specific space where you can change\n\n344\n00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.110\nthe size of the header and footer area.\n\n345\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:33.350\nEven though you might have a one inch\nmargin, but the space where the header and\n\n346\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.580\nfooter goes is a half inch.\n\n347\n00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.330\nSo that's where the adjustments will\nhappen automatically if you start changing\n\n348\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.060\nto make really small,\nsmall margins, all right.\n\n349\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.660\nHeader and footers, where do we go?\n\n350\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.543\nYou go to the insert tab on your ribbon\nand over on the the insert towards that\n\n351\n00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:57.770\nside, [LAUGH] I was like, the right\nside [LAUGH] we've got the headers.\n\n352\n00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:02.140\nNow, notice that when you drop this down,\nthey do have some pre-built\n\n353\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.090\npresets that you can add in here and\nsome of them are kind of cute,\n\n354\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.780\nif I scroll down, some of them have\na little bit more of a graphical element.\n\n355\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:15.870\nAnd notice the names here,\nlike this crop and feather and feathered.\n\n356\n00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.860\nRemember, if anybody,\n\n357\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.330\nwhere this came in when we did our\ncover pages, right, just a come back.\n\n358\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.040\n&gt;&gt; Cover pages.\n\n359\n00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, remember the feathers?\n\n360\n00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:23.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n361\n00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so they match, so\nyou can see the names with the crop and\n\n362\n00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:32.485\nthe badge and the banded, so\nthey're adding in those presets for\n\n363\n00:18:32.485 --> 00:18:36.050\nthe headers and\nfooters to match your cover pages.\n\n364\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, so with the presets you can\nkeep a theme throughout the whole thing.\n\n365\n00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.808\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah and\nyou can do your themes and\n\n366\n00:18:41.808 --> 00:18:43.612\nyour colors and\nall that wonderful stuff, try it,\n\n367\n00:18:43.612 --> 00:18:47.240\nit's nice that they're making it a lot\neasier for us to just kinda click, click,\n\n368\n00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.130\nclick and make a pretty professional\nlooking document with just a few clicks.\n\n369\n00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.930\nAll right, so back over here on\nour headers, we're gonna come\n\n370\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:00.520\ninto the different ones, I'm gonna go\nwith just the basic one, for right now,\n\n371\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.960\nbecause your headers and\nfooters are designated into three columns.\n\n372\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.990\nThe reason I'm using that, which I like to\ndo a lot and they also look like bunnies,\n\n373\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.760\nis because you have tab stops in your\n\n374\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.165\nheaders that will designate\ninto three specific areas.\n\n375\n00:19:19.165 --> 00:19:24.460\nNow, notice right here it says,\ntype here, there's a tab, it stops and\n\n376\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.890\nit is centered, s ee right there,\nthere's that centered tab stop and\n\n377\n00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.600\nthen you can tab and\nthen there is a right align tab stop.\n\n378\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.710\nAnd using this one it is showing you\nthe actual designations of those spaces\n\n379\n00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.642\nto where you can go ahead and have those\ncolumns, but they're not really columns.\n\n380\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.281\n&gt;&gt; So, if you type beyond\nthe stuff you'd go underneath,\n\n381\n00:19:45.281 --> 00:19:46.711\nthe text would place underneath?\n\n382\n00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:50.592\n&gt;&gt; Yes and you can have multiple\nparagraphs, so, I mean,\n\n383\n00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:55.050\nI could go ahead and type in\nsomething like my name here and then,\n\n384\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.170\ntype in, we'll type in Zach, all right?\n\n385\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:04.262\nAnd then we'll type in Office Pro,\nsomething to that, there we go.\n\n386\n00:20:04.262 --> 00:20:05.190\nSomething like that, right?\n\n387\n00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.989\nAnd so, if I kept on typing, it's gonna go\nahead and keep where that tab stops and\n\n388\n00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:14.575\nthen move everything over to the right,\nbut if I went to here and then hit the,\n\n389\n00:20:14.575 --> 00:20:18.974\noops, Enter, notice I can have\nmultiple lines or multiple paragraphs.\n\n390\n00:20:18.974 --> 00:20:21.897\nSo, there's nothing wrong, but\nif I went ahead and went to here and\n\n391\n00:20:21.897 --> 00:20:25.204\nthen made another entry, you see how\neverything's starting to move down?\n\n392\n00:20:25.204 --> 00:20:26.100\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n393\n00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.570\n&gt;&gt; That's where you wanna be a little\ncareful of putting too much content\n\n394\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:35.020\nwithin your header and footer area,\nbecause you might not want to kinda move\n\n395\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.960\neverything down, so,\njust something to point out.\n\n396\n00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.090\nAnd then up at the top, notice that as\nsoon as we get into adding our header and\n\n397\n00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:50.900\nfooter, notice a few things, the content\narea, it gets kind of like greyed out,\n\n398\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.020\nwe'll say, kinda dimmed down\nbecause we're in this area.\n\n399\n00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.107\nHere, let me scroll out a little bit more,\nwoo, hello, that was a little too much.\n\n400\n00:21:00.107 --> 00:21:03.860\n[LAUGH] So notice that it's saying,\nhere, we're in the header and\n\n401\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.430\nfooter areas and\nI get a contextual tab on the ribbon.\n\n402\n00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.770\nSo, this will tell me that I\ncan do specific things like\n\n403\n00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.220\nchange maybe some of those presets.\n\n404\n00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.680\nGo to the footer, now,\nclicking this button, I could or\n\n405\n00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.720\nI could just click my mouse down\nin the footer area, that's fine.\n\n406\n00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.660\nAnd then closing the header and footer,\nyou could close it right there and\n\n407\n00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.000\nnotice since there are no\nsections in this document,\n\n408\n00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.130\neverything just says header, footer.\n\n409\n00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.710\nSo everything that I'm adding in\nthese areas are going to be for\n\n410\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.130\nthe entire document.\n\n411\n00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:42.090\nAnd just for visual purposes,\nI'm going to make this bigger, so, you\n\n412\n00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:47.065\nguys can see it and maybe we will make it\nred so it's a little bit more pronounced.\n\n413\n00:21:47.065 --> 00:21:49.260\nI'm going to turn these off just for now.\n\n414\n00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.520\nSo how can I get out of it, like I just\nsaid, if you can do all the close or\n\n415\n00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.850\njust double click somewhere down in\nthe text area that's dimmed down and\n\n416\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:58.890\nthen it takes you out of it.\n\n417\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:04.010\nSo it's like which area do I want to\nbring into focus using the header and\n\n418\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.850\nfooter areas or end of the document?\n\n419\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.170\nSo now if I start typing,\nI'm typing in the document, but\n\n420\n00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.460\nnow it's like I kinda\nforgot to put in a footer.\n\n421\n00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.840\nYou don't have to actually go back\nto the insert menu if you wanted to\n\n422\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.270\nadd a header and footer.\n\n423\n00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:23.500\nIf you just double click anywhere in your\nmargin area, whether it's top or bottom,\n\n424\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.260\nit gets you into the header and\nfooter contextual tab and\n\n425\n00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.066\nthe area of the documents, so,\nthat's another way of getting into it,\n\n426\n00:22:31.066 --> 00:22:35.403\nyou don't have to go to insert first,\njust go right to here.\n\n427\n00:22:35.403 --> 00:22:39.410\nAnd back on that tab, notice that I\nhave my tab stops right there, so\n\n428\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:44.400\nif I started typing, hit the tab,\nthen I'm going to the middle, hit the tab,\n\n429\n00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.370\nagain and then I go to the right, because\nthat's just how I have my headers and\n\n430\n00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:52.940\nfooters set up and so that's where\nwe can do those types of things.\n\n431\n00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.950\nAnd I'll get rid of that because\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n432\n00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:56.475\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n433\n00:22:56.475 --> 00:23:00.300\n&gt;&gt; Let's roll out a little bit, to say,\n\n434\n00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.300\nthat this is going to repeat on\nevery page, cuz that's what it does.\n\n435\n00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.488\nBut sometimes you can do a few other\nthings within your headers and\n\n436\n00:23:11.488 --> 00:23:16.920\nfooters in that tab for the header and\nfooter tab, wow, okay, [SOUND].\n\n437\n00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.847\n&gt;&gt; Opposite of redundancy now.\n\n438\n00:23:17.847 --> 00:23:19.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n439\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.440\nSo, different first page, what does\nthat mean, again, no sections, yet.\n\n440\n00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.385\nTurn it on, well then, look,\nthe first page looks different,\n\n441\n00:23:28.385 --> 00:23:31.104\ncuz a lot of times you might\nwant to have that cover page,\n\n442\n00:23:31.104 --> 00:23:35.010\nnow, putting a cover page\nautomatically makes this happen.\n\n443\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.851\nBut I don't want to have,\nmaybe, page numbers or\n\n444\n00:23:37.851 --> 00:23:41.639\nall of this stuff that's going to\nbe hanging out on the header, but\n\n445\n00:23:41.639 --> 00:23:45.562\nbe on that first one, just check that\nbox off and I can even go ahead and\n\n446\n00:23:45.562 --> 00:23:49.646\nsay something different, ooh, ooh,\nthat was spelled really wrong.\n\n447\n00:23:49.646 --> 00:23:54.093\nBut just to kind of give you an idea,\nsee notice, this is different,\n\n448\n00:23:54.093 --> 00:23:58.629\nthis will go ahead and repeat on\nthrough because I checked on that box.\n\n449\n00:23:58.629 --> 00:24:00.556\nSo that's kind of a nice thing to do.\n\n450\n00:24:00.556 --> 00:24:02.112\nShow document text.\n\n451\n00:24:02.112 --> 00:24:06.273\nI probably wanna keep that on when\nI'm using stuff cuz I think it gets\n\n452\n00:24:06.273 --> 00:24:09.640\npeople confused like my\ngosh I deleted everything.\n\n453\n00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.450\nNo it's just a show hide thing.\n\n454\n00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.940\nThat's kinda cool.\n\n455\n00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.390\nThe other thing is well maybe I\nwant to not have these headers and\n\n456\n00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.500\nfooters anymore.\n\n457\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.440\nAnd I'm gonna turn this different\nfirst page back off, so\n\n458\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.400\nthat way everything gets on there.\n\n459\n00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.390\nI wanna remove this.\n\n460\n00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.120\nIf I go to the header,\nnotice down at the bottom.\n\n461\n00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.580\nThat's where you can get rid\nof your headers and footers.\n\n462\n00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.930\nIt's kinda hiding.\n\n463\n00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.750\nI will say that i do this a lot\nin this particular example and\n\n464\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.880\nthe next episode so I also added this\nparticular button, just to let you know,\n\n465\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.850\non the quick access tool bar so\nif you see me clicking on these buttons,\n\n466\n00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:50.450\nit's just a lot easier than going to\nthis drop down to get rid of them.\n\n467\n00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.430\nSo just throwing that out there for you,\nso I'm going to remove that and once I\n\n468\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.853\nclose this, meaning I just double clicked,\nI can get rid off my headers and footers.\n\n469\n00:24:58.853 --> 00:25:03.846\nNow there's another little check\nbox on that ribbon that I wanted\n\n470\n00:25:03.846 --> 00:25:06.125\nto show you with the even odd.\n\n471\n00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:07.690\nTalking about the book, right?\n\n472\n00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.341\nWhere I wanted the name of\nthe book on one side, and\n\n473\n00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:12.249\nthen the chapter name on the other.\n\n474\n00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.990\nLeft, right or even, odd, and\nlet's go ahead and do that first.\n\n475\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:25.823\nI'm gonna insert the header, and I'm gonna\nuse this particular one, it's kinda cute.\n\n476\n00:25:25.823 --> 00:25:27.687\nRight now, when I chose this,\n\n477\n00:25:27.687 --> 00:25:31.360\nnotice it's adding it to\nthe left-hand side of every page.\n\n478\n00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.930\nBut I don't want that, because I want\nthe left page to have it on that side,\n\n479\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.492\nand the right page to\nhave it on that side.\n\n480\n00:25:38.492 --> 00:25:41.778\nAll you have to do is check this box off.\n\n481\n00:25:41.778 --> 00:25:46.772\nIf you turn this on, watch this one\nover here, it will [LAUGH] I forgot,\n\n482\n00:25:46.772 --> 00:25:49.406\nit almost did it, but that's okay.\n\n483\n00:25:49.406 --> 00:25:53.320\nBut notice that I have designated\nan odd page and an even page.\n\n484\n00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.870\nKind of like that different first page so\n\n485\n00:25:55.870 --> 00:26:00.210\nI have that particular\nheader on the odd pages.\n\n486\n00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:05.200\nSo if I click over here,\nto give the focus on the even,\n\n487\n00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.250\ncome back over to this and then go to\nthere, which is weird because it says\n\n488\n00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.790\nodd but then it, just click it and\njust look at the visuals okay?\n\n489\n00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:18.210\nSo now I have pages one, two,\nthree and four on opposite\n\n490\n00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.960\nsides which is pretty neat and\nI could even add some content.\n\n491\n00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.960\nIf I hit the tab, cuz remember we have tab\nstops, I can say book goes here, right,\n\n492\n00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.260\nand then notice book is gonna\nbe on the left hand side.\n\n493\n00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.880\nSorry I know that's pretty small so\n\n494\n00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.710\nlet's just go ahead and\nbump that up a little bit.\n\n495\n00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:40.760\nAnd then I could put this onto the chapter\nand lets make that a little bit bigger.\n\n496\n00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.700\nWhoops.\nOkay that's fine.\n\n497\n00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.360\nPerfect.\n\n498\n00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.260\n&gt;&gt; Chapter goes here.\n\n499\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.682\n&gt;&gt; The chapter goes here, exactly.\n\n500\n00:26:45.682 --> 00:26:52.354\nSo now I've got even, odd, and different\nstuff going all the way through it.\n\n501\n00:26:52.354 --> 00:26:57.080\nNow, let's go ahead and just touch on\nthat section, cuz you've seen me doing\n\n502\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.140\nthis in the margins, so your headers and\nfooters are going to be the same way.\n\n503\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.230\nThis is again where we get\ninto the page numbers.\n\n504\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.950\nIt is coming up in the next episode.\n\n505\n00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.260\nI am going to remove the header here.\n\n506\n00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.560\nI just clicked that little\nbutton up at the top.\n\n507\n00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.060\nNotice it only did it\non one side because I\n\n508\n00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.120\nhave those different options\nwith the head the even and odd.\n\n509\n00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.475\nSo make sure that if it like\ndidn't get rid of all of it,\n\n510\n00:27:20.475 --> 00:27:24.640\nit's because you have those different\ncheck boxes in the headers and footers.\n\n511\n00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.840\nSo if I have Alice in Wonderland Through\nthe Looking Glass, let's go here.\n\n512\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.280\nI want to have something\ndifferent from here down.\n\n513\n00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.650\nGotta add that section break.\n\n514\n00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:40.460\nSo let's go to the layout, let's go with\na continuous section break for right now.\n\n515\n00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:47.820\nAnd now if I insert my header,\nlet's just go with this one for now.\n\n516\n00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.290\nAgain, why is it only on one side?\n\n517\n00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:53.960\nGot that check box, but\nit's nice though I can just uncheck it and\n\n518\n00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.250\nthen put that back in and\nit goes across all of them.\n\n519\n00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.620\nBut notice that I have some\ndifferent sections now going on.\n\n520\n00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:08.210\nI've got section one here and then all\nthe way down here I have section two.\n\n521\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:15.810\nBig thing to notice is this right here,\nsee where says same as previous and\n\n522\n00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.890\nalso in the tab I had\nthis link to previous,\n\n523\n00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:25.400\ncuz right now if I want to,\nwhoops sorry, if I went to section one.\n\n524\n00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.180\nAnd let's just go ahead and\njust say will go with put Vonne in there,\n\n525\n00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.075\nall right if I can spell my name right,\nthere we go.\n\n526\n00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:38.190\nAnd when we'll make it a little bit bigger\njust for fun, there, going all the way\n\n527\n00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.710\nthrough but you said that the section\ntwo that's how we can do it differently?\n\n528\n00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.650\nRight now still remembering and\nlinking to the previous headers so\n\n529\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:52.040\nit's gonna continue on so that I can,\nnow this is where you can have even,\n\n530\n00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.120\nodd and sections and\ndo all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n531\n00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.180\nIf I want this section two to be\ndifferent than section one I have to\n\n532\n00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.420\ntell it to not connect to itself.\n\n533\n00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:06.040\nSo clicking my cursor into this\nparticular header of Section two,\n\n534\n00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.930\nI turn off the link and\nnow if I change this.\n\n535\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:10.500\nWhoops, sorry.\n\n536\n00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.938\n[LAUGH] If I go ahead and\nchange this to Zack and\n\n537\n00:29:14.938 --> 00:29:19.800\nVonne, notice that here just me, and\n\n538\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.260\nthen in section two I pick you up and\nwe move on through.\n\n539\n00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.430\nSo that's how you can\ndesignate repeating headers or\n\n540\n00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.462\nfooters for multiple pages in sections.\n\n541\n00:29:31.462 --> 00:29:33.730\nYou gotta make sure you\nturn off that link.\n\n542\n00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:37.125\nIf you don't you change it here it's\ngonna change it back in the other one.\n\n543\n00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:40.750\nSo you gotta disconnect it and\nthat's how we can start going ahead and\n\n544\n00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:44.660\nmaking different contents on our\nheaders first with sections.\n\n545\n00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:49.450\nVery good stuff, a lot of fun stuff, it's\none of those things that I think trips\n\n546\n00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:56.050\npeople up a lot, but if you just check\nthat box off, understand sections,\n\n547\n00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.490\nand those different check boxes on\nthe tabs, it will get a lot easier.\n\n548\n00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.110\nI fight with this sometimes and\n\n549\n00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.980\nI really fight with page\nnumbers in the next episode.\n\n550\n00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.990\nSo if it's kind of a little\nfrustrating I understand,\n\n551\n00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.730\njust stop, breathe, think it through.\n\n552\n00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:12.820\nThis is where my where sections are,\n\n553\n00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.720\nthese are the check boxes and\nyou'll get there too.\n\n554\n00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.240\n&gt;&gt; Margins, headers and footers.\n\n555\n00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.740\nAnd what's great about this episode, and\nall the episodes, is you can rewatch them.\n\n556\n00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:26.950\nIn fact, we encourage you to see every\nsingle episode of Word 2016 Essentials for\n\n557\n00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.610\nMac, also everything\nin the

OfficePro.TV,\nhelping you learn whenever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:15.193 --> 00:00:20.331\nI am your host, Zach Memos, as we\ncontinue on with Word 2016 essentials for\n\n5\n00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:23.107\nMac, this is adding format page numbers.\n\n6\n00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:26.761\nAnd Vonne Smith, once again,\nour expert on everything Office Pro,\n\n7\n00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:27.961\nis here to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.031\nVonne, great to have you here, thanks.\n\n9\n00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:29.918\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.\n\n10\n00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:34.847\nYes, we talked about in our last\nepisode that we wanted to break up\n\n11\n00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:37.011\npage numbers all by itself.\n\n12\n00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:41.227\nCuz they can be slippery\nlittle devils over there.\n\n13\n00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:45.324\nSo, [LAUGH] they can get you\na little twisted sometimes of like,\n\n14\n00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:47.503\nwhat is that use chapters thing?\n\n15\n00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:53.413\nAnd that's not working at all, well, I am\ngoing to explain how that actually works,\n\n16\n00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:56.138\nbecause it's tied to something else.\n\n17\n00:00:56.138 --> 00:00:58.938\nYou're like, wow, you are being so\ndescriptive right now, [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:58.938 --> 00:01:00.958\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm being a little vague, but\n\n19\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.816\njust to kind of set the scene for us.\n\n20\n00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:06.192\n&gt;&gt; And I actually just had a real quick\nquestion, you could do it manually, right?\n\n21\n00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:08.023\nYou could put your page\nnumbers in manually, but\n\n22\n00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:10.488\nwhat you're going to show us is\nthe easier, softer way, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.488 --> 00:01:14.647\n&gt;&gt; Well, you could, but, of course,\njust like writing any great manuscript,\n\n24\n00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:16.927\nyou need to add some things here and\nthere.\n\n25\n00:01:16.927 --> 00:01:22.383\nAnd if you go ahead and add four pages,\nor four paragraphs in the middle,\n\n26\n00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:27.300\nwell, then everything is not\nin the actual numbers anymore.\n\n27\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.746\nWhat you manually said is, this is page\nthree is actually really page four.\n\n28\n00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:37.422\nSo, you really want to have it\nautomatically number the pages.\n\n29\n00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:42.282\nAnd that's why we have the insert page\nnumbers in the headers and footers.\n\n30\n00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:44.531\n&gt;&gt; And that's the slippery\nslope you were talking about.\n\n31\n00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:48.825\n&gt;&gt; Kind of [LAUGH],\nit gets more into the sessions, but yes,\n\n32\n00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:54.109\nyou definitely don't want to physically\ntype in page one on page one.\n\n33\n00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.560\nBecause a lot of times, you're gonna\nbe shifting everything around.\n\n34\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.101\nAnd that's the beauty of using the things\nin the headers and footers is like,\n\n35\n00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:01.581\nyou could have 15 more pages.\n\n36\n00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:04.683\nAnd it's just gonna go ahead and\nkeep on adding the headers and\n\n37\n00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:07.737\nfooters that would have your\npage numbers in it right there.\n\n38\n00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:11.954\nSo that's where you want to\nkeep it fluid in that way,\n\n39\n00:02:11.954 --> 00:02:15.720\nis to go ahead and\nuse this particular command.\n\n40\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.713\nLike I said, the weird part is when\nyou get into the sections and try and\n\n41\n00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:23.172\nuse chapters, so\nthat's where it gets a little funny.\n\n42\n00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:26.085\nAnd the thing we talked\nabout in the other episode,\n\n43\n00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:30.857\nwhere we had that different first page,\nthat throws people off with page numbers.\n\n44\n00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:37.080\nSo I'm gonna show you that one too, so\nwhy don't we go ahead and get ready to go?\n\n45\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.003\nI've got some files, and I closed out\nthe page layout from the last episode,\n\n46\n00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.825\njust to kinda give us\na nice starting point.\n\n47\n00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:46.762\nSo why don't we go there?\n\n48\n00:02:46.762 --> 00:02:50.496\nSo we have one, two, three,\nfour, five looks like, yes,\n\n49\n00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:52.783\nwe have five pages in this document.\n\n50\n00:02:52.783 --> 00:02:56.682\nNope, not gonna type it manually,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:56.682 --> 00:03:00.277\nuse that automatic page\nnumbering from the footers.\n\n52\n00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:02.945\nLet's go over here to Insert,\nand from Insert,\n\n53\n00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05.884\nwe're concentrating a lot\non the headers this time.\n\n54\n00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:08.040\nAnd you can put page\nnumbers in the headers,\n\n55\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.724\nit doesn't matter really like you have\nto put page numbers in the footers.\n\n56\n00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.496\nOn any content that I was adding\nthe header, I could have added the footer,\n\n57\n00:03:14.496 --> 00:03:16.621\nit's really just, do one on the top,\none on the bottom.\n\n58\n00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:21.179\nTotally up to you, but\nI tend to put page numbers in the bottom,\n\n59\n00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.680\nbecause it's just where they go.\n\n60\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.096\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let's go with Footers,\n\n61\n00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:29.362\nnow notice there is Page Number over here,\nokay, and\n\n62\n00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:31.627\nwhy don't we jump over there first?\n\n63\n00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:37.413\nSorry, let me go there, notice I have\nPage Number, let's just put it right in.\n\n64\n00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:40.490\nIt's going to ask you, well,\nwhere do you want me to put this?\n\n65\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.233\nDo you want me to put it in the bottom or\nthe top?\n\n66\n00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:45.796\nIn other words, header and footer, that's\nreally the only two places I can put them.\n\n67\n00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:48.193\nSo, if you wanted to go this way,\n\n68\n00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:52.488\nit will put in the page numbers\nin either of these two spots.\n\n69\n00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:55.645\nWhether you want it left,\nright, or center, or\n\n70\n00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:59.498\ninside, or outside,\nthat would be like the margin areas.\n\n71\n00:03:59.498 --> 00:04:04.210\nIt's the same thing as if you had gone\ninto here into the header and said,\n\n72\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.777\nI want to go ahead and\nadd this particular page number.\n\n73\n00:04:07.777 --> 00:04:12.828\nThese are just in whatever format or\ntheme that we were talking about.\n\n74\n00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:15.583\nWhere it connected to a cover page,\nor something of that effect.\n\n75\n00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:18.029\nSo, people are like, well,\nwhat's the difference?\n\n76\n00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:24.416\nThis just has a specific set\nof formatting attached to it.\n\n77\n00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:27.418\nThere's one more level\nwith this formatting,\n\n78\n00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:32.687\nbecause notice on this Page Number, notice\nit has Format Page Number, dot, dot.\n\n79\n00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:36.217\nAnd then it brings you into, well,\nhow do I want the numbering to happen?\n\n80\n00:04:36.217 --> 00:04:38.474\nBecause yes, one, two,\nthree, that's totally fine.\n\n81\n00:04:38.474 --> 00:04:42.921\nBut another way you could do it would be\nroman numerals, you could also do letters.\n\n82\n00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:43.443\n&gt;&gt; Letters.\n\n83\n00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:43.993\n&gt;&gt; ABC.\n\n84\n00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:44.714\n&gt;&gt; Letters, yeah.\n\n85\n00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:46.328\n&gt;&gt; That's a sequential order.\n\n86\n00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:50.656\nSo depending on what format\nyou have here is going to\n\n87\n00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:55.590\ndetermine how it gets actually\ninserted into the header,\n\n88\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.627\nor footer, or\nwherever you designate it to go.\n\n89\n00:04:59.627 --> 00:05:02.907\nNow, do you have to do this\nfirst before you insert it?\n\n90\n00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:06.895\nNo, you can either go this way or\nyou can go that way.\n\n91\n00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:11.926\nPut the page numbers in and then format or\nformat and then put the page numbers in.\n\n92\n00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:17.366\nBut it's this thing, the chapter numbers,\nand this whole start at and continue\n\n93\n00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:22.493\nthat I think gets people a little,\nthat's where it gets a little slippery.\n\n94\n00:05:22.493 --> 00:05:24.826\nThey might have one part here, but\n\n95\n00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:29.260\nthey didn't do the other part that\nmakes this all work together.\n\n96\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.233\nAgain, pretty vague, but I'll demonstrate.\n\n97\n00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:34.644\nI'm going to cancel that for right now.\n\n98\n00:05:34.644 --> 00:05:38.473\nLet's go with, I'm just going to go this\nway, I'm going to go into the built-in.\n\n99\n00:05:38.473 --> 00:05:42.340\nI'm going to use this one down at\nthe bottom, which is in the bandit,\n\n100\n00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.220\nit's just a single page number.\n\n101\n00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.016\nI don't have pg period,\nI just want this particular one.\n\n102\n00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:52.834\nNotice there is one, I believe, down here.\n\n103\n00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:56.775\nIt's kind of hard to see, and\nit's all right if you can't read it, but\n\n104\n00:05:56.775 --> 00:05:58.428\nit's saying page one of one.\n\n105\n00:05:58.428 --> 00:06:03.149\nSo, if you want to have, it's page\ntwo of six, this is something that I\n\n106\n00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:07.818\nnormally do if I'm sending it to somebody,\nor especially faxing it.\n\n107\n00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:11.665\nCuz then it's like, I don't know how\nmany pages I'm supposed to have,\n\n108\n00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:14.962\nespecially if you don't have\na fax cover that tells you that.\n\n109\n00:06:14.962 --> 00:06:22.336\nSo I tend to like this particular\nsetup of the x of y type formatting.\n\n110\n00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:26.836\nBut for this particular example, let's\njust go ahead and use this one, click it,\n\n111\n00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:29.549\nI know it's really small,\nI will make it bigger.\n\n112\n00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:31.482\nI do not have any sections here, so\n\n113\n00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:34.890\nall of the page numbers are gonna\ngo across every single one.\n\n114\n00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.617\nI will select this, oops, that's\nthe wrong button, whew, sorry, [LAUGH],\n\n115\n00:06:38.617 --> 00:06:40.038\ngetting a little crazy here.\n\n116\n00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:45.344\nThere, and I'll make it, let's make it\na little bit bigger so we can see that.\n\n117\n00:06:45.344 --> 00:06:48.925\nNow go into the document, I'll close\nout the headers and footers I have.\n\n118\n00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:52.456\nPages one, two, three, four, and five,\n\n119\n00:06:52.456 --> 00:06:56.376\nI've got the page numbers designated,\ngreat.\n\n120\n00:06:56.376 --> 00:07:00.915\nIf I don't like that particular\nformatting, if I go into the Insert and\n\n121\n00:07:00.915 --> 00:07:04.106\ngo to Page Number, and\nthen Format Page Numbers.\n\n122\n00:07:04.106 --> 00:07:08.403\nNotice I could change this to A,\nB, and, C, and it changes to A, B,\n\n123\n00:07:08.403 --> 00:07:10.568\nand C, just like we talked about.\n\n124\n00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:17.256\nPut them in first, format afterwards,\nand that is all well and good.\n\n125\n00:07:17.256 --> 00:07:20.417\nLet's go back to the other one,\nI'm gonna just undo,\n\n126\n00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:24.286\nall I did was command Z to get us\nback into one, two, three, four.\n\n127\n00:07:24.286 --> 00:07:27.404\nPretty simple if that's all I need to do.\n\n128\n00:07:27.404 --> 00:07:30.632\nIt's when you want to do\nthe multiple numberings, and\n\n129\n00:07:30.632 --> 00:07:34.155\nI don't want it to be on the first page,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n130\n00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:37.898\nLet's get into that, I'm gonna\ndouble click into my footer area.\n\n131\n00:07:37.898 --> 00:07:40.762\nI'm trying, there we go, so\nI can get into the header.\n\n132\n00:07:40.762 --> 00:07:47.478\nThis is the footer, sorry, [LAUGH],\nand here, different first page, great.\n\n133\n00:07:47.478 --> 00:07:51.468\nI don't want page one to be here,\ncuz this is like my cover page, for\n\n134\n00:07:51.468 --> 00:07:54.978\na lack of a better term,\neven though it's not a cover page.\n\n135\n00:07:54.978 --> 00:08:01.088\nI turn this on, and people are like,\ngreat, I don't have that page number,\n\n136\n00:08:01.088 --> 00:08:04.760\nbut This is page two,\nno but that's page one.\n\n137\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.480\nNot really, okay, because that\nreally is page two, isn't it Zach?\n\n138\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.670\n&gt;&gt; I would think so, yeah!\n\n139\n00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\nYeah.\n\n140\n00:08:12.264 --> 00:08:16.590\nIn the document it's like that is the\nsecond page, so I'm going to number it.\n\n141\n00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:21.620\nYes, I know you told me that to not\nhave like a different first page, but\n\n142\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.610\nit's not gonna change the numbering.\n\n143\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.800\nThis throws people off, because\nthey want to have this be page one,\n\n144\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.420\nand I understand that.\n\n145\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.975\nAnd I know people that it just like, it\nreally, really messes them up that I want\n\n146\n00:08:32.975 --> 00:08:35.701\nthis to be changed, and\nthen you go back and try to change it.\n\n147\n00:08:35.701 --> 00:08:41.720\nSo you could go ahead and try this,\nyou can come into your page number.\n\n148\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.668\nYou can format your page number and\nyou can say go ahead and start at 1, and\n\n149\n00:08:45.668 --> 00:08:47.017\nit still doesn't do it.\n\n150\n00:08:47.017 --> 00:08:51.749\nAnd you're like, but it says start at 1,\nand I put my cursor in there and\n\n151\n00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:53.430\nall of that.\n\n152\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:59.620\nNo, if I want this to be different and\nreally have it start\n\n153\n00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:05.680\nat 1 like I want it to,\nZach what do you think I might need to do?\n\n154\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.280\n&gt;&gt; You might have to make that\nsecond page your first page.\n\n155\n00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.490\n&gt;&gt; How?\n\n156\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.247\n&gt;&gt; You would have to designate it as\nthe first page, have to section it.\n\n157\n00:09:13.247 --> 00:09:15.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; This is all about sections.\n\n158\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.390\n&gt;&gt; All, yes, see,\ncoming around full circle.\n\n159\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.060\nRemember when I told you a couple\nepisodes ago, sections are so important.\n\n160\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.900\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n161\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.730\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this is where it comes in.\n\n162\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.550\nYou got to put in a section, okay.\n\n163\n00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.124\nThat's the only way that you\ncan make this page, page 1.\n\n164\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:36.060\nSo you do have to be,\nyou have to have your document set,\n\n165\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.190\nand like you're not gonna\nmess with it anymore.\n\n166\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.360\nI know sometimes like, well I don't\nknow if that will ever happen.\n\n167\n00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.730\nJust keep that in mind,\nthat if you start moving content around or\n\n168\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.400\nyou add more content and your section\nstarts to move it could affect this.\n\n169\n00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.290\nThat's why I was trying to say\ndo this last, I know it's hard,\n\n170\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.020\nit's very hard right.\n\n171\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.656\nBecause you wanna,\nI wanna put the page numbers in.\n\n172\n00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:01.952\nIt that what you're gonna,\nZack's over here is going like this.\n\n173\n00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:02.975\n&gt;&gt; I'm really going hey I got a question.\n\n174\n00:10:02.975 --> 00:10:04.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n175\n00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.560\n&gt;&gt; So this is something we should do,\na last steps I would think right?\n\n176\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.030\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n177\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.390\n&gt;&gt; And it's hard, just like anything,\nget it all in there and\n\n178\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.350\nthen format afterwards.\n\n179\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.179\nThis would be one,\ncuz what I'm gonna have to do to say that\n\n180\n00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:23.724\nthis is page one,\nwe're gonna have to come into here.\n\n181\n00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:28.242\nAnd on this particular paragraph we're\ngonna have to designate a section break,\n\n182\n00:10:28.242 --> 00:10:30.936\na continuous section break,\nso think about it.\n\n183\n00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:34.925\nAnd the other thing is you probably\ndon't want to do it like in\n\n184\n00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:39.398\nthe middle of a paragraph,\nthat's where the flow of your content.\n\n185\n00:10:39.398 --> 00:10:41.860\nYou really need to be aware of it to say,\n\n186\n00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.413\nI don't really want a paragraph to be\nbroken across actual page one, and\n\n187\n00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:52.400\nactual page two because that's probably\nnot the best place to put a section break.\n\n188\n00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.490\nSo the way I have my document set up\nis like the paragraph ends here, and\n\n189\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.660\nthen a new paragraph starts here.\n\n190\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.030\nThat's gonna be ideal\non how this is setup,\n\n191\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.375\nso keep that in mind when you're doing\nthis little trick that I'm gonna show you.\n\n192\n00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:09.420\nCuz right here, this is where I\nwant to designate the new start,\n\n193\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.280\nor the start of my new section.\n\n194\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.000\nWe go to layout, we go to breaks,\nwe go to continuous section break, and\n\n195\n00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.500\nnotice right there I've got a section two.\n\n196\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.442\nThis is where if I come\nback into the page numbers,\n\n197\n00:11:23.442 --> 00:11:26.679\nand I took the page numbers\nout okay that's fine.\n\n198\n00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:32.335\nWe'll go with insert the page number,\nand we'll just go with the center.\n\n199\n00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:35.562\nGoing a different way rather\nthan going through the presets.\n\n200\n00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:38.234\nAnd I will go ahead and make that bigger.\n\n201\n00:11:38.234 --> 00:11:40.776\nIt already did it, just to let you know.\n\n202\n00:11:40.776 --> 00:11:46.410\nYou're like well that's magical, that's\nall I had to because look it says page 1.\n\n203\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.370\nPage 1, it's carrying over from\nthe thing that I did before.\n\n204\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.390\nRemember when I came over\nfrom this particular page and\n\n205\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:12:00.080\nI said in the page number to format and\nstart at 1.\n\n206\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.200\nRemember this was blank before right,\nbut I put 1 in so it magically did it.\n\n207\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:12.640\nSo if I said different first page,\nnotice that one starts here, all right?\n\n208\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.860\nSo just in case you're like mine\ndidn't go ahead and change,\n\n209\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.190\nyou would have to come back and go here,\n\n210\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.670\nand tell the format page numbers to\nstart 1 in this particular section.\n\n211\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.850\nAll right so if you're following along,\n\n212\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.470\nlike mine's still saying two,\nthis is what you need to come do.\n\n213\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.705\nCursor, format, page numbers,\nstart at 1, and\n\n214\n00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:35.880\nthat's where I can take\nthis particular one out.\n\n215\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.564\nDon't have any page numbers\non the different first page,\n\n216\n00:12:39.564 --> 00:12:41.228\nand this starts page one.\n\n217\n00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.777\nSo you do see there was quite in\na few different pieces that I just\n\n218\n00:12:43.777 --> 00:12:44.750\ndid there, didn't I?\n\n219\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.890\n&gt;&gt; It was quite a few, yeah.\n\n220\n00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThere was a section,\n\n221\n00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.970\nthere was the different\nfirst page check box, and\n\n222\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.320\nthen making sure that I had\nthe cursor in section two, and\n\n223\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.230\nformatting the page numbers to start at 1.\n\n224\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.126\nThat's the thing that if people get\nlike maybe two out of the three, or\n\n225\n00:13:04.126 --> 00:13:05.590\nhowever many I just said.\n\n226\n00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.278\nThey only get a couple of them,\nand not get the whole\n\n227\n00:13:10.278 --> 00:13:15.320\npackage to make it work,\nto where this is page one.\n\n228\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.830\n&gt;&gt; And I was thinking too, your leader\npage which we know we're not numbering,\n\n229\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.360\nthat also would be for instance,\nwhere you put the prologue.\n\n230\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.324\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You wouldn't be numbering.\n\n231\n00:13:23.324 --> 00:13:24.822\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, yeah exactly.\n\n232\n00:13:24.822 --> 00:13:30.052\nI mean that's a great world example\nof how I would want to do this, but\n\n233\n00:13:30.052 --> 00:13:36.203\nI get this so many times from people, of\ncan't get page two to really be page one.\n\n234\n00:13:36.203 --> 00:13:37.078\nAll right so now you know.\n\n235\n00:13:37.078 --> 00:13:37.842\n&gt;&gt; Yes you can.\n\n236\n00:13:37.842 --> 00:13:39.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yvonne showed you how.\n\n237\n00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.071\n&gt;&gt; You can definitely.\n\n238\n00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:44.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so let's continue on that same idea\n\n239\n00:13:44.177 --> 00:13:48.977\nof you gotta have all the pieces in\nplace to make this number correctly,\n\n240\n00:13:48.977 --> 00:13:52.030\nat least correctly in how\nyou want it to do it.\n\n241\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.180\nThere's something in this check box,\nin the format page number about this\n\n242\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:02.020\ninclude chapter number,\nlet me give you an example.\n\n243\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.390\nI'm going to,\nI don't know if I need this one again so\n\n244\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.060\nlet me just minimize that for right now.\n\n245\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.490\nI have an example, section and\npage numbers example.\n\n246\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.229\nAnd let's zoom out, oops the other way.\n\n247\n00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:17.922\nLet's zoom out a little bit more,\nI'm just going to go to here.\n\n248\n00:14:17.922 --> 00:14:18.947\n&gt;&gt; Zoom it.\n\n249\n00:14:18.947 --> 00:14:25.130\nYeah, let me actually, there,\ncome on, come on, okay now I'm ready.\n\n250\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:31.590\nSo this is something that I've seen\nin books and how they number pages.\n\n251\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:37.228\nSo it says down the rabbit hole, and\nthen I have page 1 of 1, 1 of 2.\n\n252\n00:14:37.228 --> 00:14:41.570\nGo down here, 1 of 3, 1 of 4.\n\n253\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:49.330\nScroll on down, Chapter 2,\n2 of 1, 2 1, 2 2.\n\n254\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.630\n3 1, 3 2, and I think it stops there.\n\n255\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:59.207\nSo you can see that it's starting page\none at every change in chapter correct?\n\n256\n00:14:59.207 --> 00:15:02.488\nAnd the book that I lay out,\nthe anatomy and physiology textbook,\n\n257\n00:15:02.488 --> 00:15:04.663\nthis is how we do a lot\nof our page numbering.\n\n258\n00:15:04.663 --> 00:15:09.563\nOkay it is this particular chapter,\nor topic of the book,\n\n259\n00:15:09.563 --> 00:15:14.463\nand there might be other ones,\nwe might have 3 1, 4 1,\n\n260\n00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:17.364\n5 1, so on and so forth, right.\n\n261\n00:15:17.364 --> 00:15:19.503\nSo a lot of people want to do this, and\n\n262\n00:15:19.503 --> 00:15:24.096\nthey think you just check on that chapter\nbox and everything's working fine.\n\n263\n00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:25.693\n&gt;&gt; Not that simple.\n\n264\n00:15:25.693 --> 00:15:28.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You gotta have\nall the pieces right.\n\n265\n00:15:28.543 --> 00:15:33.401\nSo I'm gonna show you how this connects,\nyou have to, yes have that checkbox,\n\n266\n00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:38.060\nand the format page numbers,\nyou do have to have it starting at one.\n\n267\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.905\nSo in that dialogue box, but\nthe big kicker is not just sections\n\n268\n00:15:42.905 --> 00:15:48.010\ncuz that's another one,\nit's how you format your heading.\n\n269\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.838\nAnd you have to format it\nwith an outlined list style.\n\n270\n00:15:52.838 --> 00:15:56.487\nLet me show you.\n\n271\n00:15:56.487 --> 00:15:58.418\nAll right, here we go, you ready, Zach?\n\n272\n00:15:58.418 --> 00:15:59.069\n&gt;&gt; I am ready.\n\n273\n00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:04.722\n&gt;&gt; All right, so [LAUGH] and I have these\nsteps that I'm doing in the show notes.\n\n274\n00:16:04.722 --> 00:16:07.314\nSo, I do have them like labeled out.\n\n275\n00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:08.946\nIt can go a couple ways.\n\n276\n00:16:08.946 --> 00:16:10.190\nYou can do this one.\n\n277\n00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.230\nIt doesn't have to be like, you have\nto do step one, two, three, four, five.\n\n278\n00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.070\nYou could do step three then one then two.\n\n279\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.000\nI don't know, in my brain logically\nthis is how it makes sense to me.\n\n280\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.110\nLet's first of all come into here.\n\n281\n00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.640\nLet's zoom in just a little bit.\n\n282\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.280\nAnd I'm going to change the font size and\nthe color of my heading one.\n\n283\n00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.170\nRemember styles, there's a reason\nwhy all of this connects together.\n\n284\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.270\nSo, I'm using designated heading one.\n\n285\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:43.020\nI am changing the format,\njust so we can see it visually.\n\n286\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.580\nI'm gonna update to match the selection.\n\n287\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.590\nI'm doing that local override first, and\n\n288\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:52.530\nthen saying use that formatting to then\nredefine this particular heading style.\n\n289\n00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:58.840\nSo, we could see that every heading one is\nwhere I want to designate my new chapter.\n\n290\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.760\nAll right, perfect.\n\n291\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.790\nThe other thing that you're gonna need\nto do, is you're gonna need to have your\n\n292\n00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:12.120\nheading ones also be attached\nto an outlined list format.\n\n293\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.620\nDoing another override,\nthen redefine the style.\n\n294\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:21.640\nUp here, in the multi level list,\ncuz we're doing an outline, per say.\n\n295\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.660\nNotice down here at the bottom you can see\nthat there is one that says Chapter 1,\n\n296\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.170\nand then Heading.\n\n297\n00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.650\nNotice it has, you can't really\nsee it in the little icon,\n\n298\n00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:38.360\nbut you're connecting\nchapters to your heading one.\n\n299\n00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.330\nSo, every time you have a new change,\nor a new heading one.\n\n300\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.800\nIt's gonna automatically\nnumber the chapters.\n\n301\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.660\nSo, I'm going to choose this,\ngonna scroll out, so you can see.\n\n302\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.770\nNotice, it's not really\nconnected to the text.\n\n303\n00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.890\nIt's like bullets and numbering,\nbut if you go ahead and\n\n304\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.260\nformat your paragraph with numbering\nit does one, two, three, four, five.\n\n305\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.810\nYou change the paragraphs and\nit changes the sequence of the numbers.\n\n306\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.783\nSame thing happens here when you\nattach that the specific outlined\n\n307\n00:18:07.783 --> 00:18:11.887\nlist style to your heading one,\nwhich is also a style.\n\n308\n00:18:11.887 --> 00:18:13.670\nAnd then you gotta connect\nthem all together.\n\n309\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.710\n&gt;&gt; I get the jest of your jig.\n\n310\n00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.832\n&gt;&gt; Good, [LAUGH],\nbecause it is a little confusing I feel.\n\n311\n00:18:20.832 --> 00:18:24.380\nSo, [COUGH], now I want to make sure this\n\n312\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.790\nheading one style definition has\nthis particular outline list level.\n\n313\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.820\nDon't let this throw you off.\n\n314\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.340\nDo you see up here where it says,\nwell, it says it's a number list.\n\n315\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.000\nYeah.\n\n316\n00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.120\nBut you've got to get to the formatting\nthrough this button, the multilevel list.\n\n317\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.812\nBecause it is still numbering, I'm gonna\nstop, because I feel like [LAUGH] circle.\n\n318\n00:18:44.812 --> 00:18:47.255\nI need redefine the style, okay?, so\n\n319\n00:18:47.255 --> 00:18:52.077\nwant heading one now be associated with\nthat list update Matt's selection.\n\n320\n00:18:52.077 --> 00:18:56.640\nLet me click off this,\nscroll out a little bit, scroll down.\n\n321\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.900\nNotice, heading one, chapter two.\n\n322\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.930\nHeading one, chapter three.\n\n323\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.820\nSo, if I made another one,\nnot that I need this,\n\n324\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.670\nbut did you see how it says, to four.\n\n325\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.460\nIf I go, so\nany time you apply a heading one,\n\n326\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:16.380\nit's gonna automatically start numbering\nwith the chapter associated with it.\n\n327\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.700\nOkay, so we got a couple parts, right?\n\n328\n00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.250\nGot our heading one formatted\nwith our multi list.\n\n329\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.260\nNow, I want to put in sections.\n\n330\n00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.130\nRemember, this chapter two is connected\nto it, so don't I gotta force my\n\n331\n00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.000\ncursor to get in front of chapter two,\nit doesn't work, just put it here.\n\n332\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.860\nIt's all connected,\nI need to add sections, and\n\n333\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:45.790\nsince this is page numbering, I highly,\nhighly suggest you want to do a new page,\n\n334\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:51.731\nor next page section break,\nbecause you cannot have this be page 1-4,\n\n335\n00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:58.800\nand 2-1 at the same time, it doesn't work,\nit's a page, so make a whole new page.\n\n336\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.710\nSo, I'm going to put my cursor in front\nof here, I'm going to go to layout,\n\n337\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.070\nthen I'm going to go to my\nnext page section break.\n\n338\n00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:10.806\nSo, this is section two,\nsame thing come down here.\n\n339\n00:20:10.806 --> 00:20:16.300\nCurser, break, next phase,\nthat's chapter three.\n\n340\n00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.970\nSo, now I've designated it,\nand just for fun,\n\n341\n00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.670\nbecause I don't have enough text,\nwe'll just keep on.\n\n342\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.430\nPretend this is more text in\nthis chapter [LAUGH], okay?\n\n343\n00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.300\nAll right.\nPerfect.\n\n344\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.620\nSo, I've got everything sectioned\noff got my multi level list.\n\n345\n00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.940\nWe're good, now we want to go ahead and\nadd our page numbers.\n\n346\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.092\nWe go into insert, and\nlet's go to adding a page number,\n\n347\n00:20:43.092 --> 00:20:48.466\nwe'll go to footer and\nwe'll add that same basic page number.\n\n348\n00:20:48.466 --> 00:20:53.000\nAnd I will make this bigger,\nso you guys can see it,\n\n349\n00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.273\nand we will bump this up to like 26.\n\n350\n00:20:56.273 --> 00:20:57.390\nIs that good enough?\n\n351\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.940\nLet's bump it up a little bit more.\n\n352\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.036\nPerfect, we can really, really see it.\n\n353\n00:21:01.036 --> 00:21:04.812\nNow, I realize it will move the text down\nonce I add [LAUGH] the page numbers and\n\n354\n00:21:04.812 --> 00:21:06.730\nit makes it bigger, okay.\n\n355\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.480\nI'm all good, so now I've got it going on\nand continuously going through everything.\n\n356\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.630\nAs one, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n357\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.960\nNow, I need to format my page numbers.\n\n358\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.480\nSo, let's click in here,\nlet's come over to our headroom,\n\n359\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.610\nfooter, cuz those you know we\ncould also go to the end, but\n\n360\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.640\nI'm going to go to page number, and\nI'm going to format my page numbers.\n\n361\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.420\nInclude chapter number, because that\nchapter starts with that heading one.\n\n362\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.460\nI attached that multiple\nlevel list to my heading one.\n\n363\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.310\nCool, I want to use my separator.\n\n364\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.930\nI could use notice like m dash, or n dash.\n\n365\n00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.980\nSo, we'll go ahead and\ndo that one dash two, one dash three.\n\n366\n00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.480\nI'll just stick with the hyphen.\n\n367\n00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.070\nI will stick with the page numbers as one.\n\n368\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.240\nAnd let's go ahead and click OK.\n\n369\n00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.990\nAll right, we're going good, right?\n\n370\n00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.190\nWe got page one dash,\none-one, one dash-two.\n\n371\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:57.732\nWell, now you gotta do it for\nevery section, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:57.732 --> 00:21:59.392\nSo, if I come into-\n&gt;&gt; Sections!\n\n373\n00:21:59.392 --> 00:22:03.380\n&gt;&gt; Sections, yes, it's all about sections.\n\n374\n00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.325\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you keep saying that.\n\n375\n00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:12.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, I come over here to section\ntwo of my footer come into my page number.\n\n376\n00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.820\nFormat the page numbers.\n\n377\n00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:19.380\nI do want to turn on my chapters and\nclick OK, all right?\n\n378\n00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.360\nBut that's two dash four.\n\n379\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.420\nWhat did I forget?\n\n380\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.085\nI forgot to come back and start with one.\n\n381\n00:22:26.085 --> 00:22:28.757\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; To start with one here.\n\n382\n00:22:28.757 --> 00:22:31.861\nThere we go, two dash one, two dash two.\n\n383\n00:22:31.861 --> 00:22:32.863\nSame thing.\n\n384\n00:22:32.863 --> 00:22:37.319\nAnd this is where, I believe\nthe way that I'm doing the steps,\n\n385\n00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:39.860\nI really want to emphasize.\n\n386\n00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.370\nOkay, if it doesn't get\nthrough all of them,\n\n387\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.975\nmake sure you go into\neach individual section.\n\n388\n00:22:44.975 --> 00:22:46.225\nDo the same procedure.\n\n389\n00:22:46.225 --> 00:22:50.965\nFormatting your page numbers to start with\none and include the chapter number, and\n\n390\n00:22:50.965 --> 00:22:52.245\nthen it will go through.\n\n391\n00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:59.234\nI'm pretty sure if you kind of reverse\nthose, add the page numbers in the folder,\n\n392\n00:22:59.234 --> 00:23:03.609\nformat them, then go through and\ndo the headings.\n\n393\n00:23:03.609 --> 00:23:06.682\nAnd the multilevel lists and everything,\n\n394\n00:23:06.682 --> 00:23:11.300\nit'll probably just go and\njust pop it with the whole document.\n\n395\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:17.060\nI wanted to just try to give you them in\nthe steps that maybe take you a little bit\n\n396\n00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.640\nlonger to really emphasize the whole point\nof yep good I have my sections, I have my\n\n397\n00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:27.140\npage number started and that's how we\nget it all together, so pieces, right?\n\n398\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.960\nWe'll review one more time.\n\n399\n00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:34.297\nI had to outline list, include\nthe chapter, associate it with my heading\n\n400\n00:23:34.297 --> 00:23:39.390\none style, make sure that all my\nheading ones have that chapter.\n\n401\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:44.370\nI then had to make sure I formatted\nmy page numbers, I needed sections,\n\n402\n00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.150\nI had to add next page section breaks.\n\n403\n00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.106\nI had to then make sure my page numbers\nwere formatted to include the chapter,\n\n404\n00:23:52.106 --> 00:23:54.563\nand to start at one for every section.\n\n405\n00:23:54.563 --> 00:23:57.092\nAnd if it did not do all of them\nat one time, I had to go to each\n\n406\n00:23:57.092 --> 00:24:00.748\nindividual section and make sure I do all\nthe steps again of formatting [INAUDIBLE].\n\n407\n00:24:00.748 --> 00:24:02.540\nSo, lots of pieces.\n\n408\n00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.118\nIt will work.\n\n409\n00:24:05.118 --> 00:24:09.660\nI promise you it will work,\nit's just, you gotta get the pieces.\n\n410\n00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:15.760\nAnd just to kind of go full circle back\nup here, if I was adding my headers,\n\n411\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:23.140\nif I wanted to say that this was a rabbit,\nlet's make it bigger sorry you guys.\n\n412\n00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.070\nLet's bump that up and make it red.\n\n413\n00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.013\nNo, let's make it green now.\n\n414\n00:24:29.013 --> 00:24:29.685\n&gt;&gt; Rabbit.\n\n415\n00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:32.124\n&gt;&gt; So I've got rabbit going\nthrough all the way here.\n\n416\n00:24:32.124 --> 00:24:34.530\nBut now Section 2 needs to be cat.\n\n417\n00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.470\nWhat do you think I have to do\nto make this not be connected?\n\n418\n00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.770\nWell, you have to section it off,\ndon't you?\n\n419\n00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.830\n&gt;&gt; Got a section, got section two.\n\n420\n00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.813\n&gt;&gt; Yes, section two.\n\n421\n00:24:47.813 --> 00:24:52.078\n&gt;&gt; And then look, look,\nthis button, right here.\n\n422\n00:24:52.078 --> 00:24:54.174\nLink to tree, where am I looking?\n\n423\n00:24:54.174 --> 00:24:55.926\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm confused!\n\n424\n00:24:55.926 --> 00:24:57.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, that's okay!\n\n425\n00:24:57.895 --> 00:24:59.262\nBut that is why we\nare coming back to this.\n\n426\n00:24:59.262 --> 00:25:01.310\n&gt;&gt; And I was going to say,\nthere are lots of steps,\n\n427\n00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.820\nthere's a lot of working parts here,\nbut this is a video,\n\n428\n00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.010\nyou can watch it a million times,\nand also your show notes, too.\n\n429\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n430\n00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.990\n&gt;&gt; You're very fortunate, guys.\n\n431\n00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.480\n&gt;&gt; And circling back around to some of the\nother concepts that are in other episodes\n\n432\n00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.220\nif I wanted this I have to unlink it,\nturn off the link to previous.\n\n433\n00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:25.060\nNow this can be cat and\nsee now section 3 needs to be pig, right?\n\n434\n00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:30.290\nSo come and, again another one,\nmake sure your cursor's in the right spot\n\n435\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.990\nbefore you go and\nstart clicking on buttons, okay?\n\n436\n00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.320\nAlways gotta stop, think, what am I doing?\n\n437\n00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.333\nWhere do I need to be?\n\n438\n00:25:36.333 --> 00:25:40.810\nBe in Section 3, turn off the link,\nchange this to pig.\n\n439\n00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.380\nAnd then, you can see pig.\n\n440\n00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.190\nSo, that way you could have the titles,\n\n441\n00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.990\nif you want to say,\non all the different sections.\n\n442\n00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.974\nYou can make sure that the headers have\ndifferent content, unique content.\n\n443\n00:25:55.974 --> 00:25:57.960\nYou gotta turn it to unlink.\n\n444\n00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.440\nThese are same with previous,\n\n445\n00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.840\nbecause I want to keep it\ngoing with the page number.\n\n446\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:08.770\nSo, I didn't have to turn off the linking\nfor changing the page numbers, that's\n\n447\n00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:13.220\nokay to be connected but it is flowing\nthrough the different page numbers.\n\n448\n00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.940\nIt's when I want the words\nto be different,\n\n449\n00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.760\nthat's where you might want to go\nahead and unlink to the previous.\n\n450\n00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.700\nSo that's another thing of why it happens,\nwhen you wanna turn it on and off.\n\n451\n00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.000\nAnd notice that I can have, and this is\nsomething I didn't emphasize in the last\n\n452\n00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.060\nepisode, is that I can have my\nheaders not linked together,\n\n453\n00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:42.748\nthe linking previous from the sections,\nbut my footers can be linked to previous.\n\n454\n00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:47.489\nSo they're their own entities of how they\n\n455\n00:26:47.489 --> 00:26:52.365\nconnect into the other sections right, so\n\n456\n00:26:52.365 --> 00:26:55.627\njust throwing all that out.\n\n457\n00:26:55.627 --> 00:26:59.497\nA lot of information,\nthis part tripped me up for,\n\n458\n00:26:59.497 --> 00:27:04.260\nI don't even want to admit,\nthis tripped me up for years.\n\n459\n00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.699\nI mean, this took me a long time.\n\n460\n00:27:05.699 --> 00:27:06.588\n&gt;&gt; I don't feel so bad now.\n\n461\n00:27:06.588 --> 00:27:10.297\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This whole thing took me a long\n\n462\n00:27:10.297 --> 00:27:15.290\ntime to wrap my head around because\nI was probably just like you,\n\n463\n00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:19.542\nI fought with this so hard and\nit would get me so upset and\n\n464\n00:27:19.542 --> 00:27:22.140\nI could never make it work right.\n\n465\n00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.390\nAnd I would watch tutorials,\nand I'm like, I got it.\n\n466\n00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.940\nIt was when I didn't use that one piece.\n\n467\n00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.560\nI didn't use the multi level lists or\nthe outlined lists and\n\n468\n00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.850\nthat's why it's not working.\n\n469\n00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:38.140\nSo if you've fought with this I have\nto still fight with it sometimes.\n\n470\n00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.562\nEven during these demonstrations,\nI'm like, wait.\n\n471\n00:27:41.562 --> 00:27:45.890\nThat's why I have to kind of write it out,\nthink about it, and really stop.\n\n472\n00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.425\nAnd sometimes it's like, stop,\nscrap, let me start over.\n\n473\n00:27:49.425 --> 00:27:54.726\nBack up, always make copies of things\njust in case you need to get back.\n\n474\n00:27:54.726 --> 00:27:55.661\n&gt;&gt; More important, yeah.\n\n475\n00:27:55.661 --> 00:27:59.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz sometimes you can get down\na hole and and you can't get back out.\n\n476\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.370\nJust kind of helping you all out\nif you've struggled with it.\n\n477\n00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.050\nI have too.\n\n478\n00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.010\nI feel your pain.\n\n479\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:12.140\nHopefully, this will alleviate some of\nyour pain and Yeah, I think I'm done.\n\n480\n00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:12.955\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well very good, and\n\n481\n00:28:12.955 --> 00:28:14.465\nit will alleviate some of our pain, Vonne.\n\n482\n00:28:14.465 --> 00:28:16.155\nYou did a wonderful job as always.\n\n483\n00:28:16.155 --> 00:28:17.315\nAnd this was add and\n\n484\n00:28:17.315 --> 00:28:21.325\nformat

00:28:30.040\nBecause you're very lucky in that respect.\n\n490\n00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.920\nIn fact, our course library has\nhundreds of other videos and\n\n491\n00:28:32.920 -->

It's time for sparkles!\n\n10\n00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:32.852\n&gt;&gt; Hey [LAUGH!\n\n11\n00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:34.838\n&gt;&gt; Well, kind of [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:35.363\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n\n13\n00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:35.912\n&gt;&gt; Glitter!\n\n14\n00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:37.008\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes.\n\n15\n00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.761\nWe're going to be adding some\ndecorations to our pages.\n\n16\n00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:44.538\nAnd then we're also going\nto talk about orientation,\n\n17\n00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:48.242\nwhich that one is pretty simple,\nhonestly, [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:53.116\nSo orientation would be how\nthe page is orientated,\n\n19\n00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:56.510\nmeaning this way versus this way.\n\n20\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.903\n&gt;&gt; Horizontal or vertical.\n\n21\n00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:00.072\n&gt;&gt; Yes, or also known as portrait.\n\n22\n00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:01.954\n&gt;&gt; Or portrait landscape, yeah.\n\n23\n00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:05.790\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, it's the same,\nhorizontal, vertical, same idea.\n\n24\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.414\nSo how do I want my text designated on\nthe page or the orientation of my page?\n\n25\n00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:16.090\nLet me show you,\nI have a file called certificate layout.\n\n26\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.057\nWe have the most team spirit, I'm going to\nturn this off because we don't need it.\n\n27\n00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:24.060\nI decided to nominate Ronnie Wong for the\nmost, I probably should actually put you.\n\n28\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.732\n&gt;&gt; Actually, Ronnie likes sparkles.\n\n29\n00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:26.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He just told me.\n\n30\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.280\n&gt;&gt; And he has his own shirt.\n\n31\n00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.229\n&gt;&gt; He does.\n&gt;&gt; So I've got this, but on a certificate,\n\n32\n00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.128\nlike a certificate of completion or\nsomething,\n\n33\n00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:37.260\nit's not normally in portrait,\nit's normally in landscape.\n\n34\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.081\nSo how do you change that?\n\n35\n00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:40.953\nYou go over to your layout and\nit's right there, and so\n\n36\n00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:43.020\nthose are your only two options.\n\n37\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.457\nAnd watch if I'm gonna magically change,\nboom, there we go.\n\n38\n00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:47.645\nYes, I did this on purpose.\n\n39\n00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:52.621\nAll right, and I am making our\nown certificate, just an FYI,\n\n40\n00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:55.720\nthis is this not the gonna be the best.\n\n41\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.399\n&gt;&gt; Not the official one.\n\n42\n00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.250\n&gt;&gt; No, and\nit's not going to look very pretty.\n\n43\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.211\nI would highly suggest using some of the\ntemplates that they have for certificates.\n\n44\n00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.662\nJust, might as well just\nshow you really quickly,\n\n45\n00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:08.220\neven though this is not\nan episode about templates.\n\n46\n00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.065\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n47\n00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:11.682\n&gt;&gt; But if you go from New,\nfrom Template, and\n\n48\n00:02:11.682 --> 00:02:16.140\nif you're connected to the Internet,\nif you just type in certificate.\n\n49\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.544\nThere we go, there are some pretty ones.\n\n50\n00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:26.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, there's some much\nnicer ones that are pretty cute.\n\n51\n00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.883\nYou could also probably go online and\nconsult the Oracle, or\n\n52\n00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.737\njust type in certificate templates for\nWord.\n\n53\n00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:34.338\nAnd maybe even throw it in for\n\n54\n00:02:34.338 --> 00:02:38.690\nMac, but I don't really think that's\ngonna matter, cuz it's just a DOCX.\n\n55\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.483\nAnd you can find some much nicer ones.\n\n56\n00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:43.098\nNow, I didn't want to go all the way here,\n\n57\n00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:46.845\nbecause this does get into\ntalking about shapes and colors.\n\n58\n00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:51.479\nAnd the graphical elements that is\nin our advanced word series, but\n\n59\n00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.091\njust throwing that out there for you.\n\n60\n00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.990\nThis is just about orientation and\ndecoration, there we go.\n\n61\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.759\nNow it is landscape,\nlet's zoom in just a little bit here.\n\n62\n00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:05.893\nSo now I want to kind of\ngussy it up a little bit,\n\n63\n00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:10.036\nlet's go over to our\nDesign tab on our ribbon.\n\n64\n00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:13.319\nCuz over here,\ncuz we've been to this Design tab before,\n\n65\n00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.337\nbut we didn't really talk\ntoo much about these guys.\n\n66\n00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:22.300\nWe have our page color, changes the color\nof the page, yeah, that's what it does.\n\n67\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.368\nAnd I could make this yellow, goodness.\n\n68\n00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:26.296\n&gt;&gt; I told you it wasn't\ngoing to look pretty.\n\n69\n00:03:26.296 --> 00:03:28.506\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe a light grey.\n\n70\n00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:29.895\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n71\n00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:33.386\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now when you print this,\njust to let you know, it doesn't,\n\n72\n00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:37.090\nit's not going to print the color\nall the way to the edge of the page.\n\n73\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.798\nThat just doesn't work.\n\n74\n00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:38.526\n&gt;&gt; So there will be a border.\n\n75\n00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:43.544\nThere will,\nborder in a sense that that's just how\n\n76\n00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:49.470\ndesktop printers,\nit can't print to the edge of the page.\n\n77\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.411\nThe only way to get to printing to the\nedge of the page is you have to go into\n\n78\n00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:56.392\ncommercial printing and\nthen have bleeds and trims.\n\n79\n00:03:56.392 --> 00:04:01.369\nAnd yes, there are some photo\nprinters that do print to the edge of\n\n80\n00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.820\nyour papers that you can buy for\nyour own use.\n\n81\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.057\nBut generally speaking,\nyour printer normally will adjust and\n\n82\n00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:11.497\ncreate white space around the page.\n\n83\n00:04:11.497 --> 00:04:12.001\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n84\n00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:15.535\n&gt;&gt; The reason why I add borders is because\nwe're gonna add a page border, and\n\n85\n00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:16.960\nthat's a little different.\n\n86\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.639\n&gt;&gt; Right, different deal.\n\n87\n00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.180\n&gt;&gt; I know what you're talking about, but\n\n88\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.830\nit's all about that terminology that\nwe can get a little tripped up on.\n\n89\n00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.146\nSo back over here on this page color,\nif you're used to PC, Word.\n\n90\n00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:31.984\nIn the page color,\nthey also have things like gradients and\n\n91\n00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:34.000\nthey also have fill effects.\n\n92\n00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.240\nIt’s not available in the Mac version,\nit just isn’t.\n\n93\n00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.946\nIf you want a gradient, or\nsome type of picture background,\n\n94\n00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:45.590\nyou’re going to have to add it\nas like a graphical element.\n\n95\n00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.853\nLike a photograph, an image, and\nthen send it to the back, again,\n\n96\n00:04:48.853 --> 00:04:50.242\nmore stuff in our advanced.\n\n97\n00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:54.580\nSo it's not that it's not possible,\njust not through this\n\n98\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.230\nparticular drop down and\nthis command of changing the page color.\n\n99\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.801\nSo let's move on to borders,\nlet's come over here to Page Borders.\n\n100\n00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:08.550\nNow, just to let you know,\nI did click on this button right here, and\n\n101\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.240\nit brought up this dialog box.\n\n102\n00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.170\nThis is the Borders and Shading,\nnow this is where some are like, well,\n\n103\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.333\nthis looks kinda familiar.\n\n104\n00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.908\nBecause we've been here before when\nwe did our paragraph formatting and\n\n105\n00:05:17.908 --> 00:05:20.200\nwe did borders and\nshadings for my paragraph.\n\n106\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.704\nYou might have noticed, in that episode,\nthere is another option,\n\n107\n00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:27.434\nright here in the middle for Page Border.\n\n108\n00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:31.175\nAnd, so,\nhere I can designate my different styles,\n\n109\n00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:35.677\nI could have a double outline,\nmaybe I'll do a triple outline.\n\n110\n00:05:35.677 --> 00:05:40.653\nWatching this little button over here or\nthis graphic to tell you where its\n\n111\n00:05:40.653 --> 00:05:43.711\nactually applying is\na good thing to look at.\n\n112\n00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:49.150\nI could change the color,\nmaybe I want to make this Purple.\n\n113\n00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.303\nChange the point size, and then you also\nhave some different settings over here.\n\n114\n00:05:53.303 --> 00:05:57.200\nMaybe I want to add a shadow,\nhave a little 3D on there.\n\n115\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.888\nSometimes you might throw a 3D on it and\nbe like, that didn't do anything.\n\n116\n00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:04.273\nIt's just the nature\nof maybe the style and\n\n117\n00:06:04.273 --> 00:06:10.630\nthe point size that the 3D aspect\nisn't going to really look that 3D.\n\n118\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.549\nI'm purposely not going down here for\njust a little bit.\n\n119\n00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:16.360\nI am going to apply this\nto the whole document.\n\n120\n00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.454\nYep, that's what I want, so\nI click OK, and all right.\n\n121\n00:06:19.454 --> 00:06:21.231\n&gt;&gt; Voila!\n\n122\n00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:22.694\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm really not liking this.\n\n123\n00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:27.123\nBut [LAUGH] you get the idea here of,\nwow, that is not any better,\n\n124\n00:06:27.123 --> 00:06:30.830\n[LAUGH] that I could go ahead and\nchange the border now.\n\n125\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.782\nBut notice where the border is sitting\nin relationship to the whole page.\n\n126\n00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:40.653\nAnd if I had multiple pages,\nthis is gonna go to all the pages,\n\n127\n00:06:40.653 --> 00:06:44.040\nit's kind of setting in that margin area.\n\n128\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.748\nIf I come back over here, I have an option\nof where the border is going to sit.\n\n129\n00:06:51.748 --> 00:06:56.436\nIf I click in here, notice it's\nlike measuring from the margin,\n\n130\n00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:59.140\nmeasuring from the edge of the page.\n\n131\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.152\nAnd you also have some\ndifferent options here.\n\n132\n00:07:02.152 --> 00:07:06.913\nAlign paragraph borders to with the page\nborders, so if you had actual borders and\n\n133\n00:07:06.913 --> 00:07:10.330\nshadings in paragraphs,\nthat's what that for.\n\n134\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.721\nSurrounding the header and footer,\n\n135\n00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:16.973\nthat's another thing that you\nneed to take into consideration.\n\n136\n00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:20.060\nI'm gonna cancel all this out for\nnow because I have another file.\n\n137\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.987\nI'm just using my command tool bay as\nmy shortcut to cycle me through my open\n\n138\n00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:25.857\ndocuments.\n\n139\n00:07:25.857 --> 00:07:30.040\nI have a couple open documents, so it just\nlets you know that that's what I'm doing.\n\n140\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.260\nI could always come up\nhere to my Window menu and\n\n141\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.485\nchange what document I want in\nthe foreground by going here.\n\n142\n00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:41.968\nI'm just using my shortcut,\nlet's come back over here to this example.\n\n143\n00:07:41.968 --> 00:07:46.040\nAnd I'm gonna, oops, sorry, I'm gonna\nzoom this out a little bit more, so\n\n144\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.747\nwe can see where this border\nis going to be sitting.\n\n145\n00:07:48.747 --> 00:07:49.548\nLet me turn this off too.\n\n146\n00:07:49.548 --> 00:07:52.509\nSo let's go back over into, you know what?\n\n147\n00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:54.529\nLet's go to a different place.\n\n148\n00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:59.225\nLet's go to the Format menu and\nlet's go to Borders and Shading.\n\n149\n00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:01.865\nCuz I can get to the same place from here.\n\n150\n00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:06.938\nSo now that I have my borders and\nshading and I'm in my page border here,\n\n151\n00:08:06.938 --> 00:08:12.270\nlet's just throw on a quick border just so\nwe can get a visual on it.\n\n152\n00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.620\nLet's make this green, and\n\n153\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.440\nclick OK, it does go around\nthe whole header and footer.\n\n154\n00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.640\nBut going back into those same options,\nif I turn these off and\n\n155\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.460\nclick OK, and click OK again,\ndo you see it cuts that off.\n\n156\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.620\nWhich is something you might want to do,\nmaybe you want the page numbers to\n\n157\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.132\nthe outside of the border, that's where\nyou can designate that, change it.\n\n158\n00:08:42.132 --> 00:08:47.249\nNow it doesn't really line up so\nthat's where if coming back into\n\n159\n00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:53.660\nchanging the options of where it's\nsetting, notice it's from the margin.\n\n160\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.900\nIf I wanted to make that\ncome up a little bit more,\n\n161\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.700\nI don't know where this is gonna sit, so\nlet's look at it, we'll go the other way.\n\n162\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:06.390\n[LAUGH] But you'll notice you can go ahead\nand change where that border is sitting,\n\n163\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.160\nand this is where honestly you\njust have to play around with it.\n\n164\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.970\nYou have to kind of come into here\nbecause yeah you could do math but\n\n165\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.080\nyour measuring in points which is\na little bit different for people.\n\n166\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.903\nThere's 12 points in an inch just\nto let you, no, actually there's 6,\n\n167\n00:09:20.903 --> 00:09:23.730\n6 picas in an inch, and\nthere's 12 points in a pica.\n\n168\n00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.775\nSorry I'm getting into math which\nyou don't need to know about,\n\n169\n00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:27.860\njust keep bumping them up or down.\n\n170\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.981\n&gt;&gt;

Because as you pointed out\nall the way through this series,\n\n192\n00:10:30.774 --> 00:10:33.472\nsections and sectionalizing,\nis that a word?\n\n193\n00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:34.212\nThat sounds good.\n\n194\n00:10:34.212 --> 00:10:35.765\n&gt;&gt; Hey I'm rolling with it, so.\n\n195\n00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:37.184\n&gt;&gt; It's a very important thing.\n\n196\n00:10:37.184 --> 00:10:38.600\n&gt;&gt; I would use that word, so I'm glad,\n\n197\n00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.868\nyeah we've been working together a little\nbit so you're picking up my vocabulary.\n\n198\n00:10:41.868 --> 00:10:43.333\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like-\n\n199\n00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:43.955\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so\n\n200\n00:10:43.955 --> 00:10:45.880\nthat's where we have our page borders.\n\n201\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.170\nLet's go on to a few other\ndifferent page layout elements.\n\n202\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.494\nThis is a big one from me, I'm gonna,\n\n203\n00:10:55.494 --> 00:10:59.423\nwe can turn this page border off.\n\n204\n00:10:59.423 --> 00:11:02.192\nI forgot the art, I'll come back, okay.\n\n205\n00:11:02.192 --> 00:11:04.597\n[LAUGH] In just a second, cuz they're fun.\n\n206\n00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:06.650\n&gt;&gt; And it is, it's fun, and\nthere's a lot of moving parts.\n\n207\n00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're doing great, my goodness,\n\n208\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.010\nalways awesome.\n\n209\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.690\n&gt;&gt; We'll come back around to\nthe art border in just a second,\n\n210\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.670\ncuz I did start to talk about vertical\nalignment, this is a big one for me.\n\n211\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.240\nNotice that in this page I\nchange the orientation, but\n\n212\n00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.220\nyou see how it's just a little\nbit further up on the page?\n\n213\n00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.780\nVertical alignment, we talk about\nhorizontal alignment meaning like center,\n\n214\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:33.150\nleft, right, on our paragraphs, but now I\nwant to center it this way on the page.\n\n215\n00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.540\nThat's vertical alignment on your page.\n\n216\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.213\nEasiest way to get to this, go to your\nformat menu, and go to your document.\n\n217\n00:11:43.213 --> 00:11:46.922\nBecause back where we were doing\nour margins and stuff like that,\n\n218\n00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:50.969\nover here in your layout tab,\nwith the layout, this is where you can get\n\n219\n00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:54.430\nto the vertical alignment,\nit is always the top by default.\n\n220\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.193\nIf we go to center, then click OK.\n\n221\n00:11:57.193 --> 00:11:58.711\nSo much better, I don't know if you can.\n\n222\n00:11:58.711 --> 00:11:59.503\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n223\n00:11:59.503 --> 00:12:04.628\n&gt;&gt; See from there I did Cmd+ Z to undo,\nnow Cmd+Y to redo.\n\n224\n00:12:04.628 --> 00:12:05.870\nBoop, it just goes ahead.\n\n225\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.670\nAnd that's where if you are maybe\ndoing like a script right, and\n\n226\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.650\nthe very first page it has\nthe name of the movie or\n\n227\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.600\nwhatever and\nit's right in the middle of the page.\n\n228\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.211\nYou would center it as a paragraph and\nthen center it vertically on the page.\n\n229\n00:12:20.211 --> 00:12:24.449\nSo my big thing there, vertical alignment.\n\n230\n00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:27.950\nNow back to that border, okay cuz that was\nthe one that I forgot to tell you about.\n\n231\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.880\nI'm gonna go back to format and\nborders and shading, the art borders.\n\n232\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.620\n&gt;&gt; Art borders.\n\n233\n00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.906\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nYes, this is where we can get into some\n\n234\n00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:35.702\nsparkles and everything.\n\n235\n00:12:35.702 --> 00:12:36.422\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n\n236\n00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.561\n&gt;&gt; So maybe I wanna add some balloons,\n\n237\n00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:43.293\nmaybe I'll change the width of these\nballoons, and poof there you go, yeah.\n\n238\n00:12:43.293 --> 00:12:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n&gt;&gt; Now this particular graphic does have\n\n239\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.930\na white background because\nit's probably a JPEG.\n\n240\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.638\nAnd notice with the yellow page\nbackground it might not look so good, so\n\n241\n00:12:54.638 --> 00:12:56.844\nlet's take off that page color.\n\n242\n00:12:56.844 --> 00:12:59.937\nYeah and\nnow I have balloons around the spirit.\n\n243\n00:12:59.937 --> 00:13:03.913\nNow I cannot change the color of these\nballoons because notice they're,\n\n244\n00:13:03.913 --> 00:13:05.780\nwell they have different colors.\n\n245\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.050\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask that,\ncan you change the color of the balloon?\n\n246\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.560\n&gt;&gt; Well it depends on the type of art\nborder that you choose cuz you see\n\n247\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.470\nthese in here, we have some apples, and\n\n248\n00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.440\nsome cake, and some witches, it's close\nto Halloween time around here right now.\n\n249\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.666\nAny of those you can't change the color,\nbut if you get down into some of these,\n\n250\n00:13:24.666 --> 00:13:28.530\nso we have, those are [LAUGH]\nthose are cats by the way.\n\n251\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.064\n&gt;&gt;

Because all the time you're gonna\nneed an award for green cat monkeys for\n\n261\n00:13:56.751 --> 00:13:57.363\nsomething.\n\n262\n00:13:57.363 --> 00:13:59.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah for the most team spirit.\n\n263\n00:13:59.525 --> 00:14:02.440\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so those are the fun ones,\n\n264\n00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.250\nand I couldn't leave without\ndoing the art borders.\n\n265\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:10.100\nAll right so let's move on to, we did\nvertical alignment, date and time, okay.\n\n266\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.195\nSo right down here on this day, and\n\n267\n00:14:12.195 --> 00:14:16.550\nthis is something that I could have\ncovered in the Headers and Footers.\n\n268\n00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.970\nBecause back in that area just really\nquickly, notice that there is a date and\n\n269\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.880\ntime, and I could put that in there.\n\n270\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.163\nSo it does not matter if it's\nin the header, or footer, or\n\n271\n00:14:27.163 --> 00:14:30.392\njust on the document,\nI want to insert the date and time.\n\n272\n00:14:30.392 --> 00:14:33.926\nSo I put my cursor where I want\nit to go into, insert, and\n\n273\n00:14:33.926 --> 00:14:37.311\nthen over here you probably\nhave words next to it, but\n\n274\n00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:41.190\nmy resolution is this way,\nit looks like a little calendar.\n\n275\n00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.640\nI hit insert, date, and time.\n\n276\n00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.510\nAnd you have a lot of different\nways that you can format dates, but\n\n277\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.310\nthis one right here, update automatic,\nmaybe this is something you print out\n\n278\n00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.680\nevery day at the end of class for\nyour students or something to that effect.\n\n279\n00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.310\nYou want it to update every time you open\nup this file to whatever date it is,\n\n280\n00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.270\nthen check that box off.\n\n281\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.986\nIf you wanted it to just\nbe hey it's this date, and\n\n282\n00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:07.429\nI don't want it to change don't\ncheck the box off okay, cool.\n\n283\n00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:10.700\nI click okay, and there you go,\nI've got it formatted.\n\n284\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.360\nI already formatted this with fonts,\nand alignments, and\n\n285\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.240\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n286\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.530\nLet's move over to watermarks and\nline numbers.\n\n287\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.670\nI think those are last two little\ndifferent parts of our different page\n\n288\n00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.550\nlayouts, and decorations.\n\n289\n00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.250\nWatermark, so what is a watermark?\n\n290\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.876\nIt's something that goes across the page,\n\n291\n00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:39.350\nall of your document, and\nmaybe like a top secret or.\n\n292\n00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.172\n&gt;&gt; Like a light gray scale or\nsomething like that?\n\n293\n00:15:41.172 --> 00:15:44.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or like a do not copy,\nor confidential,\n\n294\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.500\nor any of those different things,\nthat's what you could have as a watermark.\n\n295\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.619\nThere's a text watermark, and there's also\na picture watermark, let me show you.\n\n296\n00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:55.592\nWe'll stick with this, and we'll go\nto Insert, and we'll come over to,\n\n297\n00:15:55.592 --> 00:15:57.686\nnope we'll go over to Design, sorry.\n\n298\n00:15:57.686 --> 00:15:59.279\n[LAUGH] Wrong tab.\n\n299\n00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:03.042\nAnd there it is, Watermark, click on that.\n\n300\n00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:07.838\nNotice you have two different options,\nlike what I just said, Picture and Text.\n\n301\n00:16:07.838 --> 00:16:10.367\nLet's just stick with the Text one for\nnow.\n\n302\n00:16:10.367 --> 00:16:14.451\nAnd there's a couple of different\npresets that you have in here,\n\n303\n00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:18.548\nlike Confidential, Do Not Copy,\nOriginal, Top Secret, ooh.\n\n304\n00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:20.108\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right, right.\n\n305\n00:16:20.108 --> 00:16:20.876\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n306\n00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:22.652\n&gt;&gt; I've seen many of them that just copy.\n\n307\n00:16:22.652 --> 00:16:23.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n308\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.484\n&gt;&gt; If it's not the original one,\nthen it's a copy.\n\n309\n00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n310\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.562\nSo, here we have, all right, well, I can\nchange the font to whatever one I want.\n\n311\n00:16:31.562 --> 00:16:36.722\nThe size, I'll just go with Automatic,\nbecause I want it to fit automatically.\n\n312\n00:16:36.722 --> 00:16:40.325\nThis is the one that people say,\nwell, I was trying to, wait,\n\n313\n00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:42.182\nit's making it more see through?\n\n314\n00:16:42.182 --> 00:16:43.761\nYes, because that's what transparency is.\n\n315\n00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:46.762\nIf you increase the transparency,\nyou're going to make it more see through.\n\n316\n00:16:46.762 --> 00:16:51.390\nBut the font color, if you put it\nto black, now you can really see.\n\n317\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.685\nAnd then, how much you want that to be\ntransparent makes a little bit more sense.\n\n318\n00:16:55.685 --> 00:16:58.706\nSo, if you have a really light color,\nit will go transparent or\n\n319\n00:16:58.706 --> 00:17:00.363\nmore see through pretty quickly.\n\n320\n00:17:00.363 --> 00:17:05.436\nSo I can make it purple, add whatever\nlevel of transparency looks good.\n\n321\n00:17:05.436 --> 00:17:09.605\nA lot of times, on your screen, it's gonna\nlook way different than when you print it.\n\n322\n00:17:09.605 --> 00:17:13.291\nEspecially when we get into like\na washed out picture watermark.\n\n323\n00:17:13.291 --> 00:17:17.332\nDon't always judge that the screen is\ngonna look like the printed version.\n\n324\n00:17:17.332 --> 00:17:20.502\nAnd a lot of times, you see\na diagonal rather than a horizontal.\n\n325\n00:17:20.502 --> 00:17:21.633\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, often.\n\n326\n00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:26.834\n&gt;&gt; You click OK, and there you go,\nthere's my text watermark.\n\n327\n00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:30.427\nThis one, I have noticed and I've tried\nto play around with it, it goes for\n\n328\n00:17:30.427 --> 00:17:31.523\nthe entire document.\n\n329\n00:17:31.523 --> 00:17:34.999\nYou can't put different\nwatermarks on different sections.\n\n330\n00:17:34.999 --> 00:17:38.355\nIt's gonna always apply for the document,\nat least from my experience,\n\n331\n00:17:38.355 --> 00:17:39.281\nthat's what it is.\n\n332\n00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:43.776\nSo, I know I've been really into sections,\nsections, this is like a document.\n\n333\n00:17:43.776 --> 00:17:46.343\n&gt;&gt; So,\nyou can't just put it on one page file?\n\n334\n00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:47.592\n&gt;&gt; Not that I know of.\n\n335\n00:17:47.592 --> 00:17:48.841\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n336\n00:17:48.841 --> 00:17:52.555\n&gt;&gt; At least anything that I've tried\nwith the sections, that's how it works.\n\n337\n00:17:52.555 --> 00:17:56.234\nIf you wanted it on one page, and not the\nothers, I would make two separate files.\n\n338\n00:17:56.234 --> 00:17:59.905\nSo, first page would be a separate file\nwith a watermark, and then the rest of it,\n\n339\n00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:01.250\nyou'd have a separate file.\n\n340\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.234\n&gt;&gt; And there's the work around, perfect.\n\n341\n00:18:02.234 --> 00:18:03.314\n&gt;&gt; That's what I would do.\n\n342\n00:18:03.314 --> 00:18:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n343\n00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.142\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the picture watermark.\n\n344\n00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:10.189\nCome over here to Watermark.\n\n345\n00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:13.540\nAnd the other thing, in this text,\nwe had all our presets, but\n\n346\n00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.257\nwhat if I wanted to put ITProTV?\n\n347\n00:18:15.257 --> 00:18:16.968\nWell, that's not in the drop down.\n\n348\n00:18:16.968 --> 00:18:20.108\nAll you have to do is,\nwith this selected, just start typing,\n\n349\n00:18:20.108 --> 00:18:22.019\nITPro, I just wrote OfficePro.\n\n350\n00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:25.018\nWell, ITPro, OfficePro, DevPro,\nwe're all part of the Pro family, right?\n\n351\n00:18:25.018 --> 00:18:27.505\n&gt;&gt; Sure, BizPro.\n\n352\n00:18:27.505 --> 00:18:34.885\n&gt;&gt; So we've got OfficeProTV, so\nyou can type in any text that you want,\n\n353\n00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:38.838\nyou don't have to use the defaults.\n\n354\n00:18:38.838 --> 00:18:42.063\nBack on to our picture watermark,\nmaybe you want your company logo.\n\n355\n00:18:42.063 --> 00:18:45.425\nI see a lot of that, where the logo\nis really light in the background.\n\n356\n00:18:45.425 --> 00:18:46.985\n&gt;&gt; Really light, almost at a gray scale.\n\n357\n00:18:46.985 --> 00:18:51.830\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, so we would need to,\none, have a picture of your logo.\n\n358\n00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.711\nI have pictures of my cats, [LAUGH].\n\n359\n00:18:54.711 --> 00:18:56.462\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nI bet we're using a cat.\n\n360\n00:18:56.462 --> 00:18:59.822\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, we got Bishop and Fuego.\n\n361\n00:18:59.822 --> 00:19:02.222\nYeah, that's Bishop, this is Fuego.\n\n362\n00:19:02.222 --> 00:19:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n363\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.570\n&gt;&gt; But I also have some different\nsceneries and things like that, so\n\n364\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.144\nI can have, that's Tampa.\n\n365\n00:19:08.144 --> 00:19:09.152\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, use the kitties.\n\n366\n00:19:09.152 --> 00:19:11.551\n&gt;&gt; You want the, yeah,\nlet's use these guys.\n\n367\n00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:12.392\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n368\n00:19:12.392 --> 00:19:17.337\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I click Insert, and\nnow you're like, is it in there?\n\n369\n00:19:17.337 --> 00:19:21.406\n&gt;&gt; If you haven't washed, it's really\nhard to see if you use the wash out,\n\n370\n00:19:21.406 --> 00:19:24.423\nI'm turning this off just so\nyou can visually see it.\n\n371\n00:19:24.423 --> 00:19:29.322\nCuz it's there,\nI can't see it, though, okay?\n\n372\n00:19:29.322 --> 00:19:32.503\nSo, this is another one where\nyou can wash it out, and\n\n373\n00:19:32.503 --> 00:19:37.337\nyou probably don't see it on your screen,\nprint it out, see what it looks like.\n\n374\n00:19:37.337 --> 00:19:38.081\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n375\n00:19:38.081 --> 00:19:40.889\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cuz that's the only real judge\nof whether or not you're gonna see it.\n\n376\n00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:41.873\n&gt;&gt; Test it out.\n\n377\n00:19:41.873 --> 00:19:42.737\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n378\n00:19:42.737 --> 00:19:45.937\nNow the size, I usually go with Auto,\nbut this is where,\n\n379\n00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:48.015\ndepending on the size of your photo.\n\n380\n00:19:48.015 --> 00:19:50.016\nHow this like 50, 100, and\n\n381\n00:19:50.016 --> 00:19:54.320\nthese presets of the percentages of\nhow much you want this to look like.\n\n382\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.239\nSo if I did 200, I don't know what that\nis, I think that's his nose, [LAUGH].\n\n383\n00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.967\n&gt;&gt; That's his foot, [LAUGH].\n\n384\n00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:04.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's like, yeah, I think\nthat's Fuego's little nose right there,\n\n385\n00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:06.640\nso this was a really large photograph.\n\n386\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.045\nSo if I even did 50%, I kind of got,\nI could do 10%, all right,\n\n387\n00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:16.627\nif I did 10, okay,\nthat's making it a little smaller.\n\n388\n00:20:16.627 --> 00:20:21.787\nSo, the scale does depend on\nthe original size of the graphic.\n\n389\n00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:26.188\nAnd how much you want to\nkind of show parts of it or\n\n390\n00:20:26.188 --> 00:20:29.501\nmore or less of it on the watermark.\n\n391\n00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:34.018\nSo I'm not washing it out, just so you can\nsee that now I have a picture watermark.\n\n392\n00:20:34.018 --> 00:20:34.978\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n393\n00:20:34.978 --> 00:20:39.660\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I don't want a watermark, I come\nback and just go, with no watermark,\n\n394\n00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.461\nwonderful.\n\n395\n00:20:40.461 --> 00:20:45.624\nSo I just did this over here,\nI have, okay, page, water, and line,\n\n396\n00:20:45.624 --> 00:20:50.722\nI was gonna put the watermark on this one,\nbut, nah, that's okay.\n\n397\n00:20:50.722 --> 00:20:54.811\nLast one for\ndifferent page layouts is line numbering.\n\n398\n00:20:54.811 --> 00:20:58.427\nNow, where would you see line numbering?\n\n399\n00:20:58.427 --> 00:21:01.536\nI'm thinking, script, right?\n\n400\n00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:06.364\nMaybe we have a play, and\nyou want to have like, go to line 52, or\n\n401\n00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:08.707\nwhat have you, that might be one.\n\n402\n00:21:08.707 --> 00:21:09.595\n&gt;&gt; Text?\n\n403\n00:21:09.595 --> 00:21:11.515\n&gt;&gt; Text, I have-\n&gt;&gt; Textbooks.\n\n404\n00:21:11.515 --> 00:21:13.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n405\n00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:15.867\nThe only thing I could think\nof was the script, but\n\n406\n00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:19.589\nanything that requires you to number\nyour lines, you can do it, [LAUGH].\n\n407\n00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:23.606\nIf I go to my Format,\nthen I go to Document,\n\n408\n00:21:23.606 --> 00:21:28.309\ncoming into here,\nit's in that Layout section.\n\n409\n00:21:28.309 --> 00:21:32.993\nSo if you're in Margins, you've gotta go\nto Layout, and then it's right down here.\n\n410\n00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:35.626\nNow, you do have, you could get to\nthe borders from here, as well.\n\n411\n00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:37.856\nAnd then where do you\nwant this to be applied,\n\n412\n00:21:37.856 --> 00:21:41.392\nwe all know that if it's this point\nforward, it's gonna add a, Zach?\n\n413\n00:21:41.392 --> 00:21:42.231\n&gt;&gt; Section.\n\n414\n00:21:42.231 --> 00:21:45.657\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH], but in this one, we're\njust gonna go with the whole document,\n\n415\n00:21:45.657 --> 00:21:46.987\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; Sectionalizing!\n\n416\n00:21:46.987 --> 00:21:48.139\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n417\n00:21:48.139 --> 00:21:51.384\nIf you do want different line numbers\nto start in different sections,\n\n418\n00:21:51.384 --> 00:21:52.875\nyou would have to add a section.\n\n419\n00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:53.667\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n420\n00:21:53.667 --> 00:21:56.139\n&gt;&gt; From right here,\nwe'll go with this whole document.\n\n421\n00:21:56.139 --> 00:22:00.222\nAnd I'm gonna come into line numbers,\nand then I can add my line numbers.\n\n422\n00:22:00.222 --> 00:22:04.721\nNow the cool thing is, what you want\nit to start at, one sounds logical.\n\n423\n00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:07.637\nBut there might be reasons why you would\nwant to start somewhere different.\n\n424\n00:22:07.637 --> 00:22:10.958\nEspecially since I'm\nstarting the whole document,\n\n425\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:14.656\nmaybe Alice in Wonderland right\nout here in the subtitles.\n\n426\n00:22:14.656 --> 00:22:18.265\nMaybe I don't want that to be numbered, so\n\n427\n00:22:18.265 --> 00:22:23.297\nwe could start it somewhere else,\nfor different reasons.\n\n428\n00:22:23.297 --> 00:22:28.731\nThis is where it's aligned, so\nnotice like how far away from the text,\n\n429\n00:22:28.731 --> 00:22:31.185\nI'm just gonna go Auto for now.\n\n430\n00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:35.412\nDo you want it to count every line or\nevery five lines, every ten lines?\n\n431\n00:22:35.412 --> 00:22:39.782\nSo then we'd just be like one,\nten, 20, 30.\n\n432\n00:22:39.782 --> 00:22:43.068\nRestart at each page,\nthat's a key nice option,\n\n433\n00:22:43.068 --> 00:22:47.694\ncuz maybe on a script you need to have,\ngo to page six and read line two.\n\n434\n00:22:47.694 --> 00:22:51.917\nThat might be nice, instead of, go and\nread line 55, well, what page is that on?\n\n435\n00:22:51.917 --> 00:22:53.220\nThat might be a reason why.\n\n436\n00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.666\nAnd then if you had sections,\ndo you want to restart at every section?\n\n437\n00:22:56.666 --> 00:23:01.175\nOr do you want to just continuously\ngo throughout the entire document?\n\n438\n00:23:01.175 --> 00:23:04.485\nLet's choose that, click OK,\nand then, there you go.\n\n439\n00:23:04.485 --> 00:23:07.126\nLet's zoom in,\nI always go the wrong way and it-\n\n440\n00:23:07.126 --> 00:23:08.157\n&gt;&gt; Zoom it!\n\n441\n00:23:08.157 --> 00:23:09.438\n&gt;&gt; Numbers the lines.\n\n442\n00:23:09.438 --> 00:23:15.223\nKeeping on going, but I can always come\nback and change that, if I wanted to.\n\n443\n00:23:15.223 --> 00:23:19.385\nGo to Document, go to Line Numbers,\nrestart at every page just so\n\n444\n00:23:19.385 --> 00:23:21.818\nwe can see a little bit of difference.\n\n445\n00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:26.996\nLet's do one more thing,\nlet's go ahead and do increments by five.\n\n446\n00:23:26.996 --> 00:23:31.423\n&gt;&gt; Okay, click OK, and there you go,\nnow there's line five, ten, fifteen.\n\n447\n00:23:31.423 --> 00:23:36.734\nSo you get kind of a nice little point of\nwhere you want your line numbers to show.\n\n448\n00:23:36.734 --> 00:23:41.858\nWhat iteration, how to renumber on\neach page, and so on and so forth.\n\n449\n00:23:41.858 --> 00:23:42.746\n&gt;&gt; Brilliant.\n\n450\n00:23:42.746 --> 00:23:46.652\n&gt;&gt; That's about it for\nthe decorations and everything, well,\n\n451\n00:23:46.652 --> 00:23:50.191\npretty much everything you\ncan do with the page layout.\n\n452\n00:23:50.191 --> 00:23:55.313\nLaying out our pages and\nthe flow of our document in our sections,\n\n453\n00:23:55.313 --> 00:23:58.122\nI keep saying sections in a series.\n\n454\n00:23:58.122 --> 00:24:03.225\nOne little note on the line numbers,\nand I have a link in the show notes for\n\n455\n00:24:03.225 --> 00:24:06.331\nit, it's just how it's counting things.\n\n456\n00:24:06.331 --> 00:24:10.182\nIt says a table is counted as one line,\na figure is counted as a line,\n\n457\n00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:14.187\na text box is one line, even if you\nhave multiple lines in the text box.\n\n458\n00:24:14.187 --> 00:24:15.797\nYou're like, what are those things?\n\n459\n00:24:15.797 --> 00:24:19.743\nThose are things we're going to cover\nin the advanced word series, but\n\n460\n00:24:19.743 --> 00:24:21.070\njust letting you know.\n\n461\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.829\nIf you have those elements,\n\n462\n00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:26.727\nhow line numbers are going to\ntreat those different elements.\n\n463\n00:24:26.727 --> 00:24:30.969\nSo and I believe,\nat this point in the recording,\n\n464\n00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:33.848\n[LAUGH] I'm done with-\n&gt;&gt;
