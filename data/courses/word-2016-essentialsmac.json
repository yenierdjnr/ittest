00:00:13.545\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.217\nwe're going to be reviewing\nwhat exactly is in this series.\n\n5\n00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:21.347\nWho is our target audience and who should\nbe watching this, any prerequisites that\n\n6\n00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:25.800\nwe need to know before we get started,\nand a little extra tidbits along the way.\n\n7\n00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.718\nSo what are we covering in this series?\n\n8\n00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:31.186\nThis is broken up into three main topics.\n\n9\n00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:34.800\nWe have Introduction,\nText Formatting and Page Layout.\n\n10\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.369\nIn the introduction, well,\nit's an introduction to Word.\n\n11\n00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.240\nWe get started with what is Word?\n\n12\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.350\nWhat about the interface of Word?\n\n13\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.560\nWe know where we're going so\nit's always important to understand.\n\n14\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.904\nWhen I say go to the ribbon,\nyou know where the ribbon is.\n\n15\n00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:52.270\nOr look at the status bar,\nthe status bar is down at the bottom.\n\n16\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.909\nWe talk about the interface\nof the Word environment.\n\n17\n00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.070\nThen we also get into\nnavigating a Word document.\n\n18\n00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.398\nDo you know that Ctrl-Home will always\ntake you to the very beginning of your\n\n19\n00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:03.923\ndocument?\n\n20\n00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:06.883\nWe go over that and\na lot of other cool tips and\n\n21\n00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:10.563\ntricks of getting around\na document to make it easier,\n\n22\n00:01:10.563 --> 00:01:15.299\nto be a little bit more efficient and\nfaster with typing up a document.\n\n23\n00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.794\nWe're gonna be selecting text.\n\n24\n00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:19.580\nYou think, that's just click,\nhold and drag, right?\n\n25\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.475\nThere's a lot of cool shortcuts that we\ncan do to make you more efficient there\n\n26\n00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:25.994\nwhen selecting a text.\n\n27\n00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:30.010\nWe go over the different auto-correct and\nthe proofing.\n\n28\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.636\nWe also talk about the all important cut,\ncopy and paste, and\n\n29\n00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.671\nknowing about our paste options.\n\n30\n00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.867\nAnd then Find and replace and some\ndifferent things within Find and replace\n\n31\n00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:44.680\nwith the finding special characters and\nhow that can really benefit you.\n\n32\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.848\nThen we move into formatting your text.\n\n33\n00:01:46.848 --> 00:01:51.280\nHow do you make things look bigger,\nbolder, different colors, different fonts?\n\n34\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.886\nSo we go into the world of character\nformatting and paragraph formatting.\n\n35\n00:01:55.886 --> 00:02:00.168\nWe also talk about formatting text\nin lists, either a bulleted list or\n\n36\n00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:01.901\na numbered list.\n\n37\n00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.908\nTabs, I love some tabs.\n\n38\n00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:07.287\nIn tab stops,\nwe learned about left inline tab stops,\n\n39\n00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:11.660\ncenter inline tab stops, what is a leader,\nall of those fun things.\n\n40\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.419\nAnd then my all-time favorite\nwhich would be styles.\n\n41\n00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:20.568\nWe introduced what is a style, why you\nwant to use them, how important they are,\n\n42\n00:02:20.568 --> 00:02:26.110\nand actually really how easy they\nare to implement into your document.\n\n43\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.454\nThen we end with our topic of page layout.\n\n44\n00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:32.050\nThis would be how the text\nflows within your document.\n\n45\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.755\nHow do you do the different pagination,\nand\n\n46\n00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:37.911\nreally what they normally\nwould say is page setup.\n\n47\n00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:42.560\nThings like margins,\nour breaks, our keep options.\n\n48\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.496\nWhat is a widow and orphan control?\n\n49\n00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.750\nWe have section breaks.\n\n50\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.378\nSections are so important in a document,\n\n51\n00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:54.197\nunderstanding them can just open up\na whole new world of how you can use Word.\n\n52\n00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:55.857\nWe talk about columns,\n\n53\n00:02:55.857 --> 00:03:00.910\nwe insert some blank cover pages\nwhich are really easy to do.\n\n54\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.951\nAnd then we talk about our headers and\nfooters within our margins, and\n\n55\n00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.606\nhow we can add page numbers.\n\n56\n00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:09.169\nThat can always be a little tricky,\nso we go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.310\ndedicated an entire episode to that.\n\n58\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.835\nAnd then we end on some decoration.\n\n59\n00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:17.996\nAdding some borders and some shading,\nand some different watermarks and\n\n60\n00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:19.130\nthings like that.\n\n61\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.615\nSo that would be the end\nof that particular topic.\n\n62\n00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:26.526\nNow, that's the wrong way,\nhow about we go this way?\n\n63\n00:03:26.526 --> 00:03:31.390\n[LAUGH] Our target audience, man,\nI'm getting all tripped up here.\n\n64\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.262\nAll Office users, now that means Office\nwith a capital O, as in the Office Suite.\n\n65\n00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:41.980\nNot necessarily that you\nwork in a physical office.\n\n66\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.484\nWhich maybe a lot of you do, but\nthis could be your small business,\n\n67\n00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:48.128\nhome business, school,\nwork, whichever way.\n\n68\n00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:49.734\nBut Microsoft Office and\n\n69\n00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:54.290\nWord is one of the main programs\nwithin that particular suite.\n\n70\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.741\nThis is an Essentials course, which\nmeans it starts from the very beginning,\n\n71\n00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.125\nso this would be anybody\nthat is a basic user, and\n\n72\n00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:08.178\nthen may try to get up into an\nintermediate level of understanding Word.\n\n73\n00:04:08.178 --> 00:04:12.844\nThat being said, you do not have\nto have any prior knowledge of\n\n74\n00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:15.553\nWord before starting this course.\n\n75\n00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:18.140\nYou maybe not even know what it does.\n\n76\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.599\nWell, we start from there.\n\n77\n00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.415\nWe talked about, what is the Enter key?\n\n78\n00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:23.020\nLike, really we're gonna\ntalk about the Enter key?\n\n79\n00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.339\nYou'll be surprised.\n\n80\n00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:29.645\nAnd really some other tricks, like if you\nhold Command and Enter what does that do?\n\n81\n00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:34.165\nAnd just I mean some basic understanding\nof your MAC operating systems is going\n\n82\n00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:35.337\nto be very helpful.\n\n83\n00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:40.947\nUnderstand that we find, we do cover some\nof those basics within the introduction\n\n84\n00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:45.848\nof just understanding, how to do\na File New, how to close the program.\n\n85\n00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:50.039\nAnd if you have any familiarity\nwith other Office products,\n\n86\n00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.420\nthat would be helpful for\nyou getting into Word.\n\n87\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.011\nIn these series, or\nin these episodes, we have files and\n\n88\n00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:01.493\nnotes that are for each episode.\n\n89\n00:05:01.493 --> 00:05:05.368\nThose are my notes that I use to help\nguide us along within the episode, and\n\n90\n00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:07.350\nthose are available to you.\n\n91\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.017\nAnd more often than not, there is a file,\na Word file that we're using for\n\n92\n00:05:12.017 --> 00:05:15.646\ndemonstration purposes, and\nthat is available to you.\n\n93\n00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:19.000\nNow you can download all of them for\nthe entire series right\n\n94\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.770\nhere in this course overview or\nthey are available on individual episodes.\n\n95\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.811\nAnd if for any reason we miss something,\nmaybe it's the wrong file,\n\n96\n00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:29.074\nit's attached to the wrong episode,\nlet us know.\n\n97\n00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:31.579\nContact us and we'll go ahead and\nget that fixed.\n\n98\n00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.570\nHere's some extra tidbits to end this\noverview is that there are always\n\n99\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.115\nmultiple options to do things in Word.\n\n100\n00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:43.611\nAnd I might cover three of them,\nand not cover the other two.\n\n101\n00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:45.970\nAnd you're like,\nwell I know you could do it this way.\n\n102\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.540\nTotally fine.\n\n103\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.332\nThere's many,\nmany options of how to use Word and\n\n104\n00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:51.869\nthe different commands that are available.\n\n105\n00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:53.701\nAnd really in any Office product.\n\n106\n00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:54.981\nUpdates.\n\n107\n00:05:54.981 --> 00:05:57.198\nUpdates do happen.\n\n108\n00:05:57.198 --> 00:06:01.929\nAnd that's where you might have,\nthere might be a major update that\n\n109\n00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:05.415\nhas happened with\nthe Office Suite that makes my,\n\n110\n00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:09.540\nat this time of recording,\nWord different than yours.\n\n111\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.523\nSo just be aware of that, and it will\nchange things in there from time to time.\n\n112\n00:06:14.523 --> 00:06:17.961\nAnd in any of your Office products,\nif you go to the Help menu,\n\n113\n00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.120\nthere is an option for check for updates.\n\n114\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.286\nAnd it will run to see if you need\nupdates and then go ahead and install.\n\n115\n00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:29.295\nA lot of times, if you have your\npreferences in the auto-update to\n\n116\n00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:32.374\ndo automatically,\nit will a lot of times prompt you\n\n117\n00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:37.450\nmaybe when you open one of your Office\nproducts to say Hey, there's an update.\n\n118\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.587\nAnd you can go ahead and run that.\n\n119\n00:06:39.587 --> 00:06:45.647\nAnd that's also where you can check your\ndifferent versions in your Word menu.\n\n120\n00:06:45.647 --> 00:06:47.754\nAnd I cover that in\nthe introduction to Word and\n\n121\n00:06:47.754 --> 00:06:49.980\nshowing you where you can go ahead and\nfind that.\n\n122\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.815\nThere's always lots of answers online,\nsearching for\n\n123\n00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:59.990\nanswers either in the Microsoft Help\nfiles or just in what we call the Oracle.\n\n124\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.241\nJust go to any of your\nfavorite search engines and\n\n125\n00:07:03.241 --> 00:07:05.780\njust type in what you want to find.\n\n126\n00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.633\nAnd there's the world of the Internet\nto help find the answers for\n\n127\n00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:11.044\nany of your questions.\n\n128\n00:07:11.044 --> 00:07:15.160\nAnd everybody uses these products for\ndifferent reasons.\n\n129\n00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.794\nThe way I use Word may not be\nthe same as the way you use Word, or\n\n130\n00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:20.521\nthe person down the street.\n\n131\n00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:25.580\nSo everybody has a different way that\nthey function within the product.\n\n132\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.617\nSo just be aware of that, and\neverybody has different reasons for it.\n\n133\n00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.180\nAnd most of all have fun with this.\n\n134\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.803\nI know that it can be really frustrating\nsometimes when you're trying to make Word\n\n135\n00:07:36.803 --> 00:07:37.494\ndo something.\n\n136\n00:07:37.494 --> 00:07:40.990\nIt's just not doing it,\nI've been there, I totally understand.\n\n137\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.531\nIn these episodes we like to keep it\nlight, we like to keep it fun, and\n\n138\n00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:45.214\nmake jokes.\n\n139\n00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:49.222\nAnd try to keep that when\nyou're off on your own and\n\n140\n00:07:49.222 --> 00:07:52.570\nusing Word is just try\nto have fun with it.\n\n141\n00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.038\nAnd so\nI hope to see you in some future episodes,\n\n142\n00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.003\nand let's go
