name is Von Smith, and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:18.320\nwe're going to be reviewing what we\nare doing in our Word 2016 Expert Series.\n\n5\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.986\nSo we're gonna be talking about,\nwell, what are we gonna be talking\n\n6\n00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:25.670\nabout in this series, and\nwhat episodes are we going to be covering?\n\n7\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.703\nWho is our target audience, what should\nyou know before you get started?\n\n8\n00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:34.289\nAnd any other extra information and\ntidbits that I have for you.\n\n9\n00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.470\nSo topics to be covered,\nsome of my favorites in all of Word.\n\n10\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.419\nWell, actually a lot of\nthem are my favorites,\n\n11\n00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:43.830\nI think I said that about every\nsingle one of these things.\n\n12\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.184\nBut long document creation, you have maybe\nmore than 100 pages, maybe 50 pages.\n\n13\n00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:54.162\nSo, there are things you can do with\ncreating a long document, if you really,\n\n14\n00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.770\nreally help,\nthat Word is really good at it.\n\n15\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.935\nSo, we're gonna be talking about\nbookmarks and cross-references.\n\n16\n00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:04.582\nThe things you see in your page that says,\nsee page so on and so forth.\n\n17\n00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:08.166\n[LAUGH] Well, you could go ahead and\nadd that right from within Word with\n\n18\n00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.525\na cross-reference, and\ncreate hyperlinks, super powerful.\n\n19\n00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:15.015\nWe also are going to be generating\na table of contents, and\n\n20\n00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.090\nthen an index that goes in the front and\nback of your book.\n\n21\n00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380\nTable of Contents, really handy and really\neasy, just gotta use those styles and\n\n22\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.110\nuse those heading levels.\n\n23\n00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.350\nAnd the index is just as easy,\nwith just a little bit more work\n\n24\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.530\nwith marking up your entries and\ngenerating that index.\n\n25\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.160\nThe nice thing is, all of these things,\nwhen you start modifying, you can update\n\n26\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.490\nthem really easily, by just updating\nthe fields from this generated content.\n\n27\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.970\nWe'll also be adding footnotes and\nendnotes,\n\n28\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.040\nthose things that I used to struggle\nwith when I was writing term papers.\n\n29\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.145\nAnd those different things in school where\nyou had to get the numbers just right.\n\n30\n00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.820\nWord it makes it so much easier, and\n\n31\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.690\nthen on that same note, generating\na bibliography and citing your works.\n\n32\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.600\nMan, when this came into Word,\nit was of those,\n\n33\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.920\nI really wished they had this when I was\nin high school and writing these papers.\n\n34\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.376\nIt would take those nights\nthat I spent all night crying,\n\n35\n00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:13.192\nbecause I couldn't get the typewriter or\nwhatever to work, or\n\n36\n00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:16.166\nmaybe even if it's writing on pen and\npaper.\n\n37\n00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.281\nGoodness gracious, that was a lot of fun.\n\n38\n00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:21.896\nWe're also gonna be talking\nabout master documents, and\n\n39\n00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:26.027\nhow you can create one big document\nwith little subdocuments, and\n\n40\n00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:30.619\nhow they're all connected, so\nit's a really powerful episode as well.\n\n41\n00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.702\nCollaborating, something I\nlove to do with people, so\n\n42\n00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:37.977\nif you work with multiple people on\nrevisions and editing of your documents.\n\n43\n00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:42.420\nHow to implement tracked changes is\ngoing to be really helpful for you.\n\n44\n00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.680\nHow to combine all of those\ntracked changes together, and\n\n45\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.100\nto be able to accept or\n\n46\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.290\nreject some of those changes that people\nhave made will also be part of that.\n\n47\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.450\nWe're gonna be talking about adding\ncomments into your documents, and\n\n48\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.770\nhow you can use those and\nhow to accept or reject, or\n\n49\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.740\ntalk within those comments back and\nforth with your collaborators.\n\n50\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.880\nWe'll also be discussing how you\ncan collaborate in real time online\n\n51\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.075\nthrough Office 365,\nif you have have that capability, and\n\n52\n00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.305\nyou have an Office 365 subscription.\n\n53\n00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:19.365\nAnd they've really come a long way in\nhow you can collaborate in the cloud\n\n54\n00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.045\nto where it's a really, really helpful and\n\n55\n00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:27.855\nefficient way to talk to your different\npeople in where you are working with.\n\n56\n00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:32.125\nSecurity and document properties, another\narea that's really great to know about.\n\n57\n00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.830\nOf all that hidden information\ninto your documents,\n\n58\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.390\nin the document properties, that metadata,\nand how we can use that efficiently.\n\n59\n00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.930\nAnd then document security,\nhow do I make this a true read only file?\n\n60\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.486\nHow do I allow people to\nonly fill in forms and\n\n61\n00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:50.183\nother different types\nof document security,\n\n62\n00:03:50.183 --> 00:03:55.040\nwith adding digital signatures and adding\npasswords, to protect that document?\n\n63\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.467\nAnd then we'll also throw\nin some additional topics,\n\n64\n00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:59.180\nthat's where I put in the forms.\n\n65\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.390\nSomething that Word can do,\nit's actually pretty simple\n\n66\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.020\nonce you know where you can actually find\nthe form fields in that developer tab.\n\n67\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.910\nAnd a few of the other additional topics\nthat we'll be adding throughout time.\n\n68\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.860\nWho is this product, what is this\nshow meant for, who is this for?\n\n69\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.215\nWe have all Office users, now,\nI have Office in capital letter because it\n\n70\n00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:24.162\ndoesn't mean that you're physically\nin an office environment.\n\n71\n00:04:24.162 --> 00:04:28.919\nYou could be an office of one,\nyou could be a school or university, so\n\n72\n00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.678\nit's office with a capital, as in the\nproducts, you are using Microsoft Office.\n\n73\n00:04:34.678 --> 00:04:39.670\nAnd Word, of course, is its flagship\nproduct that many people use.\n\n74\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.310\nAnd I've thrown this,\nintermediate to advanced Word users.\n\n75\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.126\nSo you will need to have a pretty\nsubstantial amount of information or\n\n76\n00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:51.795\nknowledge about Word.\n\n77\n00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:55.110\nNow I've changed this from foundational,\n\n78\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.600\nwhen we did our advanced overview,\nI went to substantial.\n\n79\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.000\nSo, you need to be comfortable\nwithin Word, pretty comfortable,\n\n80\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.570\nto when you know all about styles.\n\n81\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.770\nYou know about sections and\npage layouts, and\n\n82\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.660\nyou know where everything\nis on the ribbon.\n\n83\n00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.240\nSo, some of those things I\nmight start glossing over,\n\n84\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240\nlike selecting ranges of text.\n\n85\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.328\nIt should be, yeah, I know how to do that,\nI know what a style is,\n\n86\n00:05:20.328 --> 00:05:21.370\nI know how to modify it.\n\n87\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.220\nI know what you're talking about when I\ngo into the modify styles dialog box,\n\n88\n00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.820\nso that's why I threw\nthis up to a substantial.\n\n89\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.365\nAnd of course, the Windows operating\nsystem, you do need to know how to\n\n90\n00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:38.700\nwork within Windows, and get to your File\nExplorer, and different things like that.\n\n91\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.128\nAnd, of course, always having familiarity\nwith other Office products is always\n\n92\n00:05:43.128 --> 00:05:46.401\nhelpful, because the options\nare always in the same place,\n\n93\n00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:48.541\nno matter you're using Word or Excel.\n\n94\n00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.628\nSo you're familiar with that and\nyou know where your ribbons are and\n\n95\n00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:53.870\nyou're familiar with that interface.\n\n96\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.210\nEach product does something different, but\n\n97\n00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.360\nsome of those features will overlap\nfrom one product to another.\n\n98\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.242\nAnd then my extras, there's always going\nto be other options on how to do things.\n\n99\n00:06:06.242 --> 00:06:09.634\nI can already tell you I remember\nin the footnotes episode that I\n\n100\n00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:13.987\nwas showing you a little button up on the\nribbon of how you can jump back and forth.\n\n101\n00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:18.360\nWell, you could also right click on it,\nand I actually just didn't show it to\n\n102\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.479\nyou that way,\nI just decided to go through the ribbon.\n\n103\n00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.586\nSo there's always that right clicking or\n\n104\n00:06:23.586 --> 00:06:27.211\nthere's the same button on another\ntab that maybe I haven't covered.\n\n105\n00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:32.459\nSo there's always gonna to be multiple\nways to accomplish the same thing.\n\n106\n00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:36.070\nUpdates happen, we talk about this\na lot throughout our episodes.\n\n107\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.309\nThese products, if you're on an Office\n365 subscription, they do update.\n\n108\n00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:45.648\nAnd if you're on the cycle that updates\nevery month or every four months, you\n\n109\n00:06:45.648 --> 00:06:50.188\nmight see things differently now in your\nOffice environment than the time of this\n\n110\n00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:55.760\nrecording, of where my Office environment\nmight have been on a different update.\n\n111\n00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.459\nSo just know that that will happen, and\na lot of times, your updates are for\n\n112\n00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.648\nthe better, and it adds new features,\nwhich can be really fun.\n\n113\n00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:06.880\nSearching for answers, using the oracle,\nthe oracle as in the internet, and\n\n114\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.333\nyou go out there and\nsearch for your answers.\n\n115\n00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:13.283\nThere are so many different things that\nyou can learn about Word that we can't\n\n116\n00:07:13.283 --> 00:07:14.820\ncover all in these episodes.\n\n117\n00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.290\nI try give you as much as possible, and\nthings that I feel are really helpful and\n\n118\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.877\nimportant.\n\n119\n00:07:18.877 --> 00:07:23.685\nBut you're gonna run into things that are\nkind of weird sometimes, and you need to\n\n120\n00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:28.710\nknow how to fix it, so consulting the\noracle is going to be really important.\n\n121\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.614\nAnd everybody uses Word differently, so\nif we're covering a topic where it's like,\n\n122\n00:07:32.614 --> 00:07:34.913\nI'm never gonna need to\ngenerate a bibliography,\n\n123\n00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.638\nbecause I don't need to cite my work.\n\n124\n00:07:36.638 --> 00:07:41.511\nThat's fine, but you never know when\nyour child, or maybe you niece or\n\n125\n00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:46.242\nnephew, or maybe just a friend,\nis going to be writing a term paper.\n\n126\n00:07:46.242 --> 00:07:48.770\nAnd they need to cite their work,\nand you're like, hey, I know how you\n\n127\n00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.620\ncan actually generate a bibliography,\nand you can pass along that knowledge.\n\n128\n00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.300\nSo just knowing that it can do it\ncan be really helpful for you, or\n\n129\n00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.150\nsomebody else down the line.\n\n130\n00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.258\nAnd of course, having fun,\nI like to have fun in these episodes.\n\n131\n00:08:02.258 --> 00:08:05.222\nI actually try to keep it light and\nkeep it cheery so\n\n132\n00:08:05.222 --> 00:08:08.412\nwhen we're learning about this,\nit is fun to learn.\n\n133\n00:08:08.412 --> 00:08:13.353\nAnd I hope you will enjoy it, and\nthat way, once you learn it, it'll make\n\n134\n00:08:13.353 --> 00:08:18.394\nit to you can have more fun using Word,\ncuz you'll know how to work with it.\n\n135\n00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:22.052\nSo I look forward to seeing you soon,\nand stay around.\n\n136\n00:08:22.052 --> 00:08:26.998\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to another\ngreat episode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:15.330\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, well we are kicking off\n\n5\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.950\nour inaugural episode for our series\non Word 2016, but our expert level.\n\n6\n00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.812\nRight we're taking it up a notch\njust a little bit and joining us\n\n7\n00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:26.750\nback in the studio to help us do that very\nthing, our good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.540\nVonne, welcome back and\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.300\n&gt;&gt; It's fantastic, I'm ready to talk about\none of my favorite subjects in Word,\n\n10\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.770\nwhich is long documents.\n\n11\n00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, we're gonna be\ndoing all sorts of fun things.\n\n12\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.900\nWhat word in the sense that\ncreating a table of contents.\n\n13\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.490\nWe're gonna create an index,\nwe're gonna do a bibliography.\n\n14\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.530\nAnother one of my favorite subjects too.\n\n15\n00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.341\nBecause I struggle with it so much.\n\n16\n00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:48.201\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; This sounds like\n\n17\n00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.648\na school paper all of the sudden.\n\n18\n00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.535\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Totally yeah, and especially for\n\n19\n00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:55.340\nme working in page\nlayouts with a textbook.\n\n20\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.606\nLike I've done all of this to the ninth\ndegree in a sense for an actual textbook\n\n21\n00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:05.940\nthat students use and it's like I've I\nlaid that out, that was pretty cool.\n\n22\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.540\n[LAUGH] So,\nI had a lot of experience with this.\n\n23\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.730\nNow, I was doing it in InDesign, but\nin this sense where InDesign and\n\n24\n00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.650\nWord they can do a lot of\nthe same functionality.\n\n25\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.940\nBut just with any program there's a little\nbit of different flavors here and there.\n\n26\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.620\n&gt;&gt; But being able to pull out\nthings in a table of contents, or\n\n27\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.210\npull out things in an index.\n\n28\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.260\nIs all about creating a longer document.\n\n29\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.280\nYou wouldn't probably wanna do this\nwith a two page report or something.\n\n30\n00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280\nAnd so, that's why we have this as\na section or a topic of long documents.\n\n31\n00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.180\nAnd I wanted to start off\nwith these two topics here.\n\n32\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.610\nBookmarks and cross references because\nas by themselves, they're pretty quick,\n\n33\n00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.240\nit's like this is the bookmark,\nthis is a cross reference, it's done.\n\n34\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.430\nBut, I wanna explain it\na little bit more in depth.\n\n35\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.371\nAnd kinda start that up because everything\nthat we're gonna doing pass this point\n\n36\n00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:00.956\nin our future episodes are going to\nrevolve around these things that you're\n\n37\n00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:03.840\ngoing to see in cross node's and\nin bookmarks.\n\n38\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.960\nSo I figure it's kinda nice\nto put that in a front\n\n39\n00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.170\nRefer back to throughout\nthe different episodes, and\n\n40\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.360\nalso do a little bit of review from\nwhere we were in Word Advanced.\n\n41\n00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.840\nCuz I know not all of you\nwatch these in succession, and\n\n42\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.215\nso maybe you're like I\ndidn't see Word Advanced.\n\n43\n00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:21.360\nSo, go check that out,\nit's pretty cool, but\n\n44\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.140\nI will do a quick synopsis of where\nwe were and where we're going, so.\n\n45\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.118\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n46\n00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:28.720\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n[LAUGH].\n\n47\n00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.790\n&gt;&gt; Where do we go?\n\n48\n00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.326\nI have a file called Bookmarks and\nHyperlinks review, so I'm just gonna open,\n\n49\n00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:38.050\nso there is nothing special really\nabout this document, besides\n\n50\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.675\nit is formatted with some headings cuz we\nknow about how important headings are.\n\n51\n00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:44.675\nAnd throughout this entire,\n\n52\n00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:49.650\nshow this whole series styles are gonna\nbe coming back in full force here.\n\n53\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.380\nSo if you hadn't watched anything about\nstyles definitely check that out.\n\n54\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.160\nWe're actually how about what is centers\nand we've peppered it through everything\n\n55\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.370\nbecause it is so important and how you're\ngoing to be structuring your document.\n\n56\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.980\nAnd if you structure your document\nproperly then all this things we're gonna\n\n57\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.460\nbe doing will become very easy,\neasy for you, or more easy.\n\n58\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm just gonna stop and\n\n59\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.557\nlet's keep on going.\n\n60\n00:03:12.557 --> 00:03:17.460\nOkay [LAUGH] now in our other episodes,\nwe talked about the review pane,\n\n61\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.000\nnot the review pane, I'm sorry,\nthe navigation pane.\n\n62\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.740\nThere's so many panes in Word.\n\n63\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.050\n&gt;&gt; It's full of panes.\n\n64\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.933\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n65\n00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:25.620\n[LAUGH] I know,\nas soon as that came out of my mouth.\n\n66\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.480\n&gt;&gt; You set it right up,\nit was right down the middle.\n\n67\n00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.810\nHow could I not hit it out of the park.\n\n68\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.310\n&gt;&gt; I know and\n\n69\n00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.830\nI'm like it's funny cuz it's like, I know\ncuz I've had those pains too, so [LAUGH].\n\n70\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.500\nBut I'm trying to make it less painful for\nyou.\n\n71\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.680\nWhen we go to the view tab\nwe have our navigation pane,\n\n72\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.760\nand we talked about how cool this is\nbecause if you do have heading levels,\n\n73\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.990\nwhich we have the heading one's and\nheading two's.\n\n74\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.720\nYou can use that as a place to\nkind of jump around your document.\n\n75\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.840\nSo if I wanted to jump down into\nThe Knights, I can go there.\n\n76\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.460\nI can go to the Pig and the Pepper,\nbecause that's a heading too and\n\n77\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.070\nI can use this a kind of\ngo around in my document.\n\n78\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.640\nBecause our headings are our main\nlevels of structuring our document.\n\n79\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.900\nAnd that was really cool.\n\n80\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.940\nThe other thing we went over in\nI believe our word essentials\n\n81\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.490\nwas our go to and different ways to\njump around and that was control G.\n\n82\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.340\nThat's also over here in the home tab\nunder the find and you have go to,\n\n83\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.780\nbecause find, advance find, and\ngo to are all in the same dialog box.\n\n84\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.800\nWe talked about how we could\ngo to a specific page number,\n\n85\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.560\ntype in the page number and go to there.\n\n86\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.868\nWell, this is the place where I wanted to\nkinda get to where, it kinda ties right\n\n87\n00:04:33.868 --> 00:04:37.896\ninto bookmarks and all the the other\nthings that we're gonna be covering.\n\n88\n00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:39.930\nCuz you see like go to what?\n\n89\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.190\nThere's other things besides just a page.\n\n90\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.800\nThere are sections,\nwe've talked about different\n\n91\n00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.860\nsectioning our documents up into\ncontinuous section breaks, and\n\n92\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.740\nnext page breaks because that's where it's\ndesignating different whole sections.\n\n93\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.379\nI don't know how else to say what\na section is besides section.\n\n94\n00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.395\nThere Me and my defining my\nword with the word that it is.\n\n95\n00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:02.078\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:05:02.078 --> 00:05:04.530\n&gt;&gt; Your teachers are shaking their finger\n\n97\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.160\nright now, Von.\n\n98\n00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit's like circular reference in Excel,\n\n99\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.190\nyou're just referring back to yourself.\n\n100\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.250\nI'm pretty good at that.\n\n101\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.782\nSo, but you can see here,\nwe have go to a bookmark.\n\n102\n00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:19.910\nOkay, we have go to a foot note,\nan end note, a comment,\n\n103\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.590\na table, an equation,\nan object, okay, cool.\n\n104\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.430\nSo, there's a lot of different\nthings that we can use in Word to\n\n105\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.339\nmark this specific areas.\n\n106\n00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.975\nAnd so bookmark, a bookmark is it's just\nlike what you think of in real life, in-.\n\n107\n00:05:36.975 --> 00:05:38.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Regular terms where\n\n108\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.510\nif I have a physical book, not a Kindle.\n\n109\n00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.760\nWell, I guess you could\ndo it in Kindle too.\n\n110\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.750\nAnyways, what is it, you put an actual\npiece of paper or something in a book to\n\n111\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.670\nmark the place that you were at, you take\nlike little dog ears on the book and\n\n112\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.340\nthen like this is the spot where I'm at.\n\n113\n00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.270\n&gt;&gt; Your teachers are again\nout there going Von,\n\n114\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.810\nI told you about bending those pages over\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah,\n\n115\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.490\nbecause you always have to turn the books\nin at the end of the semester and\n\n116\n00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.060\nyou had the name right there in\nthe front like who had it before you.\n\n117\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.470\n&gt;&gt; Who destroyed this book\nbasically [INAUDIBLE].\n\n118\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I got Scott's book he had this book he\n\n119\n00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.990\nheld it okay, yep sorry I'm reverting back\nto middle school I always do that too.\n\n120\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.017\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right get away, get away,\n\n121\n00:06:16.017 --> 00:06:20.670\nwelcome to 2017 [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So a bookmark is marking\n\n122\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.680\na specific place within a document\nthat you want to be able to use for\n\n123\n00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.820\nthings like maybe a go to.\n\n124\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.280\nWhat are some other functionalities\nthat we can use in bookmarks?\n\n125\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.430\nWell, we will find those out.\n\n126\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.340\nSo we also talked about using\nbookmarks with hyperlinks.\n\n127\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.330\nNow, hyperlinks, we're making\na link out of some type of element,\n\n128\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.400\nwhether it be words or you could have\nit be associated with like a picture.\n\n129\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.910\nYou wanna click on a picture.\n\n130\n00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.740\nAnd jump either to a website, or\n\n131\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.730\nsomewhere out externally to another\nfile within your file system.\n\n132\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.950\nWe'd also talk about placing\nhyperlinks within your document.\n\n133\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.700\nSo if I selected this text,\nlike down, down, down and\n\n134\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.520\nI wanted to insert a hyperlink or\njust link they call it.\n\n135\n00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.843\nAnd we go insert link and\nthen it brings me to this dialogue\n\n136\n00:07:12.843 --> 00:07:17.564\nbox where I could go to an existing file,\nor webpage, or place in this document.\n\n137\n00:07:17.564 --> 00:07:23.267\nBut this is where we came to really start\ntalking about bookmarks in the hyperlinks\n\n138\n00:07:23.267 --> 00:07:28.653\nepisode, was that it will jump to\nthe structure level to the heading levels.\n\n139\n00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:33.619\nBut if I wanted to not go to just\nthe heading level I would have to create\n\n140\n00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:38.756\na bookmark, marking a space in my\ndocument for say a hyperlink to go to,\n\n141\n00:07:38.756 --> 00:07:43.039\nokay so that's really all it is,\nbookmarks are like just,\n\n142\n00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.124\nit's almost like sections or\nheadings but not, that's a really-.\n\n143\n00:07:48.124 --> 00:07:49.412\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Good description too, isn't it?\n\n144\n00:07:49.412 --> 00:07:52.961\n&gt;&gt; You really cleared things up for me,\nVonne, I really appreciate it [LAUGH].\n\n145\n00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:55.764\n&gt;&gt; Trying to equate it to different\nthingsand it's like yeah, that's-\n\n146\n00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:56.553\n&gt;&gt; That's hard to do.\n\n147\n00:07:56.553 --> 00:08:02.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Well we're gonna need to mark\na bookmark, because I want these down,\n\n148\n00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.282\ndown, down, to go to let's say this\nspecific paragraph right here.\n\n149\n00:08:07.282 --> 00:08:11.170\nThe one under the red night that says,\nAlice was not a bit hurt.\n\n150\n00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.990\nSo I wanna mark this.\n\n151\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:18.483\nI just put my cursor where I want it\nto go, and I go to insert bookmark.\n\n152\n00:08:18.483 --> 00:08:22.722\nAnd then I name my bookmark, and\n\n153\n00:08:22.722 --> 00:08:26.806\nwe could say, not hurt Alice.\n\n154\n00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.368\nI feel like Yoda right now.\n\n155\n00:08:28.368 --> 00:08:30.411\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not hurt Alice is,\n\n156\n00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:32.064\nis that how it sounds?\n\n157\n00:08:32.064 --> 00:08:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Putting like object, subject, verb\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n158\n00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.180\nof course we speak in our Yoda voices and\neverything like that.\n\n159\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.280\nSo this is what I wanted to put here.\n\n160\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.690\nBut now notice what I did when I named it.\n\n161\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.732\nI did not put any spaces in there.\n\n162\n00:08:46.732 --> 00:08:50.131\nYou can't put spaces in a bookmark.\n\n163\n00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:53.790\nYou can use uppercase and lowercase,\nso just because I didn't uppercase any\n\n164\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.614\nletters that's not really part\nof the naming prevention.\n\n165\n00:08:56.614 --> 00:08:58.600\nBut don't put spaces.\n\n166\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.260\nSo underscores are always good, and\nactually if you don't conform to\n\n167\n00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.060\nthe naming convention when you click\nthe Add, it will give you a warning.\n\n168\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.960\nIt's like nope, can't do that.\n\n169\n00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.222\nSo when I go ahead and click Add,\nlet me zoom out again.\n\n170\n00:09:11.222 --> 00:09:16.027\nI went ahead and\nadded that bookmark right there, so\n\n171\n00:09:16.027 --> 00:09:19.752\nnow I've put a marker at this position.\n\n172\n00:09:19.752 --> 00:09:24.648\nSo now using it in conjunction with\na hyperlink for this example that I'm\n\n173\n00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:29.641\ndoing as a review, I can now say insert\na hyperlink within this document.\n\n174\n00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:34.081\nAnd I want it to go to a specific\nbookmark within my file,\n\n175\n00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:37.021\nand now I can get that control click.\n\n176\n00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:39.366\nAnd it does have that blue and underline,\n\n177\n00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:43.320\nbecause that's just formatting that\nhyperlinks will do by default.\n\n178\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.750\nI hold my control key,\nI get the little finger,\n\n179\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.250\ncuz when you get the finger\nyou're going somewhere.\n\n180\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In Word [LAUGH]\n\n181\n00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.608\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean you see the same thing in\n\n182\n00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:52.470\nwebsites, right?\n\n183\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.870\nSo it's giving that same kind of look and\nfeel, this is a hyperlink.\n\n184\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.160\nAnd you should be used to this if you've\never browsed on a website at all or\n\n185\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.150\non a web browser, which I'm sure most\nof us have done from time to time.\n\n186\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.692\nThis should feel very similar to that.\n\n187\n00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:09.746\n&gt;&gt; Especially since we are online and\nthat's how people find our web shows.\n\n188\n00:10:09.746 --> 00:10:12.619\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So my assumption is good,\n\n189\n00:10:12.619 --> 00:10:13.702\nis what she's saying.\n\n190\n00:10:13.702 --> 00:10:14.715\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n191\n00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:15.526\nMy hypothesis is correct.\n\n192\n00:10:15.526 --> 00:10:17.636\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My hypothesis is correct.\n\n193\n00:10:17.636 --> 00:10:20.805\n&gt;&gt; So I hold my control key down and\nI click, and\n\n194\n00:10:20.805 --> 00:10:24.761\nit goes down to that specific\nplace that I have marked.\n\n195\n00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:25.753\nOkay, perfect.\n\n196\n00:10:25.753 --> 00:10:28.430\nSo now we know that that's\nwhat a bookmark does.\n\n197\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.720\nIt's just us giving some signal to have\nus be able to jump to different places,\n\n198\n00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.240\nwhether we're doing a hyperlink,\ndoing a navigation.\n\n199\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.970\nAnd then when we get\ninto our index episode,\n\n200\n00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.800\nthere's another place where\nbookmarks are going to come back.\n\n201\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.090\nBecause I just clicked my cursor in\nthis paragraph right in the front.\n\n202\n00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.790\nI didn't select anything, and\nI said insert bookmark, perfect.\n\n203\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:57.260\nBut you can also create whole\nsections with a bookmark.\n\n204\n00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.540\nNow we've talked about sectioning the\ndocument where we said in the beginning\n\n205\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.010\nof the episode, the continuous\nsection break to mark that up.\n\n206\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.610\nSo that's why this is like a section.\n\n207\n00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.602\nIf I wanted to have let's\nsay the bishop and the rook,\n\n208\n00:11:14.602 --> 00:11:20.102\nI want that to be one whole area,\nbecause in my index I'm going to wanna say\n\n209\n00:11:20.102 --> 00:11:25.513\nthat when I mark up the bishop as\nan entry that's going to go in the index,\n\n210\n00:11:25.513 --> 00:11:31.422\nI want it to span across this amount of\npages, and then it will show up that way.\n\n211\n00:11:31.422 --> 00:11:36.353\nAnd that's the only way that you\ncan really get a range of pages or\n\n212\n00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:39.470\ncontent to show up in the index that way.\n\n213\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.480\nYou have to create a bookmark first.\n\n214\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.299\nSo we're going to select the text,\nall the way down.\n\n215\n00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:44.812\nThat's all there is?\n\n216\n00:11:44.812 --> 00:11:45.514\nThat's all there is.\n\n217\n00:11:45.514 --> 00:11:47.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought there was more [LAUGH].\n\n218\n00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:52.694\nSo here is my range of text,\nand I will create a bookmark.\n\n219\n00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:56.241\nAnd type in bishop underscore rook, so\n\n220\n00:11:56.241 --> 00:12:00.114\nI know what that is and\nI add it there you go.\n\n221\n00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:05.910\nEven with your show or hide characters on,\nyou're not gonna see the bookmarks.\n\n222\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.040\nThere's no kind of visual indication like,\nstart bookmark, end bookmark, or\n\n223\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.010\nthis is where a bookmark goes.\n\n224\n00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.862\nBut you can always find\na list of your bookmarks.\n\n225\n00:12:15.862 --> 00:12:20.007\nI think the easiest way to do it,\nis do that go to, like the control G.\n\n226\n00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:23.001\nAnd you can see that if I go to what,\nand it says bookmarks,\n\n227\n00:12:23.001 --> 00:12:25.528\nit's gonna name all your\nbookmarks right here.\n\n228\n00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:28.320\nAnd then you can jump around to them, and\n\n229\n00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.900\nyou can see what those\nbookmarks are going to go.\n\n230\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.040\nSo to me that's the easiest place that you\ncan kind of find out where they all go\n\n231\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.290\nto in your documents, and\nhow many bookmarks you have.\n\n232\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.820\nAll right, cool.\n\n233\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.830\nSo that's what any bookmark is all about.\n\n234\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.522\nSo now's let's go on to cross-references.\n\n235\n00:12:47.522 --> 00:12:53.821\nThere's a reason why I wanted to start off\nthis episode with a review of hyperlinks,\n\n236\n00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:57.829\nbecause a cross-reference is,\nit's a hyperlink.\n\n237\n00:12:57.829 --> 00:13:01.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's the same but different.\n\n238\n00:13:01.525 --> 00:13:04.564\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's a ways you can create a link to\n\n239\n00:13:04.564 --> 00:13:08.081\ncross-reference something else in a book.\n\n240\n00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:12.419\nAnd if you've gone through school or\nany type of formal textbook,\n\n241\n00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:14.130\nyou see this all the time.\n\n242\n00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.\nI read a lot of very academic\n\n243\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.620\ntype of books, and\nthey always have either footnotes, or\n\n244\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.230\nif you go to the end of the chapter there\nwill be references there that they make\n\n245\n00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.540\nreference to inside of the book.\n\n246\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.910\nHave a little number and that takes you,\nand lets you know which reference is what.\n\n247\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.580\nWell here inside the electronic\ndocuments and digital documents,\n\n248\n00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.600\nwe can click on that and it will\ntake us to where we wanna go, right?\n\n249\n00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou are throwing in those footnotes and\n\n250\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.530\nend notes in those little symbols.\n\n251\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.561\nYes, that's totally what it is.\n\n252\n00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:45.375\nAnd a cross reference is very similar\nto that, where it's like see,\n\n253\n00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:48.531\nif it's talking about hashtag algorithms.\n\n254\n00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:49.681\nI don't know,\nif it's even that maxed together.\n\n255\n00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:51.118\n&gt;&gt; Hashing, hashing algorithms.\n\n256\n00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:52.826\n&gt;&gt; Hashing, there you go.\nHashing algorithms.\n\n257\n00:13:52.826 --> 00:13:53.796\n[LAUGH] Wow.\n\n258\n00:13:53.796 --> 00:13:56.064\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hashtag algorithms.\n\n259\n00:13:56.064 --> 00:13:57.765\nI've got to see that on paper.\n\n260\n00:13:57.765 --> 00:14:01.644\nAnybody out there's into algorithms,\nI wanna see a hashtag algorithm.\n\n261\n00:14:01.644 --> 00:14:03.018\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Me like,\n\n262\n00:14:03.018 --> 00:14:05.100\nputting together words that I\nbarely know what they mean.\n\n263\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:10.016\nSo maybe you're reading a paragraph\nabout hashing algorithms,\n\n264\n00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.700\nand in parentheses it\nsays see figure 5 dash 6.\n\n265\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.920\nCuz maybe there is a figure or chart, or\n\n266\n00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.830\nsomething like a visual\npicture that you say, okay.\n\n267\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.785\nAnd maybe that's on the next page,\nmaybe that's two paragraphs down.\n\n268\n00:14:23.785 --> 00:14:28.087\nBut it's just giving you a reference\nto say see this particular thing.\n\n269\n00:14:28.087 --> 00:14:31.048\n&gt;&gt; This chunk of information goes\nwith that chunk of information.\n\n270\n00:14:31.048 --> 00:14:31.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd\n\n271\n00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:36.055\na cross-reference could be to a figure,\nit could be to a heading level.\n\n272\n00:14:36.055 --> 00:14:37.937\nNow I'm starting to get back into Word.\n\n273\n00:14:37.937 --> 00:14:44.092\nBut it could also be referring to\na footnote, because see footnote, [SOUND].\n\n274\n00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:48.932\nBecause it is applicable for\nthis paragraph, but the footnote,\n\n275\n00:14:48.932 --> 00:14:51.748\nfootnote is on another paragraph, so\n\n276\n00:14:51.748 --> 00:14:57.120\nyou can't have two footnotes of the same\nnumber going to the same thing.\n\n277\n00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.070\nSo make one a cross-reference and\none a footnote.\n\n278\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.260\nSo different scenarios of how\nyou can use cross-references.\n\n279\n00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.340\nIt really is that parentheses C and\nthen whatever it says after it.\n\n280\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.670\nAnd that's what you can do in Word and\nhave it jump to those different places.\n\n281\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.890\nSo it is a hyperlink, but\na specific hyperlink cuz as we just\n\n282\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.550\nsaw in the insert hyperlink dialog box,\nit only went to headings and a bookmark.\n\n283\n00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.280\nIt didn't say anything about footnotes,\n\n284\n00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.080\nendnotes, figures,\nany of those different things.\n\n285\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.050\nSo that's the difference here.\n\n286\n00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.480\nSo I have an example of some already done,\nand\n\n287\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.130\nthen we'll use that document to also\ninsert some more cross-references, so\n\n288\n00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.760\nwe can at least see it in action and\nsee those dialog boxes.\n\n289\n00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.780\nSo this long document example is where I\n\n290\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.960\nthrew in a couple of elements\nfrom our other shows.\n\n291\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.171\nI put a cover page on here.\n\n292\n00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:56.163\nWe will be seeing in other episodes how\nwe will be inserting a table of contents,\n\n293\n00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:59.752\na table of images that correlate\nwith captioned images.\n\n294\n00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:02.950\nAgain all more stuff\nyou'll see down the road.\n\n295\n00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.720\nSo, this is like a finished example of\neverything we're going to be learning in\n\n296\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.084\nthe long document section.\n\n297\n00:16:08.084 --> 00:16:10.367\nAnd I believe it's on, hello [LAUGH].\n\n298\n00:16:10.367 --> 00:16:13.707\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I believe it's on page three.\n\n299\n00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:14.524\nLook at that cute little piggy.\n\n300\n00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:17.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Scroll on, wow, okay, my mouse is out,\n\n301\n00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.480\ngoing a little bit.\n\n302\n00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.020\nOkay, here we go.\n\n303\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.490\nSo, we have a table.\n\n304\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.970\nThat is referring to\nthe sea turtles of Florida.\n\n305\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.670\nAnd this is a caption by the way and this\nis something you might have seen through\n\n306\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:36.710\ndifferent textbooks as well, whether their\nlabeling any type of graphical element,\n\n307\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.000\nlike a chart, a table, a picture.\n\n308\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.660\nSo, you see this in a lot of\ndifferent textbooks here, and so,\n\n309\n00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.690\nwe have a table of baby sea turtles.\n\n310\n00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.530\nWell, this is actually sea turtles,\nand this is actually a green.\n\n311\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.620\nAnd notice, it says, see image three.\n\n312\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.670\nOkay, well, then,\n\n313\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.080\nthat's giving me that cross reference\nto go ahead and see something.\n\n314\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.540\nNow, if I hover over this, it's also going\nto give me when I hold my control key,\n\n315\n00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.510\nthere I go notice, that it says,\ncontrol click to follow the link, so\n\n316\n00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.150\nlet's do that.\n\n317\n00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.140\nLet's hold the control, let's click it and\n\n318\n00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.200\nit's taken me to, look at that,\nour little baby sea turtles.\n\n319\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.925\nThey're so darn cute, they got little\ngreen shells for bathing suits.\n\n320\n00:17:16.925 --> 00:17:17.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] I can stop right\n\n321\n00:17:17.907 --> 00:17:18.424\nnow, sorry.\n\n322\n00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:20.943\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Vonne has a whole song on sea turtles,\n\n323\n00:17:20.943 --> 00:17:22.055\napparently.\n\n324\n00:17:22.055 --> 00:17:22.605\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:17:22.605 --> 00:17:24.685\n&gt;&gt; There's more verses, so if you want to,\n\n326\n00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:27.605\nyou know, write in and I'll sing the whole\nsong on one of these episodes one of these\n\n327\n00:17:27.605 --> 00:17:30.040\ndays, but\nthis is from growing up in South Florida.\n\n328\n00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.850\nWe had a camp that we would go to\nat the Environmental Study Center,\n\n329\n00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.760\nand we learned about baby sea turtles,\nand how they're so darn cute.\n\n330\n00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.020\n&gt;&gt; You can't help, but love them.\n\n331\n00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.890\n&gt;&gt; And they have little green shells for\nbathing suits,\n\n332\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.560\nand their flippers flap like angel wings.\n\n333\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.261\n&gt;&gt; That is fun.\n\n334\n00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:47.515\n&gt;&gt; Baby sea turtles,\nthey're funny little things.\n\n335\n00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:48.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there's more.\n\n336\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.783\n&gt;&gt; It must have made a real impression on\nyou, cuz you remembered the entire thing.\n\n337\n00:17:52.783 --> 00:17:53.464\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n338\n00:17:53.464 --> 00:17:54.072\nThe whole song.\n\n339\n00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:55.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, everybody is-\n\n340\n00:17:55.385 --> 00:17:56.207\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] sings it every night\n\n341\n00:17:56.207 --> 00:17:58.435\nbefore she-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you went to Smackaway Camp,\n\n342\n00:17:58.435 --> 00:17:59.530\nyou knew about that.\n\n343\n00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.970\nSo, and as, well, also it was\nteaching us about how sea turtles,\n\n344\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.760\nthey go to the light, so that's the bright\nlights, bright lights lead them astray,\n\n345\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.040\nand you wanna turn off the lights and\nhelp them on their way.\n\n346\n00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.964\nOkay, pretty much just sang\nthe whole song [LAUGH].\n\n347\n00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:14.171\n&gt;&gt; You did, you did, I think,\nI know it now [LAUGH].\n\n348\n00:18:14.171 --> 00:18:18.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, this is, sorry, so\nI got all track a little bit there, but\n\n349\n00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.630\nwe are talking about cross\nreferences to this adorable picture.\n\n350\n00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.940\nSo, it was see this particular item.\n\n351\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.210\nAnd I can have it go to any\ndifferent places, so what if\n\n352\n00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:34.120\nI wanted to have a cross reference,\ncuz now is just like how it works.\n\n353\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.290\nHow do I make that happen?\n\n354\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:40.480\nNow, so in this document just to give you\na quick, quick overview, so you can it.\n\n355\n00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.580\nI have a lot of different heading levels\nin here, we have got the TSL cut these\n\n356\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.010\nare things that you see in our show high\nthere is an index marked index entries.\n\n357\n00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:56.180\nSo, I'd like to have a cross reference\ndown to the queen of hearts, cuz\n\n358\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.110\nwe're gonna talk about the queen of hearts\nbut up here on this particular page.\n\n359\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.220\nAnd again, I'm kinda making it up,\n\n360\n00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:08.090\nwe have here we go the white rabbit and\nhe has little kids glove,\n\n361\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.500\nand while he was talking I wanna\nput a cross reference here.\n\n362\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.750\nSo I'm going to find it right about there,\nand I'm going type in, now,\n\n363\n00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.510\nyou're physically have to\ntype in like the parentheses,\n\n364\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.640\ntype in the word See, and then put your\ncursor there, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n365\n00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.230\nclose that parentheses right now,\nso you can.\n\n366\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.390\nLet me zoom in a little bit more.\n\n367\n00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.860\nSo, I have physically typed that in,\n\n368\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.130\nput in my cursor in the place where I\nnow want to insert that cross reference.\n\n369\n00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.500\nWe're going to insert cross reference.\n\n370\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.710\nAnd then here, this is where I can cross\nreference all sorts of different things.\n\n371\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:51.205\nI can cross reference to a heading, to\na bookmark, to a footnote, to an end note.\n\n372\n00:19:51.205 --> 00:19:52.393\nAnd if I choose footnotes,\n\n373\n00:19:52.393 --> 00:19:55.070\nthere are footnotes that\nare created in this document.\n\n374\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.900\nSo, I could say, all right,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n375\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.820\nrefer to the nesting season\nis from March to September.\n\n376\n00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.740\nOr I could go to,\neach contestant was on point.\n\n377\n00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.930\nNot even sure what I was meaning on that\none, cuz I'm making all that up anyways.\n\n378\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.460\nBut you can see I can find all these\ndifferent things that you can create\n\n379\n00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.605\nin a Word Document.\n\n380\n00:20:13.605 --> 00:20:15.328\nAnd I can reference too.\n\n381\n00:20:15.328 --> 00:20:17.915\nI could reference to an image.\n\n382\n00:20:17.915 --> 00:20:18.655\nPerfect, you know what?\n\n383\n00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:20.545\nThere's an image of a white\nrabbit right there.\n\n384\n00:20:20.545 --> 00:20:23.672\nSo, sorry, I switched mid-stream\nabout where we're going.\n\n385\n00:20:23.672 --> 00:20:27.446\nSo, [LAUGH] I just decided that\nwe're going to see the image of\n\n386\n00:20:27.446 --> 00:20:30.415\nthe white rabbit, which is image one.\n\n387\n00:20:30.415 --> 00:20:34.415\nNow, once I've chosen what type\nof thing this is going to,\n\n388\n00:20:34.415 --> 00:20:37.370\nwhich one of those things it is.\n\n389\n00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.910\nHow is it going to be\nentered into the document?\n\n390\n00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.890\nThis is the drop down right here,\ndo I want to enter the entire caption,\n\n391\n00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:49.320\nonly the label on the number, because if I\nsaid, entire caption, it would say figure,\n\n392\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.580\nor sorry, image one white rabbit.\n\n393\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.050\nMaybe I just want it to say see image\none and whatever page number it's on.\n\n394\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.170\nSo, you have these different\noptions depending on the type of\n\n395\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.840\nreference that you're making.\n\n396\n00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.680\nNow, this is of course for an image, but\n\n397\n00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.910\nif I had chose end notes,\nnotice that I have\n\n398\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.890\na different set of options of how that's\ngoing to be entered into the document.\n\n399\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.700\nSo, I'll go back to image and by the way,\nimage if you're dropping this down and\n\n400\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.560\nnot seeing that, that's, because it's\na specific label that I have created for\n\n401\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.350\ncaptions within this document.\n\n402\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.605\nSo, don't freak out if like mine's\nnot showing anything about images,\n\n403\n00:21:26.605 --> 00:21:29.240\ncuz this is my specific file,\nhow I made it.\n\n404\n00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.130\nWatch the captions episode,\nyou'll see what I'm talking about.\n\n405\n00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.150\nSo, then I go with an insert\nonly label and number.\n\n406\n00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:41.650\nI click insert, notice it says right\nthere, see image two, perfect.\n\n407\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.570\nAnd I could keep on going if I wanted to.\n\n408\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.390\nI could hit my space bar, and then,\ninsert something else that's in here,\n\n409\n00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.420\nlike the page number, or the caption text.\n\n410\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.922\nSo, you can have multiple\ninserted information there.\n\n411\n00:21:55.922 --> 00:21:58.813\nYou just have to choose which\none you want it to go to.\n\n412\n00:21:58.813 --> 00:22:03.322\nI'm just gonna keep it right there and\njust say, clothes, and\n\n413\n00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.630\nnow I have created my own cross reference.\n\n414\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.100\nAnd sometimes they are formatted\na little bit differently, so\n\n415\n00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.560\nif you wanted to create your own style,\nmaybe make it italicized,\n\n416\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.130\nmaybe make it a little bit smaller\nas well, create a style, and\n\n417\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.760\ngo ahead and format that, or\napply it to everything else.\n\n418\n00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.850\nAnd so, now, I've got a clickable\nlink that's just gonna go right into,\n\n419\n00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.800\nwell, image two is a cute pig.\n\n420\n00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is not a white rabbit,\n\n421\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.960\nbut you get the idea that\nit's going somewhere [LAUGH].\n\n422\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.840\nAnd the nice thing is,\ncuz I've had people say, well,\n\n423\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.300\nwhy wouldn't I just type that in?\n\n424\n00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.010\nWhy do I have to go through the whole\nthing of put in my cursor where\n\n425\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.870\ninserting that cross\nreference is just text.\n\n426\n00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.410\nYeah, but what if this moves?\n\n427\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:51.190\nWhat if the image one, or two, or\nwhatever I am cross referencing to,\n\n428\n00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.720\nI went ahead ,and put like a whole\nbunch more information in this page,\n\n429\n00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.510\nand it has moved everything down.\n\n430\n00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.470\n&gt;&gt; So,\nif you make some big wholesale changes,\n\n431\n00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.510\nit can really affect doing at the easy way\nother than putting a cross reference in.\n\n432\n00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nbecause if I just said see page two, well,\n\n433\n00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.270\nnow with all my edits, that thing was\non page two is now on page three.\n\n434\n00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.245\nThis, it follows wherever it goes,\nbecause you're\n\n435\n00:23:14.245 --> 00:23:18.515\nidentifying it as that particular element\nthat you want to cross reference to.\n\n436\n00:23:18.515 --> 00:23:20.165\nIt's not just straight text.\n\n437\n00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:23.545\nCuz someone's like I'll just make text and\nmake a hyperlink.\n\n438\n00:23:23.545 --> 00:23:26.585\nNo, use the functionality of\nwhat cross references does for\n\n439\n00:23:26.585 --> 00:23:28.535\nyou, cuz it travels with it.\n\n440\n00:23:28.535 --> 00:23:33.475\nAnd that's really kind of the whole name\nof the game in this whole section of this\n\n441\n00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:39.750\nshow is, the long documents is\nutilizing this, because it does move.\n\n442\n00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.040\nIt's a living document as\nsomebody has said to me before.\n\n443\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.580\nIt's gonna flow.\n\n444\n00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.800\nIf you change it, it will go with it.\n\n445\n00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.370\nSo, you don't have to go back and\nkeep redoing things.\n\n446\n00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:55.230\nJust go ahead and follow the path, and\nit should turn out pretty well for you.\n\n447\n00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:59.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Vonne, I think, you've\ngot us well up to speed when it comes to\n\n448\n00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.930\nthe cross references and also doing-\n&gt;&gt; Bookmarks.\n\n449\n00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Bookmarks, thank you.\n\n450\n00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.745\nThe word was escaping my mind I was\nlooking at my paper to try to find it\n\n451\n00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:09.098\nquickly, but Vonne,\nyou beat me to it thank you so much,\n\n452\n00:24:09.098 --> 00:24:10.688\nthat's why she's such a great host.\n\n453\n00:24:10.688 -->

00:24:18.517\ntrying to bump us up\ninto that expert level.\n\n456\n00:24:18.517 --> 00:24:22.232\nIt's about having a cursory knowledge,\nit's about having that in depth knowledge\n\n457\n00:24:22.232 --> 00:24:24.370\non how it works and\nwhat we can do with it.\n\n458\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.770\nThat being said, it does look like we\nare at the end of our show

another great\nepisode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.090\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.610\nwe're continuing on with our Word 2016\nExpert Level series, that's right.\n\n6\n00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.810\nAnd joining us back in the studio, the\nresident expert herself, Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.382\nVonne, welcome back, so\nglad to have you yet again.\n\n8\n00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:26.790\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you very much,\nalways glad to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.144\nSo we are going to move on to the table\nof contents within our long documents.\n\n10\n00:00:32.144 --> 00:00:36.255\nNow I will say table of contents,\nit's actually really easy, so\n\n11\n00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:39.374\nit's kinda like click, click, done-\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n12\n00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:43.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's nice,\nif you have everything set up right.\n\n13\n00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.924\n[LAUGH] If you're using headings,\nsee, told you-\n\n14\n00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:49.040\n&gt;&gt; The old bait and switch.\n\n15\n00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.713\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n16\n00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:52.115\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see how it works, this one.\n\n17\n00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:56.180\n&gt;&gt; It's easy if you do x, y and z, and\na, b and c, and a couple of l, m, n, o,\n\n18\n00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.045\np's in there.\n\n19\n00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:59.903\nSo that really all you have to do is a and\nb.\n\n20\n00:00:59.903 --> 00:01:00.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n21\n00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is that simple\n&gt;&gt; Like I said, you have to have headings.\n\n22\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.530\nIf you don't have heading levels of\nsome sort, then it doesn't work, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.610\nSo as long as you've got that part, and\nwe've been talking about this through all\n\n24\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.770\nof the Word series, even Essentials,\nand Advanced, and in Expert.\n\n25\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.812\nIt's all of the styles, it's all about\nusing those heading 1s, heading 2s,\n\n26\n00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:27.143\nheading 3s, and being able to\nstructure your document to say this\n\n27\n00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.720\nis particular area,\nthis is covering this topic.\n\n28\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.451\nAnd that's something that I feel, it\nwasn't until I really started getting into\n\n29\n00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:38.840\nWord and other types page layout type\nprograms that I start noticing this all\n\n30\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.160\nover the place, and I think we've just\ntaken it for granted, in a sense.\n\n31\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.750\nWe open a textbook in school and they say,\ngo to this page and look at that,\n\n32\n00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.440\nand read about this chapter or this\nparticular area, everything's headings.\n\n33\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.910\nAnd so, as long as you use that,\nyou'll be okay, so it's one of those,\n\n34\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.510\nonce you start learning it,\nyou start looking at it differently.\n\n35\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.990\nI love looking at pieces of mail,\ncuz my husband works in mailing.\n\n36\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.062\nAnd so we'll sit there and\n\n37\n00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:07.632\nanalyze this, like look at the paper\nthat they've used, look at this insert.\n\n38\n00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:09.692\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of ridiculous, so,\n\n39\n00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:12.600\n[LAUGH] but it's one of those\nthings that if you know it,\n\n40\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.860\nyou look at it a little bit differently,\nso.\n\n41\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhy don't we give you an example.\n\n42\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.780\nI have our long document example that we\nhad used in our episode with the cross\n\n43\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.090\nreferences, and you'll see this\nagain in the index episode.\n\n44\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.520\nSo this is the one that's already done,\nand so right here,\n\n45\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.950\nhere's our table of contents.\n\n46\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.895\nI'll hide the characters, and\nit looks really nice and quick and easy.\n\n47\n00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:39.380\nWe did talk about learning about tab\nleaders in our Word Essentials show,\n\n48\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.780\nbut I'll tell you,\nI didn't have to do any type of tab stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.507\nI didn't format the tab stops\nwith leaders, I just said insert\n\n50\n00:02:46.507 --> 00:02:51.310\ntable of contents, picked a style, and\nit generated this, and it's awesome.\n\n51\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.630\nAnd notice that they're all hyperlinks.\n\n52\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.300\nIf I hold my Ctrl key down, I get that\nfinger, and then I can go ahead and jump\n\n53\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.580\nright on down to the Jack of Hearts, and\nit takes me right to where I need to go.\n\n54\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.430\nSo really handy,\nreally easy to generate because it's\n\n55\n00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.470\npulling out every heading\nlevel that I have.\n\n56\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.060\nSee, down the rabbit hole is a heading 1.\n\n57\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.770\nThe Pig and Pepper, that is a heading 2.\n\n58\n00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.121\nPig Gig, now that's a heading 3, but\nI don't see that in my table of contents.\n\n59\n00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.748\nWell that's just because I chose\nto only show the first two\n\n60\n00:03:29.748 --> 00:03:32.320\nlevels in my table of contents.\n\n61\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.303\nSo Word is saying, hey, I found a heading\n1, hey, I found a heading 2, I'm gonna\n\n62\n00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:42.080\npull out what that heading says and I'm\ngonna tell you what page number it's on,\n\n63\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.560\nand I'm just gonna make it, [SOUND] done.\n\n64\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.356\n&gt;&gt; It's like magic.\n\n65\n00:03:45.356 --> 00:03:45.884\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n66\n00:03:45.884 --> 00:03:47.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's very interesting\n\n67\n00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.190\nthat it can just do that, but\nyou said it only goes to certain levels,\n\n68\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.070\ncan you change the levels\nin which it goes to?\n\n69\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.890\n&gt;&gt; You sure can.\n&gt;&gt; Well how about that.\n\n70\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.680\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n\n71\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.050\n[LAUGH] So\nwhy don't I show you how it works, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.730\nSo this is our example,\nI'll just minimize this for now.\n\n73\n00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.799\nAnd I have a file called TOC and index.\n\n74\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.610\nWhere we're going to generate\nour table of contents and\n\n75\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.990\nour index in the next episode,\nif you're watching in succession.\n\n76\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.320\nRight, so we know that we\nhave our heading levels, and\n\n77\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.110\nthey're all the way down through here,\nthis is pretty much the exact same\n\n78\n00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.980\ndocument, maybe a few things here and\nthere that are a little bit different.\n\n79\n00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.950\nBut the text is pretty much the same\nthat we've been looking for\n\n80\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.430\nthroughout this whole episode, or\nthis whole series, all the way back.\n\n81\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.410\nSo we got that down, I'm just kinda\ngiving you a quick run down so\n\n82\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.930\nyou can see some of the documents,\n\n83\n00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.740\nhopefully you're not getting too\nsick cuz I'm moving this too much.\n\n84\n00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.471\n[LAUGH] All right, okay, close your eyes,\nI'm gonna zoom really quick.\n\n85\n00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:43.094\n[LAUGH] All right, so I'm going to\ngenerate the table of contents.\n\n86\n00:04:43.094 --> 00:04:46.190\nI'm first gonna go ahead\na do a manual page break,\n\n87\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.570\nbecause I want the table of\ncontents to be on its own page.\n\n88\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.490\nAs long as your cursor is at that place,\nthat's where it's gonna go.\n\n89\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.430\nSo, you put it wherever you want, but\n\n90\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.570\nI will do it, Ctrl+Enter,\nto generate that page break.\n\n91\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.349\nNotice right here,\nI'll show the turn, yeah that-\n\n92\n00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:04.068\n&gt;&gt; You can do it, that thing?\n\n93\n00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:05.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can do it, spit it out.\n\n94\n00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.174\n[LAUGH] The show hide characters, and\n\n95\n00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:11.560\nI will hit Enter here\njust to make some space.\n\n96\n00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.507\nI will type in Table of Contents just for\nfun, and I will throw a title on that,\n\n97\n00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:21.822\nand maybe I'll just get rid of that too,\nso there we go.\n\n98\n00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:24.850\n[LAUGH] And Enter one more time, perfect.\n\n99\n00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.570\nGot everything set up for\nme to generate it.\n\n100\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:34.080\nYou go into your References tab, on the\nReferences tab there is Table of Contents.\n\n101\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.380\nRemember I said, it was click, click, go?\n\n102\n00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.900\nYou really could just go ahead and\nclick that and be done, and\n\n103\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.733\nit will pull out automatically, you can\nsee, if you can't read it, it says it will\n\n104\n00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:48.100\npull out all of the text formatted\nwith the headings 1 through 3 styles.\n\n105\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.460\nAnd then that's all you've gotta do.\n\n106\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.467\nBut I do wanna go through the Custom Table\nof Contents dialogue box just so\n\n107\n00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:58.160\nyou can see some of those other\noptions that are available for you.\n\n108\n00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.820\nAnd it gives you a nice\nlittle preview right here\n\n109\n00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.930\nof what it's going to look like.\n\n110\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.050\nAnd it's going to show the page numbers,\ngood.\n\n111\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.900\nIt's gonna write a line of page numbers,\ncool.\n\n112\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.620\nTab leaders, we talked about that.\n\n113\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.074\nWhat type of character do\nyou want to have leading\n\n114\n00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:18.130\nup to where that tab is going to stop and\nput that content?\n\n115\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.584\nSo if you don't want dots, and you want\ndashes, or you want the underscore to go\n\n116\n00:06:22.584 --> 00:06:26.790\nahead and make almost like a little line,\nyou can do that.\n\n117\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.190\nHow is it going to look?\n\n118\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.050\nYou have the format, and this is where\nit has a couple different styles or\n\n119\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.220\ndesigns in here.\n\n120\n00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.940\nAnd we can choose from the Classic,\nwhere it doesn't have the leaders, but\n\n121\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.570\nyou can always put it back in.\n\n122\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.730\nWe have Distinctive, all right?\n\n123\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.290\nWe'll go through a couple more, Modern,\nthat one I'm just not sold on this one,\n\n124\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.820\nfor me, in the way that I\nlike to have things look.\n\n125\n00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.070\nSo I usually go with the Formal,\nthat's the one that kinda speaks to me and\n\n126\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.770\nwhat I like things to look like,\nbut everybody has their choices.\n\n127\n00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.305\n&gt;&gt; This is all artistic\ninterpretation at this point.\n\n128\n00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:02.038\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It totally is.\n\n129\n00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:08.420\n[LAUGH] And what does my eye look\nat what looks nice, so, all right.\n\n130\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.818\nDifferent heading levels,\nso actually what you said,\n\n131\n00:07:10.818 --> 00:07:12.560\nmaybe you have four levels of headings.\n\n132\n00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.100\nMaybe you have five levels of headings,\nso you can pick which ones.\n\n133\n00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.464\nOf course you would have to have things\nformatted with headings 4 and 5 and so\n\n134\n00:07:19.464 --> 00:07:20.320\non and so forth.\n\n135\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.750\n&gt;&gt; So the more levels you get into,\n\n136\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.980\nthe more work you're kinda making for\nyourself.\n\n137\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.790\n&gt;&gt; And it's really just how deep you\nwant to structure your document.\n\n138\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.082\nBecause I've seen plenty of\npublications that have heading 1, 2,\n\n139\n00:07:34.082 --> 00:07:40.130\n3, 4, but it is a structure,\ncuz heading 1 is a subcategory of 1.\n\n140\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.592\nWait, sorry, [SOUND] 2 is a sub of 1,\n\n141\n00:07:44.592 --> 00:07:49.900\n3 would be a sub of 2,\n4 would be a sub of 3.\n\n142\n00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.703\nSo it just depends on\nhow much information-\n\n143\n00:07:52.703 --> 00:07:53.793\n&gt;&gt; So it's all done for\n\n144\n00:07:53.793 --> 00:07:56.807\na purpose of saying,\nwell it really makes sense for\n\n145\n00:07:56.807 --> 00:07:59.259\nme to break this off\ninto its own sub heading.\n\n146\n00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:01.151\nAnd therefore I'm gonna make one for it.\n\n147\n00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:04.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it could be like\nturtles would be heading one.\n\n148\n00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.021\nSea turtles heading two cuz\nthat's a type of turtle.\n\n149\n00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:09.598\nAnd then there is the leatherback and\nthe loggerheads and\n\n150\n00:08:09.598 --> 00:08:12.347\nthen there might be two different\nversions of loggerheads.\n\n151\n00:08:12.347 --> 00:08:14.749\nSo that's how-\n&gt;&gt; I've noticed sea turtles have made\n\n152\n00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:15.838\ntheir way back into our show.\n\n153\n00:08:15.838 --> 00:08:19.331\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I look for things.\n\n154\n00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:20.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's all about animals.\n\n155\n00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.656\nAnd then I, for\nsome reason when I was making this file,\n\n156\n00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:24.349\nI'm like baby sea turtles, how cute.\n\n157\n00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:26.586\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then it just brought me all back.\n\n158\n00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:28.240\nAnd the song, and everything.\n\n159\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.074\nAnd it's something that I kind\nof know a little bit about.\n\n160\n00:08:31.074 --> 00:08:32.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it kind of gives us\na context to work on the show.\n\n161\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Growing up in Florida\nyou went every year to that\n\n162\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.400\nenvironmental studies\ncenter with your school.\n\n163\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.430\nAnd learned all about the sea turtles.\n\n164\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.290\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n165\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.975\n&gt;&gt; That's where I come from.\n\n166\n00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:45.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just talking about headings,\n\n167\n00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:50.638\nnow that we're on the subject a little\nbit, you just don't willy nilly throw in,\n\n168\n00:08:50.638 --> 00:08:53.880\nI'm gonna make that\nlook like heading four.\n\n169\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.130\nI think people sometimes choose\nit just in the way it looks,\n\n170\n00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.230\nlike this is the format that I want.\n\n171\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.900\nBut you really need to\ntry to think about it\n\n172\n00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.690\nin that structure level of not\njust I'm gonna put a heading four.\n\n173\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.240\nAnd then I'll put the heading two\nafter heading four underneath it.\n\n174\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Put some logic into it.\n\n175\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just kind of think\nabout it a little bit, and\n\n176\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.970\nhow you want to arrange and\nstructure your document.\n\n177\n00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.150\nThat's the important part and\nlittle lesson for the day.\n\n178\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.860\nAnd I am going to say,\nchoose the first two heading levels.\n\n179\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.050\nThey are going to have hyperlinks instead\nof page numbers, don't worry about that.\n\n180\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.230\nThat's in the web preview.\n\n181\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.900\nThey will all become hyperlinks\nwithin the document.\n\n182\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.780\nAnd then you just click OK.\n\n183\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.950\nI said, just click, boom.\n\n184\n00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.612\n&gt;&gt; And there's a table of contents.\n\n185\n00:09:41.612 --> 00:09:45.570\nBadda-bing, bada-boom, table of contents,\nright here in our document.\n\n186\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.290\n&gt;&gt; And we're done.\n\n187\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.034\nNo, we're not done.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:48.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's a couple\n\n189\n00:09:48.383 --> 00:09:52.180\nof other options that I wanna show you,\nbut it really is that easy.\n\n190\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.770\nAnd it's pretty cool.\n\n191\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:59.230\nNow as soon as I get a table of contents\nin, there's the thing in my mind like\n\n192\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.990\nwhat if I wanted all of those\nheading ones to be red?\n\n193\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.910\nAnd then all the other ones\nto be indented a little more.\n\n194\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.350\nCuz you wanna style it, and that's usually\nwhat everybody says like, that's great but\n\n195\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.880\nnow I want it to look different.\n\n196\n00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.450\nSo how can I change that?\n\n197\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.180\nThere's two ways,\nthese are all done by styles, so\n\n198\n00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.110\nyou could go into your style inspector.\n\n199\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.020\nGo onto the Apply Styles,\nclick the button.\n\n200\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.984\nCome over here to the side,\nfind the style.\n\n201\n00:10:24.984 --> 00:10:29.080\nAnd then go down into it to\nsee where I can format this.\n\n202\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.280\nTotally fine where we can come and\nmodify it.\n\n203\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.850\nI'm just gonna show you\na little bit quicker way.\n\n204\n00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.980\nI'm gonna close all that out.\n\n205\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.900\nAs long as you select the line of\nthat level, down the rabbit hole, and\n\n206\n00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.080\nI'm going out onto the left hand\nside into the selection area.\n\n207\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.030\nIf I select this, change it to red, notice\nhow all of them change automatically.\n\n208\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.980\nAnd when we talked about doing\nthe headings, you do one and then\n\n209\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.330\nupdate the style to then match everything,\nand then it all goes through that.\n\n210\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.970\nHere you don't event have to really go\nthat deep cuz it's all connected together.\n\n211\n00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:06.000\nSo if I went down into the second level,\nand maybe I'll make that bold, or\n\n212\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.610\nmaybe make it a little bit smaller and\nthen make it not bold.\n\n213\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.030\nYou can see that I can change those\ndifferent things pretty quickly on how\n\n214\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.880\nI want them all to look like.\n\n215\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.270\nSo that's, I feel,\na little bit easier of a way to format\n\n216\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.830\nthese styles that the table\nof contents is utilizing.\n\n217\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.200\nAll right, nice.\n\n218\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.072\nWell, the cool thing is,\nwhat if I start modifying my document?\n\n219\n00:11:30.072 --> 00:11:36.430\nWhat if I came down into here and decided\nthat this Alice was not a bit hurt.\n\n220\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.990\nI wanna make this another heading two.\n\n221\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.882\nAnd this one here and\nhere where Alice began,\n\n222\n00:11:43.882 --> 00:11:47.371\nthat's gonna become a new heading one.\n\n223\n00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:50.493\nJust kind of throwing this in here\nto where I'm changing things,\n\n224\n00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:52.190\nI'm moving things around.\n\n225\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.610\nMaybe I'm gonna move this down into\nthe next page by doing a Ctrl+Enter,\n\n226\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.400\ntotally change stuff.\n\n227\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.473\nCome back into my table of contents,\nthese are all fields,\n\n228\n00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:07.070\nthese are all updatable\nfields that you can update.\n\n229\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.510\nWell, there's my circular again [LAUGH].\n\n230\n00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:13.620\nDo a little lap, come back, around click\nin here, and notice how it all goes grey.\n\n231\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.660\nOkay, that always is an indication\nthat you're in a field.\n\n232\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.617\nYou can right click on this and\nyou can update field.\n\n233\n00:12:20.617 --> 00:12:25.145\nYou could also go back into the references\nand you can see that this is a table,\n\n234\n00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:26.780\ntable of contents.\n\n235\n00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.350\nAnd I click it.\n\n236\n00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.050\nNow this is saying, do you wanna\nupdate the page numbers only or\n\n237\n00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.610\ndo you want to update the entire table?\n\n238\n00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.070\nI normally go with update the entire table\n\n239\n00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.945\neven if I know the only thing that\nis updating is a page number.\n\n240\n00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:41.880\nI just kinda wanna get\nthe whole shebang in there.\n\n241\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.210\nSo I click update entire table, click OK.\n\n242\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.890\nAnd notice you can see there\nis my new heading one,\n\n243\n00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.740\nthere is my new heading two, and\neverything goes ahead and changes.\n\n244\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.360\nIf I delete some text,\nthen that will be changing as well.\n\n245\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.710\nBut just to make sure you always go\nback into the table of contents and\n\n246\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:05.108\nupdate that to reflect any changes\nyou've made while editing the document.\n\n247\n00:13:05.108 --> 00:13:07.275\nSo another one of,\nwhat if I wanted to, and\n\n248\n00:13:07.275 --> 00:13:09.950\nI'm clicking out of\nthe table of contents first.\n\n249\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.470\nWhat if I wanted to change it up and\ndo one of those other styles\n\n250\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.470\nthat I saw in that customize\nthe table of contents?\n\n251\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.970\nI wanna do that modern or the distinctive.\n\n252\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.891\nSo I go back into custom table of\ncontents and it seems like, hm, well,\n\n253\n00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:29.690\nam I going to be entering in another one?\n\n254\n00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.530\nWell, let me show you.\n\n255\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.234\nLet's pick a fancy one, click OK.\n\n256\n00:13:33.234 --> 00:13:35.360\nHere's what I wanted to show you.\n\n257\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.105\nDo you want me to replace\nthis table of contents?\n\n258\n00:13:38.105 --> 00:13:41.940\nCuz you really can't have two table\nof contents in a document, so\n\n259\n00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.220\nyou say Yes, and then boom, it's done.\n\n260\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.150\nSo you just insert it again and\nit replaces the existing one.\n\n261\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.346\nSo that's pretty cool and pretty easy.\n\n262\n00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:52.842\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's very nice cuz\nyou don't have to go back and\n\n263\n00:13:52.842 --> 00:13:54.515\ntry to make changes to your original.\n\n264\n00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:56.476\nAnd then, you know how it is,\nyou start to make a little change here and\n\n265\n00:13:56.476 --> 00:13:57.150\na little change there.\n\n266\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.513\nAnd next thing you know, what started off\nas really cool is now a big old mess.\n\n267\n00:14:00.513 --> 00:14:01.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n268\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.770\nnow it is just like,\nlet's just wholesale change this thing.\n\n269\n00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.030\nYou drop it in and\nthere you go, it's easily done.\n\n270\n00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I will say in some of the\nother things when we start talking about\n\n271\n00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:14.340\nlong documents, it does get\na little more confusing in a sense.\n\n272\n00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.450\nThe table of contents,\nto me I feel it's pretty reliable.\n\n273\n00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.310\nWhen we get into captions\nit's not as reliable, but\n\n274\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.360\nI have a cute little fix in that\nepisode that I can show you.\n\n275\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.640\nThat it's like you kind\nof have to force it.\n\n276\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.060\nAnd sometimes it's like, is this right?\n\n277\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.702\nEspecially if you're working in\na document that's like 150 pages.\n\n278\n00:14:31.702 --> 00:14:34.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is everything updating itself?\n\n279\n00:14:34.682 --> 00:14:35.671\n&gt;&gt; I hope so.\n\n280\n00:14:35.671 --> 00:14:36.403\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess.\n\n281\n00:14:36.403 --> 00:14:40.340\n&gt;&gt; i guess, so\nthis is pretty solid in that sense.\n\n282\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.860\nWell, what if I get in here and realize I\ndon't even want a table contents any more.\n\n283\n00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.780\nI just want this to all go away.\n\n284\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.110\nCuz kinda like I do need to start over for\nwhatever reason.\n\n285\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.840\nIf you come back into, I've clicked into\nit, come back into table of contents, you\n\n286\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.580\ncan see down at the bottom there is remove\ntable of contents and then it goes away.\n\n287\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.596\n&gt;&gt; I feel like one of those models,\nand it's gone, right?\n\n288\n00:15:02.596 --> 00:15:04.087\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ta da, yeah,\n\n289\n00:15:04.087 --> 00:15:08.110\nwe could be like Vanna White and\nstart like, yes, perfect, [LAUGH] awesome.\n\n290\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.300\nSo that's how you can\nremove a table of contents.\n\n291\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.750\nPretty simple.\n\n292\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.680\nUse those heading levels.\n\n293\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.161\nBut what if I didn't use\nthose heading levels?\n\n294\n00:15:15.161 --> 00:15:16.376\nI'm going to not save this.\n\n295\n00:15:17.942 --> 00:15:20.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have an option.\n\n296\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.454\nYes, there it is-\n&gt;&gt; They have not left you\n\n297\n00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:22.087\nwithout a witness.\n\n298\n00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:24.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Actually, I forgot,\n\n299\n00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:29.350\nI've got to pull that file out\nof the Word Expert folder.\n\n300\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.220\nI like to make copies on my desktop\nwhen I'm demonstrating to make sure I'm\n\n301\n00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:32.950\nnot messing up the files.\n\n302\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.090\n&gt;&gt; With the originals, yeah.\n\n303\n00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially since you guys are\nbeing able to follow along with them in\n\n304\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.440\nthese episodes.\n\n305\n00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.720\nLet's go down to the toc custom headings,\nall right.\n\n306\n00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.756\nI normally just stick with heading ones,\nheading twos, use the defaults.\n\n307\n00:15:47.756 --> 00:15:52.747\nAnd then if I want to look different\nthen just modify the style,\n\n308\n00:15:52.747 --> 00:15:54.734\nkeep it as a heading one.\n\n309\n00:15:54.734 --> 00:15:58.762\nMaybe you don't need to do that,\nyou can make your own styles,\n\n310\n00:15:58.762 --> 00:16:02.880\nyou can make your own headings in\nthe way that you want it to look.\n\n311\n00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.096\nSo this down the rabbit hole,\nI've called this pink top.\n\n312\n00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:08.159\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n313\n00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:10.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, doesn't really make much sense.\n\n314\n00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.860\nOkay, what's the top level?\n\n315\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.290\nAnd then I named this purple second,\nthat's not heading one and heading two.\n\n316\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But it goes along the same idea of.\n\n317\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.836\n&gt;&gt; That make sense to you as someone\nwho gets to do that subjectively.\n\n318\n00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:27.197\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and maybe you're in\nan organization that they have\n\n319\n00:16:27.197 --> 00:16:30.421\na whole system,\nthese are what are headings are going to\n\n320\n00:16:30.421 --> 00:16:34.078\nbe even though we don't name them\nheading one and heading two.\n\n321\n00:16:34.078 --> 00:16:38.349\nAnd just to make one other clarification,\nthis particular document,\n\n322\n00:16:38.349 --> 00:16:41.917\nI'm going to come into the style and\nmodify it for a second.\n\n323\n00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:47.990\nSo I wanted to show you that this style is\nbased on no style, this is its own entity.\n\n324\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.070\nCuz a lot times, and\nI've seen this where people say, well,\n\n325\n00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.135\nI didn't have to go in and change the\nthing that I'm gonna show you in a second.\n\n326\n00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:55.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it still sees it as a heading\n\n327\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.520\none, cuz people start with heading one,\nthey select it, they format it.\n\n328\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.940\nAnd then, say, I'm gonna make a new style,\nand then the thing in this dialog box,\n\n329\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.280\nit'll say new style, but\nit says in parentheses, heading one.\n\n330\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.980\nSo it's based off of heading one,\nso it still sees that as like its\n\n331\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.920\nbase foundational level, even though you\nmight not name it anything like that.\n\n332\n00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.090\nIt still remembers it because\nthat's where you started it.\n\n333\n00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:23.440\nSo that's why if you take it and\nbase it off of no style,\n\n334\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.750\nthere's no connection to anything.\n\n335\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.330\nAnd so\nthat's where it's completely independent.\n\n336\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.070\nOkay, so just wanted to clarify\nthat in this particular example.\n\n337\n00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:37.570\nBut if I have headings that I\nhave created and I know, oops.\n\n338\n00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.080\nSorry, I just realized that's why\nyou should always put your show and\n\n339\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.890\nhide characters on there.\n\n340\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.530\nI need to be on this side and hit Enter.\n\n341\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:50.340\nI want to pull out the same styles or same\nheading levels, just named differently.\n\n342\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.900\nGo back into References, go into Table\nof Contents, go down into Custom Table\n\n343\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:01.440\nof Contents, and\ndown here it's the Options button.\n\n344\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.250\nWe didn't go over Options and Modify.\n\n345\n00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.850\nSo if I click on Options,\nnotice here that it does say and\n\n346\n00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.700\nsee it's even pointing right there.\n\n347\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.750\nIt's recognizing that pink top heading,\n\n348\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.320\nit's actually thinking\nthat's it heading one.\n\n349\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.550\nIt sees that almost in the structure.\n\n350\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.620\nI was trying to make it not do this,\nand I.\n\n351\n00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.880\n&gt;&gt; It's just too good at its job.\n\n352\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.100\nIt's all you can do.\n\n353\n00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:24.969\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nWord is too good.\n\n354\n00:18:24.969 --> 00:18:26.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what to say.\n\n355\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.580\nBut you can see that I can\nchoose which heading level or\n\n356\n00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.210\nwhat style that I want\nto pull out of here.\n\n357\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:41.320\nSo I could delete these, scroll on\ndown and then, okay, there's pink top.\n\n358\n00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.860\nSo let's just pretend that\nthat didn't do it by default.\n\n359\n00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Pink top is ToC level one,\n\n360\n00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.120\npurple second is ToC level two, and\n\n361\n00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.130\nthose are the only ones that I\nwanna pull out and then I click OK.\n\n362\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.850\nI can pick which one I want,\nwe'll go with distinctive this time.\n\n363\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:01.400\nAnd then it does it the exact same way,\nyou just have to tell it\n\n364\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.390\nto pick the ones that I used and\nnot anything else.\n\n365\n00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:12.260\nSo that's pretty awesome and\nI really like that option.\n\n366\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like an override command,\nsay, yeah,\n\n367\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.290\nI know you'd normally would do this but.\n\n368\n00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.520\nListen to me [LAUGH].\n\n369\n00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.806\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm doing everything the way I want to do.\n\n370\n00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:21.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So you have to match that.\n\n371\n00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.050\nI don't wanna use your heading ones and\n\n372\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.540\nheading twos but then it's still\ndefaulted to even seeing it that anyways.\n\n373\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:29.605\n&gt;&gt; So you can map your\n\n375\n00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:34.285\ncustom headings into what you want\nyour ToCs, your Table of Contents,\n\n376\n00:19:34.285 --> 00:19:36.706\nto show and that's pretty awesome.\n\n377\n00:19:36.706 --> 00:19:40.070\nSee, that's simple, bada bing, bada boom.\n\n378\n00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.620\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n379\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.202\nI like this one.\n\n380\n00:19:41.202 --> 00:19:44.470\nYou've done a very good job of showing\nus something that's very simple,\n\n381\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.150\nthat we can do very easily inside of Word.\n\n382\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.920\nBut giving us that kind of meat and\npotatoes, what's going on in\n\n383\n00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.340\nthe background, what's happening behind\nthe curtain as it were, so we get a better\n\n384\n00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.530\nsense of how it's doing it and why it's\ndoing it, making us that expert level.\n\n385\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.590\nThat being said, Vonne, looks like\nwe're out of time for this episode,\n\n386\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.640\nwe do thank you for\nshowing us these things.\n\n387\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.590\nWe thank you good folks out there for\nwatching,\n\n388\n00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.980\nhope you have enjoyed this thing and\ncome back for more.\n\n389\n00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.270\nBut that's for this episode,\nlet's go ahead and sign off for\n\n390\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.460\nOffice Pro.TV, I've been your

now.\n\n10\n00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.509\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like your hype man.\n\n11\n00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.804\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, serious like,\n\n12\n00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:31.923\nevery time you introduce me like, yeah,\nI just wanna start like cheering or\n\n13\n00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:32.475\nsomething.\n\n14\n00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.646\n&gt;&gt; You ain't never seen word like\nthis before, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n15\n00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:36.184\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really.\n\n16\n00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:40.281\n[LAUGH] So we're going to create an index.\n\n17\n00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:44.475\nSo we talked about table of contents in\nthe front, now we're going to the back,\n\n18\n00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:47.041\nand we're going to start\nmarking our entries and\n\n19\n00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.145\nhad it generate our table of contents.\n\n20\n00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:50.427\nNo, index.\n\n21\n00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:51.037\n&gt;&gt; Indexes.\n\n22\n00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:53.589\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just flipped them all around.\n\n23\n00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.880\n&gt;&gt; The cousin, right, of the twin brother,\neveryone look at it, some relation.\n\n24\n00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.133\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, they're related somehow but-\n\n25\n00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.269\n&gt;&gt; Mother's brother's,\n\n26\n00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.059\ncousins uncles' friend from the gym.\n\n27\n00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the second cousin twice removed.\n\n28\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That kind of stuff, yes.\n\n29\n00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.190\nSo when look at books, a lot of\ntimes like, if you have some type of\n\n30\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.050\ntextbooks or reference guide you wanna\nsay, hey, I wanna learn about turtles.\n\n31\n00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.100\nSo you go to the back, cuz maybe you\nlook in the table of contents first, and\n\n32\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.190\nyou don't see anything in the table\nof contents that screams out turtles.\n\n33\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.690\nSo you go to the back,\nand you look it up, and\n\n34\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.270\nyou're like, it's on page 25 and\n1 through 100 or whatever.\n\n35\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.421\n1 through 100, that's a lot of pages.\n\n36\n00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:32.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well anyways,\n\n37\n00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:33.019\n&gt;&gt; Man, what a section.\n\n38\n00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:34.478\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, I know.\n\n39\n00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:35.739\n[LAUGH] Hey, it's got a lot to say.\n\n40\n00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:36.273\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n41\n00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:40.395\nthat's a way that you can refer to the\nback and then go to the different pages.\n\n42\n00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:44.859\nAnd then sometimes you see indexes\nthat have one main category and\n\n43\n00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:50.540\nthen subcategories, or what they're going\nto be referred to now as subentries.\n\n44\n00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.370\nSo, actually I have\nan example to get us started.\n\n45\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.418\nWe have our long document example.\n\n46\n00:01:57.418 --> 00:01:59.350\nAnd we will jump into here.\n\n47\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.482\nThis is the one we've been seeing for\na couple episodes, if you're watching.\n\n48\n00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:07.504\nAnd we're gonna scroll\non down to the bottom.\n\n49\n00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:12.510\nAnd there is our index, and\nI will turn this off so you can see it.\n\n50\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.650\nI mean, that's formatted really nicely,\nand didn't have to do much to it.\n\n51\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.002\nThis one, well let me back up, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.030\n[LAUGH] With the table of contents,\nit really was like click,\n\n53\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.760\nclick go once you have the heading levels.\n\n54\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.530\nIndex, it takes a little bit more, and\nyou really do have to plan this out,\n\n55\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.330\nlike what do I want to\nactually show in the index?\n\n56\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.977\nNow this is where if you are the sole\ncreator of this document,\n\n57\n00:02:36.977 --> 00:02:41.483\nyou've typed all of this out,\nyou're gonna know the content really well.\n\n58\n00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:46.051\nBut if you are maybe somebody like me,\nwhere I'm a freelancer,\n\n59\n00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:50.280\nwhere I go ahead and\nbe hired by people to design their work,\n\n60\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.955\nI'm not the author of the book,\nI'm just the graphic designer.\n\n61\n00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:56.736\nSo I don't read everything that I lay out.\n\n62\n00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:58.479\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just like, okay,\n\n63\n00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:02.233\nhere's, there I'm looking more\nof it from a larger standpoint.\n\n64\n00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:03.091\n&gt;&gt; A higher viewpoint.\n\n65\n00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:05.735\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah,\nthe 40,000 view or whatever.\n\n66\n00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:09.718\nI'm looking down and it's like, okay, I\nneed to make sure all the text looks good\n\n67\n00:03:09.718 --> 00:03:12.170\non the page, so\nI don't know the content as well.\n\n68\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.593\nSo, when I created the textbook,\nthey gave me,\n\n69\n00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:19.861\nthese are all of the entries that\nwe want to have in the index.\n\n70\n00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:22.220\nSo they just listed everything out.\n\n71\n00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.760\nSo it was my job to go\ninto the document and\n\n72\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.230\nmark those and then generate the index.\n\n73\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.430\nSo there's twofold.\n\n74\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.950\nYou have to mark the index entries, and\nonce you have them all marked, the index\n\n75\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.788\nto generate it or create it, you just say\npull out all the things that I marked.\n\n76\n00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:44.360\nIt puts the little letters, and\nthen it puts the page references and\n\n77\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.580\neverything, and so,\nthat's all generated by word.\n\n78\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.820\nSo that's a two step process, mark it,\ncreat it, and that's pretty cool.\n\n79\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.290\nAnd, then these examples you can see that,\nyou have Chess and\n\n80\n00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.492\nthen under that you have the Bishop and\nthe Rook, or, and\n\n81\n00:03:59.492 --> 00:04:02.261\nthat's where you have\nthe different ones here.\n\n82\n00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.110\nNow, this is a little bit different.\n\n83\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.090\nNotice it says Knight,\nRed and Knight, White.\n\n84\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.730\nI've seen index entries both ways.\n\n85\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.600\nSo I mean, it could have had\nthe category just like Chess, but\n\n86\n00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.600\nit's really more like, how do you\nwant this to look as the index or\n\n87\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.020\nthe generated index rather\nthan what is actually marked?\n\n88\n00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.780\nSometimes, they don't always match.\n\n89\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.960\nYou might mark a word that\ndoesn't even have the same\n\n90\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.750\nstarting letter as what\nyou've actually marked.\n\n91\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.640\nSo you have control over all of this.\n\n92\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.490\nAnd then this one right over here, The\nMock Turtle's story, it has 3 through 5.\n\n93\n00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.740\nThat's one that we're going\nto talk about page ranges and\n\n94\n00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.650\nthat's the other part where\nyou have to have a bookmark.\n\n95\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.630\nSo, we will go through all of those\nsteps together in another document.\n\n96\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.634\nWe will go to our TOC and index.docx.\n\n97\n00:04:56.634 --> 00:04:58.210\nGet it all started.\n\n98\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.070\nAnd so we're gonna start\nmarking up a couple entries.\n\n99\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.460\nAnd I have a list over here\nthat I'm gonna be referring to,\n\n100\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.527\nto make sure I know where we're going, and\nwe're gonna mark up this entry called bat.\n\n101\n00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:12.404\nAll right, so\nthis is the word that I would like to say,\n\n102\n00:05:12.404 --> 00:05:14.820\nI think this should be an index entry.\n\n103\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.410\nAnywhere you see the word bats word,\nit's like I'm telling Word to do this.\n\n104\n00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.562\nMark this, where do we go?\n\n105\n00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:23.900\nWe go to References.\n\n106\n00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.418\nWe go to Mark Entry, we click that, and it\nopens up the Mark Index Entry dialog box.\n\n107\n00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:36.332\nSo you could see that I can say,\nwhat is the entry, what is the subentry?\n\n108\n00:05:36.332 --> 00:05:40.420\nI will demonstrate that when we get\ninto the cats, you'll see that.\n\n109\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.191\nI can do a cross reference.\n\n110\n00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:44.916\nNow, this isn't necessary like a hyphen.\n\n111\n00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:48.210\nWe do have a whole episode\nabout cross references.\n\n112\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.410\nThis is really just in the index entry,\nunder this particular letter under b.\n\n113\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.787\nSo if I have letter b, bat,\nbut when you have bat,\n\n114\n00:05:57.787 --> 00:06:01.868\nit might just say,\nc flying scary creatures.\n\n115\n00:06:01.868 --> 00:06:04.713\n[LAUGH] So\nyou need to go over to the f, and\n\n116\n00:06:04.713 --> 00:06:08.953\nthen find the flying creature and\nthen find where that is.\n\n117\n00:06:08.953 --> 00:06:12.636\nSo it's really just gonna\ngenerate the text for you, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:12.636 --> 00:06:14.315\nAnd then the page range.\n\n119\n00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:19.320\nNotice that it does show bookmarks, you\nwould have to generate a bookmark first,\n\n120\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.090\nbefore you make that\nrange of where you want.\n\n121\n00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.050\nYou can't just type 3-5,\nit won't let you do that,\n\n122\n00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.970\nit will actually give you a warning,\nsaying, no, you can't do that.\n\n123\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.370\nSo I would like to have it as bat but\n\n124\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.500\nin the index,\nI would like it to be capitalized.\n\n125\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.970\nAnd it's lowercase,\nI'm marking all lowercase entries of bat.\n\n126\n00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.135\nThat's I'm emphasizing that right\nthere because, whatever you choose,\n\n127\n00:06:45.135 --> 00:06:48.660\nit will read verbatim with\nthe capitalization and everything.\n\n128\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.000\nIf you have bat and bats,\nit won't mark bats.\n\n129\n00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.670\nOkay, so you have to do both of them.\n\n130\n00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:02.090\nUppercase bat, lowercase bat, bats with\nan s, you would mark each one of them but\n\n131\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.105\nput the main entry as bat, so\nyou would have to do it exact like that.\n\n132\n00:07:07.105 --> 00:07:12.775\nNow down here, you have okay,\nnow do you want to mark this entry?\n\n133\n00:07:12.775 --> 00:07:13.875\nYes, I would.\n\n134\n00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:17.195\nSo I will go ahead, and I think it,\nwhy is it not me Mark All?\n\n135\n00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:20.525\nYou know what, there we go, bat, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:24.065\nI think it clicked off of that and\nthat's why it didn't like it,\n\n137\n00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:27.230\nbecause I was seeing down\nhere Mark All was grey.\n\n138\n00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.113\nSo, it somehow just got\na little off kilter.\n\n139\n00:07:30.113 --> 00:07:31.620\nThat's okay, we'll put it back on there.\n\n140\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.170\nIt happens, it totally happens.\n\n141\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.618\nI do it all the time.\n\n142\n00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:38.730\n[LAUGH] So,\nI will mark all of the instances.\n\n143\n00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:44.400\nAnd then you can see that, I'm gonna close\nthis, it put in the entry and notice that\n\n144\n00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.380\nour show hide characters have come on,\nand we have it as the squiggly brackets.\n\n145\n00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.355\nThat's what I call them, and then the XE.\n\n146\n00:07:53.355 --> 00:07:56.685\nSo that is our index entry,\nand then it is bat.\n\n147\n00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.044\nAnd I'm going to scroll out of this,\nso you can see it.\n\n148\n00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:00.878\n&gt;&gt; Those are technical\ncalled curly braces.\n\n149\n00:08:00.878 --> 00:08:04.705\n[LAUGH] Curly but yeah I do-\n&gt;&gt; My contribution to the show.\n\n150\n00:08:04.705 --> 00:08:09.453\n&gt;&gt; When I teach CSS I would always say\nopen squiggly then close squiggly cuz it\n\n151\n00:08:09.453 --> 00:08:10.993\nlooks like a squiggly.\n\n152\n00:08:10.993 --> 00:08:12.583\n&gt;&gt; And you know what,\nvery descriptive though.\n\n153\n00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:13.518\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you know.\n&gt;&gt; That would work,\n\n154\n00:08:13.518 --> 00:08:15.097\nI would know exactly what\nyou were talking about.\n\n155\n00:08:15.097 --> 00:08:17.666\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I kinda call it like I see it.\n\n156\n00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:20.380\nYeah, like the dialog box launcher button.\n\n157\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.492\nNo, it's just the button that\nlooks like there's more options.\n\n158\n00:08:22.492 --> 00:08:23.516\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's the more options button.\n\n159\n00:08:23.516 --> 00:08:24.455\n&gt;&gt; The more options button.\n\n160\n00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:28.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, and then you're\njust gonna go through your document and\n\n161\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.393\nkeep on going.\n\n162\n00:08:29.393 --> 00:08:31.921\nSo let's go down to page two.\n\n163\n00:08:31.921 --> 00:08:34.582\nSo here we have the baby grunted again, so\n\n164\n00:08:34.582 --> 00:08:38.321\nmaybe this is where I'd like\npeople to go to find the baby.\n\n165\n00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:40.350\nSo I'll select the word baby.\n\n166\n00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.805\nI'll go into Mark Entry, and in this\ninstance I don't wanna do all the entries,\n\n167\n00:08:44.805 --> 00:08:46.740\ncuz it's just this one section.\n\n168\n00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.850\nSo I can just say Mark Singularly.\n\n169\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.180\nI will capitalize the word Baby and\nclick Mark.\n\n170\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.982\nAnd then there you go,\nit only marks just one part.\n\n171\n00:08:55.982 --> 00:08:59.920\nOkay so let's get into a range\nlike the Mock Turtle story.\n\n172\n00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.510\nI want this whole part,\nfrom here down through,\n\n173\n00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.590\nputting my cursor there,\ndown through here.\n\n174\n00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.320\nSo I will hold my Shift key,\nclick the end.\n\n175\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.807\nSo that was to arrange\nselection of all of this texts.\n\n176\n00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:16.293\nSo I've got my selection ready.\n\n177\n00:09:16.293 --> 00:09:18.860\nI need to make a bookmark first.\n\n178\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.517\nThat's back over in the Insert menu.\n\n179\n00:09:21.517 --> 00:09:25.965\nWe go to Bookmark and\nI will name this turtle_story.\n\n180\n00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.128\nWe know that we can't have any spaces\nwhen we name our bookmark, and\n\n181\n00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:30.440\nwe will add that.\n\n182\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.701\nSo I'm making my little\nmark of this section here.\n\n183\n00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:42.585\nBut now this is the entry that I\nwant to be generated into my index.\n\n184\n00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:46.570\nSo select my text,\ncome over into the references,\n\n185\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.358\ngo to Mark Entry, it pulls this up.\n\n186\n00:09:49.358 --> 00:09:53.217\nNow I don't want the word the cuz there's\nprobably gonna be a lot of entries there.\n\n187\n00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:56.524\nYou don't want the article there,\nso I'm going to delete this.\n\n188\n00:09:56.524 --> 00:10:00.997\nSo it'll come under the m in the index so\nthat's great.\n\n189\n00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:04.271\nI don't want this current page,\nI do wanna page range.\n\n190\n00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.931\nAnd dropping that down,\nthere's that bookmark that I made and\n\n191\n00:10:07.931 --> 00:10:09.046\nI can choose that.\n\n192\n00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:12.794\nAnd then I go ahead and\nmark it, and it marks it on up.\n\n193\n00:10:12.794 --> 00:10:14.771\nPerfect I will,\nnow you can keep this open,\n\n194\n00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:17.288\nI was gonna say I'm now gonna\nclose this and keep going.\n\n195\n00:10:17.288 --> 00:10:21.268\nBut if you're marking and those entries\nyou don't wanna have to like keep closing\n\n196\n00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:24.045\nthis, select a text,\ngo back up and insert index entry.\n\n197\n00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:26.735\nYou can keep it open as you go through.\n\n198\n00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:31.780\nSo let's go into, let's go with old,\nwe'll mark whiskers just for fun.\n\n199\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.300\nAnd notice I've selected the text here and\nit didn't change there?\n\n200\n00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.680\nJust click into the box and\nyou see how now it went ahead and flipped.\n\n201\n00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.605\n&gt;&gt; So once you get it focused it goes\nyou want me to do something which you've\n\n202\n00:10:41.605 --> 00:10:42.467\nselected in the body.\n\n203\n00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:46.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz a lot of times it's like,\neven I do that sometimes even now.\n\n204\n00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:47.651\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's like what, I forgot.\n\n205\n00:10:47.651 --> 00:10:49.600\nI've gotta click back in the box and\nthen it knows.\n\n206\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.431\nSo I will mark this one as well and\nthere we go.\n\n207\n00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:58.221\nI've got some sub-entries,\nwe're going to mark the cats.\n\n208\n00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:01.955\nBecause in this document we have\nDinah that is up in the top,\n\n209\n00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:06.200\nthat Dina is the cat, and\nthere's also the Cheshire cat.\n\n210\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.060\nSo I'd like to say cats and\nthen have two sub-entries.\n\n211\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.350\nLet's scroll down because I\nthink the Cheshire there,\n\n212\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.110\nthe Cheshire is right here.\n\n213\n00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.290\nSo I will select the text, come in here.\n\n214\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:24.384\nBut this is where I don't put\nthe Cheshire cat as the main entry.\n\n215\n00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:30.709\nJust cat by itself is gonna be the main so\nI'm gonna just select Cheshire cut.\n\n216\n00:11:30.709 --> 00:11:33.397\nSo I did a Ctrl+X right there.\n\n217\n00:11:33.397 --> 00:11:36.779\nAnd then put the Cheshire\nas the sub-entry.\n\n218\n00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.257\nSo that's what I want it to do.\n\n219\n00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:40.179\nSo sometimes you have to kinda cut and\n\n220\n00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:43.221\npaste some of these pieces out\nto get it in the right place.\n\n221\n00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:45.006\nAnd I would like to have\nit as the current place.\n\n222\n00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:48.490\nI'm not gonna mark all for this one,\njust this particular page.\n\n223\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:55.019\nSo I mark it, and notice that\nthe entry goes in as cat:Cheshire.\n\n224\n00:11:55.019 --> 00:12:00.758\nCool, let's scroll on up to the top,\nget the Dinah.\n\n225\n00:12:00.758 --> 00:12:04.683\nThere we go same idea,\nselect the text click in here.\n\n226\n00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:09.983\nI will take Dinah, cut this out,\nput it in the sub-entry.\n\n227\n00:12:09.983 --> 00:12:14.039\nNow this you do have to match, so\nyou wanna make sure you put cat,\n\n228\n00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:20.040\ncuz I put cat for Cheshire, cat for Dinah-\n&gt;&gt; You could put cats or cat like objects.\n\n229\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It would be cat because that's\n\n230\n00:12:21.969 --> 00:12:23.765\nthe actual category it's in.\n\n231\n00:12:23.765 --> 00:12:24.575\n&gt;&gt; It has to match.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n232\n00:12:24.575 --> 00:12:26.901\n&gt;&gt; So we need to make sure we\nremember which one we did.\n\n233\n00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:28.587\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this one,\n\n234\n00:12:28.587 --> 00:12:30.012\nmaybe I'll go ahead and mark all.\n\n235\n00:12:30.012 --> 00:12:32.117\nBecause I think Dinah is\nin some other places.\n\n236\n00:12:32.117 --> 00:12:34.150\nSo I'll go ahead and click that, and\n\n237\n00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.950\nnotice that it's got there is Dinah and\nDinah.\n\n238\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.165\nAwesome and\nthere's actually a couple items here.\n\n239\n00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:44.570\nNotice that it has it marked\nthree times on page one.\n\n240\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:49.455\nThat means it will not put this in as one,\none, one.\n\n241\n00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:53.810\nIt just says here it is,\nthis entry is on page one.\n\n242\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.097\nSo don't worry about the-\n&gt;&gt; Multiples.\n\n243\n00:12:57.097 --> 00:13:00.116\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it won't show up that way,\nall right perfect.\n\n244\n00:13:00.116 --> 00:13:05.833\nAll right so now we've got enough I\nfeel to go ahead and generate the index.\n\n245\n00:13:05.833 --> 00:13:07.760\nI'm just double checking my notes,\nyeah that's good.\n\n246\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.420\nI wanted you to see it working in action.\n\n247\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.460\nLet's close this down,\nwe've marked our entries.\n\n248\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.750\nWe will go to the bottom, and\nI have already, no I haven't already.\n\n249\n00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.388\nPerfect, we will make one.\n\n250\n00:13:20.388 --> 00:13:22.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We will do a page break, so\n\n251\n00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:25.923\nI'll do a Ctrl+Enter, and\nI will type in the word Index.\n\n252\n00:13:25.923 --> 00:13:30.153\nAnd can't help it,\nI have to format it as a title, and\n\n253\n00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:35.230\nthen I will hit Enter and\nnow I'm ready to generate my index.\n\n254\n00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.065\nWe go over to references and\nI keep saying generate.\n\n255\n00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:41.839\nI think in InDesign it\nactually says generate index.\n\n256\n00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:43.900\nSo I think that's why my\nbrain keeps doing that.\n\n257\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.810\nBut generate, insert-\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n\n258\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.449\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n\n259\n00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:48.996\n&gt;&gt; Half of one, six a dozen of the other.\n\n260\n00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:49.733\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n261\n00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:50.585\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n262\n00:13:50.585 --> 00:13:52.186\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, whatever that saying is.\n\n263\n00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:54.765\n[LAUGH] Which I always mess them up.\n\n264\n00:13:54.765 --> 00:13:56.990\n[LAUGH] So insert the index.\n\n265\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.950\nSame like the table of contents is I have\nspecific formats that I could choose.\n\n266\n00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.560\nSo think about if you have the same\nformat for your table of contents,\n\n267\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.720\nyou might want to choose\nthe same format for your index.\n\n268\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.536\nI'll go with, I usually like the classic,\nyeah that's the one I tend to like.\n\n269\n00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:19.200\nBut I want it to be in two columns or\ninto one column, totally up to you.\n\n270\n00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.120\nI'll just go ahead and\nkeep all of these, click OK and boom.\n\n271\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.700\nThere we go, it went ahead and\ngenerated my index.\n\n272\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.800\nNotice that Mock Turtle Story\nis page 2 through 3.\n\n273\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.296\nDine wow,\nDinah'sis all over the place isn't it?\n\n274\n00:14:33.296 --> 00:14:34.652\n[LAUGH] She's in a lot of pages.\n\n275\n00:14:34.652 --> 00:14:36.156\n&gt;&gt; That cat's really in this story.\n\n276\n00:14:36.156 --> 00:14:40.291\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's cuz I copy and\npasted a lot of the same paragraphs.\n\n277\n00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:42.001\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go.\n\n278\n00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:45.380\n&gt;&gt; So now you can see we\nhave generated an index.\n\n279\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.308\nPretty cool on how this all works.\n\n280\n00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:54.302\nAll right now the whole list of\nentries that I want to mark.\n\n281\n00:14:54.302 --> 00:14:58.649\nThis is one of those things where if\nyou take a little bit of time and\n\n282\n00:14:58.649 --> 00:15:01.587\nset up what's known as a concordance file.\n\n283\n00:15:01.587 --> 00:15:05.964\nYou can generate,\nyou can have it automark everything for\n\n284\n00:15:05.964 --> 00:15:08.655\nyou which is pretty, pretty cool.\n\n285\n00:15:08.655 --> 00:15:11.247\nNow a concordance file\nis just a reference,\n\n286\n00:15:11.247 --> 00:15:13.777\nits a reference of these different terms.\n\n287\n00:15:13.777 --> 00:15:16.465\nOops, that's my virtual machine,\nwent a little too far.\n\n288\n00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:18.910\nWhere we want to say this is\nwhat you need to find and\n\n289\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.670\nthis is what it's going\nto enter in as the index.\n\n290\n00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.205\nSo I will open the file\ncalled Index Automark.\n\n291\n00:15:25.205 --> 00:15:27.125\nNow the name of the file\ndoesn't mean anything.\n\n292\n00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:30.378\nI've just named it that for my purpose.\n\n293\n00:15:30.378 --> 00:15:37.034\nBut do look at how this is set up,\nwe have a two column table.\n\n294\n00:15:37.034 --> 00:15:41.977\nSo you do need to have the table\nformat with the left hand\n\n295\n00:15:41.977 --> 00:15:46.710\nside being what I am looking for\nthe in the document.\n\n296\n00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:52.387\nAnd on the right hand side, what is\ngoing to be inserted into the index.\n\n297\n00:15:52.387 --> 00:15:56.637\nAnd notice here, like we said\nbefore that it reads it verbatim.\n\n298\n00:15:56.637 --> 00:16:02.373\nSo I wanted to find lowercase mouse and\nuppercase Mouse But\n\n299\n00:16:02.373 --> 00:16:09.560\nall of it, regardless of upper or\nlower, goes into the index as mouse.\n\n300\n00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.020\nSo watch your capitalization,\nor with the bat and Bats, so\n\n301\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.259\nyou'd have it listed twice.\n\n302\n00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.940\nThe other thing is that red knight and\nwhite knight,\n\n303\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.180\nyou saw the result of\nthis in the example file.\n\n304\n00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:28.340\nI had it inserted as knight, red so\nit's gonna read it exactly like that.\n\n305\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:34.820\nIt's only when you use that colon in\nbetween that it will do the main entry and\n\n306\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.080\nthe sub entries for that, it will\nsay chess and then bishop and rook.\n\n307\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.860\nUnderneath that and that it will formatted\nautomatically, so you make a concordinance\n\n308\n00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.390\nfile, two table list that there\nis nothing else in this document,\n\n309\n00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.540\nthere is no headings or\nanything like that, it's just a table.\n\n310\n00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.350\nYou're gonna use that file\nto automark you entries,\n\n311\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.100\nand you don't necessarily have\nanywhere specifically in the document,\n\n312\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.590\nI just want a heading,\nclick somewhere into the page.\n\n313\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.130\nWe go back into references,\nwe go to insert index, but\n\n314\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:15.380\nwe're not inserting the index just yet cuz\nwe need to get to the auto mark button.\n\n315\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.210\nAnd down here, it's gonna,\nthere's no other instructions there so\n\n316\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.870\nthat's when you click it's like\nwhat am I supposed to choose.\n\n317\n00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:23.470\nThat's that con coordinates file.\n\n318\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.460\nOur reference we go over to the desktop\nof where mine is living and\n\n319\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.810\nwe will find that file.\n\n320\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:29.550\nClick open.\n\n321\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.980\nI'm not sure if I'm on a page\nthat's gonna automatically do it.\n\n322\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.750\nThere's a couple.\n\n323\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.420\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz I'm at where the bishop\n\n324\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.860\nand the rook.\n\n325\n00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.680\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n326\n00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.462\n&gt;&gt; It's like I planned that.\n\n327\n00:17:37.462 --> 00:17:37.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:17:37.972 --> 00:17:38.472\n&gt;&gt; Good\n\n329\n00:17:38.472 --> 00:17:39.092\njob Vonne.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n330\n00:17:39.092 --> 00:17:39.762\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n331\n00:17:39.762 --> 00:17:40.972\nIt's like watching someone fall down\n\n332\n00:17:40.972 --> 00:17:42.764\nthe stairs and land on their feet.\nWe just saw it.\n\n333\n00:17:42.764 --> 00:17:43.799\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much.\n\n334\n00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:44.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.160\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n336\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.600\nnow when I had it marked on my\nentries there's a two demonstration,\n\n337\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.890\ncuz now I wanna had in put\nmore stuff into my inbox.\n\n338\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.255\nI need to Update this and\n\n339\n00:17:56.255 --> 00:17:59.175\nthis is where it gets kinda like,\nThis is a little easier now.\n\n340\n00:17:59.175 --> 00:18:02.715\nI've generated it,\nI just need to update the index which I'm\n\n341\n00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:05.835\non the reference tab so\nI can go over to update index.\n\n342\n00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:11.665\nYou could also right click somewhere in\nyour index fields and choose update field.\n\n343\n00:18:11.665 --> 00:18:15.125\nAnd then there we go,\nhere all of my new entries,\n\n344\n00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:16.995\ngotta click off to the side somewhere.\n\n345\n00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.575\nHere, let's go back up to there so\n\n346\n00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:22.750\nI can deselect all of the fields And\nit's changed everything.\n\n347\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.480\nThat's looking pretty good and\n\n348\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.630\nso that's where it gets pretty easy\nin the sense of just keep updating.\n\n349\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.140\nJust like the table of contents.\n\n350\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:36.400\nSo I will say that the index can be\na little weird because that's where like,\n\n351\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.120\nnow I need to go ahead and\nstart changing everything and\n\n352\n00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.810\nI need to change how this looks and that's\nwhere you have to kinda go back and forth.\n\n353\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.920\nSo I would suggest before you\nstart doing this do a save as.\n\n354\n00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.520\nGo ahead and\ndo a backup file one that doesn't have\n\n355\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.970\nanything with your index entries.\n\n356\n00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.680\nSo at least if you we kinda talked about\nthis in the table of contents right?\n\n357\n00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you start making changes.\n\n358\n00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.110\nAnd then you make another little change,\n\n359\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.300\nthen make another little change and\nthe next thing you know, what do kids say?\n\n360\n00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.816\nIt's a hot mess.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] yes, yes.\n\n361\n00:19:05.816 --> 00:19:06.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a very hot mess and\n\n362\n00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:07.690\nthose aren't fun.\n\n363\n00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.640\nSo as long as you have like\na place that you can go back to,\n\n364\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.040\nlike a starting position, that's good.\n\n365\n00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:18.880\nAnd maybe even an incremental save, like\nI'm good right now so I should save this.\n\n366\n00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.110\nAnd then when you get to a certain point,\n\n367\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.930\ncuz I've done that too where,\nYeah I've made a backup, but then I got so\n\n368\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.590\nfar down the line where man,\nif I would have just stopped here.\n\n369\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.780\n&gt;&gt; You could have been good at one spot,\nbut now I gotta go back to my backup,\n\n370\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.765\nwhich is well before that.\n\n371\n00:19:33.765 --> 00:19:37.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah and then you have you\nknow, something, one, two, three, four.\n\n372\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.810\n&gt;&gt; I get it.\n&gt;&gt; And then you come back five years later\n\n373\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.430\nwhen you have a new client that says,\nhey we want to do a new edition.\n\n374\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.400\nI'm like, why am I in this?\n\n375\n00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.640\nI have no idea what's going on.\n\n376\n00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.200\nBut then you start opening and\nlike, it's coming back now.\n\n377\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.470\nSo that's what I like to do so\nif you need to like start over,\n\n378\n00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.230\nthere is that save as and\ngo back to a clean copy.\n\n379\n00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:03.980\nBut there's a little secret that I'd\nlike to let you know cause like You can\n\n380\n00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.570\nremove all of the entries using the find,\nand\n\n381\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.770\nthis was one of those things where it's\nlike can I just get rid of them all.\n\n382\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.430\nBecause I don't want, I could remove\nthe index but all of the marked entries,\n\n383\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.690\nlike down into here.\n\n384\n00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:21.090\nLet me turn back on this Joey hide,\nthey're all through here.\n\n385\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.450\nAnd well yeah, I don't see it when you\nprint it or anything like that but\n\n386\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.220\nits just kinda like for\n\n387\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.940\nme it's like I know they still live\nin there, you need to get out.\n\n388\n00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.448\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:20:29.448 --> 00:20:30.758\n&gt;&gt; You have to go away.\n\n390\n00:20:30.758 --> 00:20:32.918\nSo you can do this little thing where you\n\n391\n00:20:32.918 --> 00:20:38.350\ncan use an advanced find and type in\nthe code And then it removes everything.\n\n392\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.620\nSo this is pretty neat.\n\n393\n00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.530\nLet me show you what we're gonna do.\n\n394\n00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.260\nWe're gonna do a Ctrl+H.\n\n395\n00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.780\nIt's just a keyboard shortcut to bring up\nthe Find &amp; Replace dialogue box, okay?\n\n396\n00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.180\nSo why is it H?\n\n397\n00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.730\nI don't really, I can't even tell you.\n\n398\n00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.970\nSo [LAUGH] it's-\n&gt;&gt; You got me.\n\n399\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:55.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.542\nWell, there's Had to be something I guess?\n\n401\n00:20:57.542 --> 00:20:58.054\n&gt;&gt; Something.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:20:58.054 --> 00:20:59.409\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you got to map it to something so\n\n403\n00:20:59.409 --> 00:21:00.970\nCtrl+H is where you're going.\n\n404\n00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.850\nWe're not finding a specific word.\n\n405\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.180\nYou need to find the field, so\nyou're going to type in the caret,\n\n406\n00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.650\nthat's the Shift+6 key,\nto where it puts the carer.\n\n407\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.890\nYou're gonna type in the lower case d.\n\n408\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:18.820\nYou're gonna space Type in\nan upper case x and upper case e.\n\n409\n00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.810\nAnd you can see the upper case x and\n\n410\n00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.880\ne that was that yeah that's\nworth marking the entry.\n\n411\n00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.970\nAnd then replace with you keep that\nblank and if you choose the replace\n\n412\n00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.976\nall it will go three and [SOUND] it does\n&gt;&gt; Removes it all.\n\n413\n00:21:32.976 --> 00:21:35.712\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the wonderful sound of happiness,\n[SOUND]\n\n414\n00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:36.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah success, [LAUGH]\n\n415\n00:21:36.814 --> 00:21:40.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I have removed everything.\n\n416\n00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.370\nI've started over and that was something,\n\n417\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.990\nwhen I learnt how to do\nthat it made me very happy.\n\n418\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.980\nIt's a small little thing.\n\n419\n00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But it's always the small things that\n\n420\n00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.950\nmake you happy [LAUGH] on\nhow every thing works.\n\n421\n00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.760\nAnd so you can get rid of everything.\n\n422\n00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.090\nNow one last, last, last, last, last-\n&gt;&gt; Last, last.\n\n423\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.990\n&gt;&gt; Thing.\n\n424\n00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.240\n&gt;&gt; Let's say for\nexample in one of my entries and\n\n425\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.090\nthis is where if like all of them\nare you know kinda messed up.\n\n426\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.480\nYou really need to go back and remove and\n\n427\n00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.520\nthat's where actually if I did here,\nif I said here and\n\n428\n00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.600\nthen I said like White coz I wanna remove\nall the ones that have the white rabbit.\n\n429\n00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.120\nNow it's gonna go on that it doesn't do\nall of them so I was just kind of doing it\n\n430\n00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.032\non the fly figure but what but\nyou know didn't so that's okay.\n\n431\n00:22:27.032 --> 00:22:27.544\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n432\n00:22:27.544 --> 00:22:29.350\n&gt;&gt; We'll it's not gonna work so\n\n433\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:33.850\nthis is that as actually exemplify the,\nhey make sure you do a file save as and\n\n434\n00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.760\ndo command update and\nif doesn't work you just gonna.\n\n435\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Just back it up.\n\n436\n00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you gonna have to back up\n&gt;&gt; Making those [INAUDIBLE] files is\n\n437\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.130\nreally easy cuz then you can just do\nan auto mark and you have a lot easier.\n\n438\n00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.740\nBut I wanted to try and show you\nthat where you can modify one entry,\n\n439\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.310\nlike if white rabbit is something that I\nwant to modify, just this specific one.\n\n440\n00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.840\nMaybe I wanted to have it be\nthe red rabbit, I don't know.\n\n441\n00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.920\nBut it knows I'm going into the specific,\nIndex entry right there,\n\n442\n00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.350\nso you can modify it right from here, cuz\nmaybe sometimes you forgot to uppercase\n\n443\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.530\nthe entry, like you had baby and\nyou brought it in as lowercase baby.\n\n444\n00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:17.490\nYou can change it right here in\nthe entry that it's being marked as,\n\n445\n00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.310\nso just some of those little\nthings that you could go through,\n\n446\n00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.630\nbut that is that time where small edits.\n\n447\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:24.980\nOkay not too bad.\n\n448\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.510\nBigger ones, 150 pages,\n\n449\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:33.270\nI might need to kind of utilize a little\nbit more of that removing authority.\n\n450\n00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.740\nSo just wanted to throw that out and\n\n451\n00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:40.910\nI believe that is everything that I\nwanted to show you in creating an index.\n\n452\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:47.050\nReally powerful But it can be\na little wonky every once in a while.\n\n453\n00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.340\nSo just watch yourself, backup,\nbackup, and you'll be okay.\n\n454\n00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.240\n&gt;&gt; It's funny,\nI know what she means when she says wonky.\n\n455\n00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.120\nI think you do too out there, but Vaughn,\n\n456\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.010\nit's very cool cuz it's a nice bookend\nto having the table of contents and\n\n457\n00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.780\nalso being able to do an index\nas well inside of our documents.\n\n458\n00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.240\nVery good things and\nthey can be very helpful things\n\n459\n00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.690\nto other people that are looking\nthrough our documents.\n\n460\n00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.370\nSo we do want to be able to do that and\nnow hopefully you have a pretty good idea\n\n461\n00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:17.110\nif not a great idea on to how to make\nthat happen inside of your program layer.\n\n462\n00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.530\nSo Vonne thank you for joining us\ntoday but I'm looking at our clock and\n\n463\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.880\nI'm looking at our content and\nwell we're well out of both.\n\n464\n00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.524\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n465\n00:24:23.524 --> 00:24:24.787\n&gt;&gt; So might as well go ahead and\n\n466\n00:24:24.787 --> 00:24:25.337\ncall it a day.\n\n467\n00:24:25.337 --> 00:24:27.260\nThank you good folks for joining us.\n\n468\n00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.630\nSigning off for OfficePro.TV.\n\n469\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.120\nI've been

We are, yes, and\nit's gonna be a really fun episode for me,\n\n8\n00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:31.703\nit's gonna be one of those,\nI wished I had that back in my day.\n\n9\n00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:36.408\n[LAUGH] Because I can remember\nagonizing over citing my work,\n\n10\n00:00:36.408 --> 00:00:39.729\nwriting a reference paper in high school,\n\n11\n00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:44.800\nwhere we didn't have all of\nthe fancy computers, right?\n\n12\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.570\n&gt;&gt;

Right, right, nothing wrong with\nusing free domain stuff, nothing wrong.\n\n104\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.510\n&gt;&gt; I can use this, and\nthere's a whole bunch of text, a lot,\n\n105\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.980\ntexts that were from way back in the day\nto where there's no royalties or anything,\n\n106\n00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.270\nso you can use the text.\n\n107\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.720\nAnd that's why I've been using\nthe Alice in Wonderland.\n\n108\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.360\n&gt;&gt; Which makes really good sense, too, if\nyou're practicing to be able to do this,\n\n109\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.550\nhave this tool available to you,\nand it's free, right?\n\n110\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.450\n&gt;&gt;

Unless it's a quote in a quote.\n\n126\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.113\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, exactly, and so\n\n127\n00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:32.680\nit started making me like what are the\nrules of the single and the double quotes?\n\n128\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.365\nAnd it's just a really interesting\narticle, it's in my show notes so\n\n129\n00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:37.560\nI am citing my source.\n\n130\n00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.675\nI am giving you the reference of where\nI'm getting this information from,\n\n131\n00:06:40.675 --> 00:06:42.266\nit's a really interesting article.\n\n132\n00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:46.459\nAnd it talks a lot about how, and\nit gets into the whole idea about with\n\n133\n00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:51.830\nthe Internet and the collection of\neverybody and crowdsourcing that you have.\n\n134\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.420\nYou ask a question to different blogs or\nmessage boards and people answer.\n\n135\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.350\nAnd where it's become kind of,\nwell, everybody said it online.\n\n136\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.126\nIt becomes that's like the new rule, and\nso if people start kind of adapting that,\n\n137\n00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:12.057\nso it kinda takes that angle a little bit\nwhich was, I thought, pretty interesting.\n\n138\n00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:16.660\nAnd then just the which way is right and\nthen there’s some other websites about\n\n139\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.581\nwell its more of a stylistic\napproach whether it's single quote.\n\n140\n00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:27.470\nAnd it also went into the American, what\nwe usually like to use the double quotes.\n\n141\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:35.472\nAnd it's more common for over in England\nto where they use single quotes.\n\n142\n00:07:35.472 --> 00:07:38.309\n&gt;&gt; Hm, [NOISE].\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right, right, and then I'm like,\n\n143\n00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:39.761\nwas Alice in Wonderland,\n\n144\n00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:43.140\nwas he from I don't even remember\nif he was British or not.\n\n145\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.400\n&gt;&gt;

New, Ctrl+N,\nFile &gt; New, if I come over here.\n\n192\n00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.720\nThey're in here too.\n\n193\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.580\nSo there's this master list, that says,\nsources available in master list.\n\n194\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.090\nNow think about it, if you start adding\nall this stuff in multiple documents,\n\n195\n00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.500\nthey're all in there, it just depends\non whether you need to pull it out for\n\n196\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.920\nthat particular file.\n\n197\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.450\nThat particular list that you want to\npull from and start citing your work.\n\n198\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.830\nSo think about the capabilities of\nthis if you're writing multiple\n\n199\n00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.480\nbook reports or\nreference papers and all that, and\n\n200\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.620\nit's all right here, it's like\nyou're creating your own library.\n\n201\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.041\nI remember the card catalog,\nyou had to pull it all out.\n\n202\n00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.550\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n203\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.650\nWe used to have to do tests.\n\n204\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.970\n&gt;&gt; Index files my gosh.\n\n205\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and we had tests on how\nto actually read those cards, and\n\n206\n00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.040\nwhere to find them in the library.\n\n207\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.390\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; It was awesome.\n\n208\n00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:40.490\nSo it's like I have my own card\ncatalogue right here, in Word,\n\n209\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.440\nthat I can just start moving things over,\nputting them in and it's inserted\n\n210\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.580\nthe proper way because it just told\nme how to do it and I got it ready.\n\n211\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.272\nGo ahead and cite it where I need to.\n\n212\n00:10:51.272 --> 00:10:54.457\nPut in my citations, generate my\nbibliography and poof, I'm done.\n\n213\n00:10:54.457 --> 00:10:55.714\nIt's like what, really?\n\n214\n00:10:55.714 --> 00:10:57.257\n&gt;&gt; It's too magical.\n\n215\n00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:58.108\nI can't take it.\n\n216\n00:10:58.108 --> 00:10:59.430\n&gt;&gt; I know [LAUGH], right?\n\n217\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.570\nIt's so crazy.\n\n218\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.190\nSo I have here the ones that I've done.\n\n219\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.470\nI've got a document.\n\n220\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.350\nLike I said, I'm just randomly\nputting in some citations that don't\n\n221\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.310\nreally make any sense, so\nmake sure they make sense to you but\n\n222\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.310\nlet's say this whole paragraph or\nthis particular sentence right here.\n\n223\n00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:20.270\nI need to quote this,\nI need to cite this from a source.\n\n224\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.680\nNow, I could have a choice from here and\nchoose a new source.\n\n225\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.380\nLet's say, I don't even have that\nin my master list right now, so\n\n226\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.630\nlet's just generate a brand new one first.\n\n227\n00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.670\nWe're going to insert it and right here.\n\n228\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.160\nWhat is the type of source?\n\n229\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.860\nIs it a book?\n\n230\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.670\nIs it a journal?\n\n231\n00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.790\nIs it an article?\n\n232\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.270\nBut notice how as soon as I change\nwhat type of source it is, look at all\n\n233\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.870\nthe fields that change in here and if I\ncome into Website, well there's the URL.\n\n234\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.880\nWhat's the year?\n\n235\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.510\nWhat's the month?\n\n236\n00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.070\nWhat's the date?\n\n237\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.030\n&gt;&gt; So Word has stored the protocol for\nall the different design types.\n\n238\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.580\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n239\n00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.060\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n&gt;&gt; And even cooler\n\n240\n00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.635\n&gt;&gt;

Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; In a sense but\n\n247\n00:12:11.747 --> 00:12:15.790\nhow it's gonna show up and put it in\nas a citation, that will change and\n\n248\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.720\nthat you can change it dynamically.\n\n249\n00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.400\nIt's so cool so I'm getting really,\nreally excited about this [LAUGH].\n\n250\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.640\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:09.691\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:11.666\nI'm your host, Zack Memos,\n\n5\n00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:16.570\nas we continue on with Microsoft Word\n2016 Expert, Long Documents.\n\n6\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.020\nToday it's Footnotes and Endnotes!\n\n7\n00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.450\nAnd Vonne Smith is gonna deliver us the\ninformation that we need, right, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.701\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I am, thank you so\nmuch for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.443\nI like the way you said that,\nfootnotes and endnotes.\n\n10\n00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:29.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So proper and-\n\n11\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.424\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, footnotes, endnotes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] footnotes,\nendnotes, yes, exactly.\n\n13\n00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.620\nSo yes, we're continuing\non with our long documents.\n\n14\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.679\nAnd really, when I say long documents,\nit's more like writing reports.\n\n15\n00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:41.298\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n16\n00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:46.740\n&gt;&gt; I keep thinking about school, where you\nhad to go ahead and write those reports.\n\n17\n00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.572\nAnd you had to have all\nof your references cited.\n\n18\n00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:51.030\nAnd have your table of contents.\n\n19\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.212\nAll the different things that we have been\ngoing over throughout these episodes.\n\n20\n00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:57.358\nAnd then footnotes and\nendnotes was another one of those.\n\n21\n00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:02.121\nWhere you had to, if you wanted to\nmake just like a little note on this\n\n22\n00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:07.557\nparticular sentence or paragraph,\nyou would put like the superscript one or\n\n23\n00:01:07.557 --> 00:01:10.834\nsome type of symbol at\nthe end of the sentence.\n\n24\n00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:15.810\nAnd then at the bottom of the page, you'd\nhave to go ahead and put that footnote.\n\n25\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.840\nAnd it had to be formatted properly,\nit had to match.\n\n26\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.330\nYou had to make sure all the numbers.\n\n27\n00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.320\nAnd if you didn't have\nsomething as beautiful as Word\n\n28\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.580\nto guide you along through, it's like,\nyou have to go back and erase them all and\n\n29\n00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.570\nall that kinda fun stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.473\nSo it was not so much fun doing it\nback in the day on pen and paper.\n\n31\n00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:33.790\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day, so what different\nshapes do the footnote from the endnote,\n\n32\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.680\njust briefly?\n\n33\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.355\n&gt;&gt; The placement, really, yeah,\na footnote is at the end of a page.\n\n34\n00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:44.516\nAnd endnote is at the end\nof either a chapter-\n\n35\n00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:45.252\n&gt;&gt; Or the book.\n\n36\n00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:46.081\n&gt;&gt; Or the book.\n\n37\n00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:46.770\n&gt;&gt; Or the report.\n\n38\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it just depends on\nwhere they've decided to put it.\n\n39\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.820\nAll the way in the back of the book or\nin that particular chapter.\n\n40\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.265\nSo I've seen them both ways.\n\n41\n00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:55.850\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n42\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.016\n&gt;&gt; So\nI think it's more of a stylistic choice.\n\n43\n00:01:59.016 --> 00:02:03.347\nI did some research, or, at least,\nI went to the oracle of the Internet that\n\n44\n00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:07.225\nsometimes you don't know if it's right or\nwrong.\n\n45\n00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:10.998\nBut it really just said which way,\nwhich one is better,\n\n46\n00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:13.260\nit really depends on the author.\n\n47\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.295\nAnd how they're wanted to put it.\n\n48\n00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:19.641\nAnd also, maybe like the length\nof the amount of footnotes or\n\n49\n00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:20.855\nendnotes that they might have.\n\n50\n00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.390\nIf you have a lot of\ndifferent things that you're\n\n51\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.090\nputting those types of notes\non throughout your page.\n\n52\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.672\nThink about if you had six or seven on\na page, that might take up a lot of space-\n\n53\n00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:30.295\n&gt;&gt; It could.\n\n54\n00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:34.307\n&gt;&gt; At that particular one, especially\nif it's going into more detail, or\n\n55\n00:02:34.307 --> 00:02:35.622\na research project, or\n\n56\n00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:39.990\ntalking about whatever type of information\nthey're wanting to put in there.\n\n57\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.830\nYou might wanna put that at the end.\n\n58\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.592\nSo I think it's really more of how much\nspace you have and how much you wanna say.\n\n59\n00:02:45.592 --> 00:02:50.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right,\nbecause there's like a book that I enjoy.\n\n60\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.630\nIt's been updated, my gosh,\nlike every five years, it gets updated.\n\n61\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.520\nAnd they always include\nwith the very beginning,\n\n62\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.040\nthis is the version number\nten of such-and-such a book.\n\n63\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.659\nSo that would be our footnote?\n\n64\n00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, it's really more of like\nthey're really wanting to put any more\n\n65\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.715\ninformation that they don't really\nfeel fits in that paragraph.\n\n66\n00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:11.296\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Making that note of like,\n\n67\n00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:15.712\nin this addition, we've decided to\nchange the way we say tomato, tomato,\n\n68\n00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:20.059\nbecause that's just what we're going\nwith because that's the way people\n\n69\n00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.450\nare talking nowadays.\n\n70\n00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.101\n&gt;&gt; They're now calling it to-mu-to.\n\n71\n00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like to-mu-to.\n\n72\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.760\n&gt;&gt; Tomutoes.\n\n73\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.071\n&gt;&gt; Yes, ooples and banoonoos.\n\n74\n00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:30.125\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's bringing me back to\n\n75\n00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.156\nmy camp songs still, so.\n\n76\n00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:32.938\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh,\nwe're gonna have to hear that one day.\n\n77\n00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:34.080\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n78\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.335\n[LAUGH] And actually,\nI just went ahead and\n\n79\n00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:39.306\nthrew up a website here that\nI do have in the show notes.\n\n80\n00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:42.150\nLooking through,\njust kinda double checking.\n\n81\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.106\nHey, cuz it's been awhile\nsince I've written a report or\n\n82\n00:03:45.106 --> 00:03:46.927\nanything that I needed footnotes.\n\n83\n00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:49.440\nSo I was like, when do you use them?\n\n84\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.360\nAnd it's just talking about why\nare they using footnotes and endnotes.\n\n85\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.543\nFor copyright permission,\nexplanatory information, supplemental but\n\n86\n00:03:57.543 --> 00:03:58.878\nrelated information.\n\n87\n00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:00.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n88\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.477\n&gt;&gt; So it's one of those things.\n\n89\n00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:07.133\nI actually just read this really funny\nbook by a comedian where she had\n\n90\n00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:12.010\na excerpt from her diary from like\nwhen she was 18 or something.\n\n91\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.340\nAnd she's 30-something now or whatever.\n\n92\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.690\nAnd so she's writing,\nit has her journal entry and\n\n93\n00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.639\nfootnotes at every little sentence,\nthat you go down the bottom.\n\n94\n00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.167\nSo you're seeing her 18-year old voice and\nthen her 30-year old voice.\n\n95\n00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:30.730\nIt's like, why would I ever even write,\nit's hilarious, it was, yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.715\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n97\n00:04:32.715 --> 00:04:35.552\n&gt;&gt; I can completely relate to it, so\nI just read something that had a ton of\n\n98\n00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:37.735\nfootnotes, and\nthey're really, really funny.\n\n99\n00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:42.720\nAnd it was explanatory,\nsupplemental information now,\n\n100\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.410\n15 years later, so pretty cool.\n\n101\n00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.884\nSo it's also talking about\nthe similarities and\n\n102\n00:04:47.884 --> 00:04:49.760\nthe advantages when a reader looks.\n\n103\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.020\nAnd that's one thing that I've noticed.\n\n104\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.645\nI'll see a little symbol, but\nI'll look to the bottom of the page.\n\n105\n00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:57.700\nI'm like, it's at the end, so\nyou gotta flip all the way to the end.\n\n106\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.210\nAnd then see that extra information\n\n107\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.100\nrather than having it right\nthere on the bottom of the page.\n\n108\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.690\nSo it's talking about some of\nthe advantages, to me, of a footnote.\n\n109\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.170\nBut then some disadvantages, when you\nhave a high number or it's too lengthy.\n\n110\n00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.511\nSo it's kinda going through that here.\n\n111\n00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:17.230\nThis is where I'm citing my source.\n\n112\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.040\n&gt;&gt; Citing is good.\n\n113\n00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, of where I am\ntelling you this information.\n\n114\n00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.000\nI'm passing it along from this particular\nwebsite that I was using as my reference.\n\n115\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.700\nSo just some of the disadvantages\nof your endnotes.\n\n116\n00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.190\nAnd of course, it says at the bottom,\nas with anything,\n\n117\n00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.890\nthe overuse of footnotes and\nendnotes hurts the strength of your paper.\n\n118\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.860\nIt's all these great things,\nsometimes too much is too much.\n\n119\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.490\nAnd just enough is just enough, wow,\nthat was a profound statement by-\n\n120\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.515\n&gt;&gt; It's too profound for me, so, goodbye.\n\n121\n00:05:46.515 --> 00:05:48.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm leaving, I'm just gonna-\n\n122\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] Captain Obvious, right?\n\n123\n00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:51.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n124\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.430\nso how are we going to insert\nfootnotes and endnotes?\n\n125\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.000\nAnd then how do we kinda\ncontrol them within Word?\n\n126\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.050\nI will say, this particular function\nin Word is actually really handy.\n\n127\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.440\nAnd it's really easy, and\nit updates itself really well.\n\n128\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.900\nCuz when we talk about captions, there is\nthis thing where you, you go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.580\nselect all of it.\n\n130\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.886\nCuz if you start moving these around or\nlike you delete a caption, or\n\n131\n00:06:15.886 --> 00:06:18.870\ntake one out or add one,\nit should renumber automatically.\n\n132\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.100\nCaptions are a little, they're not,\nthey're a little stubborn.\n\n133\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.970\nAnd you kinda have to force them\nto wake up and update themselves.\n\n134\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.330\nAnd sometimes you have to\ndo a couple of tricks.\n\n135\n00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.273\nWith footnotes and endnotes, if you delete\none or add one, it's just, [SOUND].\n\n136\n00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:35.570\nIt just re-numbers everything, and\nI feel it's a little bit more reliable.\n\n137\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.362\n&gt;&gt; And it will go [SOUND].\n\n138\n00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:40.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, yes,\nit definitely has that sound effect.\n\n139\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.770\nOr at least that's what I\"m thinking\nof in my own little head, but yes.\n\n140\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.120\nSo I like this,\nI feel it's a little bit more reliable of\n\n141\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.380\na automatically updating\ntype of functionality.\n\n142\n00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.270\nSo let me show you this functionality,\nand actually, I just started Word.\n\n143\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.530\nAnd I didn't really wanna\nstart from a blank document.\n\n144\n00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.698\nI could have just kept it open,\nbut I'm gonna go right here.\n\n145\n00:07:01.698 --> 00:07:03.432\n&gt;&gt; To Alice in Wonderland?\n\n146\n00:07:03.432 --> 00:07:06.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\ndown the rabbit hole, let's go.\n\n147\n00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.088\nI have a footnotes example file,\nand we'll open it up.\n\n148\n00:07:11.088 --> 00:07:13.188\nAnd again, I could have just\nopened it right from Word.\n\n149\n00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:14.552\n[SOUND] You get in your little habits.\n\n150\n00:07:14.552 --> 00:07:15.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n151\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.010\n&gt;&gt; And this is the way we go,\nwe have our Down the Rabbit Hole.\n\n152\n00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.353\nYou've been seeing this file\nprobably a lot in this particular\n\n153\n00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:24.707\nsection of this show or this episode,\nno, this is an episode.\n\n154\n00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:25.654\n&gt;&gt; Series?\n\n155\n00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:26.315\n&gt;&gt; Series.\n\n156\n00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:27.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n157\n00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.634\n[LAUGH] Using that terminology properly\neven though we kinda swirl them all\n\n158\n00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:31.493\ntogether really.\n\n159\n00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:34.480\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I have foot notes in here.\n\n160\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.752\nI have, not up up up up and cats might\neat bats, but that might be bad.\n\n161\n00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:41.444\nCompletely making this up.\n\n162\n00:07:41.444 --> 00:07:41.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.670\n&gt;&gt; And having some fun with myself.\n\n164\n00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.200\nBut its like,\nI'm looking at the bottom of the page.\n\n165\n00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.943\nAnd I just kinda jumped down here, but\nwhere is that, like in the actual text?\n\n166\n00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:57.217\nThe cool thing is, in the References tab\nof our ribbon, this area right here for\n\n167\n00:07:57.217 --> 00:08:00.934\nour footnotes The cool thing\nis this Show Notes button.\n\n168\n00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:04.015\nThis is where,\nif you're on the symbol in the text,\n\n169\n00:08:04.015 --> 00:08:08.300\nit'll jump down to the bottom to show you,\nlike the corresponding one.\n\n170\n00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.770\nOr in this sense, my cursor is in\nthe bottom of the page, in the footnotes.\n\n171\n00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:18.040\nIf I click Show Note, it actually\njumps my cursor up to the area or\n\n172\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.180\nthe sentence,\nthe placement of that footnote.\n\n173\n00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.274\nSo you can see down, down,\ndown and there is that number one.\n\n174\n00:08:24.274 --> 00:08:26.572\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And you also see when I hover over it,\n\n175\n00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:30.398\nit gives me like this little almost\nlike a Post-it note looking icon and\n\n176\n00:08:30.398 --> 00:08:31.800\nit says not up, up, up.\n\n177\n00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.330\nSo that is just me being silly.\n\n178\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.080\nSo you could see that I could go back and\n\n179\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.110\nforth and I like that that\ngives me a little preview.\n\n180\n00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.360\nAnd then if I wanted to jump\ndown I click that Show Notes and\n\n181\n00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.860\nthen, do I want to view the footnote area?\n\n182\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.930\nYes, there you go.\n\n183\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.780\nAnd it does prompt me something.\n\n184\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.780\nLet's go back up to that.\n\n185\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.909\nLet's go back up to Show Notes.\n\n186\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.950\nWhen I click, well, go ahead and show\nthe note, I say, hey, well, wait a second.\n\n187\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.730\nThis segment has both footnotes and\nendnotes,\n\n188\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.440\nbecause I added both in\nhere in this example.\n\n189\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.220\nSo which one do you want to use?\n\n190\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.630\nI'm like, well,\nhow about we go to the endnotes?\n\n191\n00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.183\nWhy don't we see where that is?\n\n192\n00:09:04.183 --> 00:09:07.380\nClick OK, and that took me,\nif you scroll down a little bit.\n\n193\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.910\nThis I was already on page,\nit's behind my head, sorry.\n\n194\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:15.310\nIt's page 11 so it brought me all\nthe way to the end of the document.\n\n195\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.224\nAnd pepper goes great with soup.\n\n196\n00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:21.360\n[LAUGH] I told you,\nI'm just making this stuff up.\n\n197\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.930\nSo there's where it's at.\n\n198\n00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:28.610\nIf I go back to the Show Notes here now\nit's taking me to, I added an endnote at\n\n199\n00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.890\nthe end of this Pig and Pepper paragraph,\ncuz I do like pepper in my soup.\n\n200\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.209\n&gt;&gt; Pepper's good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I figured saying that pepper\n\n201\n00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.294\nwith soup instead of pepper with a pig.\n\n202\n00:09:38.294 --> 00:09:40.574\nI was like,\n[SOUND] then it starts making me feel bad.\n\n203\n00:09:40.574 --> 00:09:43.023\n&gt;&gt; Well, it makes pigs sneeze, doesn't it?\n\n204\n00:09:43.023 --> 00:09:46.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, it does.\n\n205\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.717\nYes, we'll put it that way.\n\n206\n00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:48.572\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n207\n00:09:48.572 --> 00:09:49.720\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n208\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.860\nOkay, so we have here, so\nthat's where I have a different icon here.\n\n209\n00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.700\nI'm trying to zoom in.\n\n210\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.440\nIt's not playing with me very nicely.\n\n211\n00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.330\nOkay, well then I will use the buttons and\nnot the shortcut.\n\n212\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.890\nSo you see that's a Roman numeral i\n\n213\n00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.920\nin there it's kind of small\nespecially on the screen.\n\n214\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.230\nBut it is a lower case Roman numeral i for\none, okay?\n\n215\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:17.020\nSo Roman numerals for endnotes but\nthen a numerical number 1 for footnotes.\n\n216\n00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.150\nSo that way it differentiates,\nthis is a footnote, this is an endnote.\n\n217\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.862\nAnd that way you go ahead and\n\n218\n00:10:22.862 --> 00:10:27.571\nfind the corresponding symbol into\nthe different places where they live.\n\n219\n00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:32.965\nAt the bottom of the page or the end of,\nin this case, the whole document, right?\n\n220\n00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:35.635\nSo that's where we have some\nexamples through here, and\n\n221\n00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:40.195\nit will automatically number as we go\nthrough some of the other ones, okay?\n\n222\n00:10:40.195 --> 00:10:42.805\nYeah, so\nturtle nesting season is from March\n\n223\n00:10:42.805 --> 00:10:45.555\nto November on the east coast of Florida,\nwhich is true.\n\n224\n00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:47.187\nI double checked my facts.\n\n225\n00:10:47.187 --> 00:10:51.070\nIt's actually May to November\nif you're on the west coast.\n\n226\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.901\nDidn't know that, but-\n&gt;&gt; Must have something to do with\n\n227\n00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:54.626\nthe equator.\n\n228\n00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:55.437\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n229\n00:10:55.437 --> 00:11:02.200\n[LAUGH] There's gotta be some science and\ngeography type things going on there.\n\n230\n00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.550\nAnd we've had a couple of rabbit\nwith gloves is most adorable.\n\n231\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.239\nYou get the idea here is that\nI've added footnotes and\n\n232\n00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:12.521\nif I don't know where this is in my text,\nwe go to the Show Notes and\n\n233\n00:11:12.521 --> 00:11:14.646\nwe can jump back and\nforth and there we go.\n\n234\n00:11:14.646 --> 00:11:19.329\nA white, a little white, wait,\nrabbits little white kid gloves,\n\n235\n00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:22.630\nthat's kinda hard to say right now for\nmyself.\n\n236\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:27.940\nAll right, so we have got all of these\ndifferent footnotes and/or and endnotes.\n\n237\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.850\nWe could change things like the symbols.\n\n238\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.680\nMaybe I don't want number 1s,\nI want A, Bs, and Cs.\n\n239\n00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.340\nMaybe I want little asterisks and\nlittle cross-looking signs,\n\n240\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.430\nI want those to be my symbols for\neither my endnotes or my footnotes.\n\n241\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.110\nWhere am I placing my endnotes?\n\n242\n00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.190\nDo I want the endnotes to go\nto the end of the document or\n\n243\n00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.780\nto the end of the chapters?\n\n244\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.840\nNow when I say chapters,\n\n245\n00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.870\nyou will need to have your\ndocument broken up into sections.\n\n246\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.870\nSo I'm gonna throw that Show/Hide button\non here to show you that if I go down\n\n247\n00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.130\nto right there, there's a section break.\n\n248\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.597\nAnd there are a couple endnotes throughout\nthis document, that if I wanted to,\n\n249\n00:12:07.597 --> 00:12:08.904\nI could put them right there.\n\n250\n00:12:08.904 --> 00:12:12.585\nBut if you don't have sections\nthen it's not going to apply.\n\n251\n00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:16.944\nSo you do need to make sure you have\nthe structure and the page layout set up\n\n252\n00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:21.590\nbefore you go through in converting\nthem which I will show you how to do.\n\n253\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.999\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't you just\nuse like a page number?\n\n254\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.300\n&gt;&gt; This way with the page numbers\nit will be dynamic, in a sense.\n\n255\n00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.830\nAnd you want to say at\nthe end of this section.\n\n256\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.477\nI see what you're saying,\nokay go ahead and put them on page six.\n\n257\n00:12:33.477 --> 00:12:34.583\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n258\n00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:38.740\n&gt;&gt; But with that, it's not that specific\nand it doesn't have that capability for\n\n259\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.390\nyou to specifically target.\n\n260\n00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.150\nAnd the other thing you do\nwanna keep them floating,\n\n261\n00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.300\nbecause what if you started\nadding text into page five?\n\n262\n00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.705\nThat moved all that text down, and\nthe end of that chapter is on page seven.\n\n263\n00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.050\n&gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying?\n\n264\n00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.912\nShe's smarter than me.\n\n265\n00:12:54.912 --> 00:12:57.180\nA man's gotta know his limitations.\n\n266\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No it's a valid question.\n\n267\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.510\nBecause you're like no\nI wanna put it there.\n\n268\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.224\nBut if it does to flow that's where\nit keeps it that kind of fluid,\n\n269\n00:13:05.224 --> 00:13:06.313\nliving document.\n\n270\n00:13:06.313 --> 00:13:07.330\n&gt;&gt; Living document.\n\n271\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.274\nThat was what I said.\n\n272\n00:13:08.274 --> 00:13:10.239\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nI think it kind of keeps that and so\n\n273\n00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:12.740\nit makes it a little bit more flexible for\nyou.\n\n274\n00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.430\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; It's nice that they thought that far\n\n275\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.780\nahead for us.\n\n276\n00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.710\nAnd that's how it works.\n\n277\n00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.520\n&gt;&gt; And it makes sense.\n\n278\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.200\nYeah, perfect, so as long as we have\nall of that, we can go through and\n\n279\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.550\nchange all of our options.\n\n280\n00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.150\nOkay, you know what?\n\n281\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.210\nWhile I'm talking about it, you're like,\nwell, can you go ahead and just show me?\n\n282\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.040\nAll right, I can.\n\n283\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.220\nIf we go over to References,\nthis button right here,\n\n284\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.300\nthis is our dialogue box launcher button.\n\n285\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.900\nI still just call it the more button\nbecause it's a lot easier to say.\n\n286\n00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.620\nAnd it takes me into the different\noptions that I can have for\n\n287\n00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.440\nmy footnotes and endnotes.\n\n288\n00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.680\nAnd notice that when I have this on,\nand I have footnotes, and\n\n289\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.610\nI have bottom of the page.\n\n290\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.830\nIt has a particular number format.\n\n291\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.850\nIt is a continuous numbering.\n\n292\n00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.780\nSo it goes all the way\nthrough the document.\n\n293\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.010\nAnd that's where you could,\nwell, change these things.\n\n294\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:04.946\nWhat if I wanted to change\nthe footnotes to renumber every page?\n\n295\n00:14:04.946 --> 00:14:07.512\nWell that could be,\nif you have a lot of footnotes,\n\n296\n00:14:07.512 --> 00:14:09.133\nthat might be a good thing to do.\n\n297\n00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:13.793\nSo that way you don't have a footnote\n235 because you put a couple\n\n298\n00:14:13.793 --> 00:14:16.620\nfootnotes on every other page.\n\n299\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.700\nYou might want to just say,\n\n300\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.250\ngo with renumbering every time\na page starts, or maybe a section.\n\n301\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:27.960\nThat could be if you have a really, really\nlong document, doing it for the chapters.\n\n302\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.830\nOr we're calling them chapters,\nbut we know that they're sections.\n\n303\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.260\nSo those are the different\noptions you can have,\n\n304\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.560\nstarting at whatever number you want.\n\n305\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.030\nI usually start numberings with one.\n\n306\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.254\nBut you could see where you might want\nto have it start at a different place.\n\n307\n00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:45.720\nBecause notice that it is applying\nto what part of the document?\n\n308\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.927\nMaybe in one particular section of\nyour document, you want the page,\n\n309\n00:14:49.927 --> 00:14:53.941\nsorry not page numbers,\nthese footnotes to start at number five.\n\n310\n00:14:53.941 --> 00:14:56.210\nI mean, you could, if you wanted to.\n\n311\n00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.970\nBut not the whole document,\njust this one place.\n\n312\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.840\nSo making sure If you are going to\nbe using the different options of\n\n313\n00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.190\nyour footnotes and/or endnotes, for those\nparticular sections make sure your cursor\n\n314\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.606\nis in the section that you wanna be in\nbefore you start changing all this.\n\n315\n00:15:12.606 --> 00:15:17.080\nSo it's all still back to that same\nfoundational premise of where am I at,\n\n316\n00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.780\nwhat do I want to do,\nwhere do I need to be, that kind of thing.\n\n317\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.270\nThe number format, whether you wanted a,\nbs, cs, those little symbols.\n\n318\n00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.925\nIf you wanted to do those as,\nas a alternative.\n\n319\n00:15:27.925 --> 00:15:31.055\nNope, we want to keep\nwith the numerical ones.\n\n320\n00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:36.311\nMatch section layout,\nI would probably just go with that but\n\n321\n00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:42.220\nthink about it if your section\nwas divided into columns, okay?\n\n322\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.800\nThat's where you would want to have\na footnote in the first column.\n\n323\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.093\nThe footnote goes on that first column and\n\n324\n00:15:48.093 --> 00:15:51.050\nthen the second column\nfootnote goes in that column.\n\n325\n00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.251\nSo it would match whatever\nyour document is laid out.\n\n326\n00:15:55.251 --> 00:16:00.129\nOr you could say I want, maybe you\nhave your pages all in one column,\n\n327\n00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:03.396\nbut your footnotes want\nto be in two columns.\n\n328\n00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:08.641\nSo, you could section that out, section,\nha, ha, so you could change that out\n\n329\n00:16:08.641 --> 00:16:13.732\nthere for how you want the footnotes to\nbe displayed at the bottom of your page,\n\n330\n00:16:13.732 --> 00:16:18.390\nand that's where you're changing\nthe option for all your footnotes.\n\n331\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.930\nYou change it over to endnotes,\nwhere do you want your endnotes?\n\n332\n00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.780\nSo now you're doing all these different\noptions in here, like the format and\n\n333\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.370\nthe apply to, now you're changing\nit all for your endnotes.\n\n334\n00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.720\nDo I want them at the bottom\nof the document or\n\n335\n00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.640\ndo I want them at the end of the section?\n\n336\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.030\nThe cool thing is, is that I've got all\nof these in here, you could sit here and\n\n337\n00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.386\nchange them all day long and\nit will just renumber like it does,\n\n338\n00:16:43.386 --> 00:16:45.420\nit's pretty neat, so let's try this.\n\n339\n00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:51.300\nWe'll put our endnotes at the end of\nthe sections and we will keep those,\n\n340\n00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.170\nlet's change the numbers to A,B, C, so we\nget a little bit more of a visual change.\n\n341\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.520\nI know those lower case,\nroman numerals are hard to see.\n\n342\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:05.160\nWe'll start at A continuous and\nwe'll apply to the whole document,\n\n343\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.410\nso that way everybody knows that we're\ndoing the endnotes this way, for the end\n\n344\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:14.010\nof the sectionn and for fun let's go\nback and change some the footnote stuff.\n\n345\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:18.700\nWe'll keep the 123s, and\nwe'll start the numbering at each page.\n\n346\n00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.560\nThat sounds good, and we'll do it for\nthe whole document and we apply, and now,\n\n347\n00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.560\nif I zoom out just a little bit,\nwe could, oops, little bit too much.\n\n348\n00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.180\nI need to zoom out the whole computer,\nthere we go.\n\n349\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.740\nSo, let's go back to see, that one says,\nand it's kinda hard to see with them\n\n350\n00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.690\nthe Show/Hide buttons on, so\nlet me turn those off, there's number one.\n\n351\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.960\nRemember, I think it was\nnumber three before because we\n\n352\n00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.895\nhad two footnotes on page one.\n\n353\n00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:42.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n354\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.940\n&gt;&gt; And so, now, yep, there's one too and\nthen on the next page, there's number one.\n\n355\n00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.750\nSo it's renumbering at\nevery change in page and\n\n356\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.610\nif I get down to the bottom\nof the section, there it is,\n\n357\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.210\nthere's that Pepper goes great with soup,\nand Small places are no fun.\n\n358\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.880\nI get a little claustrophobic sometimes,\nnot too bad, but\n\n359\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.240\nenough to where it's like,\nno, I don't wanna do that.\n\n360\n00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.950\nSo I put my endnotes at\nthe end of the sections and\n\n361\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.720\nit completely renumbered everything for\nme, moved it all around and\n\n362\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.500\nby just me clicking some of the options,\nthat's really powerful.\n\n363\n00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.440\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft Word is amazing.\n\n364\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.680\nI mean, they thought, they did,\nyou're right, they thought of everything.\n\n365\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.190\nIt's like they have little tron\npeople in there [LAUGH] and\n\n366\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.440\nthey're doing this all for\nyou behind the scenes.\n\n367\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n368\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.909\nI call them the hamsters, the hamsters.\n\n369\n00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:28.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Are running in the wheel really,\n\n370\n00:18:28.546 --> 00:18:29.148\nreally fast.\n\n371\n00:18:29.148 --> 00:18:31.109\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\n&gt;&gt; But I like the Tron reference too.\n\n372\n00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Furry, cute animals, and\n\n373\n00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.760\nsomething scientific reference,\nyou can see where we're at.\n\n374\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.650\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; But I love it, that's awesome.\n\n375\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.155\nSo we have the different ways that we can\nchange the options of our footnotes and\n\n376\n00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:44.400\nendnotes.\n\n377\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.460\nWhat if I start adding more into this?\n\n378\n00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.290\nSo, now that I've got a couple\nalready established, I need to\n\n379\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.890\nshow you how to insert footnotes,\nand what about deleting footnotes?\n\n380\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.930\nAnd then we can go through and change all\nour options again and I'm right here.\n\n381\n00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.340\nLet's go with our Cheshire Cats, and\nwe'll talk about some Fuego, maybe,\n\n382\n00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.440\nhere we go, White Buffalo.\n\n383\n00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.030\nNow this isn't a smart object, or\nSmartArt, and it is an object, so\n\n384\n00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.680\nyou can put footnotes and\nendnotes on anything really,\n\n385\n00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.370\nit doesn't have to just be in paragraphs.\n\n386\n00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.300\nWhy do we call him the White Buffalo?\n\n387\n00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.745\n&gt;&gt; It was a bad movie, by the way.\n\n388\n00:19:18.745 --> 00:19:19.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Was it?\n\n389\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:20.146\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it was.\n\n390\n00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:20.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n391\n00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.400\n&gt;&gt; I'll take your word for it.\n\n392\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.400\nSo I wanna put a footnote here\nto explain a little bit more,\n\n393\n00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.410\nof where he got this nickname, so\n\n394\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.730\nI'll come over to references and\nI will not be able to insert a footnote,\n\n395\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.390\nbecause I just lied to you and\nsaid that you can put it on there.\n\n396\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.030\nAnd guess what?\n\n397\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.710\nYou can't.\n\n398\n00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.370\nSo let's pretend that,\nwe'll save White Buffalo here.\n\n399\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.720\nOkay, so there's a great teaching moment,\nturn this into a teachable moment,\n\n400\n00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.650\ncan't add footnotes to text\nin a SmartArt graphic.\n\n401\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.620\nI thought you could.\n\n402\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.600\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n403\n00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.655\n&gt;&gt; I put it in a table.\n\n404\n00:19:53.655 --> 00:19:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So I kinda just assumed that, okay,\n\n405\n00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.730\nthen we could do that,\nwell I guess it didn't really see that.\n\n406\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.050\nAnd I can, now that I think about it a\nlittle bit more, because it is an object,\n\n407\n00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.956\ntables, they're objects, but it's, what\nyou put in tables is really mostly text.\n\n408\n00:20:09.956 --> 00:20:10.548\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n409\n00:20:10.548 --> 00:20:15.745\nAnd since SmartArt is something\nthat is generated from Word.\n\n410\n00:20:15.745 --> 00:20:18.700\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; As that particular content, I can see\n\n411\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.210\nthe reason why they wouldn’t do that,\nso I just kind of solved it for myself.\n\n412\n00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:28.532\n&gt;&gt; So the footnotes, endnotes features\nwould see that as an object, not as text?\n\n413\n00:20:28.532 --> 00:20:31.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I'm going with.\n\n414\n00:20:31.674 --> 00:20:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; At least for right now.\n\n415\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.450\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense, it does.\n\n416\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.740\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense for me too and\nso I'll double check that but,\n\n417\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.140\nwe're gonna go with that for now.\n\n418\n00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.885\n&gt;&gt; Back with you later on that note,\nback with you later.\n\n419\n00:20:41.885 --> 00:20:42.502\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely.\n\n420\n00:20:42.502 --> 00:20:45.810\nSo we'll pretend that we have\na White Buffalo here and\n\n421\n00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.020\nthis is where we are going\nto add that foot note.\n\n422\n00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.700\nSo we will click the cursor,\nI put my cursor where I wanted and\n\n423\n00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.540\nas soon as I clicked it,\nyou see it just went ahead and\n\n424\n00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.450\nmade that number two there\nat the end of that sentence.\n\n425\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.060\nAnd then if I scroll down,\nit jumps down into the bottom of my page,\n\n426\n00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.520\nit puts that line there, which was already\nthere, because I had cry it out girl,\n\n427\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.800\nbecause it was saying something about,\nAlice crying.\n\n428\n00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.191\nSo I was like,\nsometimes you just need a good cry.\n\n429\n00:21:08.191 --> 00:21:11.068\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So now, I'm gonna go ahead and type and\n\n430\n00:21:11.068 --> 00:21:16.130\nsay he is, well he is white,\nso he has white fur\n\n431\n00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:24.180\nand he is very large, so\nthat's why he is called the White Buffalo.\n\n432\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.145\n&gt;&gt; And he likes pepper.\n\n433\n00:21:25.145 --> 00:21:29.075\n&gt;&gt; Yes and he just kind of lumbered\naround like a big White Buffalo so.\n\n434\n00:21:29.075 --> 00:21:29.790\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n435\n00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:30.640\n&gt;&gt; We got that?\n\n436\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.150\nAnd now,\nI've added a footnote into my page.\n\n437\n00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.900\nNow here, where it says cry it out girl,\nmaybe I've realized that I don't really\n\n438\n00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.000\nknow if I want that there anymore,\nso how do I get rid of a footnote?\n\n439\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.220\nI put my cursor at the bottom,\n\n440\n00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.460\nI move back up to that show notes,\njump in, this is a field, so,\n\n441\n00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.460\nif I selected, I just kinda click dragged\nright across to highlight that number one,\n\n442\n00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.260\nthat footnote there, and then I just hit\nthe delete key and and it gets rid of it.\n\n443\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.030\nBut look at down here there it goes,\nwell, now the cry it out girl,\n\n444\n00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.740\nis gone and\nnow the only footnote I have on this page\n\n445\n00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.390\nis about the White Buffalo and it has\nchanged the numbering and there you go.\n\n446\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.070\nThat's what I was saying, it's that easy-\n&gt;&gt; Awesome\n\n447\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.650\n&gt;&gt; To get rid of or add or renumber,\n\n448\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.190\nanything that you have in your document.\n\n449\n00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:25.818\nAnd the one I wanted to show you a little\nbit more, I think it's actually, sorry.\n\n450\n00:22:25.818 --> 00:22:28.876\nOne second.\n\n451\n00:22:28.876 --> 00:22:30.908\nNo, it's down, no it is.\n\n452\n00:22:30.908 --> 00:22:33.260\nSorry, like where are you going?\n\n453\n00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.240\nI don't know sometimes, that's okay.\n\n454\n00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.880\nBut I wanted to show you if I had taken\nthis paragraph, and let's say, let's cut\n\n455\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.310\nit out, because I want to rearrange\nmy information, so I cut this out.\n\n456\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.800\nIt automatically will make\nthe cats eats spats turns to one.\n\n457\n00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.940\nNow I'm gonna put this\nparagraph down here.\n\n458\n00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.430\nWhoops, let's pretend,\nwe'll change this, there.\n\n459\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.590\nNotice it changed the numbering too?\n\n460\n00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.350\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n&gt;&gt; The footnote,\n\n461\n00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.310\nit stayed with it,\nwhen I cut that information out.\n\n462\n00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:08.220\nIt now it realizes you are now\nlower than the cats might eat bats,\n\n463\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.080\nso it automatically changed.\n\n464\n00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.070\nAnd that's how, to me, how responsive,\nand how easy it is to just kind of\n\n465\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:20.080\ntrust that everything is gonna\nupdate the way it's supposed to.\n\n466\n00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.988\nCaptions, not as much,\nthis one's pretty cool.\n\n467\n00:23:23.988 --> 00:23:29.670\nSo adding, deleting,\nrearranging your text, changing pages,\n\n468\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:34.710\nit will all move with you, cuz if I\nwent ahead and started changing this.\n\n469\n00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.340\nYou see how now all of this has gone\ndown to the next page in there.\n\n470\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.856\nSo the first one, the cat eats bats is\nstill there, cuz that was at the top of\n\n471\n00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:47.552\nthe page, this has moved down to the next\npage and the footnotes come with it.\n\n472\n00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:52.309\nAutomatically changes the sea turtle, it\nkinda changed my table a little bit, but\n\n473\n00:23:52.309 --> 00:23:54.560\nthat was just because of the.\n\n474\n00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.566\nThe text is moving it down, and\nit's kind of breaking it, so.\n\n475\n00:23:57.566 --> 00:24:01.411\nFor demonstration purposes only,\nI wouldn't keep it like this.\n\n476\n00:24:01.411 --> 00:24:02.085\n&gt;&gt; Don't try this at home!\n\n477\n00:24:02.085 --> 00:24:03.916\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely.\n\n478\n00:24:03.916 --> 00:24:06.004\n&gt;&gt; Actually, you should try it home,\nthough, to be honest with you.\n\n479\n00:24:06.004 --> 00:24:07.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n480\n00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:11.450\n&gt;&gt; Get into Microsoft Word 2016 and\nplay around.\n\n481\n00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:16.275\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and those options of how you can\nstart converting, that's really cool.\n\n482\n00:24:16.275 --> 00:24:20.740\nCuz now maybe I've decided, I went back\nto that More button on that group.\n\n483\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.650\nAnd I don't really like that the footnotes\nare restarting at every page.\n\n484\n00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.790\nI wanna put that back to continuous,\nand I like that.\n\n485\n00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:34.480\nAnd maybe the end notes,\nthe end notes need to go back to the end\n\n486\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.770\nof the document, so I can put that\nback over there, and I apply.\n\n487\n00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:44.220\nAnd now my numberings, yep, there's two,\nthree, and there should be some fours.\n\n488\n00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.770\nAnd all of my end notes go to the bottom.\n\n489\n00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.170\nSo they just move around\nexactly how I'm supposed to.\n\n490\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.498\nBut there's another one that I wanted\nto go over in that options, and\n\n491\n00:24:54.498 --> 00:24:56.480\nthat's where you can convert.\n\n492\n00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.700\nMaybe I'm starting to realize I have a lot\nof footnotes that I'm adding into this\n\n493\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.350\ndocument, and it's starting to\nkind of clutter up my page.\n\n494\n00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:09.380\nSo maybe it'd be better if I just made\nall of my foot notes into end notes.\n\n495\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.120\nYeah, or I could switch them.\n\n496\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.975\nAll of my end notes go to foot notes and\nfoot notes go to end notes.\n\n497\n00:25:15.975 --> 00:25:17.593\nPretty neat.\n\n498\n00:25:17.593 --> 00:25:19.718\nClick the More button, it's right there.\n\n499\n00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:25.154\nThe convert button, do I want to\nconvert all foot notes to end notes,\n\n500\n00:25:25.154 --> 00:25:29.950\nconvert all end notes to footnotes,\nor swap them.\n\n501\n00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.050\nJust turn them around to where each one\ntakes a different place, end goes to foot,\n\n502\n00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.310\nfoot goes to end.\n\n503\n00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.490\nThe option's there.\n\n504\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.544\nSo let's go with all end notes\nto footnotes, sounds good.\n\n505\n00:25:41.544 --> 00:25:43.560\nClick OK.\n\n506\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.030\nAnd then it should have already applied\ncuz the Apply button is already there.\n\n507\n00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:52.160\nIf I scroll down through my end there,\nokay, well, that's try that again.\n\n508\n00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.640\n[LAUGH] We'll go with convert to,\nyes, all footnotes.\n\n509\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.520\nYou know what, I just got confused.\n\n510\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.320\n&gt;&gt; Another teachable moment.\n\n511\n00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.702\nYou're seeing it right here live.\n\n512\n00:26:04.702 --> 00:26:09.225\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's because I just made all\nend notes the footnotes, I chose that.\n\n513\n00:26:09.225 --> 00:26:10.180\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n514\n00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.470\n&gt;&gt; In my brain, I want the footnotes\nto go to the end notes.\n\n515\n00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.000\nOkay.\n\n516\n00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.930\nWell, you can see how easy, okay,\nfoot, end, which place am I going to.\n\n517\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:24.080\nBut at least now I have all footnotes\ncan be turned into end notes.\n\n518\n00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.488\nThere we go [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:26:25.488 --> 00:26:26.660\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n520\n00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Maybe my mouth was saying the wrong\nthing that my head was thinking,\n\n521\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.260\nthat happens a lot.\n\n522\n00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.495\n&gt;&gt; Could have been the little gerbils in\nthe machine running around backwards.\n\n523\n00:26:34.495 --> 00:26:37.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and\nthen they got in the Tron,\n\n524\n00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.875\nand then they got all confused and\nthey didn't know where to go so.\n\n525\n00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:45.747\nYes, so\nyou should have all of our footnotes,\n\n526\n00:26:45.747 --> 00:26:48.800\nshould be all the way at the end.\n\n527\n00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:54.310\nThere you go, perfect, that was what I was\nintending in my brain but I was getting\n\n528\n00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:59.240\nconfuse at the end and the beginning but\nthe nice thing is Word will let me do that\n\n529\n00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.420\nand now you can see I can convert\nall my end notes back to footnotes.\n\n530\n00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.720\nCuz they are associated with\nthose particulars spaces or\n\n531\n00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.750\nthose paragraph within my document.\n\n532\n00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.700\nAnd at least it's nice to know, hey,\nI could just switch it back and\n\n533\n00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.740\nforth all day long.\n\n534\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.540\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n\n535\n00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.340\n&gt;&gt; And hey, don't forget the biscuits.\n\n536\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.370\nWhen, I think it's in reference to tea.\n\n537\n00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.650\nYes, at tea time,\ndon't forget the biscuits.\n\n538\n00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.050\n&gt;&gt; More tea moved down,\nmore tea moved down.\n\n539\n00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nI think that that covers pretty much\n\n540\n00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.894\neverything I wanted to show you\nabout footnotes and end notes.\n\n541\n00:27:31.894 --> 00:27:34.630\nBiggest thing,\ndon't get confused [LAUGH] about end and\n\n542\n00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.130\nfoots and read the dialog box and\nreally think of where you're going.\n\n543\n00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.690\nBut the nice thing is hey, I have\nthe option of going back and forth and\n\n544\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.040\nI can always switch it back.\n\n545\n00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.990\nAnd just like when anything that\nyou're starting to do with these long\n\n546\n00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:51.380\ndocuments where you're starting to add the\nbibliographies or the table of contents,\n\n547\n00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.510\nit's always good to do a File &gt; Save As,\n\n548\n00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:59.040\nget a clean copy before you start\ndoing some of these major changes.\n\n549\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.895\nFootnotes and end notes\nare pretty safe but just in case,\n\n550\n00:28:02.895 --> 00:28:05.950\nalways have backup, backup, backup.\n\n551\n00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.270\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful, well,\ngreat job as usual, Vonne.\n\n552\n00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:13.160\nLong documents, Microsoft Word 2016\nexpert and this has been Footnotes and\n\n553\n00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.110\nEndnotes, thank you for watching.\n\n554\n00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.580\nHey, remember,\nan Office Pro is always

That would be lovely right now,\nthank you.\n\n25\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.580\nSo we're going to be adding in captions.\n\n26\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.170\nSo what do I think of captions?\n\n27\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.180\nI honestly think closed captioning right\naway in my brain because I actually had\n\n28\n00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.030\na roommate in college who always\nhad closed captions on the TV.\n\n29\n00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.005\nCuz she's bilingual and she said,\nit was just a thing that she's always had\n\n30\n00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:19.596\non to just help her kind of\nread the TV for the most part.\n\n31\n00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:23.520\nAnd so I got used to it and then I started\njust having closed captions on everything.\n\n32\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.324\nSo there's a couple years there\nI just always had them on.\n\n33\n00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:28.160\n[LAUGH] So it was kinda fun.\n\n34\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.420\nBut what was it doing?\n\n35\n00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.818\nIt was saying what is\nbeing said on the TV.\n\n36\n00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:36.383\nAnd then you also think about, okay,\n\n37\n00:01:36.383 --> 00:01:40.002\ncaptions it's a description\nof what is being shown.\n\n38\n00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:44.939\nSo when you talk about captions on\nan image or a table or a chart,\n\n39\n00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.533\nwhat is this about?\n\n40\n00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.906\nAnd you see this a lot in,\nI always think about textbooks, okay?\n\n41\n00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:51.679\nBecause that anatomy and\n\n42\n00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.999\nphysiology textbook I laid out had\na bunch of pictures of skeletal hands and\n\n43\n00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.314\neverything, you had at the bottom\nfigure 1 dash whatever.\n\n44\n00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:04.707\nAnd then the name of that particular\nthing that you're looking at.\n\n45\n00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:07.110\nBecause you need to refer to that.\n\n46\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.990\nWhen you're a teacher and you talk about\nbiology and you go ahead and look at\n\n47\n00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.419\nfigure one dash fifteen, and there's\nthe skeletal structure of your hands.\n\n48\n00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:19.741\nMedic carpals and tarsals.\n\n49\n00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:20.595\n&gt;&gt; Medic tarsals, yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:22.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then, icky parts.\n\n51\n00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:26.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're right,\nall that stuff in there.\n\n52\n00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:31.073\nSo those are the different things that\nwe're gonna be adding into word, and\n\n53\n00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:34.550\nif you have captions added\nto your graphical elements.\n\n54\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.060\nNow that could be a picture,\nit could be a smart art graphic,\n\n55\n00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.300\nit could be a table,\nit could be a shape or a chart.\n\n56\n00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.510\nAny of those elements that you're\nadding in to enhance your document.\n\n57\n00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.630\nYou add a caption to it,\nit will remember all the captions and\n\n58\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.620\nyou can create a table of figures.\n\n59\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.180\nThat means a table of all\nthe captions that you've\n\n60\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.530\nput onto those different elements.\n\n61\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.000\nAnd maybe you have a table of pictures.\n\n62\n00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.263\nThey call it table of figures\ncuz maybe you're doing charts.\n\n63\n00:03:06.263 --> 00:03:07.880\nChart would be maybe a figure.\n\n64\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.634\nBut if you have pictures, maybe you\nwanna have that as a different label for\n\n65\n00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:12.417\nyour caption.\n\n66\n00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:16.259\nThat can be images or\npictures or hullabaloos.\n\n67\n00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:20.593\nI mean you can pick whatever your label is\nthat you wanna put on that caption as long\n\n68\n00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:22.143\nas you use it consistently.\n\n69\n00:03:22.143 --> 00:03:26.080\nYou can say pull all the labels for\nhullabaloos.\n\n70\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.660\nAnd then tell me what page they're on.\n\n71\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.316\nJust like you have a table of contents\nthat we've done in pulling out the heading\n\n72\n00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:34.715\nlevels, pull out heading ones and\ntwos and tell me what page they're on.\n\n73\n00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.380\nIt's the exact same thing.\n\n74\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.260\nSo you have to use both of them together.\n\n75\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.586\nYou have to add captions.\n\n76\n00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:44.890\nYou have to use your labels consistently,\nand make sure you're using labels for\n\n77\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.095\nwhat you want each of\nthe pieces to be labeled as.\n\n78\n00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:52.284\nAnd then you can generate that table of\ntables, table of figures, table of charts,\n\n79\n00:03:52.284 --> 00:03:54.440\nwhatever you're using there in there.\n\n80\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.251\nIt's pretty neat and\nas long as you do it right it'll be fine.\n\n81\n00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:58.445\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I have a question.\n\n82\n00:03:58.445 --> 00:03:59.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm?\n\n83\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.245\n&gt;&gt; Could you show us, please?\n\n84\n00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:01.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Why certainly?\n\n85\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.596\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.\n\n86\n00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:04.690\n&gt;&gt; Let me have an example for you.\n\n87\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n88\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.300\n&gt;&gt; We have Captions Example, mm-hm.\n\n89\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.230\nSo I'll open that up.\n\n90\n00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.819\nSo this is one that is already done.\n\n91\n00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.144\nIf I scroll on down,\nwe have our image one white rabbit.\n\n92\n00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:19.310\nAnd if I click on this,\nit's just a text box.\n\n93\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.020\nSo I didn't create it.\n\n94\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.050\nI didn't do insert text box and\ntype the text in manually.\n\n95\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.270\nI right clicked on this picture,\nand with the Insert.\n\n96\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.100\nIt's little bit behind the head,\nbut you see in the Insert caption.\n\n97\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.120\nThat's where I added the caption\ndirectly to the image.\n\n98\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.291\nSo the text box was created from this.\n\n99\n00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:42.490\nIt's not Insert text box, okay?\n\n100\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.831\nSo that's actually how I just showed\nyou how to Insert the Caption.\n\n101\n00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:46.690\nWe'll come back around to that.\n\n102\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.570\nSo there's where I have my\ntext box connected to it.\n\n103\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.630\nIt goes right underneath the picture\nbecause I chose to put it there.\n\n104\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.539\nAnd it is an option when you start doing\nyour Inset Captions in the dialog box\n\n105\n00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.040\nbefore you can choose them.\n\n106\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.360\nLet's scroll on down.\n\n107\n00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.380\nWe've got a very cute little pig.\n\n108\n00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.910\n&gt;&gt; He's so cute.\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that adorable?\n\n109\n00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.054\nYes, so.\n\n110\n00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.510\nAnd then we came down here,\nbut now look at this.\n\n111\n00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.989\nThis is not image 3.\n\n112\n00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:10.558\nWell, because it's not an image.\n\n113\n00:05:10.558 --> 00:05:11.221\nIt's a table.\n\n114\n00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:12.062\n&gt;&gt; It's a table, yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:15.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I use a different label.\n\n116\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.403\nSo I have tables in here,\nso I have table 1,\n\n117\n00:05:17.403 --> 00:05:21.726\nof course you think there's another table\nin here that's probably gonna be table 2.\n\n118\n00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:22.925\n&gt;&gt; Table 2.\n\n119\n00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:26.400\n&gt;&gt; But keep on scrolling down,\nall those baby sea turtles.\n\n120\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.970\nThey're back with their\ncute little bathing suits.\n\n121\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.780\nSo image three it re-numbered because\nI'm using that particular label again.\n\n122\n00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.573\nSo I can keep on scrolling down\nhere to go, this is a figure one.\n\n123\n00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:44.601\nCuz me this is more of a figure, it's\nnot a table, and yeah it's an image but.\n\n124\n00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:45.721\n&gt;&gt; Like an art object?\n\n125\n00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's that smart art again.\n\n126\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.890\nSo I wanted to name this a figure,\nor label it,\n\n127\n00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.880\nwe should use that correct terminology,\nokay?\n\n128\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.750\nAnd you keep on going on down and\nthere's my second table.\n\n129\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.290\nThere's some more images.\n\n130\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:05.100\nNotice that the image caption is below but\nthe figure is above.\n\n131\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.341\nStylistic purposes.\n\n132\n00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:10.720\nI just decided to put it on\nthe top rather than on the bottom.\n\n133\n00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.396\n&gt;&gt; So you can customize that?\n\n134\n00:06:12.396 --> 00:06:15.466\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can say whether\nyou want it on the top and\n\n135\n00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:19.726\nthat way you could hav whether it's\nan image, a figure, or a table.\n\n136\n00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:23.159\nI can put it always on\nthe bottom to stay consistent.\n\n137\n00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.694\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n138\n00:06:23.694 --> 00:06:28.040\n&gt;&gt; But maybe it's just because\nof way I've seen books, as well,\n\n139\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.970\nI always tend to see figures or\ntables on the top for some reason.\n\n140\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.620\nOr maybe it's just in my brain\nthat I've only seen it that way or\n\n141\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.335\nthis is just what I\nwanted it to look like.\n\n142\n00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:38.057\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I think your brain is\n\n143\n00:06:38.057 --> 00:06:38.857\nfine because I agree with it.\n\n144\n00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:39.857\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wonderful.\n\n145\n00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:40.664\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n146\n00:06:40.664 --> 00:06:43.945\n&gt;&gt; So you can put that on the top or\nthe bottom and\n\n147\n00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:49.642\nthen once you get all of your captions,\nyou can generate a table of figures.\n\n148\n00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:52.285\nAnd choose the labels of\nwhat you wanna generate.\n\n149\n00:06:52.285 --> 00:06:54.010\nSo that's my example.\n\n150\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.230\nLet's come back into a document that\ndoesn't have any captions on it just yet,\n\n151\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.000\nand I will show you how to do that.\n\n152\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.050\nSo I already kind of showed you\nalready by selecting the thing,\n\n153\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.530\nthe graphical element, so\nwe'll click on this white rabbit.\n\n154\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.710\nAnd right clicking is one way,\n\n155\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.240\nI believe, can we put it in,\nI think it's in the references?\n\n156\n00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.527\nThere it is, Insert Caption, okay.\n\n157\n00:07:18.527 --> 00:07:23.382\nThere's another place that I can insert,\nand it says label your picture or\n\n158\n00:07:23.382 --> 00:07:25.550\nobject, and then you can use it.\n\n159\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.632\nIt actually talks about that\ncross-reference we talked about\n\n160\n00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:30.440\nin our cross-references episode.\n\n161\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.320\nI like to right click,\ngo to Insert Caption and\n\n162\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.150\nhere is my dialogue box for\nwhat do I want this to be.\n\n163\n00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.940\nAnd it automatically put figure one\nsince it's seen that this is the first\n\n164\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.050\none that I'm adding in.\n\n165\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:51.590\nIt's the first one in the succession\nof the document, but I named it image.\n\n166\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.492\nThere's no image in here.\n\n167\n00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:55.399\nIt just has an equation,\nfigure, and table.\n\n168\n00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:56.553\nHow did you make image?\n\n169\n00:07:56.553 --> 00:08:00.906\nI made my own label, remember how I\nsaid you can make your label hullabaloo?\n\n170\n00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:05.330\nWell, to make much sense, but\nyou can make whatever word or\n\n171\n00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:11.180\nphrase that you would like to have as\nthe label of your graphical elements.\n\n172\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:17.012\nSo, I will say new label, and\nwe'll say image, and I'll click OK.\n\n173\n00:08:17.012 --> 00:08:21.538\nAnd be careful with that space because\nI added, last time when I was trying\n\n174\n00:08:21.538 --> 00:08:25.493\nthis out Image space and it kept it,\nso it did image space space.\n\n175\n00:08:25.493 --> 00:08:27.492\nAnd then the automatic numbering and\n\n176\n00:08:27.492 --> 00:08:30.143\nI said no no I gotta make\nI get that off of there.\n\n177\n00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:32.750\nSo, just a little FYI be\ncareful about that one.\n\n178\n00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:39.076\nSo were do I want to position this, below\nselected item, or above so that's why\n\n179\n00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:44.585\nwe have the up or down, and the numbering,\ndo I want it to be numbers, 1, 2, 3?\n\n180\n00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:45.270\nDo I want it to be A, B, C?\n\n181\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.890\nHow do I want that to be?\n\n182\n00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.188\nIf I had a chapter number,\n\n183\n00:08:50.188 --> 00:08:55.101\nnow that is where we talked\nabout using the chapters in,\n\n184\n00:08:55.101 --> 00:09:00.132\nI believe, the page layout\nIn the Word Essentials show.\n\n185\n00:09:00.132 --> 00:09:02.837\nI wanted to say that's where we went to,\nbecause that's where we did page numbers.\n\n186\n00:09:02.837 --> 00:09:07.306\nAnd so, you do have to have documents\nsectioned and you have to use\n\n187\n00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:12.280\nyour headings to make sure that you\nhave that as you start of the chapter.\n\n188\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.090\nSo there are some connections that you\nwould have to make before you start\n\n189\n00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:16.860\nchecking this off.\n\n190\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.660\nIt's like, yeah, that's what I wanna do.\n\n191\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.950\nIt has to be sectioned properly and\nyou have to make sure you use the heading\n\n192\n00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:27.100\nstyles to indicate where that\nchapter starts within your document.\n\n193\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.930\nSo definitely go back and\ncheck that episode out if you wanna\n\n194\n00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.380\nlearn a little bit more about chapters and\nstuff.\n\n195\n00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.670\n&gt;&gt; Just throwing it out there, can you put\nthe caption to the side, left to right?\n\n196\n00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.100\n&gt;&gt; That is not an option.\n\n197\n00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.470\nIn the default setting of, and\n\n198\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.130\nI'm gonna cancel out of this where\nit's like image above or below.\n\n199\n00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:49.010\nBut it's funny you say that\nbecause the caption that we're\n\n200\n00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:54.070\ngoing to be adding to this,\nit's not connected to the picture.\n\n201\n00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.245\nI'll show you what I mean, and\n\n202\n00:09:56.245 --> 00:10:01.358\nthat's where you technically could\nmove it to the side if you wanted to.\n\n203\n00:10:01.358 --> 00:10:02.355\nSo yeah, keep that thought.\n\n204\n00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:04.056\n&gt;&gt; I will.\n\n205\n00:10:04.056 --> 00:10:07.804\n&gt;&gt; For every reason that you would\nwant to it could, let's keep going.\n\n206\n00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:09.450\n[LAUGH] That's a great question.\n\n207\n00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.430\nSo below I'll say that and\nthen I need to put in the text.\n\n208\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.410\nSo I say Image 1.\n\n209\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:20.110\nI'm gonna use a colon and then space,\nand I'll say White Rabbit.\n\n210\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.280\nSo you do have to type in\nthe text of what the image\n\n211\n00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.360\nis actually about and\nthen we click okay and there you go.\n\n212\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.330\nThere's that text box and this is\nthe one that were to me I would think\n\n213\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.850\nthat if I'm adding the caption\nto this particular element,\n\n214\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.240\nif I move the element\nit should move with it.\n\n215\n00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.643\nBut if I take this picture and\nI move it over you see that text box,\n\n216\n00:10:45.643 --> 00:10:48.182\nthat caption doesn't come with it.\n\n217\n00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:48.912\n&gt;&gt; No, it didn't.\n\n218\n00:10:48.912 --> 00:10:53.780\n&gt;&gt; No, to me okay, but\nit should kinda come together.\n\n219\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.610\nAnd I've looked this up and\n\n220\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.340\nthey're like well the really only way\nyou could do it is, you can group them.\n\n221\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.500\nYou can select both of them.\n\n222\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.110\nAnd then once you group it\nthen it moves together.\n\n223\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.390\nAnd then you put the text wrap and\n\n224\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.800\neverything in a positioning\naround the whole group.\n\n225\n00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.020\nThat seems like a lot of work.\n\n226\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.280\nA lot more work than it\nshould be connected to it.\n\n227\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.746\nWho knows?\nMaybe in the next update they'll\n\n228\n00:11:14.746 --> 00:11:15.421\nstart doing that.\n\n229\n00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:18.060\nBut it's been this way for a while.\n\n230\n00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.298\nTo just know that,\nthey're not gonna move together.\n\n231\n00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:25.500\nSo, that's bringing to your point,\nif I wanted to move it over,\n\n232\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.090\nI could put it over to the side or\never I would want the caption to go,\n\n233\n00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.360\nindependently from the other part.\n\n234\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.820\n&gt;&gt; But I think, getting back to your\npoint of sometimes less is more,\n\n235\n00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.540\nof keeping it simple.\n\n236\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.020\nMost people are gonna put that\ncaption underneath or above.\n\n237\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.660\nThat just makes sense.\n\n238\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.390\nif it's graphically it makes sense.\n\n239\n00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.685\nSo I was just being a little zak.\n\n240\n00:11:47.685 --> 00:11:51.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, but, people will ask that.\n\n241\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.680\nWell, why can't I leave it over?\n\n242\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.520\nBut you can.\n\n243\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.430\nSo you could take it, but\n\n244\n00:11:55.430 --> 00:12:01.250\nyou're saying to keep the functionality\nof making this easy for you.\n\n245\n00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.470\nJust keep whatever the default is and\nmove on.\n\n246\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.470\nNow as soon as I said keep the default.\n\n247\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.887\nI immediately say what if I wanted\nto change the look of this?\n\n248\n00:12:09.887 --> 00:12:11.690\n[LAUGH].\nIt is connected to a style.\n\n249\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.450\nSo if I come over here, and\nI'll select the text you can see it.\n\n250\n00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.480\nIf i come over here to home, and\n\n251\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.560\nI drop this down,\nthere is a style called caption.\n\n252\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.980\nSo just like we talked about\nin all of our style episodes.\n\n253\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.410\nYou could come in and modify this.\n\n254\n00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.950\nAnd I could them all green or\n\n255\n00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.580\npink or change the font size or\nchange the font all together.\n\n256\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.980\nSo you can change all of the look\nof how the caption is being\n\n257\n00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.270\nshown on the document by\ncontrolling the styles.\n\n258\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.841\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Just keep that.\n\n259\n00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:48.130\nI don't mind the default formatting of it,\nso I'm cool with it.\n\n260\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.260\nWe can keep going, but in case anybody\nelse is doing kind of the well,\n\n261\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.080\nwhat if I wanna do this,\nwhat if I wanna do that.\n\n262\n00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.790\nAnd I do the same thing, so\nI like your train of thought.\n\n263\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.325\n&gt;&gt; That's my multi chatty brain.\n\n264\n00:12:58.325 --> 00:13:02.254\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know how that goes.\n\n265\n00:13:02.254 --> 00:13:03.480\n[LAUGH] So we'll keep on scrolling down.\n\n266\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.420\nWe can go-\n&gt;&gt; Bring that pig again, he's so cute.\n\n267\n00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.300\n&gt;&gt; He's so cute, right?\n\n268\n00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.927\nSo we'll add or caption, and\nnote, it does say, image, too,\n\n269\n00:13:10.927 --> 00:13:15.843\nbecause it was the label that I started,\nand we will go A Cute Piggy.\n\n270\n00:13:15.843 --> 00:13:19.030\nAnd we will keep going, it goes below.\n\n271\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.990\nHere's this table.\n\n272\n00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.220\nThis isn't an image.\n\n273\n00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.520\nSo I want to add the caption here.\n\n274\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:30.290\nThe easiest way is to select the whole\ntable, and then, right-click it.\n\n275\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.220\nYou still have the references tab,\n\n276\n00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.800\nbut I always just like to go ahead and\nright-click on it.\n\n277\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.440\nAnd we can insert the caption,\nin this sense,\n\n278\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.636\nwe would definitely make this a table.\n\n279\n00:13:39.636 --> 00:13:41.800\nAutomatically start re-numbering and\n\n280\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:47.590\nit remembers all of them and\nI can say, Sea turtles of Florida.\n\n281\n00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.760\nSea turtles of Florida.\n\n282\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.420\nWell, I guess we have some land turtles\non there, so we'll just say turtles.\n\n283\n00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.320\n&gt;&gt; As long as you spell it T-U-R-D.\n\n284\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeay, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n285\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.040\n&gt;&gt; Just saying.\n\n286\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.710\n&gt;&gt; So we'll look like OK.\n\n287\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.970\nAnd we go there, and you can see that\nwe can start doing all of our different\n\n288\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.882\nlabels, or captions, or captions with\nour labels, with our different elements.\n\n289\n00:14:10.882 --> 00:14:12.612\nAnd I can choose to go, and\n\n290\n00:14:12.612 --> 00:14:17.751\nthat one I didn't even point out that\nthe table in it just defaulted to above.\n\n291\n00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:20.120\nAnd the image one that defaulted to below.\n\n292\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.931\nSo if you can pick it,\nit's totally up to you.\n\n293\n00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:28.740\nAnd that way you start adding those\ncaptions in and changing the labels and\n\n294\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:29.610\nthe numbering.\n\n295\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:36.120\nBut back to the whole numbering thing,\nthis is where I would highly suggest\n\n296\n00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.680\nif you're gonna start adding captions\ninto your documents, really great.\n\n297\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.740\nDo it the last.\n\n298\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.590\nDo it very last thing that you do,\n\n299\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.150\nwhere you know that this is\nwhere we're gonna set the text.\n\n300\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.732\nThis is where everything's going,\ndo all of your edits.\n\n301\n00:14:50.732 --> 00:14:53.514\nEspecially if you're working with say,\nlike an author, and\n\n302\n00:14:53.514 --> 00:14:55.867\nthey're the ones that's\ngoing to be proofing, and\n\n303\n00:14:55.867 --> 00:14:59.250\nthere's always going to be proofing,\nand I really want to move this down.\n\n304\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.903\nTry as much as possible to\nget it in its finality.\n\n305\n00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.113\nFinality?\n\n306\n00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.005\n&gt;&gt; Final.\n\n307\n00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.802\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the [SOUND] wow.\n\n308\n00:15:08.802 --> 00:15:12.446\nThe final setup-\n&gt;&gt; It's the final countdown.\n\n309\n00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:15.361\n[SOUND] Sorry, my gosh.\n\n310\n00:15:15.361 --> 00:15:18.078\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can't avoid it, can you?\n\n311\n00:15:18.078 --> 00:15:21.620\n[LAUGH] But yes, just make sure,\nit's singing in my head right now.\n\n312\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.220\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there goes that brain worm.\n\n313\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.356\n&gt;&gt; Try to get it in its final form and\nthat way when you start adding things,\n\n314\n00:15:28.356 --> 00:15:33.591\nyou hopefully won't have to worry\nabout updating some of these things.\n\n315\n00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:38.249\nBecause it does get slightly wonky,\nbut I will tell you how to work\n\n316\n00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:42.945\naround that seems to work out for\nthe most part, most of the time.\n\n317\n00:15:42.945 --> 00:15:45.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah because what would happen is, so\n\n318\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.340\nlet's say you changed your caption.\n\n319\n00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.635\nIt's gonna move everything down.\n\n320\n00:15:51.635 --> 00:15:56.442\nYou're not number one anymore, you become\nnumber two or three or even whatever.\n\n321\n00:15:56.442 --> 00:15:59.822\n&gt;&gt; You go way on down the line Yeah and\nthat's the thing right here,\n\n322\n00:15:59.822 --> 00:16:01.586\nif I wanna had and got rid of this.\n\n323\n00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:05.220\nAnd you can just, the easiest way on this,\nyou could go ahead and\n\n324\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.442\ndelete the text box.\n\n325\n00:16:06.442 --> 00:16:08.900\nWhen you delete the text box it's gone.\n\n326\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.450\nSo now I don't have a caption on here.\n\n327\n00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.513\nSo let's scroll on down,\nthat still says image two, and\n\n328\n00:16:15.513 --> 00:16:18.572\nthen the next one is\ngonna say image three.\n\n329\n00:16:18.572 --> 00:16:19.242\nAnd everything.\n\n330\n00:16:19.242 --> 00:16:23.543\nSo it didn't automatically do it when\nyou delete the caption out there.\n\n331\n00:16:23.543 --> 00:16:25.927\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now you could come into here cuz this,\n\n332\n00:16:25.927 --> 00:16:27.420\nthis is a field, right?\n\n333\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.430\nThe automatic numbering, is the field that\nhappens because of the way that we're\n\n334\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.410\nusing this particular function.\n\n335\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.510\nI can right click and\nI can update this field.\n\n336\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.460\nWe've talked about updating our\nfields in the table of contents,\n\n337\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.790\nand also with our formulas.\n\n338\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.970\nSo this is not necessarily a new feature,\nor a new thing that we're talked about.\n\n339\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.160\nIt's just correlating into captions and I\nclick update field, and yeah there we go.\n\n340\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.720\nThat turned to cute pig number one.\n\n341\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.410\nBut let's go on down.\n\n342\n00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.692\nThis still says image three.\n\n343\n00:16:56.692 --> 00:17:00.342\nSo if I have to go through and\ndo each one individually, that's not so-\n\n344\n00:17:00.342 --> 00:17:01.423\n&gt;&gt; It could take a while.\n\n345\n00:17:01.423 --> 00:17:01.942\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n346\n00:17:01.942 --> 00:17:05.710\nEspecially if I've got 100 captions in\nthere that might take a little while.\n\n347\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.540\nSo you look this up on Microsoft, and\n\n348\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.872\nit will tell you to go ahead and\ndo a Select All.\n\n349\n00:17:11.872 --> 00:17:13.011\nCTRL-A.\n\n350\n00:17:13.011 --> 00:17:15.445\nCTRL-A for selecting all.\n\n351\n00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:19.940\nAnd then you right-click or\nthey actually give the shortcut of F9.\n\n352\n00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.205\nBut I don't have a function\nkey on my Virtual Machine, so\n\n353\n00:17:23.205 --> 00:17:25.840\nI know that F9 is update field.\n\n354\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.530\nSo if I update the field,\nit still didn't work.\n\n355\n00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.210\nWell that's because\nthat's the other thing.\n\n356\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.340\nI thought, well that's interesting\nbecause captions are text boxes.\n\n357\n00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.540\nAnd text boxes, while it's still\ntext it's still a graphical element.\n\n358\n00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.880\nWe were actually just looking this up.\n\n359\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.662\nIf you saw the episode that we just did,\nwhich was the.\n\n360\n00:17:45.662 --> 00:17:47.299\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Graphical elements.\n\n361\n00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:50.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Footnotes and end notes.\n\n362\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.730\nWow.\nSo where it's like, I know,\n\n363\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.755\nthat's why you can't add\na footnote to a Smart Art graphic.\n\n364\n00:17:54.755 --> 00:17:55.953\nCuz it doesn't really see it as text.\n\n365\n00:17:55.953 --> 00:17:57.289\nIt's seeing it as a graphic.\n\n366\n00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:58.141\n&gt;&gt; As an object, right.\n\n367\n00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:00.947\n&gt;&gt; And I did look that up, and it's true.\n\n368\n00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:02.972\nIt says, yes, it doesn't work that way.\n\n369\n00:18:02.972 --> 00:18:08.133\nAnd then, on the same kind of thread,\nthere was talk about text boxes.\n\n370\n00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:11.265\nAnd they were like, well, yeah,\ntext boxes while it's text,\n\n371\n00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:14.110\nthat's still in the drawing\nlayer of the document.\n\n372\n00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:19.710\nSo it still sees that as the graphical\nelement, even though it has text in it.\n\n373\n00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.700\nSo when I got to this,\nwe'll select all and then update.\n\n374\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:30.778\nIt's only updating the fields that it sees\nin the document, not in the drawing layer.\n\n375\n00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:35.050\nSo, it's not working for me either.\n\n376\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.170\nNow if it works for you that's fine.\n\n377\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:38.960\nFantastic.\n\n378\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.460\nThat's wonderful.\n\n379\n00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.410\nSo I started to consult the oracle.\n\n380\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.865\nI was like well, why isn't it updating.\n\n381\n00:18:44.865 --> 00:18:47.488\nAnd I found and\nthen this is after the show notes so,\n\n382\n00:18:47.488 --> 00:18:50.113\nI don't have the website\npulled up just right now.\n\n383\n00:18:50.113 --> 00:18:51.860\nBut the thing there's a little trick.\n\n384\n00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.951\nIf you switch into the print preview and\nthen come back.\n\n385\n00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:58.018\nIt forces the update for you.\n\n386\n00:18:58.018 --> 00:18:59.140\nI was like [SOUND].\n\n387\n00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.760\nSo let's watch.\n\n388\n00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.692\nWe did image two.\n\n389\n00:19:01.692 --> 00:19:05.101\nWe did the right click and\nupdated that field.\n\n390\n00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:06.456\nLet's go over to File.\n\n391\n00:19:06.456 --> 00:19:12.092\nWe'll come over to Print, which is really\njust taking me into Print Preview.\n\n392\n00:19:12.092 --> 00:19:14.316\nCome back and then look.\n\n393\n00:19:14.316 --> 00:19:16.610\nIf you look at the,\nthat one was already done.\n\n394\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.110\nThere's image two now.\n\n395\n00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:25.960\nAnd the other ones have changed as well,\nwhen I come down to, wow.\n\n396\n00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.110\nI thought I had it, there.\n\n397\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.230\nImage three and so on and so forth, so.\n\n398\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.760\n&gt;&gt; It's magical again.\n\n399\n00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.016\n&gt;&gt; It worked, so\nthat fix that I found on the community,\n\n400\n00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:38.052\nlike the answers.microsoft.com.\n\n401\n00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:38.839\nIt worked.\n\n402\n00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:40.540\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So there's your trick.\n\n403\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.659\nIf you wanna update it and\nyou delete something or\n\n404\n00:19:43.659 --> 00:19:48.603\nyou add one, you delete one and\nit's not updating everything, Select All,\n\n405\n00:19:48.603 --> 00:19:51.356\nUpdate, Print Preview, then come back.\n\n406\n00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:54.740\n[LAUGH] And then it works just fine.\n\n407\n00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.242\nSo there's my little fix for you on how to\nget things around, and again your captions\n\n408\n00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:05.223\ndon't move, I was just looking at my\nnotes and I already talked about that.\n\n409\n00:20:05.223 --> 00:20:07.650\n[LAUGH] So we talked about how\nthey don't move around together.\n\n410\n00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.880\nSo you get through all of\nthe different adding of your captions.\n\n411\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.163\nIn this particular example,\nI have them all done.\n\n412\n00:20:15.163 --> 00:20:23.772\nLet's undo just to go back to where we\nhave the white rabbit at our image one.\n\n413\n00:20:23.772 --> 00:20:27.330\nSo I want to now insert\nthat table of figures.\n\n414\n00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.620\nWe'll make a new page.\n\n415\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.830\nLet's click our cursor\non Alice in Wonderland.\n\n416\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.360\nWe'll do a Ctrl+ Enter for\ncreating a page.\n\n417\n00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.150\nI'll turn the show high buttons back on so\nwe can see that.\n\n418\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.170\nI have to hit Enter one more\ntime to get my up there.\n\n419\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:45.207\nAnd just like the table of contents, we've\ndone it correctly by adding the captions,\n\n420\n00:20:45.207 --> 00:20:51.012\nand the tables, and the figures, and all\nthe captions to our graphical elements.\n\n421\n00:20:51.012 --> 00:20:56.702\nGet our cursor to where want\nto create a table of figures.\n\n422\n00:20:56.702 --> 00:20:57.220\nClick there.\n\n423\n00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.970\nJust like our table of contents,\n\n424\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.070\nwe have some different formattings\nthat we can choose from.\n\n425\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.890\nWhether we want a distinctive,\nor formal, or classic.\n\n426\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.870\nI'll go with, formal looks good.\n\n427\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.030\nAll of this is going to\nbe entered in as a style.\n\n428\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.310\nSo you can always go back and\nchange the style if you wanted to,\n\n429\n00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.650\nafterwards if it doesn't\nlook the right way.\n\n430\n00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:24.770\nWhat label do I want to pull out\nto create that table of whatever?\n\n431\n00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.580\nI want to pull out the images.\n\n432\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.850\nSo anything that has a caption of\nimage whatever, include the label and\n\n433\n00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.830\nthe page number,\nit will create hyperlinks for it and\n\n434\n00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.350\nthen you click OK and then there it is.\n\n435\n00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.370\nI have a table of figures just like that.\n\n436\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.103\nMaybe I want to make a Table-of-Tables.\n\n437\n00:21:44.103 --> 00:21:49.391\nOkay maybe I'll hit Enter and\nwe'll say a Table of images.\n\n438\n00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:52.370\nImages gotta put a different style.\n\n439\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.394\nSorry, can't help it.\n\n440\n00:21:54.394 --> 00:21:55.871\nPerfect [LAUGH] table of tables.\n\n441\n00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:58.311\nTable-of-Tables.\n\n442\n00:21:58.311 --> 00:21:59.279\n&gt;&gt; Table of tables.\n\n443\n00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:03.356\n&gt;&gt; Table of tables and then same thing,\nwhoops let me scroll down,\n\n444\n00:22:03.356 --> 00:22:05.180\nlet me get to my references.\n\n445\n00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.230\nCursor's in the right place that I want.\n\n446\n00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:12.043\nI'll insert my table of figures and\nthen change the label to table,\n\n447\n00:22:12.043 --> 00:22:16.771\nand now I have my Table-of-Tables,\nand I can do the same thing for\n\n448\n00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:19.150\nmy figures and so on and so forth.\n\n449\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.964\nAnd this is where,\nif you did need to change some things,\n\n450\n00:22:22.964 --> 00:22:26.697\nmaybe I took one out,\nwe'll take out the white rabbit,\n\n451\n00:22:26.697 --> 00:22:30.281\nmaybe I've taken out\nthe whole picture altogether.\n\n452\n00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:33.450\nSo I've just deleted,\nI selected both of those items.\n\n453\n00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:37.270\nI'm gonna do my Ctrl+A and\nforce my update.\n\n454\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.670\nWe will update the fields.\n\n455\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.250\nNow this is where I do, I wanna update\nevery, I would update everything because\n\n456\n00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.043\nyou're also going to be updating\nyour table at the same time.\n\n457\n00:22:46.043 --> 00:22:50.407\nBecause I did that Ctrl+A.\n\n458\n00:22:50.407 --> 00:22:52.272\nSo now it's taken that out.\n\n459\n00:22:52.272 --> 00:22:57.031\nBut it still says, see it says image 2,\n3, 4 So let's force that back over.\n\n460\n00:22:57.031 --> 00:23:03.440\nLet's go into our Print Preview and then\nit should, let's update one more time.\n\n461\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.020\nWe will update our fields and\nwe'll update the entire table.\n\n462\n00:23:08.242 --> 00:23:09.160\nThere you go.\n\n463\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.140\nIt just switched.\n\n464\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.770\nI did that twice because\nit was updating everything.\n\n465\n00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.930\nBut again, due to that force, so\nif you change something in your document,\n\n466\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:20.090\nmake sure you come back and update your\ntable of figures, just like you would\n\n467\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.121\nupdating your table of contents, or\nyour index, or anything like that.\n\n468\n00:23:24.121 --> 00:23:26.701\n&gt;&gt;

ProTV,\nhelping you learn where ever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:15.141\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Microsoft Word 2016\n\n5\n00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:16.793\nexpert long documents.\n\n6\n00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:21.162\nAnd we are going to learn right\nnow what the master document\n\n7\n00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.311\nmaster document is all about.\n\n8\n00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:25.540\nVonne Smith's got the information for\nus right here.\n\n9\n00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.681\n&gt;&gt; Yes thank you,\nwe are going to master those documents and\n\n10\n00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.459\nput them all into one document.\n\n11\n00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:32.650\nWe're gonna make sure-\n&gt;&gt; It becomes a master document.\n\n12\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.216\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes and\nthey will be controlled, and\n\n13\n00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:39.271\nwe are the masters of the universe and-\n&gt;&gt; She has the power..\n\n14\n00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:42.499\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] I love that.\n\n15\n00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:45.009\nSo yes, what is a master document?\n\n16\n00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:46.574\nI guess we should start there.\n\n17\n00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:49.790\nSo it is, it's the master document.\n\n18\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the place that you have\n\n19\n00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:58.150\nas a single file but\nconnections to other files.\n\n20\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.950\nSo this is even more\nthan just linked objects,\n\n21\n00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.390\ncuz we've talked about linked\nobjects in some other shows and\n\n22\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.650\nepisodes where we connected\nan Excel spreadsheet into Word.\n\n23\n00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.550\nSo if you made changes in Excel,\nthen it would go ahead and populate and\n\n24\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.930\nshow in your Word document.\n\n25\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.320\nBut, the thing was, if you changed any\n\n26\n00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.820\nof the information into that linked\nobject in Word, it didn't go backwards.\n\n27\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820\nOkay, it was just kind of\na one-way communication street.\n\n28\n00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.420\nIn this sense,\nwhen you're creating a master document\n\n29\n00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.520\nyou are creating what are known\nas sub-documents in that.\n\n30\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.035\nAnd then, those documents are from other\nplaces, and it's a two-way communication.\n\n31\n00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:42.750\nSo if you update the sub-document,\nit will update in the master document.\n\n32\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.960\nBut if you change that in the master\ndocument, it updates here too.\n\n33\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.180\nSo they're totally connected.\n\n34\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.210\nAnd this is, where would you use this?\n\n35\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.790\nWhy would I use a master\ndocument with sub documents.\n\n36\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.670\nSay you're writing a book.\n\n37\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.110\nWe've talked about these long documents.\n\n38\n00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.188\nWell instead of having the entire\nbook in one Word file,\n\n39\n00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.750\nyou could have chapter\none as a separate file.\n\n40\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.668\nChapter two, chapter three,\nchapter four, chapter five, so\n\n41\n00:02:09.668 --> 00:02:12.684\nyou can work on them in smaller chunks.\n\n42\n00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:13.193\nAnd hey,\n\n43\n00:02:13.193 --> 00:02:17.470\nsay if you're doing this in collaboration\nwith other people with your office.\n\n44\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.229\nSo maybe you're not even doing chapters.\n\n45\n00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:22.475\nMaybe it's an annual report and I'm in\ncharge of the marketing department and\n\n46\n00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.307\nyou're in charge of\nthe advertising department and\n\n47\n00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:27.710\nsomebody else is in\ncharge of the other one.\n\n48\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.195\nSo they all have their own pieces of\nthe whole report that we have to do.\n\n49\n00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:36.711\nBut I'm just gonna assign you to just go\nahead and do the stuff in the advertising.\n\n50\n00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:41.493\nAnd then send me the file and\nthen I will compile them all together into\n\n51\n00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:45.790\none master document and\nbe able to kinda connect it all there.\n\n52\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.170\nSo it's a nice way to kinda\nbreak up a bigger project.\n\n53\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.650\n&gt;&gt; It's also, isn't it,\n\n54\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.875\nanother way of having a backup of a backup\nof a backup if you think about it.\n\n55\n00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:54.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Somewhat.\n\n56\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n57\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.779\n&gt;&gt; In this sense though,\nI would say make a backup of that backup.\n\n58\n00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it is connected.\n\n59\n00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:03.066\n&gt;&gt; Okay, right, that's right.\n\n60\n00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.022\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n61\n00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:05.286\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n&gt;&gt; That's where it's not\n\n62\n00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:06.302\na two way communicate.\n\n63\n00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:08.283\nIt's not a one way communication\nit's that two way.\n\n64\n00:03:08.283 --> 00:03:12.513\nIn that sense I would say,\nwell if they gave it to me and\n\n65\n00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:15.808\nemailed it to me, I had it on my computer.\n\n66\n00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:20.010\nAnything that I do on my connections\nto those files is gonna be from me and\n\n67\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.050\nI don't have any connections to your\nparticular document on your computer.\n\n68\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.980\nBut, take that one step further.\n\n69\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.200\nWhat if I had everything on\na shared network drive and\n\n70\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.360\nthen everybody has access to it.\n\n71\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.800\nAnd in my master document I'm using the\none that you created, but you go in and\n\n72\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.780\nstart changing your document but\nI've connected into the master,\n\n73\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.870\nthen it's gonna change there.\n\n74\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.840\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna change everything.\n\n75\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you do need to be careful\nabout all of the connections and\n\n76\n00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.010\nthe links and who has access to them.\n\n77\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.470\nAnd if you're done, there is an important\nstep there if you can create a link,\n\n78\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.740\nyou can also break a link.\n\n79\n00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.924\nSo then I say let's break it and\n\n80\n00:03:57.924 --> 00:04:02.462\nmake this master document not\nhave any connection to that file.\n\n81\n00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:04.936\nSo that way the master stays intact and\n\n82\n00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:09.422\nany changes that you do in the sub\ndocuments won't change anymore and\n\n83\n00:04:09.422 --> 00:04:13.074\nit just becomes a big document\nwith a lot of text in it,.\n\n84\n00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:15.239\nYou just got it from a different place and\n\n85\n00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.610\nthen you broke that connection\nwhen you're ready to be done.\n\n86\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.490\n&gt;&gt; It's always better\nto be safe than sorry.\n\n87\n00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.698\n&gt;&gt; Definitely [LAUGH].\n\n88\n00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:22.699\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.690\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna start by\nshowing a couple examples.\n\n90\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.690\n&gt;&gt; So pretty.\n\n91\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.540\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that nice?\n\n92\n00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.650\nIt's so calm and relaxing.\n\n93\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.030\nIt's a timber lake.\n\n94\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.160\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n95\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.710\n&gt;&gt; Did you see that?\n\n96\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.930\n&gt;&gt; Timber, lake.\n\n97\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.605\nJustin Timberlake, yeah,\nI did all of this on purpose.\n\n98\n00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.470\n[LAUGH] There was thought behind it.\n\n99\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.530\nSometimes I won't have a lot of thought\nbehind things but in this one I did.\n\n100\n00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.200\n&gt;&gt; And Justin, if you're watching I worked\nwith you when you were 13 years old in\n\n101\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.400\nthe MIckey Mouse Club.\n\n102\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.540\nJust remember, Zach,\nZach from Disney MGM Studios.\n\n103\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.985\nOkay, sorry, go ahead.\n\n104\n00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm so jealous.\n\n105\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.885\nOkay, so we have our sub documents\nhere of down the rabbit hole.\n\n106\n00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:04.601\nThis is just a part of the big document\nthat we've been working on throughout\n\n107\n00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:05.540\nthese shows.\n\n108\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.159\nAnd so I have down the rabbit hole and\nI have it formatted and\n\n109\n00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.184\nthere is a section break right there.\n\n110\n00:05:13.184 --> 00:05:18.873\nOkay, so I just want to point out, there\nis a section break in this sub document.\n\n111\n00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:21.860\nAnd all the styles that we're using.\n\n112\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.430\nThat's another thing that if\nyou start using sub documents,\n\n113\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.208\nyou kinda wanna try to plan\na little bit ahead and try to keep\n\n114\n00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:34.975\na lot of the same formatting and\nmake sure you're using the same headings.\n\n115\n00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:38.258\nAnd try to stay consistent across it\nbecause if you do, it's going to make your\n\n116\n00:05:38.258 --> 00:05:41.074\nlife a lot easier when you bring\nit back into that master document.\n\n117\n00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.553\nBecause while it will go ahead and\n\n118\n00:05:43.553 --> 00:05:48.610\ntake on the master stylistically\nyou might have some small issues.\n\n119\n00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.420\nSo try to stay as consistent as\npossible to avoid more headaches at\n\n120\n00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.810\nthe end when you bringing them\nall into that master document.\n\n121\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.190\n&gt;&gt; Better be safe than sorry.\n\n122\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.400\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yes.\n\n123\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.630\nAnd try to keep all of\nthis stuff together.\n\n124\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.630\nSame thing, you can probably\nthe idea here with the nights.\n\n125\n00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.270\nI do not have a section break\nat the end of the nights.\n\n126\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.333\nI'm also just reminding myself, cuz I know\nsome of them I took some of them out,\n\n127\n00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:15.001\nsome of them I didn't so we'll make sure.\n\n128\n00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:16.407\nSo here's our queen of hearts.\n\n129\n00:06:16.407 --> 00:06:18.072\nScroll on down.\n\n130\n00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:22.900\nYes, this has a section break and\nthis is a next page section break.\n\n131\n00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.723\nSo when I put them all together,\nall of this is going to come in so\n\n132\n00:06:26.723 --> 00:06:31.070\nwe're gonna have the down the rabbit hole,\nsection break, new page.\n\n133\n00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.820\nSame thing with the queen of hearts,\nsection break and\n\n134\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.330\nthen the knights is what\nthe last part of it.\n\n135\n00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.790\nSo that would be like the end chapter,\nsee what I'm saying, and\n\n136\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.850\nthen we don't need\na page break from there.\n\n137\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.470\nSo you can see all the different pieces\nof my doc, my chapters as you will.\n\n138\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.160\nMy master document,\nthere's nothing in here.\n\n139\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.150\nIt just has one Alice-in-Wonderland.\n\n140\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.400\nI don't have any other text in here.\n\n141\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.384\nSo you could be starting\nthis from a file new.\n\n142\n00:06:55.384 --> 00:06:58.693\nYou don't have to name it master document.\n\n143\n00:06:58.693 --> 00:07:01.917\nSo don't think like I have\nto keep it that name.\n\n144\n00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:03.704\nNo, I just named that for this example.\n\n145\n00:07:03.704 --> 00:07:05.025\n&gt;&gt; Can you name it She-Ra?\n\n146\n00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, we totally could.\n\n147\n00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.251\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\n\n148\n00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:12.465\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so we can name it anything\nwe want and I'm gonna enter cause I'm\n\n149\n00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:16.500\nthinking like I'm gonna type all\nthe rest of that information.\n\n150\n00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.470\nSo now I'm just gonna start\nputting in those sub documents.\n\n151\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.860\nOne other kind of gotta\nhave this type thing.\n\n152\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.280\nI mentioned styles.\n\n153\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.055\nI should take that one step further in\nwhat you really need to have when you're\n\n154\n00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:32.487\nstarting to create master documents.\n\n155\n00:07:32.487 --> 00:07:34.344\nYou do need to use heading levels.\n\n156\n00:07:34.344 --> 00:07:38.635\nYou have to have heading levels cuz\notherwise it doesn't really kind of\n\n157\n00:07:38.635 --> 00:07:41.710\nunderstand what's going\non in your documents.\n\n158\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.890\nSo that's like a must.\n\n159\n00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.841\nYou can format it however you want, but\n\n160\n00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:49.924\ndefinitely keep all those headings because\nhow we're going to get into our master\n\n161\n00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:52.844\ndocument is we're going to\nhave to go into outlying view.\n\n162\n00:07:52.844 --> 00:07:58.075\nIn an outlying view, in Word, it's always,\nit relies on those headings and\n\n163\n00:07:58.075 --> 00:08:03.642\nthose structural tabs, sorry, structural\nelements I went back to my HTML days.\n\n164\n00:08:03.642 --> 00:08:07.722\n[LAUGH] This is Heading 1,\nHeading 2, Heading 3,\n\n165\n00:08:07.722 --> 00:08:12.200\nare organized where the levels\nare in your document.\n\n166\n00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.470\nSo you do need to have those.\n\n167\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.580\nHow do I get over into the Outline View?\n\n168\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.120\nWell, you go over to the view tab,\nand you go over to outline.\n\n169\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.970\nAnd, when you go into outline,\nit takes you into this world,\n\n170\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.450\nthat has these little dots and pluses and\nminuses, indicating where those different\n\n171\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.640\nchanges of headings, and the dots are\nindicated of where your paragraphs are.\n\n172\n00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.010\nSo I have my cursor here.\n\n173\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:42.230\nI want to then start compiling in those\nsub-documents in my master documents.\n\n174\n00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.310\nSo now I'm in to it.\n\n175\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.050\nYou're gonna click\nthe Show Document button and\n\n176\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.970\nthen the Show Document button brings\nyou into this create and insert.\n\n177\n00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.220\nAnd you can see there's Merge, Split,\nUnlink, those different things we're\n\n178\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.950\ngoing to be doing,\nwith inserting in those sub-documents.\n\n179\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.364\nSo we'll click the Insert,\nand come into here.\n\n180\n00:09:02.364 --> 00:09:06.420\nWe'll go to the desktop, because that's\nwhere I have these particular files, and\n\n181\n00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.875\nbecause I was gonna be\nmessing around with them, so\n\n182\n00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:11.350\nI didn't wanna change\nthe original access files.\n\n183\n00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.570\nTalking about backups in a sense,\nI have those in that folder for\n\n184\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.250\nyou guys to have clean starts here.\n\n185\n00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.570\nFirst what I'm gonna add is the down the\nrabbit hole, and I just named it sub for\n\n186\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.210\nthis example.\n\n187\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.399\nAgain, you don't have to name them\nsub-document to make all of this work.\n\n188\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.920\nClick Open, and\nit goes ahead and put that's in.\n\n189\n00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.840\nYou can see up there.\n\n190\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.190\nSee the pluses?\n\n191\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:39.380\nThat's where you have your heading levels,\nand you can collapse those as well.\n\n192\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.170\nIf I see the plus sign here,\nI can hit the minus sign.\n\n193\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.850\nSo think about if you're trying to, and\n\n194\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.620\nespecially if you're talking about long\ndocuments and editing these things.\n\n195\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.850\nMaybe you need to start moving things\naround, or, everything that's under\n\n196\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.050\nthe Mock Turtle story and then,\neverything that's under the whole,\n\n197\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.140\nWho Stole The Cars,\nwhat if you wanted to move those around?\n\n198\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.470\nThis is the place where you can\ndo this a lot easier because,\n\n199\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.480\nnow you just collapse them down,\nsort of changing them things around.\n\n200\n00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.110\nSo it's really, really cool,\nhow you can collapse and\n\n201\n00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.420\nexpand, based on those heading levels.\n\n202\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.620\nBut for now, we're just gonna go ahead and\ninsert the whole document, that's good.\n\n203\n00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.040\nIt puts in that section break\nbecause that was in the document.\n\n204\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.635\nAnd now, I have the next paragraph for\nwhere I can insert my next sub-document.\n\n205\n00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.070\nInsert, come over here to,\nwe're gonna do the Queen of Hearts next.\n\n206\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.630\nOpen that, and there we go.\n\n207\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.330\nOne more insert and\nwe'll finish off with the knights.\n\n208\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.080\nPuts in all of that text.\n\n209\n00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.570\nSo if I scroll up through here.\n\n210\n00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.370\nI have a continuous section break and\na next section break.\n\n211\n00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.160\nI can get rid of those, that's fine.\n\n212\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.050\nSo I go through and change all of that.\n\n213\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.560\nIt's because it's doing it automatically,\n\n214\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.530\nwhen we're doing\nthe continuous section break.\n\n215\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.110\nOkay.\n\n216\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.310\nThe continuous section break is happening\nautomatically in the master document, and\n\n217\n00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.880\nthen I have a next page\nbreak in the document.\n\n218\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.720\nSo I actually created two.\n\n219\n00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.500\nIt'll be okay for this example.\n\n220\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.300\nBut just keep that in mind, that you\nmight not have to create its own break,\n\n221\n00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.289\nwithin all of the sub documents.\n\n222\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.690\nWhat can I do here in this view?\n\n223\n00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.110\nI have everything expanded,\nif I collapse these sub-documents.\n\n224\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.040\nNow it is asking me to save the changes,\nwhich is fine.\n\n225\n00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.570\nYes, I would like to save my changes,\nI click Okay.\n\n226\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.760\nAnd then you see how it sucks it all down.\n\n227\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.040\nBut it's not showing the heading levels,\n\n228\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.140\nit's showing the links,\nbecause that's what we just did,\n\n229\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.840\nwe created a sub-document, and\nit made a link into the master doc.\n\n230\n00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.251\n&gt;&gt; So once again, it's all connected and\nthat's why you have to be careful.\n\n231\n00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:42.980\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n232\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.480\n&gt;&gt; Careful and\n\n233\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.230\nit, you know, it is an advantage cuz\nof that two-way communication, but yes,\n\n234\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.110\ndefinitely just making sure you\nunderstand the functionality of it and\n\n235\n00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:57.680\nhow it can benefit you, fantastic,\nbut it could bite you if you don't.\n\n236\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.600\nSo now, I've expanded or I collapsed them,\nand I can collapse each one individually.\n\n237\n00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.110\nIf I keep them expanded like this and\n\n238\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:10.720\nI close the Outline View,\nthis is just a regular document.\n\n239\n00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.040\nOutline View is just that.\n\n240\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.350\nIt's just a view, I'm changing how I'm\nlooking at things, and in Print Preview or\n\n241\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.980\nin Print Layout, sorry.\n\n242\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.770\nIn Print Layout View,\n\n243\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:24.280\nthis is just a regular old document,\nthat I have in here and that's fine.\n\n244\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.670\nAnd that's where I could go ahead and\ndelete those section breaks out of them,\n\n245\n00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.760\nand use only the breaks that\nI have in the document.\n\n246\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.180\nI'm gonna just undo that for\nnow, just for purposes.\n\n247\n00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.139\nI don't wanna get in a loop, and\nthen like now let me go ahead and fix it,\n\n248\n00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:39.872\nlet me go ahead and fix it.\n\n249\n00:12:39.872 --> 00:12:42.760\nNope, just keep going.\n\n250\n00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.620\nWe've talked about it, so\nwe know what we're going to do.\n\n251\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.099\nAnd all of my different, I probably\ndon't want a section break there though.\n\n252\n00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:51.120\n[LAUGH] Can't do that one,\nall right perfect.\n\n253\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.350\nSo now,\nI've got everything working for me.\n\n254\n00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.120\nIt's just a regular document.\n\n255\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.360\nEverything's fine.\n\n256\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.090\nLet's save this file.\n\n257\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.520\nLet's close this file.\n\n258\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.800\nAnd so now,\neverything is connected to each other, and\n\n259\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.110\nI need to start making changes.\n\n260\n00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.720\nAnd this is where, hey, I really just\nwanna work on the Down the Rabbit Hole\n\n261\n00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.880\nchapter, cuz that's my focus right now.\n\n262\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.130\nI will open up the subfile, or just the\nregular file that is connected into there.\n\n263\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.834\nAnd I will say, hello world, and\n\n264\n00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:26.944\nI will say, I'm going to type text.\n\n265\n00:13:26.944 --> 00:13:32.023\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, that's way to creative.\n\n266\n00:13:32.023 --> 00:13:36.674\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, all of that\ncreative juice is not there today.\n\n267\n00:13:36.674 --> 00:13:39.613\n[LAUGH] I am going to type text, perfect.\n\n268\n00:13:39.613 --> 00:13:43.040\nSo, I have made some\nchanges To this document.\n\n269\n00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.310\nSave my changes, Ctrl+S, close the file.\n\n270\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.860\nCome back into my master document.\n\n271\n00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.000\nSo I don't have any documents open.\n\n272\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.650\nOpen up the master document, and\nwhat do you think's gonna happen.\n\n273\n00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.311\nAnd you're like, well wait a second.\n\n274\n00:13:56.311 --> 00:13:57.960\n[LAUGH] What just happened?\n\n275\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.070\nRight here, I'm in Print Preview.\n\n276\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.980\nI left in Print Layout.\n\n277\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.650\nSo, I thought when I came\nback I'd still have that.\n\n278\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.180\nWell this is just one of\nthe things with master documents.\n\n279\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.600\nIt's showing that hey I'm connected\nin there, but this isn't just a link.\n\n280\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.800\nThere are documents in it.\n\n281\n00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.930\nThere's sub-documents in here.\n\n282\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.510\nWhat you have to do is you have to go\nback into that Outline View, expand,\n\n283\n00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.120\nthen leave Outline View and come back.\n\n284\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.940\nSo, I have to go to View,\nI have to go to Outline.\n\n285\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.270\nI have to expand all the sub documents,\nthere, now you can see my changes.\n\n286\n00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.410\nClose out of Outline View, and\n\n287\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.067\nyep there you go, they're all my changes\nthat I made in the sub-document, cool.\n\n288\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.220\nThis is where I'm in the master document.\n\n289\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.500\nWhere am I?\nThink about myself, okay,\n\n290\n00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.380\nI'm in the master document.\n\n291\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.420\nDown the Rabbit Hole and\nthrough the woods.\n\n292\n00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:49.920\nOkay?\n\n293\n00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.350\nYeah.\n\n294\n00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.340\n&gt;&gt; The Timberlake.\n\n295\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n296\n00:14:54.925 --> 00:14:58.610\n[LAUGH] So we go down here,\nI'm in the master document.\n\n297\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.160\nI save my changes, so\nwe'll do a File Save.\n\n298\n00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.910\nI'll click the little disk, save my\nchanges, close out of my master document.\n\n299\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.500\nCome back in to the Down the Rabbit Hole,\nmy sub-document.\n\n300\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.360\nThere you go.\n\n301\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.874\nSo showing you that two way.\n\n302\n00:15:14.874 --> 00:15:15.508\n&gt;&gt; Connected.\n\n303\n00:15:15.508 --> 00:15:17.770\n&gt;&gt; YES, that two-way connection.\n\n304\n00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.725\n&gt;&gt; So be careful.\n\n305\n00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:21.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which is hard\nto get used to in times,\n\n306\n00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:26.680\nbecause when you usually put something in\nand link it, it doesn't go the other way.\n\n307\n00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:33.120\nThis way it does, so good, and\nif you don't want it to be that way,\n\n308\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.080\ndefinitely go back and forth and\nI can say, hello world, and\n\n309\n00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.810\neveryone on it Making more changes that\naren't really making too much sense.\n\n310\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.964\nAnd let's just change some colors, and\n\n311\n00:15:46.964 --> 00:15:50.690\nmake it a little bit more visual change,\nSave.\n\n312\n00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.732\nAnd you can get the idea here, as we go\nthrough the loop I'm going around of but\n\n313\n00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:56.209\nman, this keeps happening.\n\n314\n00:15:56.209 --> 00:16:00.380\nNow this is one thing that I told you,\nyou have to go to View.\n\n315\n00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.031\nYou have to go and\nexpand the sub-documents, and\n\n316\n00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:03.380\nthen you have to close the Outline View.\n\n317\n00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.720\nThese are things that if I'm gonna be\nworking in a master document a lot,\n\n318\n00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.994\nI don't want to keep going\nover through those things,\n\n319\n00:16:10.994 --> 00:16:15.617\nyou can add your buttons on your quick\nlaunch bar, which I wanted to show you,\n\n320\n00:16:15.617 --> 00:16:19.840\nbecause this would be an exact example\nof I want to add them right here.\n\n321\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.780\nThat smiley face, by the way, is from our\nmacros in some of our other episodes.\n\n322\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.155\nSo I want to customize my\nquick Quick access toolbar.\n\n323\n00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:32.520\nClick the drop down here and\nwe will go to more commands.\n\n324\n00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.920\nAnd the commands, I just said expand\ndocument, but you do have to be\n\n325\n00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.919\na little careful on this one because, if\nyou start going into the all commands and\n\n326\n00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:46.010\nI don't know where there at just remember,\nlet me double check with you.\n\n327\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.980\nWhen we go over to View,\nand we go to Outline.\n\n328\n00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.550\nNotice that there is\nan outlining tab that comes up.\n\n329\n00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.380\nThat's where the commands\nthat we want to add.\n\n330\n00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.410\nSome of the commands are located.\n\n331\n00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.110\nSo just remember just wanted\nto kind of point that out.\n\n332\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.110\nGo over to the More commands.\n\n333\n00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.590\nWe'll move over here.\n\n334\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:12.110\nAnd we first want to add the change\nthe view to outline cuz that's step one.\n\n335\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.150\nNow I know that that is on the View Tab.\n\n336\n00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.550\nOkay.\n\n337\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.540\nThat's on my main ribbon.\n\n338\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.860\nSo if I scroll down through,\nthere it is, Outline View.\n\n339\n00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.140\nSo we will add the Outline View\nto my Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n340\n00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.170\nBut then I need to expand\nthe sub documents.\n\n341\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.140\nThat's where it is on the outlining tab.\n\n342\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.990\nYou see that these over here they're\nnot in my normal they're in my\n\n343\n00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.210\nsub list we'll call it at outlining\ntab that's where we have expand sub\n\n344\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.700\ndocuments there's that command and then\nI would like to close the outline queue,\n\n345\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.510\nthat would be my third step to get\nback into the print layout queue.\n\n346\n00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.110\nSo adding those on to your\nquick access toolbar,\n\n347\n00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.040\nit doesnt matter where\nyoure on the ribbon.\n\n348\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.660\nAnd it's just like, outline,\nexpand, close and I am back.\n\n349\n00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.030\nRight, so love that quick access to a bar,\n\n350\n00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.400\ncustomizing it to where you\nneed things such as this.\n\n351\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.610\nAnd now I can start seeing all\nthe different changes that I'm making.\n\n352\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.880\nAnd now I'm realizing that I don't\nwant to have that extra text and\n\n353\n00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.300\nit really just needs to say\ndown the rabbit hole and\n\n354\n00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.200\nnow I'm making my changes here and\nI can move on.\n\n355\n00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.775\nNow the thing is,\nthis is a regular document.\n\n356\n00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.500\nYes it does have our sub documents, but\n\n357\n00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.110\nin this view you treat it\nas a regular document.\n\n358\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:40.510\nWhat I mean by is I can do things\nlike add a table of contents.\n\n359\n00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:45.110\nI just did a control+enter\nin front of that.\n\n360\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:50.132\nTitle, to get me a new page,\nI can insert nope that's the references,\n\n361\n00:18:50.132 --> 00:18:54.940\n[LAUGH] We can add a table of content I'm\njust doing a quick one right now, And\n\n362\n00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.380\nit's pulling it right from here.\n\n363\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.660\nSo just because they're sub documents,\n\n364\n00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.460\nyou don't treat them any differently and\nif I wanted to generate an index,\n\n365\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.740\nYou can generate the index and that we're\ngetting back in a smaller chunks and\n\n366\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:13.960\nmaking them into chapter or pieces of\na large document you can just kind of\n\n367\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.070\nfocus on little part rather than\nbig part bring them in the master,\n\n368\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:22.550\nadd the index in the master, make all\nyour changes and everything is fine.\n\n369\n00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.456\nIt's a normal document.\n\n370\n00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:30.400\n&gt;&gt; But this is gonna send this information\nback to your original, yes, no?\n\n371\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is connected, but\n\n372\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.700\nthe table of contents only\nlives in the master document.\n\n373\n00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So you will not see\n\n374\n00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:36.970\na table of contents-\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n375\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.350\n&gt;&gt; At the top of the subdocument.\n\n376\n00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.260\n&gt;&gt; That's really cool.\n\n377\n00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.440\n&gt;&gt; But the sending back the information,\n\n378\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.390\nyou change your heading levels,\n&gt;&gt; In your subdocument,\n\n379\n00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.910\nand then you save the changes\nin your master document,\n\n380\n00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.370\nyou would need to come in and\nmake sure you update the tables.\n\n381\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.300\nYou would need to update your table of\ncontents if you added more index entries,\n\n382\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.910\nyou'd need to update your index.\n\n383\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.965\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhelping my feeble mind understand.\n\n384\n00:20:00.965 --> 00:20:05.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, that's fantastic because\nin this sense it's only this element\n\n385\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.140\nonly lives in the master document.\n\n386\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.700\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n387\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.620\nthe data is connected to everything,\nso that's really cool.\n\n388\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.580\nBut like I said what if this is\nthe final version or a final countdown?\n\n389\n00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.545\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna do it.\n\n390\n00:20:19.545 --> 00:20:22.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the final countdown.\n\n391\n00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:22.945\n&gt;&gt; Yep, okay.\n\n392\n00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:26.590\n[LAUGH] So final countdown to where I'm\ngonna send this off to the printer or\n\n393\n00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:31.960\nsend this to the CEO, whoever I'm\nmaking this particular document to And\n\n394\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.650\nI don't want any of those\nchanges on the sub-documents\n\n395\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.410\nmake a change on the sub-documents,\nI do not want to do your reflected here.\n\n396\n00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.960\nSo that's where you need to break\nthe link to the sub-documents.\n\n397\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n398\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.840\n&gt;&gt; So I can go back into the outline\nview if I have my button right here.\n\n399\n00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.050\nI can collapse the sub-documents.\n\n400\n00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.860\nI can make this changes.\n\n401\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:57.100\nThat's fine, so I've collapsed them,\nbut now I just realized that I actually\n\n402\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.310\ndo need to expand them, [LAUGH] so\nI'll expand them back out and\n\n403\n00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.350\nif I click here and\nthen down the rabbit you see unlinking.\n\n404\n00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:09.360\nSo, delete the link to\nthe sub document and\n\n405\n00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.290\ncopy the sub document content\ninto the master document.\n\n406\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:18.450\nSo it will stay as is In the master and\nnobody will be connected to it.\n\n407\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.450\n&gt;&gt; They won't be able to touch it.\n\n408\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.140\nIt's its own entity.\n\n409\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.070\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n410\n00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you can see that the kind of box\n\n411\n00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.630\ngoes around.\n\n412\n00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.680\nIt's not here anymore,\ncoming into down here.\n\n413\n00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.650\nSo that box is that indicating\nof that this is a sub-document.\n\n414\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:38.960\nI will unlink The queen of hearts and\nthen, unlink the knights.\n\n415\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.900\nAnd now the outline view is\njust an irregular outline.\n\n416\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.460\nAnd I could still use\nthis outline view to move\n\n417\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.540\nmajor chunks by collapsing things down and\nlike, I need to.\n\n418\n00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.910\nChange the red knight,\nwe'll class that and the white knight.\n\n419\n00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.060\nI need to change those two sections.\n\n420\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.950\nSo this is where you can\nstart just dragging them.\n\n421\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:58.780\nSee how easy that was?\n\n422\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.640\nAll I did and just to show you, I just\ntook the plus sign, put my cursor over it.\n\n423\n00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.750\nMove this over, maybe I will collapse\nthe bishop because now I want to put\n\n424\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.270\nthe red knight between the bishop and\n\n425\n00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:15.580\nthe rook wow, think about if you were\ntrying to do that within print layout.\n\n426\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.990\nLike you would have to select them all and\nmake sure you moved it all.\n\n427\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:23.640\nHere it's just collapse those heading\nlevels, collapse those structures down.\n\n428\n00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.970\nAnd just move the top level structures.\n\n429\n00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:30.520\nAnd all the stuff that's inside of\nthose structures is gonna move as well.\n\n430\n00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.090\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n431\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can be really, really cool.\n\n432\n00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:36.200\nI really do like outline view,\nit can be really handy for\n\n433\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.000\nmoving large amounts of information,\nbut you've gotta have those headings.\n\n434\n00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.870\nIf you don't have headings it\ndoesn't understand what's going on.\n\n435\n00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:47.070\nSo now, anything I do changes\nin my master document.\n\n436\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.010\nIt's just a regular file now,\nthere's no connections to anything else.\n\n437\n00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.980\nAnd so this is the final.\n\n438\n00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.300\nThis is the final countdown of this\nepisode because now we know that\n\n439\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.070\nit's a regular file.\n\n440\n00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.330\nBut I got it from using smaller\ndigestible chunks if you wanna say and\n\n441\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.270\nadded them all together.\n\n442\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.780\nThen I linked it and now I'm ready to go\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job as usual, Vonne.\n\n443\n00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.382\nLong documents and\nthis has been master document.\n\n444\n00:23:13.382 --> 00:23:14.960\nWe're in Microsoft Word 2016 expert,\n\n445\n00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.670\nthere's a whole bunch of videos\nin this series, watch them all.\n\n446\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.640\nYou'll be very glad you did.\n\n447\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.590\nThank you for watching Office Pro.TV and\n\n448\n00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.350\nremember a good office\npro is always learning.\n\n449\n00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.170\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n450\n00:23:25.170 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.620\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.550\nIn today's episode we\nare taking look at Word 2016,\n\n5\n00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.640\ntrying to become more expert\nusers of that lovely little tool.\n\n6\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.670\nAnd joining us in the studio\nwho is actually an expert in\n\n7\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.560\nusing that lovely little tool,\nour friend Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.260\nVonne, welcome.\n\n9\n00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.900\nHow’s it going?\n\n10\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.670\n&gt;&gt; Why, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.690\nI always love your introductions for me.\n\n12\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.590\nI feel so smart.\n\n13\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.621\n&gt;&gt; I try to really build her up.\n\n14\n00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:33.938\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So she has only one way to go.\n\n15\n00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:35.244\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:36.790\n&gt;&gt; No but today we're gonna be\n\n17\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.290\ntalking about track changes.\n\n18\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.820\nActually something that I love\nto talk about track changes and\n\n19\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.940\nI use it constantly.\n\n20\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.890\nIt's a great way to,\nwell, track your changes.\n\n21\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.150\nThe definition is in the words.\n\n22\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.668\nBut this is where you can start\ncollaborating with fellow coworkers or\n\n23\n00:00:54.668 --> 00:00:55.800\npublishers.\n\n24\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.395\n&gt;&gt; Publishers.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n25\n00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:58.065\nI was trying to be a little fancy there.\n\n26\n00:00:58.065 --> 00:00:58.677\n&gt;&gt; Like in French.\n\n27\n00:00:58.677 --> 00:01:00.882\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know what just happened.\n\n28\n00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:04.244\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like liqueur instead of liquor.\n\n29\n00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:05.309\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or Target.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Target.\n\n30\n00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.752\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n31\n00:01:06.752 --> 00:01:07.322\nYeah.\n\n32\n00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:09.332\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love me a Jacque Penne.\n\n33\n00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:10.075\n&gt;&gt; I don't know that one.\nWhat is that?\n\n34\n00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:11.572\n&gt;&gt; JC Penny.\n\n35\n00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.842\n&gt;&gt; Jeeze.\n\n36\n00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:20.011\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so, but it's the whole idea of\ncollaborating with somebody else and\n\n37\n00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.965\ntracking the changes that\nyou're making in a document.\n\n38\n00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:27.661\nSo let's say that we're working on a book\ntogether and that I went ahead and\n\n39\n00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:28.197\ntyped it.\n\n40\n00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:32.955\nAnd I need to send it to somebody to help\nproof my work cuz it's always good to have\n\n41\n00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:36.450\nmore than one set of eyes on\na manuscript or a publication.\n\n42\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.980\nAnd there's always going to be things\nthat you're gonna miss even though\n\n43\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.100\nyou've seen it a thousand times.\n\n44\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.202\nYou'll still miss it and there'll be\ncorrections that you need to have.\n\n45\n00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:51.050\nAnd if I send it to somebody, I want\nto see what changes they are making.\n\n46\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.660\nYou just turn on a button and that's\ncalled track changes and then remembers\n\n47\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.220\nand documents everything that is going\nto be changed within that document.\n\n48\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.210\nIt's really, really great.\n\n49\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.190\nI've actually used this when I'm not\neven collaborating with anybody,\n\n50\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.690\nI'm just using it for myself.\n\n51\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.990\nTo remind myself of what I had changed,\n\n52\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.220\nwhat I had done to kind of get to that\nfinal state of that particular document.\n\n53\n00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.320\n&gt;&gt; Vonne,\nthat sounds really interesting in my mind.\n\n54\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.270\nI've never seen this before, so\n\n55\n00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.200\ninside of the head here I'm going, how is\nthis even going to look on the screen?\n\n56\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.106\nIt's gotta be a little crazy, right?\n\n57\n00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:24.714\n&gt;&gt; It can.\n\n58\n00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:27.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you start getting into a lot of\n\n59\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.950\nchanges it's just bubbles everywhere, and\n\n60\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.030\nI'll show you what those\nbubbles look like.\n\n61\n00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.820\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nget started with Justin's computer.\n\n62\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.650\nI am going to be two people again today.\n\n63\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.190\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n\n64\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm gonna have to keep my\nmind in order of who am I right now.\n\n65\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.380\nWell right now,\n\n66\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.910\nI'm gonna start off as Justin Timberlake,\ncuz I'm here on my lake looking out.\n\n67\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.915\nSo I have to remind myself of who I am,\nwhat computer I'm using.\n\n68\n00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:52.378\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's timber on the lake.\n\n69\n00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:54.059\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n70\n00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.570\nHey, exactly.\n\n71\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.635\nYou got it.\n\n72\n00:02:55.635 --> 00:03:00.290\n[LAUGH] So I have this file\ncalled Knight's track changes.\n\n73\n00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.330\nSo this is the document\nthat I'm starting off with.\n\n74\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.220\nAnd the whole idea here is that I\nam going to be working with Joey.\n\n75\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.980\nAnd Joey is gong to\nhelp proof my document.\n\n76\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.550\nSo I'm starting out here with the Knights\nand I'm gonna say all right this is great.\n\n77\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.241\nI need to send this to him and\n\n78\n00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:21.361\nI'm going to go old school in this\nway where I'm just going to email\n\n79\n00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:25.502\nhim this as an attachment rather\nthan setting it up into the cloud.\n\n80\n00:03:25.502 --> 00:03:28.445\nCuz we're gonna kind of\nstay on the ground for\n\n81\n00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:31.540\nthis particular example of track changes.\n\n82\n00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.407\nBut how you get the file to one person or\nanother, that's another thing.\n\n83\n00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:38.743\nBut you do wanna kinda keep it\nwhere they have their own copy and\n\n84\n00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:42.260\nyou have your own copy so\nyou can kind of see it back and forth.\n\n85\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.050\nBut all of this does work in the cloud\nwith the same tracked changes.\n\n86\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.270\nI'll show you what we're gonna be doing.\n\n87\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.380\nSo here's our Knights and\nI'm gonna go over to the review tab.\n\n88\n00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.836\nCuz one of the first things that\nI'm going to do as the owner, so\n\n89\n00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.456\nJustin right now is\nthe owner of this document.\n\n90\n00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:04.740\nI want to put a note in there for\nJoey for when he gets there.\n\n91\n00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.290\nHey, I want you to look at this particular\npart or maybe some instructions.\n\n92\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.510\nIt's like a,\nyou know the sticky notes, right?\n\n93\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n94\n00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.030\n&gt;&gt; Obviously.\n\n95\n00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.400\n&gt;&gt; You put it on a piece of paper and\nlike, hey.\n\n96\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.352\n&gt;&gt; I invented them.\n\n97\n00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:17.285\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That might not be true.\n\n98\n00:04:17.285 --> 00:04:19.093\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I invented the Post-It note.\n\n99\n00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:20.184\nThat was a great movie.\n\n100\n00:04:20.184 --> 00:04:20.703\n&gt;&gt; It was.\n\n101\n00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:22.286\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, yeah.\n\n102\n00:04:22.286 --> 00:04:22.990\n&gt;&gt; I know where you're at.\n\n103\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.989\n&gt;&gt; We had the same one.\n\n104\n00:04:23.989 --> 00:04:28.115\nSo I wanna go ahead and\nput a sticky note on this file for\n\n105\n00:04:28.115 --> 00:04:31.020\na something called a comment.\n\n106\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.791\nWhen we add comment to our document\nit's like a digital sticky note of,\n\n107\n00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:40.957\nhey, this is not part of the text that's\nin the document just a little note for\n\n108\n00:04:40.957 --> 00:04:42.886\nyou to see what's going on.\n\n109\n00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:46.487\nAnd so on that review tab,\nthere is a button for new comment and\n\n110\n00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:49.170\nadd a note about this\npart of the document.\n\n111\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.642\nNow I could select a whole paragraph, so\n\n112\n00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:55.944\nit doesn't have to be attached to\njust one word or one specific place.\n\n113\n00:04:55.944 --> 00:05:00.460\nYou can attach it to whatever\nyou want to put a note on.\n\n114\n00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.467\nBut in this case, we're just gonna\nput it right in the beginning.\n\n115\n00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:06.731\nPut our cursor in front of the in\nThe Knights, and we go with new comment.\n\n116\n00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:10.380\nAnd you can see off the side, that's what\nthose bubbles that I was just mentioning.\n\n117\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.320\nThese bubbles are gonna come up for\nall the different formatting and\n\n118\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.080\ndifferent changes that I'm making.\n\n119\n00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.620\nNow, track changes and comments,\nthey are two separate things.\n\n120\n00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.330\nSo they don't have to go together.\n\n121\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.875\nI could comment a document and\nnever use track changes.\n\n122\n00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:29.261\nSo I don't want you to\nthink they are together,\n\n123\n00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:33.800\nthey're mutually exclusive in\nthe ways that you can use them.\n\n124\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.309\nSo, a comment is, just that, add a note.\n\n125\n00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:43.700\nAnd I will say, please proof, let's see if\nI can spell proof, proof this document.\n\n126\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.911\nAnd that's the note that I am making,\nfor whoever, it could be just me.\n\n127\n00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:53.346\nLike I said, I can use this for myself\n[LAUGH] and just, giving yourself a note.\n\n128\n00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:56.234\n&gt;&gt; I've been right there with you,\nVonne, where you're going, yeah,\n\n129\n00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:59.171\nit's been awhile since you've been\nover that certain portion and you go,\n\n130\n00:05:59.171 --> 00:06:00.260\nwhy did I write this again?\n\n131\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.110\nOr what was my, I don't remember,\ncuz I forget things.\n\n132\n00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.635\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n133\n00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:04.720\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n\n134\n00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.839\nSo I use sticky notes, physical sticky\nnotes, everywhere in my desks and\n\n135\n00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.059\nall these different pages.\n\n136\n00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:11.440\nAnd they're all color coordinated so\nthey mean something.\n\n137\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.226\nCan't remember what pink or\nblue means right now, but\n\n138\n00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:16.970\nthey did have some type of meaning.\n\n139\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.190\nSo, we have our little note, and\nthat's what I'm adding into our document.\n\n140\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.310\nNow, I'm just gonna save the changes,\nso I'll do a file save.\n\n141\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.068\nAnd now I've made this note.\n\n142\n00:06:26.068 --> 00:06:30.170\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nsend this off to Joey.\n\n143\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.381\nSo Joey will know to please\nproof this document.\n\n144\n00:06:34.381 --> 00:06:37.890\nNow I can email directly from Word.\n\n145\n00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.910\nAnd the share button which is\non the upper right hand side,\n\n146\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.550\nthis also if you come over\nhere to file and do save as or\n\n147\n00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.240\nsome other ways or\nI think it's share, it's right there.\n\n148\n00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.520\nShare right here of where\nI can just email and\n\n149\n00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.070\nsend this as an attachment,\nwhich ever way you wanna go.\n\n150\n00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.290\nYou can go over here or\nto the backstage view.\n\n151\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.180\nAnd I can send,\n\n152\n00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.670\nit's actually behind my head where\nI'm going here of send as attachment.\n\n153\n00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.510\nAnd then I would like to send a copy.\n\n154\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.510\nAnd since I do have Outlook already\nconfigured on this computer,\n\n155\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.140\nit'll just go right from there.\n\n156\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.260\nInstead of me opening up Outlook,\nattaching the files,\n\n157\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.835\nsending it off, it's all connected\nif you wanted to do that way.\n\n158\n00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:23.801\nAnd so I'll send a copy and\nit opens up my Outlook and\n\n159\n00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:32.170\nI can address it to Joey and there we\ngo perfect, attached and I'll send it.\n\n160\n00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.580\nI do have Outlook open but\nthat didn't have to be opened.\n\n161\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.566\nI just have that there because I\nknow I am gonna be emailing back and\n\n162\n00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:39.666\nforth in this episode.\n\n163\n00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:43.274\nSo I just wanted to kinda cut\nsome time by opening products,\n\n164\n00:07:43.274 --> 00:07:45.014\njust already had them open.\n\n165\n00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:47.250\nSo now I have sent that off.\n\n166\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.320\nI will close this file.\n\n167\n00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.470\nHere we go,\nwe're gonna switch personalities.\n\n168\n00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.980\nSo we're gonna jump on\nover to Joey's computer.\n\n169\n00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:01.028\nSo now I'm Joey and\nI am receiving this document from Justin.\n\n170\n00:08:01.028 --> 00:08:02.849\nNow Justin didn't give\nme any instructions,\n\n171\n00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.350\nlike I just got this file attached.\n\n172\n00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.411\nHe should have Put something\nin the body of the email.\n\n173\n00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:07.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nice email etiquette there,\n\n174\n00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.698\nJustin, sorry.\n\n175\n00:08:08.698 --> 00:08:11.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a phishing scam.\n\n176\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.135\n[LAUGH] He's just trying to\ninfected him with malware.\n\n177\n00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:14.533\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n178\n00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:15.854\nwe do know who sent this,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n179\n00:08:15.854 --> 00:08:18.145\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so we will move this on over.\n\n180\n00:08:18.145 --> 00:08:23.364\nI'm just dragging the attachment from\nthe email right onto my desktop and\n\n181\n00:08:23.364 --> 00:08:25.804\nso now I will open this as Joey, and\n\n182\n00:08:25.804 --> 00:08:31.380\nI just realized [LAUGH] something that I\ncompletely forgot to do in all of this.\n\n183\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.565\nSo, you know what,\nlet's pretend none of this ever happened.\n\n184\n00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:34.513\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's rewind the tape.\n\n185\n00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:35.016\n&gt;&gt; Rewind.\n\n186\n00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:37.118\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because, you know what I forgot to do?\n\n187\n00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:37.733\n&gt;&gt; What'd you do?\n\n188\n00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:42.806\n&gt;&gt; I was, I knew where we were going,\nbut I forgot to tell you guys that I\n\n189\n00:08:42.806 --> 00:08:49.420\nwould like to make sure, as Justin, that\nany changes that Joey does are tracked.\n\n190\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.584\nSo I miss a very key point of\nturning on the track changes.\n\n191\n00:08:53.584 --> 00:08:54.833\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we knew that, and\n\n192\n00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:56.033\nI know it was purposeful, so\n\n193\n00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:58.983\nthat we would remember that if we want\nto do that we have to turn this on.\n\n194\n00:08:58.983 --> 00:08:59.880\nSo very smart on your behalf there Vonne.\n\n195\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.720\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n\n196\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.761\nIt's right in my notes.\n\n197\n00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:03.255\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To plan out to do this that way.\n\n198\n00:09:03.255 --> 00:09:07.504\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Conveniently forget to, right?\n\n199\n00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:08.089\n&gt;&gt; That's how it works?\n\n200\n00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.892\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well the other thing is\n\n201\n00:09:09.892 --> 00:09:10.798\nit's very easy to forget.\n\n202\n00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:12.371\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's that whole,\n\n203\n00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:15.145\nlike my brain is going\nfaster than the computer or\n\n204\n00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:19.083\nthe actual, my hand on the mouse,\nit doesn't connect right there.\n\n205\n00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:23.383\nSo yes, if you want to make sure that\nall changes are going to be tracked,\n\n206\n00:09:23.383 --> 00:09:26.145\nyou have to turn that\ntrack changes button on.\n\n207\n00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:27.488\nSo, let's try that again.\n\n208\n00:09:27.488 --> 00:09:30.395\nWe will open this back up and\nI've already added my note.\n\n209\n00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:33.958\nI think I got sidetracked on they're\nseparate, you don't have to use comments\n\n210\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.541\nor track change, and then my mind went\noff the track, literally, and forgot.\n\n211\n00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:38.586\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It went, shiny thing.\n\n212\n00:09:38.586 --> 00:09:39.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Squirrel.\n\n213\n00:09:39.487 --> 00:09:40.718\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n[LAUGH] Yeah, squirrel.\n\n214\n00:09:40.718 --> 00:09:42.792\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that happens a lot.\n\n215\n00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:47.543\nOkay, so now we know that if we come\nover here to Review, I need to turn on\n\n216\n00:09:47.543 --> 00:09:52.059\nthe track changes for Joey, and\nall I gotta do is click that button,\n\n217\n00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:56.177\nand now everything is going to be tracked,\nwhether I do it, or\n\n218\n00:09:56.177 --> 00:10:00.656\nwhoever receives this document\nwill be able to track the changes.\n\n219\n00:10:00.656 --> 00:10:05.525\nNow the thing is if I can turn it on\nthat fast I could also turn it off and\n\n220\n00:10:05.525 --> 00:10:07.570\nanybody could turn it off.\n\n221\n00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.870\nSo if I turn this on here as Justin.\n\n222\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.760\nJoey gets it.\n\n223\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.701\nWell, Joey's like,\nI don't want you to track my changes,\n\n224\n00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:16.155\nhe can just turn it right off.\n\n225\n00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:20.015\nSo that's something you might not\nwant other people to control,\n\n226\n00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:22.060\nespecially if that's their job.\n\n227\n00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.516\nThey have to do this [LAUGH] and\nI have to see what you're doing.\n\n228\n00:10:26.516 --> 00:10:30.370\nSo there's something now that\nyou can do called lock tracking.\n\n229\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.890\nI do not want anybody else,\nbut me as the owner, and\n\n230\n00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.920\nthe owner of the passwords that I\ncan turn it off, but nobody else.\n\n231\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.866\nSo locking it would be a good thing to do.\n\n232\n00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:42.213\nNow notice it says,\nthis is not a security feature.\n\n233\n00:10:42.213 --> 00:10:45.268\nSo this is not locking the document down,\n\n234\n00:10:45.268 --> 00:10:50.870\nit's only turning the track changes\nto be locked, that's the only thing.\n\n235\n00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.140\nSo I'm going to type in Apple, cuz that's\nmy password for everything that I use\n\n236\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.400\nin security when I'm teaching all these\ndifferent products, so I click OK.\n\n237\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.773\nNow I save the changes so that way,\nnotice this can't be turned off.\n\n238\n00:11:03.773 --> 00:11:06.120\nNope, nope, i'm clicking and\nit will not turn off.\n\n239\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.089\nSo the only way that I can unlock\nit will be to come here and\n\n240\n00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:11.877\nthen use that password.\n\n241\n00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:16.580\nSo if Joey tries this and doesn't know\nthe password then he can't unlock it.\n\n242\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.373\nSo that's a very good thing to do.\n\n243\n00:11:19.373 --> 00:11:23.261\nAll right so\nwe're going to pretend that that happened,\n\n244\n00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:28.126\ncuz right back over here, I can turn\nthe tracked changes on obviously.\n\n245\n00:11:28.126 --> 00:11:32.556\nSo we're just gonna pretend that I had\nsent the locked tracked changes to Joey\n\n246\n00:11:32.556 --> 00:11:35.144\nand he can't turn them off,\nand there we go,\n\n247\n00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:38.290\nnow we're right back to\nwhere we're supposed to be.\n\n248\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:38.914\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n249\n00:11:38.914 --> 00:11:41.698\ndon't forget to turn on the track changes.\n\n250\n00:11:41.698 --> 00:11:45.100\nAll right, so now I'm going to\nstart marking up my document.\n\n251\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.542\nAnything that I do,\nit will come off to the side and say,\n\n252\n00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:53.397\nyou did this, you either deleted, or\nyou inserted, or you changed the text.\n\n253\n00:11:53.397 --> 00:11:57.015\nSo let's say as Joey,\nnow I don't think that this down, down,\n\n254\n00:11:57.015 --> 00:12:00.300\ndown really needs to be there,\nso I'm going to edit that.\n\n255\n00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.514\nI'm just gonna select this and hit Delete,\nand notice how it strikes it out.\n\n256\n00:12:04.514 --> 00:12:10.141\nSo this is going to be an indication that\nthis person deleted that particular part\n\n257\n00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:15.188\nof the text, and then right here\nmaybe we'll say, we don't really need\n\n258\n00:12:15.188 --> 00:12:20.679\nto know that Dina was the cat, everybody\nknows that Dina's the cat, I guess.\n\n259\n00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:23.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And my ears and whiskers, and\n\n260\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:27.210\nthen there is this, and then there's\nobviously a lot of repeated text and\n\n261\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.520\nI'm going to take this and\ndelete this out, and\n\n262\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.990\nso I'm just changing anything that I would\nnormally do, by editing this document.\n\n263\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:40.370\nInstead of sleepy we're just gonna go\nahead and change it to tired, and then we\n\n264\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:46.012\nwill add some more texts by just hitting\nenter and we'll just say, add text here.\n\n265\n00:12:46.012 --> 00:12:46.600\nPerfect.\n\n266\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.490\nSo you can see that added text is\nunderlined and has that color.\n\n267\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:56.400\nAnything that is deleted has that\nstrikethrough, and then if I change some\n\n268\n00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.430\nformatting, let's say I've decided\nthat this needs to be a new heading,\n\n269\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.050\nlet me zoom out a little bit, you can see\nthat bubble over there on the side is\n\n270\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:09.108\ngonna let anybody know\nthat this was a formatting\n\n271\n00:13:09.108 --> 00:13:15.035\nchange rather than just an inserted or\ndeleted amount of text.\n\n272\n00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:19.202\nThe other thing with comments, and\nagain track and comments or separate, but\n\n273\n00:13:19.202 --> 00:13:24.252\nthey are used a lot together because\nyou wanna make notes along the way to\n\n274\n00:13:24.252 --> 00:13:29.280\nwhere maybe I could say, here,\nI could select this whole paragraph, and\n\n275\n00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.160\nwhile I don’t wanna delete it,\nit’s like I want to ask a question.\n\n276\n00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.653\nSo I can come over here to review and\nbe like is this repeating?\n\n277\n00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:41.800\nWhy yes it is,\ncuz [LAUGH] I was just putting in text.\n\n278\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.345\nSo that way it's not an actual edit,\nit’s just a,\n\n279\n00:13:45.345 --> 00:13:48.809\nI’m not sure what we're\nsupposed to do here, and\n\n280\n00:13:48.809 --> 00:13:53.680\nmaybe I can also put on a comment here\nof saying that this is a new topic.\n\n281\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:01.830\nThis is a new topic needs heading.\n\n282\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.281\nSo that way as collaborators,\nas Joey collaborating with Justin,\n\n283\n00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:11.043\nI'm telling Justin what I think of all\nof this and sometimes I don't need\n\n284\n00:14:11.043 --> 00:14:15.881\na specific edit, I just need a comment,\nand the other cool thing is that,\n\n285\n00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:19.658\nwith these comments is,\nthat you can reply to a comment.\n\n286\n00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:25.160\nSo this one was from Justin and\nas Joey I might reply directly to it.\n\n287\n00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.480\nSo you're almost having a conversation,\n\n288\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.110\nyou're documenting this note between\nthe two of you without an edit.\n\n289\n00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.820\nSo I can go like, please proof.\n\n290\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.640\nYes, sir.\nThere we go.\n\n291\n00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.370\nDone.\n\n292\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.290\nGreat, and so there we go.\n\n293\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.330\nReplying to comments, marking all\nof the document up, tracking these\n\n294\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:54.708\nchanges as I go through here, and\nnow I'm ready to send this back to Justin.\n\n295\n00:14:54.708 --> 00:15:00.449\nNow since we're working on hard copies of\nthis, if I sent this back as night trap\n\n296\n00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:05.864\nchanges, there wouldn't be any indication\nthat this was from me as Joey.\n\n297\n00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:09.822\nSo it's probably a good thing to do a file\nsave as, and even just like add your name\n\n298\n00:15:09.822 --> 00:15:13.890\noff to it, and this is where you can do\nthe track changes one, two, three, four.\n\n299\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.340\n[LAUGH] All the different edits,\nmaybe having the dates there so\n\n300\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:23.180\nyou know when you did this collaboration,\ncuz you're handing over physical copies\n\n301\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:28.070\nif you wanna say of these documents back\nand forth, and so you need to make sure\n\n302\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:33.040\nyou have some type of system, if you wanna\nsay, for how we're going to name this.\n\n303\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.719\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this seems very much old\nschool just in a digital format\n\n304\n00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:39.560\nwhere we used to type this\nup on physical paper.\n\n305\n00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.450\nI would hand it you as an editor.\n\n306\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.519\nYou would edit it strike through with your\nlittle red pen and bleed all over it, and\n\n307\n00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:46.193\nmake my dreams crushed,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n308\n00:15:46.193 --> 00:15:47.184\n&gt;&gt; And cry in the night,\n\n309\n00:15:47.184 --> 00:15:50.435\n[LAUGH] cuz I can see all the murder\nyou've done to my lovely little paper\n\n310\n00:15:50.435 --> 00:15:54.197\nthere, and then I would make those\nchanges, and then we would publish, right?\n\n311\n00:15:54.197 --> 00:15:55.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n312\n00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.980\nYeah, and this is what we're doing,\njust electronically crushing your dreams.\n\n313\n00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n314\n00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.212\nSo much easier to dream crush when you\ncan just email current dream crushing.\n\n315\n00:16:04.212 --> 00:16:05.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n316\n00:16:05.246 --> 00:16:06.055\n&gt;&gt; By the click of a button.\n\n317\n00:16:06.055 --> 00:16:07.314\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n318\n00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:10.252\nthat's why I'm saying if you're\ndoing this in the cloud,\n\n319\n00:16:10.252 --> 00:16:13.922\nif you uploaded this to your One Drive\naccount and then sent them the link.\n\n320\n00:16:13.922 --> 00:16:19.280\nAnd then they edit directly in there and\nthen they come into it.\n\n321\n00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.960\nThat's totally fine.\n\n322\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.370\nBut you are accessing\nthe exact same document.\n\n323\n00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.150\nSo you do have to be\na little careful about that.\n\n324\n00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.330\nBut the cool thing,\nwhich I'm gonna show you next,\n\n325\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:32.710\nis when you're doing all these track\nchanges as the owner of a document.\n\n326\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.610\nI can accept or reject them.\n\n327\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.470\nLike if Joey is making these changes,\nsending it back to Justin,\n\n328\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.730\nand then Justin can say yeah that's\na great suggestion or that's a great edit.\n\n329\n00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:45.897\nYep I'll keep that.\n\n330\n00:16:45.897 --> 00:16:49.329\nNo I don't think that should be another\nheading level because that's not what\n\n331\n00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:50.327\nit's supposed to be.\n\n332\n00:16:50.327 --> 00:16:56.024\nDeny, reject that, and then as the owner\nyou can then go ahead and keep that.\n\n333\n00:16:56.024 --> 00:16:59.141\nSo if you think about the I can accept or\nreject it, but\n\n334\n00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:04.030\nthen you also wanna make sure you have\na back up copy, back up, back up, back up.\n\n335\n00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.660\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n336\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.380\n&gt;&gt; You work in the cloud and\nthat same document, you\n\n337\n00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.710\njust gotta be careful about too much\noverwriting and not having a backup.\n\n338\n00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.980\nEverybody's different and\n\n339\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.530\neverybody had different procedures\nof how they need to do things.\n\n340\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.160\nSo that's why we're staying\non the ground in this\n\n341\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.740\nepisode of just emailing back and forth.\n\n342\n00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.290\nAll right, so\nas Joey I'm doing a save as to let\n\n343\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.799\nJustin know that I have done my\nedits in this particular document.\n\n344\n00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:33.930\nI'll close this.\n\n345\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.985\nCome back into the email and\nlet's reply to Justin.\n\n346\n00:17:37.985 --> 00:17:40.909\nAnd changes, okay.\n\n347\n00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:44.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's German for changes.\n\n348\n00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.720\n&gt;&gt; It's like that whole thing\nif somebody's watching you type,\n\n349\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.875\nyou never type correctly.\n\n350\n00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:53.250\n[LAUGH] And we're going to find,\nthat's Joey.\n\n351\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.620\nSo I will just drag it into there.\n\n352\n00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.290\nThere's my attachment.\n\n353\n00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.740\nSo I will send this back to Justin.\n\n354\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.320\nGoes on its merry little way.\n\n355\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.590\nI will just go to here,\njust to make sure it's being sent.\n\n356\n00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.880\nSwitching, now we're Justin again.\n\n357\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.990\nSo Justin is now receiving\nthe changes from Joey.\n\n358\n00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.900\nSo, I'll take this down, minimize this,\n\n359\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.570\nopen this up and I see all the track\nchanges that just happened.\n\n360\n00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.130\nNow notice the color changes cuz when I\nwas Joey, all my edits were in purple.\n\n361\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:35.280\nNow that I'm back as Justin,\nI'm seeing all of Joey's edits in blue.\n\n362\n00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.370\nNow that's just a user\npreference of what happens as\n\n363\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.490\nI am the editor of this document,\nI will go ahead and make it purple.\n\n364\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:47.440\nAnd now you see here, I'm seeing the edits\nof others and that's why it's blue.\n\n365\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.190\n&gt;&gt; It's actually really\neasy to assimilate.\n\n366\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:54.880\nI look at the page, I easily see okay,\nJoey made some sought of change here and\n\n367\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.900\nit falls over right over my eye tracks\nthe page very well with this so\n\n368\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.880\nI like this system.\n\n369\n00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great, especially when\nyou're collaborating on the same document.\n\n370\n00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.960\nI did this with the textbook that I did,\nand it was,\n\n371\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.670\nwe were always going back and forth.\n\n372\n00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.963\nNow I didn't actually do it in Word,\nI did it in Acrobat.\n\n373\n00:19:11.963 --> 00:19:15.778\nBut it's the same idea of she would\ngo through and anything that I did,\n\n374\n00:19:15.778 --> 00:19:19.023\nshe would make all the edits and\ndo it right in the document.\n\n375\n00:19:19.023 --> 00:19:23.852\nI would then as the designer find all the\nchanges, go into my native document and\n\n376\n00:19:23.852 --> 00:19:27.671\nmake all the changes and\nmaybe make comments long the way like\n\n377\n00:19:27.671 --> 00:19:33.130\nyep I did this and I found this, so on and\nso forth and we would go back and forth.\n\n378\n00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.293\nQuite a few times in like the review\nprocess of me as the designer,\n\n379\n00:19:37.293 --> 00:19:40.941\nher as the publisher and\nthen we just do this all day long.\n\n380\n00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:42.593\nAnd sometimes these comments,\n\n381\n00:19:42.593 --> 00:19:45.894\nwould go from, lot's of different\n[SOUND] go all the way down, so\n\n382\n00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:49.762\nwe might have three or four times that\nwe've gone back and forth with this.\n\n383\n00:19:49.762 --> 00:19:53.301\nIt's pretty powerful tool to do\nall of these tracked changes and\n\n384\n00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:57.640\nsee the differences of what's going on\nright there, like you said, in line.\n\n385\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.220\nWell actually, this isn't in line.\n\n386\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.490\nThis is in balloons.\n\n387\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.495\nTo me it's like in line, but\nit's actually a little bit different.\n\n388\n00:20:06.495 --> 00:20:08.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Spin around a couple of times,\n\n389\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.095\nlet me tell you what I'm talking about.\n\n390\n00:20:10.095 --> 00:20:11.209\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bumpy brakes, Vonne.\n\n391\n00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:12.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz right here,\n\n392\n00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.100\nin the tracked changes, these three\n\n393\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.080\nbuttons right here are something\nyou should just get familiar with.\n\n394\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.340\nCuz sometimes you might get this back and\n\n395\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.440\nthen be like I don't see all of\nthese things off to the side.\n\n396\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.180\nCuz I'm showing all markup right now.\n\n397\n00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.280\nSo these are just different views\njust like we've talked about like\n\n398\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.600\nbeing in read mode or\nthe print preview, or the outline.\n\n399\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.660\nJust different views of the same thing.\n\n400\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.900\n&gt;&gt; So if I go to simple markup you\nsee how it's not all there but down\n\n401\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.437\nthe left-hand side, anywhere where there's\nan edit there's like a big red line.\n\n402\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.220\nIt's just not showing everything.\n\n403\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.510\nSo that's a simple markup.\n\n404\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.420\nNow the comments will still be in there,\n\n405\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.060\nbut any of those edits,\nthat's what's not being shown.\n\n406\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.390\nSo the All Markup, that's a big thing\nthat would always throw me off is like,\n\n407\n00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.470\nwhy can I see this in some and\nsome of the others?\n\n408\n00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.300\nAnd it was like,\nit's just what I'm looking at right here.\n\n409\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.860\nAnd then if I go to No Markup, okay now\nthat’s another one you have to be careful\n\n410\n00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.520\nof like I thought he was\nsupposed to do these changes.\n\n411\n00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.200\nHe might have left this on no markups,\nsaved the file and sent it to me.\n\n412\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.410\nSo I’m just getting it back\ninto the last known state.\n\n413\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.920\nSo always check this to see is\nthe markup showing, do I want it or\n\n414\n00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.560\nsimple or all and then there’s\nthe original of what did it start with,\n\n415\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.970\nokay, this is all the cool things\nabout having those tracked changes.\n\n416\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.210\nCuz the original is still there.\n\n417\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.180\nWe haven't done a hard commit\nto any of these changes.\n\n418\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.850\nCuz right now it's just being tracked and\n\n419\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.530\nkinda keeping in that\nmemory if you wanna say.\n\n420\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.230\nAnd then I can decide whether or\nnot I want to do that or not.\n\n421\n00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.250\nSo all markup is good to\nmake sure you see everything\n\n422\n00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.680\nover there on the right hand side.\n\n423\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.970\nThe other button right below it is\nwhat am I showing as my markup?\n\n424\n00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.310\nAnd you can see the check boxes\nhere of I'm showing comments,\n\n425\n00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.660\nI'm showing any ink\nnotations if you have those.\n\n426\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.900\nWe don't have that right now.\n\n427\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.060\nInsertions and deletions, we did that.\n\n428\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.420\nThe formatting, and then the balloons.\n\n429\n00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.630\nAnd that's why I had to correct myself\nwith saying it's all showing in line,\n\n430\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.180\nbecause it's me in like a general\nsense of the word in line.\n\n431\n00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.440\nIt's like yeah,\nit's right where the edits happened.\n\n432\n00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.300\nBut technically, see,\nif I still show revisions in line,\n\n433\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.720\nthen it goes directly in line and\nnot off to the side.\n\n434\n00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.950\nSo just clarifying that.\n\n435\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.050\nWithin the context of Word\nin that particular meaning.\n\n436\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.560\nIt's kinda like templates.\n\n437\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.090\nYou throw the word template around, but\n\n438\n00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.410\nit means something kinda\ndifferent in Word, so.\n\n439\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:42.860\nWe have the balloons, we have that.\n\n440\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.800\nOkay, show comments and formatting in\nballoons, show all revisions in balloons.\n\n441\n00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.940\nSo these are the defaults\nthat you can see.\n\n442\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.300\nAnd then when we start getting into\nmultiple reviewers, we'll show that in\n\n443\n00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:00.040\nthe Compare and Combine, you might\ncombine edits from multiple people.\n\n444\n00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.210\nAnd this is where you can choose,\nhey I only wanna see Joey's, or\n\n445\n00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.480\nonly see Lance's, or\nme as the owner of this document.\n\n446\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.350\nI don't need to see\nthings I made changes to.\n\n447\n00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.600\nI only wanna see what Joey did.\n\n448\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:18.700\nSo I can turn off Justin and just see\nJoey's comments and mark ups that he did.\n\n449\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:24.000\nSo this is another drop-down to\njust make sure that you're seeing\n\n450\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.940\nwhat you think you're supposed to be\nseeing, and what's actually there.\n\n451\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:32.460\nAnd then the revealing pane, this is if\nyou put it off to the side or the bottom.\n\n452\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.610\nIf I go with vertical,\nit's off over here in a vertical fashion\n\n453\n00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.280\nversus putting it into a horizontal and\nit goes underneath.\n\n454\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.540\nI usually choose off to the side cuz then\nyou can actually change the two pointed\n\n455\n00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.790\nwhite arrows how wide this panel is,\nand this is going through and\n\n456\n00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.880\nshowing you everything, all the revisions\nthat have been done in this document.\n\n457\n00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.790\nAnd you see if you click on them,\nit's actually going to go to the specific\n\n458\n00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.870\nplaces that that particular\nrevision is done in the document.\n\n459\n00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.906\nReally good if you have a really\nlong document across multiple pages.\n\n460\n00:24:05.906 --> 00:24:08.866\nI kept it simple by just keeping one,\nso we can see it all.\n\n461\n00:24:08.866 --> 00:24:13.463\nBut that's really nice to be able to see\nthe revisions in this pane in a list\n\n462\n00:24:13.463 --> 00:24:15.031\nformat if you wanna say.\n\n463\n00:24:15.031 --> 00:24:17.303\nI'm gonna close that for now and\n\n464\n00:24:17.303 --> 00:24:22.194\nzoom out just a little bit if I get\nthe right keys selected, perfect.\n\n465\n00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:28.206\nSo as the owner I can go through and\naccept or reject changes.\n\n466\n00:24:28.206 --> 00:24:32.857\nSo I'll start at the beginning, I'll put\nmy cursor up at the top if we go up to\n\n467\n00:24:32.857 --> 00:24:37.220\nthese buttons we can go to the next\nchange, the next track change well,\n\n468\n00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.900\nthat was mine and notice it is kinda\nhighlighting over my comment as Justin.\n\n469\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.310\nAnd then the next one is putting\nthe cursor you can see it right there,\n\n470\n00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.429\nit's following the next\nparticular revision,\n\n471\n00:24:49.429 --> 00:24:52.413\nthat Joey went ahead and\nanswered my comment.\n\n472\n00:24:52.413 --> 00:24:56.391\nNow this is just moving through here,\nnow do I really need to accept or\n\n473\n00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:58.392\nreject that particular comment?\n\n474\n00:24:58.392 --> 00:25:03.191\nCuz it's not an edit it's just a comment\nso, I'm just gonna pass over that for\n\n475\n00:25:03.191 --> 00:25:08.151\nnow come back around to how I can get rid\nof the comments after I'm done with this.\n\n476\n00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:13.809\nSo the next one is down, down, down that\nmight be a decent thing it's like, okay I\n\n477\n00:25:13.809 --> 00:25:19.314\nmaybe redundant but with department,\nRedundancy Department, redundancy.\n\n478\n00:25:19.314 --> 00:25:21.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH\n&gt;&gt; I totally mess that one up, yeah.\n\n479\n00:25:21.903 --> 00:25:24.086\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The one we're doing last week.\n\n480\n00:25:24.086 --> 00:25:25.670\n&gt;&gt; The redundant,\nDepartment of Redundancy?\n\n481\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.625\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's it, yes.\n\n482\n00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:30.807\nSo it's like we don't really\nneed to have that many down so,\n\n483\n00:25:30.807 --> 00:25:36.140\nI will accept this change so, I click\naccept and it's like, yep there we go.\n\n484\n00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:41.083\nThen the next one, so let's go with next,\nDiana was the cat, well not everybody\n\n485\n00:25:41.083 --> 00:25:45.823\nknows that Diana was the cat, maybe they\nthink Diana is the wife or whatever.\n\n486\n00:25:45.823 --> 00:25:46.895\n&gt;&gt; Stupid Joey.\n\n487\n00:25:46.895 --> 00:25:49.520\n&gt;&gt; Come on Joey don't assume,\nyou know what happens.\n\n488\n00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.246\n&gt;&gt; That's right, hypothesize.\n\n489\n00:25:52.246 --> 00:25:57.352\nSo I will reject this change and you can\nsee that the text goes right back into\n\n490\n00:25:57.352 --> 00:26:02.890\nthe document cuz he had deleted it, but\nI'm saying no, and so it keeps in there.\n\n491\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.926\nCuz it still has got all\nthat original content, and\n\n492\n00:26:05.926 --> 00:26:07.839\nthen we just keep on going down.\n\n493\n00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:11.906\nNow the other way instead of clicking\nthese next and previous buttons,\n\n494\n00:26:11.906 --> 00:26:14.770\nif I wanted to come into here,\nis this repeating?\n\n495\n00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.277\nAnd I could, if I was going back and\nforth with him, I might say like,\n\n496\n00:26:18.277 --> 00:26:22.455\nwell yeah it's repeating that's just\nbecause I'm getting placeholder text for\n\n497\n00:26:22.455 --> 00:26:24.415\nthese episodes for demonstrations.\n\n498\n00:26:24.415 --> 00:26:29.179\nSo you can right-click on anything that's\nover there on the right hand side,\n\n499\n00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:31.910\nin this case, this is a comment.\n\n500\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.598\nSo it's not an accept or reject,\n\n501\n00:26:34.598 --> 00:26:39.114\nit is either delete the comment or\nreply to the comment.\n\n502\n00:26:39.114 --> 00:26:42.340\nAnd at this point sentence is just a note,\nI was like no,\n\n503\n00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.750\nno we're good Joey, thanks for\ncatching that, but that doesn't matter.\n\n504\n00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:51.742\nSo I'm just gonna delete it and I can\nkeep on going so, right clicking on your\n\n505\n00:26:51.742 --> 00:26:56.510\ncomments or any of your edits is just\nanother comment that I will delete.\n\n506\n00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.987\nAnd then I can see that Joey\ndeleted all of this text and\n\n507\n00:26:59.987 --> 00:27:03.401\nI realized yep that was\nsupposed to be deleted.\n\n508\n00:27:03.401 --> 00:27:08.322\nAnd notice and it's a little bit behind\nmy head as well, you can see that when I\n\n509\n00:27:08.322 --> 00:27:13.170\nright-click on this I can accept or\nreject right from the particular edit in\n\n510\n00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:18.190\nthat side right hand, I don't have to do\nfrom the buttons up top on the ribbon.\n\n511\n00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.623\nSo whichever way you feel more\ncomfortable, I will accept that change and\n\n512\n00:27:22.623 --> 00:27:27.125\nI will not accept this one because I do\nnot want that to be its own heading so,\n\n513\n00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:28.223\nI will reject it.\n\n514\n00:27:28.223 --> 00:27:34.030\nAnd it's getting rather tired instead of\nsleepy, all right, we'll accept that one.\n\n515\n00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.196\nAnd now, there's one more you can\nsee that I've added text here so,\n\n516\n00:27:38.196 --> 00:27:42.099\nif I didn't want that to happen\nyou can right-click here as well.\n\n517\n00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:46.562\nNow this is one that didn't come off to\nthe side because added text is going to\n\n518\n00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:50.428\nbe like in the document itself so,\nI think all of that looks good.\n\n519\n00:27:50.428 --> 00:27:54.822\nSo I've gone through, let me delete\nthis cuz I don't need that, perfect.\n\n520\n00:27:54.822 --> 00:27:59.145\nSo I have used the track changes\nto collaborate with a team member,\n\n521\n00:27:59.145 --> 00:28:02.463\nI've gotten all the comments,\nI've accepted and\n\n522\n00:28:02.463 --> 00:28:05.570\nrejected this is going\nto be my final document.\n\n523\n00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:09.812\nAlways good to do a file save\nas just to make sure so,\n\n524\n00:28:09.812 --> 00:28:13.867\nI could say track changes\nfinal I will save this.\n\n525\n00:28:13.867 --> 00:28:18.702\nAnd now this is where I'm done,\nI don't want to track any more changes,\n\n526\n00:28:18.702 --> 00:28:21.808\nyou should really turn\nthe track changes off.\n\n527\n00:28:21.808 --> 00:28:24.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Looks like I forgot to turn them on,\n\n528\n00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:27.581\nI don't wanna turn them off but\nI did lock them so,\n\n529\n00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:32.046\nif I turn that off that will be good,\nand that was the other document, right?\n\n530\n00:28:32.046 --> 00:28:33.029\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n531\n00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:37.401\n&gt;&gt; Okay, staying on track but\nif you had locked it you would need to put\n\n532\n00:28:37.401 --> 00:28:42.396\nin that password, and then once it is\nunlocked you just turn the button off,\n\n533\n00:28:42.396 --> 00:28:45.010\nand then we save that and there we go.\n\n534\n00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:49.912\nSo track changes its super cool, it's\na great way to not commit to any changes\n\n535\n00:28:49.912 --> 00:28:54.739\nin that whole reviewing process and\ngoing back and forth, I use this a lot and\n\n536\n00:28:54.739 --> 00:28:56.722\nit's really, really great.\n\n537\n00:28:56.722 --> 00:29:00.778\nSo hopefully, you can see some reasons\nwhy you would need to use this, and\n\n538\n00:29:00.778 --> 00:29:02.160\nnow you know how to do it.\n\n539\n00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.063\n&gt;&gt; Yvonne, I believe a blind man\ncould see the benefit of using\n\n540\n00:29:05.063 --> 00:29:08.546\nthe tracking of changes, very cool\ntool that they put inside of Word for\n\n541\n00:29:08.546 --> 00:29:10.364\nus to be able to collaborate better.\n\n542\n00:29:10.364 --> 00:29:14.812\nAnd make sure that we don't forget any\nreasons that we were doing certain things,\n\n543\n00:29:14.812 --> 00:29:15.784\nand who did what?\n\n544\n00:29:15.784 --> 00:29:19.002\nThat's also another important thing,\ndon't forget to turn it off and\n\n545\n00:29:19.002 --> 00:29:21.264\non as necessary or\nif you need to, even lock it up.\n\n546\n00:29:21.264 --> 00:29:24.033\nYvonne, you did a great job\ndemonstrating this how we can use\n\n547\n00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:27.890\nthis in our environments, hopefully you\nguys got a lot out of this episode.\n\n548\n00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:30.720\nBut it does like it is that time for\nus to sign off for OfficePro TV,\n\n549\n00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.319\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n550\n00:29:32.319 --> 00:29:33.266\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Yvonne Smith.\n\n551\n00:29:33.266 --> 00:29:34.174\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n552\n00:29:34.174 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.713\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode it is continuing on with more in\n\n4\n00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.867\nour Word 2016 expert level series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:20.924\nAnd joining us back in the studio The\nexpert of Word herself, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n6\n00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:23.434\nVonne, thank you so much for\ncoming by, how are you today?\n\n7\n00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:30.374\n&gt;&gt; I'm fantastic, I'm ready to compare and\ncontrast, comparing and combining.\n\n8\n00:00:30.374 --> 00:00:32.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's all these words that\n\n9\n00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:32.894\nstart with Cs.\n\n10\n00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:34.310\n&gt;&gt; Like peanut butter and jelly, right?\n\n11\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.090\nIt's hard not to say\nthe two things together.\n\n12\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I'm like, I can't remember\nwhat we're doing right now, but\n\n13\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.690\nwe [LAUGH] We are comparing and\ncombining documents.\n\n14\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.450\nIt's funny we had this discussion\nbefore we started filming.\n\n15\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.240\nWell, I didn't know if I should put and.\n\n16\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.780\nAnd we talked about semantics.\n\n17\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.890\nCuz they're not really\ndoing the same thing.\n\n18\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.490\nThey're two separate\nfunctions that you do.\n\n19\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.720\nIn Word, but sometimes to me,\nit's like if you can compare and combine,\n\n20\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.918\nthey're together but they're not.\n\n21\n00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:05.542\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n22\n00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:07.140\n&gt;&gt; They're mutually exclusive.\n\n23\n00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.020\nSo we kinda started getting\ninto context and everything.\n\n24\n00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.409\nBut we went ahead and put and\n\n25\n00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.928\nin the title to make sure that you\nknow that this is what we're doing.\n\n26\n00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:18.755\nBecause it's one of those,\nwhen you talk about, the words in general,\n\n27\n00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:21.288\nnot talking about the actual\nfunction in word.\n\n28\n00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:26.581\nIf you're going to compare something,\nwell, you're combining them anyways,\n\n29\n00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.663\nso we're combining, comparing,\ncontrasting, whatever.\n\n30\n00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:32.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's an interesting trickery of\n\n31\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.645\nlanguage right now.\n\n32\n00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:34.908\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly,\n\n33\n00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:37.696\nyeah, the English\nlanguage is really weird.\n\n34\n00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:40.859\nAnd then you thrown in all these\ntechnical stuffs on top of it and take,\n\n35\n00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.485\nwe doesn't really mean that\nthe way we normally think of it\n\n36\n00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:45.830\nwhen we're talking about\nin the world of word.\n\n37\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.374\n&gt;&gt; So your point being, Vonne,\nthat we are going to compare one thing,\n\n38\n00:01:49.374 --> 00:01:52.137\nthat is one thing that we are going to do,\ncomparing.\n\n39\n00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:55.727\nAnd we are also gonna combine which is\nanother thing that we're going to do, but\n\n40\n00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:58.310\nmaybe not necessarily\ntogether at the same time.\n\n41\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.320\n&gt;&gt; Exactly Daniel, that is a perfect way\nto describe what we're gonna be doing.\n\n42\n00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.430\nSo in a previous episode,\nwe had talked about tracking changes.\n\n43\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.700\nWe went ahead and\nturned on the track changes.\n\n44\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.870\nGotta make sure you do that.\n\n45\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.050\nAnd then, you send it off to somebody or\nmaybe it's just yourself.\n\n46\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.310\nAnd you go through and make your changes\nand you can see what was changed.\n\n47\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.670\nSo that's a good way to track your edits.\n\n48\n00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.880\nWell, what if I forgot to\nturn on the track changes?\n\n49\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.830\nAnd I sent my document off to Joey.\n\n50\n00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.480\nJoey went ahead and made his changes.\n\n51\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.580\nI get it back and\nI'm like I don't know what's different.\n\n52\n00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.650\nAnd maybe I print it out and\ngo line by line and read each one.\n\n53\n00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.600\nAnd then you get really confused.\n\n54\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.520\nI don't know, there's just so\nmany differences.\n\n55\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.303\nBut I know I started with\nthis original document.\n\n56\n00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:46.090\nAnd then, this is the modified document I\nwant to compare and see what is different.\n\n57\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.160\nAnd that's exactly what we're going to do.\n\n58\n00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.510\nNow, with combining separate function.\n\n59\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.090\nThat's where you can combine multiple\nedits from multiple authors.\n\n60\n00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.580\nNow, this is one where you\nare using track changes.\n\n61\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.960\nAnd let's say that I have two editors.\n\n62\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.380\nI have Lance and\nI have Joey as both editors,\n\n63\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.750\nand I went out and turned the track\nchanges on, had them do their edits,\n\n64\n00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.020\nit comes back to me, Justin,\nas the owner of a document.\n\n65\n00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.270\nWell, now I want to combine\nall of Lance's edits and\n\n66\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.710\nall of Joey's edits into one document so\nI can see everybody all together.\n\n67\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.063\n&gt;&gt; Question, can you edit an edit?\n\n68\n00:03:28.063 --> 00:03:31.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So like you said,\nwe had two editors right.\n\n69\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.644\nYou made a change.\n\n70\n00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:33.676\nYou're an editor, I'm an editor.\n\n71\n00:03:33.676 --> 00:03:36.090\nYou make a change I go,\nVonne's wrong there.\n\n72\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.840\nAnd I make a change to your edit.\n\n73\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.570\nWhat does it do with that or\ncan you even do that?\n\n74\n00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, in this sense,\nit's not Joey's gonna do the edits,\n\n75\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.010\nthen pass it on to Lance.\n\n76\n00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.400\nSo in this sense,\nyou sent it out this way.\n\n77\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.966\nAnd so he's doing his edits,\nhe's doing his edits, and then they're.\n\n78\n00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:53.800\n&gt;&gt; So they're not really\nconflicting with each other.\n\n79\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.720\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, but\n\n80\n00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.700\nthat's where what if they both made the\n&gt;&gt; Same edit.\n\n81\n00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.238\nThe cool thing is being the owner and\ncombining all of those changes,\n\n82\n00:04:02.238 --> 00:04:03.498\nyou'll see both.\n\n83\n00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:08.724\nThat way it's like we both say the same\nthing and we'll still do the same process\n\n84\n00:04:08.724 --> 00:04:13.575\nin the end, kind of continuing and\ncompleting this thought of me as just.\n\n85\n00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:19.520\nAnd I get my combined edits together and\nthen I would accept or reject.\n\n86\n00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.120\nAnd then, go ahead and\nsay all right here's my final document.\n\n87\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.810\nSo watch the tracked changes episode for\n\n88\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.300\nthat particular functionality of\naccepting and rejecting the changes.\n\n89\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.390\nIn this episode we're just\ngonna show you how you\n\n90\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.640\nget to the place where you\ncombine multiple edits together.\n\n91\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.210\nSo let's start with the compare and\nI have some documents ready to go.\n\n92\n00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.900\nI have a Knights1 and let's open this.\n\n93\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.530\nAnd you will see that this\nis just all the changes.\n\n94\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.333\nJust a regular document,\nthere's no track changes on here.\n\n95\n00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.990\nSo you can see all the markup,\nthere is no markup.\n\n96\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.690\nSo nothing has been tracked.\n\n97\n00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.690\nI open up where's there it is.\n\n98\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.450\nLike all these documents on my desktop.\n\n99\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.010\nSo I have Knights2, so\nthis is where, hey I went ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.880\nsent this off to Joey and he made edits.\n\n101\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.954\nNow, the only thing that's over\nhere on the right hand side and\n\n102\n00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:16.145\nactually that's from Justin Timberlake it,\nlet's pretend it's from Joey [LAUGH].\n\n103\n00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:19.310\nBut he made a note in here and\nthat's just a comment.\n\n104\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.397\nSo no check changes, but\nI can already tell that,\n\n105\n00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:26.966\nthis the White Knight is purple and\nit centers so I know there's a change.\n\n106\n00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:32.600\nThis is italic, a bold italic,\nwhere in Knights1 it's not.\n\n107\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.570\nBut I don't know line by line like\nwhat words have been changed.\n\n108\n00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.760\nI can't see any of those differences\non that level, so I'm going to compare,\n\n109\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.000\nnights one and night two and\nsee what the differences are.\n\n110\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.910\nBut I'm gonna close everything\n\n111\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.940\nbecause how you start with this is just\nWord with just like a blank document.\n\n112\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.540\nYou just have to get Word up and\n\n113\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.750\nlearning without any of the documents\nthat your trying to compare together.\n\n114\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.180\nSee using that context again\nwhere we're going to compare.\n\n115\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.060\nJust keep those all closed\ncuz you're going to\n\n116\n00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.390\ntell it the opening of the documents\nwithin the dialog box.\n\n117\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.930\nSo we're coming over\nhere to our Review tab.\n\n118\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.960\nAnd over to the right we\nhave that compare and\n\n119\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.650\nsee that's where totally\ndifferent compare, combine.\n\n120\n00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.530\nAnd the compare,\nalso known as legal blackline.\n\n121\n00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.040\nSo if you think about where\nyou're taking each line,\n\n122\n00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.120\nI'm sure there's an actual\ndefinition to legal blackline, but\n\n123\n00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.510\nit really is taking line by line and\ncomparing what is different.\n\n124\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.220\nSo we will click on that.\n\n125\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.630\nCompared documents.\n\n126\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.720\nThis button right here\nmight look like this.\n\n127\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.600\nSo if you don't see all\nthe parts on the bottom,\n\n128\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.230\nthat's because the More\nbutton is not clicked on.\n\n129\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.930\nBut it is going to compare.\n\n130\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.900\nYou can see whether texts they move,\ncomments.\n\n131\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.940\nAnd that's why I wanted\nto add that comment in.\n\n132\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.950\nCuz it is something's that is checking.\n\n133\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.660\nSo pretty much everything\nis being compared.\n\n134\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.840\nBut you could change these\nthings if you wanted to.\n\n135\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.430\nAnd notice that it is going to show\nchanges into a new document because\n\n136\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.610\nI don't want to change any of\nthe original or revised documents.\n\n137\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.840\nThose stay separate.\n\n138\n00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.870\nI want all the comparisons to\nbe in its separate document,\n\n139\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.950\nso not messing up any\nof my source documents.\n\n140\n00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.220\nLet's zoom out, original document.\n\n141\n00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.410\nThere is a drop-down that will have\na lot of my files that I've working with\n\n142\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:39.200\nwithin word, if you had oped it\nyou could probably find in this.\n\n143\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.350\nIt's probably just easier\nto go out to the folder and\n\n144\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.280\nfind the document within your file system.\n\n145\n00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.680\nSo I know that this is on my desktop, and\nI know it's Knights1 and I click Open.\n\n146\n00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.290\nSo this is my original document.\n\n147\n00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.534\nThe revised document, where is that?\n\n148\n00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:56.928\nSame idea, click the little folder.\n\n149\n00:07:56.928 --> 00:08:00.790\nCome out to our desktop,\nwhich is already there, we go to Knights2.\n\n150\n00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:06.039\nSo now I'm comparing one and two, they\ndont have to be named that by any means.\n\n151\n00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:06.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was just for me,\n\n152\n00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:09.000\nyou can name them whatever you want.\n\n153\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.600\nI click OK, and does its little thing,\n\n154\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.210\nand notice this is document two so\nthis is a separate document.\n\n155\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.320\nAnd I can see all the differences\nthat are going through here,\n\n156\n00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.580\nthey're all Justin Timberlake because\nI was the one doing all the documents.\n\n157\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.050\nSo if this had come from, Joey or Lance,\nwhoever had done those particular changes,\n\n158\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.710\nyou would see those labeled over there\non the side of the different people.\n\n159\n00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.390\nFor demonstration purposes\nI create all this stuff so,\n\n160\n00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.560\nit's well me as Justin Timberlake\non this computer.\n\n161\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.080\nSo you can see everything.\n\n162\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.505\nNow this is where changing how\nthings look within this window.\n\n163\n00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:52.030\nBecause like, I can see that okay.\n\n164\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.130\nCat was added, the White Knight\nwas formatted differently,\n\n165\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.230\nthis was deleted in one the documents.\n\n166\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.500\nBut, which one was which.\n\n167\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.550\nIt would be nice kinda see all of them.\n\n168\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.160\nIf you come up to the comparing and\ndrop this down,\n\n169\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.880\nthere the show source documents.\n\n170\n00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.980\nAnd notice it says,\nhide source documents here.\n\n171\n00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.550\nWell, I'd like to kinda see all of them.\n\n172\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.780\nSo if I show both, here we go.\n\n173\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.377\nNow I can see the original\ndocument in one window.\n\n174\n00:09:18.377 --> 00:09:23.841\nI can see the revised, and\nnotice if I scroll down,\n\n175\n00:09:23.841 --> 00:09:28.415\nand the combined Sorry, the compared, so\n\n176\n00:09:28.415 --> 00:09:34.560\nhard because you are combining them, but-\n&gt;&gt; You're not really.\n\n177\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You are, but you're not.\n\n178\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're combining in the way\nthat we think of it, but in Word,\n\n179\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:39.560\nit's still compare.\n\n180\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.995\nDo you see the struggle I'm\nhaving with this right here?\n\n181\n00:09:41.995 --> 00:09:43.707\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We can see it fine.\n\n182\n00:09:43.707 --> 00:09:46.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So the compared document, and\n\n183\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.640\nas I scroll through, let's scroll, there.\n\n184\n00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.690\nNow you see it moving in all\nof these different windows.\n\n185\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.280\nSo you could say, there we go.\n\n186\n00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.970\nMy ears and whiskers,\nI can se that is different here, but\n\n187\n00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.130\nif I can get in one\nwindow versus the other,\n\n188\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:07.460\nI can scroll them somewhat independently,\nbut they all kind of move together.\n\n189\n00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:13.390\nSo this is a great way that I can really\nsee more line by line what has changed.\n\n190\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.480\nI have a whole revisions panel over here.\n\n191\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.040\nAnd so\nnow I have compared these documents and\n\n192\n00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.900\njust like before I can go through each one\nof them go lights the next next next and\n\n193\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:31.590\neither accept or reject, the different\nchanges from that comparison.\n\n194\n00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:36.230\nAnd then do a file Save As, and\nnow I have my edited version, and\n\n195\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.590\nthat's great if you\nforget to track changes.\n\n196\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.140\nSo to me it is pretty powerful, it works.\n\n197\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.700\nI don't have to take that piece of paper\nand put the paper here and go down and\n\n198\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.390\nlook over and look over,\nit does it all for me.\n\n199\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is a nice, nice feature\nbecause anybody that's had to do\n\n200\n00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.600\ncomparison of two different documents\njust to look for those probably subtle or\n\n201\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.630\nminor changes It can become very,\nvery frustrating, and\n\n202\n00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.960\nthey've done a really good job of trying\nto make that easy to track and follow and\n\n203\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.060\nfind those changes, and see whether or\nnot you wanna keep them running.\n\n204\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.150\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's really, really handy.\n\n205\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:15.290\nAnd so Compare is two documents that you\nare comparing and seeing the differences.\n\n206\n00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.100\nThe one one and done.\n\n207\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.600\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n208\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's move on to combine them,\n\n209\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.905\nwhat does that do?\n\n210\n00:11:20.905 --> 00:11:22.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you.\n\n211\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.220\nSo I will close all of this,\n\n212\n00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.720\nI don't want to save the changes right\nnow because we're just getting to that\n\n213\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.240\npoint where you would then move on and\ndo all the accepting and rejecting.\n\n214\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.893\nWe have some different altitude\nversion with track changers.\n\n215\n00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:40.720\nSo let me start the scenario here,we\nhave queen of hearts share and\n\n216\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.260\nthis is a document that i as\nthe owner as Justin Timberlake.\n\n217\n00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.728\nI would do the same thing i that i\nhad done on a track changer episode.\n\n218\n00:11:48.728 --> 00:11:51.290\nWhere i made pretty little moat in here or\n\n219\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.280\nmaybe them put that in\ninstruction of the email.\n\n220\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.940\n&gt;&gt; That I'm sending this off to Joey and\nLance.\n\n221\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.511\nSo I turn the track changes on, email it\nout, they go ahead and make their edits,\n\n222\n00:12:03.511 --> 00:12:04.783\nand send it back to me.\n\n223\n00:12:04.783 --> 00:12:08.172\nSo this is our original\n[INAUDIBLE] document,\n\n224\n00:12:08.172 --> 00:12:11.211\nthis is gonna be our starting document.\n\n225\n00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:16.285\nAnd I've already kind of set this up\nto where Joey has made his edits.\n\n226\n00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:19.055\nAnd if I open up the queen\nof hearts chair Joey,\n\n227\n00:12:19.055 --> 00:12:24.285\nyou can see the inserted text,\nsome formatted text.\n\n228\n00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:27.725\nIt is labeled as Joey Fatone\nbecause I actually did all of this.\n\n229\n00:12:27.725 --> 00:12:31.610\nI went over into Joey's computer,\ndid his edits, and then sent it back.\n\n230\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.610\nSo I can see that this is\nwhat Joey has done with his.\n\n231\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.460\nClose that.\n\n232\n00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.040\nLet's see what Lance has done.\n\n233\n00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.570\nWe have some edits from Lance, as well.\n\n234\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.490\nHe's added a comment in here.\n\n235\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.850\nHe's changed rather sleepy to tired again.\n\n236\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.000\nSo these are all the things\nthat Lance has done.\n\n237\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.892\nI want to combine Lance and\nJoey's edits into one.\n\n238\n00:12:54.892 --> 00:13:01.320\nSo we're gonna start with just opening up\nword, and getting a blank document to go.\n\n239\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.730\nAnd it's really the same\nprocedure as doing the compare.\n\n240\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.720\nexcept for using combine [LAUGH]\nit is the same with different,\n\n241\n00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.440\nmy favorite saying\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n242\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.097\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] so come over the feel and\n\n243\n00:13:13.097 --> 00:13:16.809\ncome over to compare, drop this down and\nwe are going to combine and\n\n244\n00:13:16.809 --> 00:13:20.940\nit says combined revisions from\nmultiple offers into a single document.\n\n245\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.124\nAnd we do have two people, so\n\n246\n00:13:23.124 --> 00:13:28.430\nwe are going to have to combine\nthe original with the first.\n\n247\n00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:33.660\nGet our results, then take those results\nand combine them with the third.\n\n248\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.406\nSo you have to do two steps.\n\n249\n00:13:35.406 --> 00:13:37.100\n&gt;&gt; It's a stepping process.\n\n250\n00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nCos you can only do two at a time, so\n\n251\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.310\nyou can't say okay here's the original and\nthis one and\n\n252\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.890\nthis one, make it all together.\n\n253\n00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.170\nSo you do have to kind of step it out.\n\n254\n00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.810\nLet's go with combine.\n\n255\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.630\n&gt;&gt; Does it matter in which, so\n\n256\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.550\nyou have three documents that\nyou are going to combine.\n\n257\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.970\nDoes it matter which one you do first?\n\n258\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.662\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily.\n\n259\n00:13:55.662 --> 00:13:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but maybe.\n\n260\n00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.020\n&gt;&gt; The only way it could matter\nis something that's going to\n\n261\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.722\nhappen when we see about the format.\n\n262\n00:14:02.722 --> 00:14:03.281\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; When we get\n\n263\n00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:07.940\nto that dialogue box you might say\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I could see a scenario where,\n\n264\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.817\nin that case, I might want to do\nthis combination first, besides.\n\n265\n00:14:13.817 --> 00:14:14.634\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n266\n00:14:14.634 --> 00:14:18.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is the short answer.\n\n267\n00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.490\nSo let's open up our original document.\n\n268\n00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:27.300\nGo on to our desktop and we will go with\nthe Queen of Hearts, that's the one.\n\n269\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.430\nWe will do the share,\nbecause that is my original document,\n\n270\n00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.960\nI'm going to combine\nthat with the edits from,\n\n271\n00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.080\nwe'll go with Joey first and\nwe'll click open.\n\n272\n00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.569\nIt is combining everything,\nwe're now on combine.\n\n273\n00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:48.190\nAnd we are going to show\nthe changes in a new document.\n\n274\n00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.140\nYou click OK.\n\n275\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.803\nThis is the dialog box, or the warning,\nthat says Word can only store,\n\n276\n00:14:53.803 --> 00:14:58.960\nWord can store only one set of formatting\nchanges in the final merge document.\n\n277\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.790\nChoose which set of\nformatting changes to keep.\n\n278\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.540\nThis is where it would matter in a sense.\n\n279\n00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.490\nBecause you can only keep\none set of formattings.\n\n280\n00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.770\nWhen you're setting off your edits\nto your different reviewers or\n\n281\n00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.860\nyour different authors,\nyou really should think about,\n\n282\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.720\nokay Lance, you're only going\nto do formatting changes.\n\n283\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.300\nSuch as fonts, colors,\nalignments, things like that.\n\n284\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:32.690\nAnd Joey you're only going to concentrate\non the content like editing the document,\n\n285\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.810\ndon't worry about color and\neverything like because if Joey and\n\n286\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:42.040\nLance are both doing formattings well\nthey're gonna override each other.\n\n287\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.360\nAnd okay so that's where the whole\nprocedure of who combines first.\n\n288\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.521\nIt all depends on who is kinda\nset as the formatting, so\n\n289\n00:15:51.521 --> 00:15:54.687\nin this sense do I wanna\nkeep my original or\n\n290\n00:15:54.687 --> 00:16:00.312\ndo I wanna merge the formatting with\nthe combined one which would be Joey.\n\n291\n00:16:00.312 --> 00:16:06.122\nLet's say I've instructed Joey to do\nformatting changes, so in this sense\n\n292\n00:16:06.122 --> 00:16:12.930\nI would say I want to keep the formatting\nfrom Joey's document and not the original.\n\n293\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.910\nSo that's where it could be in\na situation where it would matter.\n\n294\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.829\nSo let's zoom out a little bit more and\nwe will continue with the merge.\n\n295\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.900\nBrings it all together.\n\n296\n00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.930\nAnd it is bringing up these\nwindows where it is combining\n\n297\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.600\nall of my information together.\n\n298\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.280\nAnd now I have my original document,\nmy revised document.\n\n299\n00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:37.520\nBut again if I don't need to see this, cuz\nthis is the exact same thing as compare.\n\n300\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.970\nRight?\nNow we're getting in that loop again.\n\n301\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.720\nThis is just a view.\n\n302\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.980\nComing up here I can choose\nthe source documents for it.\n\n303\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:51.520\nI don't need to see it, I just need to see\nthe final combined results of the edits.\n\n304\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.950\nSo I'm gonna hide the source documents and\nthis is where,\n\n305\n00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.690\nokay I have combined the original\nwith Joey so here is everything.\n\n306\n00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.900\nTo start with,\nI know what has been different.\n\n307\n00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.350\nAnd I will close the revisions.\n\n308\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:11.380\nNow I need to go ahead and change or\ncombine results or combine results too.\n\n309\n00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.260\nSee there it is up in the tile bar.\n\n310\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.660\nI will take all of these changes,\nthe results, and\n\n311\n00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.540\ncombine it in with Lance's Edits.\n\n312\n00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.020\nCome back and do the same thing.\n\n313\n00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:28.550\nSo this is that two step process\ncombine my combine results.\n\n314\n00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.710\nNow this is not a saved\ndocument in my file system.\n\n315\n00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:38.340\nSo this is where you will need to do this\ndrop down here with the original document.\n\n316\n00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.590\nI can scroll down, there it is, combine\nresults to what I have opened right now.\n\n317\n00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:48.540\nAnd I'm going to bring in\nthe revised document of Lance.\n\n318\n00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.030\nSo we'll find the Queen of\nHearts share Lance open that up.\n\n319\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.090\nIt's gonna show all\nthe changes in a new document.\n\n320\n00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.320\nI click okay, this is again.\n\n321\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.270\nAnd this is where I if I merge this\nin with Lance you will see right\n\n322\n00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:08.580\nhere that Joey Fatone he did some\nformatting changes off to the side.\n\n323\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.530\nIt says font, bold and italic so\nthat was that formatting.\n\n324\n00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:22.100\nIf I choose now use Lance this is where\nLance's formattings will override Joey's.\n\n325\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.940\nOkay so you gotta kinda pick\n\n326\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.580\nwho's in charge of formatting cuz\nit will make a difference here.\n\n327\n00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:34.720\nNow I can say no don't take Lance's\nformatting, stay with this original one.\n\n328\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.820\nAnd so there's that priority level.\n\n329\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.290\nYou choose which\nformatting's gonna be kept.\n\n330\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.810\nSo in this sense I will say your document.\n\n331\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:50.120\nCuz I don't want any of Lance's\nchanges to override anything here.\n\n332\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.050\nSo we will continue with the merge,\nbring it in.\n\n333\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.850\nAnd so here we go, me as Justin\nas the owner of this document,\n\n334\n00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.620\nI have now combined the edits and\n\n335\n00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.630\nthe track changes from both Lance and\nJoey.\n\n336\n00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.760\nAnd now I can go through and\ndo my accepting and rejecting.\n\n337\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.630\nAnd just to kind of just review\nthat one step here, remember,\n\n338\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.810\ndefinitely choose do you wanna\nsee all markups, simple markup.\n\n339\n00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.930\nI like to keep it in all markup\ncuz I wanna see everything.\n\n340\n00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:25.940\nI don't wanna just have a the little red\nlines off the side, I need to see this, so\n\n341\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.220\nI like to do the all markup.\n\n342\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.990\nAnd now that I do have multiple editors,\n\n343\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.210\nI can come over here to the specific\npeople, and I can turn on and\n\n344\n00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.740\noff because say you had a fourth editor,\nthen you just do the step again.\n\n345\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.580\nYou can take this combine results,\nthis document five and\n\n346\n00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.560\nthen combine it in with somebody else's,\nand then you might have three or\n\n347\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.890\nfour different edits and\ntrack changes throughout here.\n\n348\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:52.440\nAnd you can pick them, you can pick how,\nof course, the revisions are being shown.\n\n349\n00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.350\nWhether they are in balloons or inline.\n\n350\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.370\nOnly show the formatting, cuz maybe\nI don't need to see anything else.\n\n351\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:03.378\nI can turn on and off these\ndifferent results that I'm seeing.\n\n352\n00:20:03.378 --> 00:20:08.140\nAnd a mark-up and then you as the owner\ngo through, accept, reject, yep,\n\n353\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.950\nthis is great.\n\n354\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.070\nAll right, I've collaborated\nwith multiple people to get\n\n355\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.350\nto my final result of my document.\n\n356\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.330\nAnd I don't have to worry about\ncrushing dreams with the ink pad and\n\n357\n00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.919\neverything [LAUGH].\n\n358\n00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:23.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I'll just crush them later on.\n\n359\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.200\nI have the know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You just.\n\n360\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.302\n&gt;&gt; Nope, nope you're done.\n\n361\n00:20:25.302 --> 00:20:27.542\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not quite crust but slowly chip away.\n\n362\n00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:29.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n363\n00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.080\nAnd so there we go.\n\n364\n00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.530\nWe've combined multiple edits and\nwe go through our steps.\n\n365\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Alright, well very cool stuff Von.\n\n366\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:40.460\nObviously, well hopefully, you can see how\npowerful and advantageous this can be for\n\n367\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.670\nyou as you're going through your editing\ncycle and your documents and Von,\n\n368\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.460\nI think you did a very good job even\nthough it is a difficult thing to explain\n\n369\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.560\non the difference between comparing and\ncombining and those functions within Word.\n\n370\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.750\nThat being said, whew, right?\n\n371\n00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.970\nWipe your forehead, take a deep breath.\n\n372\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.060\nWe can now all breathe easy, go play\nwith it and see what you can do with it.\n\n373\n00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.050\nAnd see how you can make it work\nreally well in your environment.\n\n374\n00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.240\nThat being said,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n375\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.390\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n376\n00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.630\nHope you have enjoyed it.\n\n377\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.970\nBut signing for Office Pro TV I've\nbeen your host

Okay, yes, we're collaborating.\n\n46\n00:01:57.146 --> 00:01:58.732\nThank you.\nYou started getting me thinking about\n\n47\n00:01:58.732 --> 00:01:59.770\ntypography and I'm like, ooh.\n\n48\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.706\nLet's talk, wait.\n\n49\n00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:01.418\n&gt;&gt; Squirrel.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n50\n00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:02.722\n&gt;&gt; Shiny.\n\n51\n00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:06.978\n[LAUGH] So\nlet's jump into Justin's computer and\n\n52\n00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:10.091\ngo through this whole scenario of,\n\n53\n00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:14.758\nI have a document that I would\nlike to work with Joey and\n\n54\n00:02:14.758 --> 00:02:20.600\nwe want to talk to each other\ntogether while we edit this document.\n\n55\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.260\nSo we have a file called\nQueen of Hearts Share Online.\n\n56\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.820\nSo I know that this is the one\nthat we're gonna put up online.\n\n57\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.930\nSo when I open this up,\nwe are all on Office365 accounts.\n\n58\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.640\nSo this is where I have a OneDrive account\nthat is part of my Office subscription.\n\n59\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.370\nSo when I have the option to do\na file save as, one of the places I\n\n60\n00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.630\ncan share or saving this, we're gonna\nsave first and then we're gonna share.\n\n61\n00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.130\nOne of the places I can locate\nthis is in my OneDrive account.\n\n62\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.190\nAnd this is going up into the cloud.\n\n63\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.655\nAnd as we've talked about\nthis in some other episodes,\n\n64\n00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:01.156\nthat OneDrive,\nit's very much like Google Docs.\n\n65\n00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:05.987\nI mean, that's what the thing that we\ncan compare it to, or maybe Dropbox or\n\n66\n00:03:05.987 --> 00:03:10.968\nother type of cloud storage location\nservices that you can sign yourself up for\n\n67\n00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:14.989\nan account and use that if you're\nin the cloud type of storage.\n\n68\n00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.217\nBut OneDrive,\nwhy's that have an advantage,\n\n69\n00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:21.190\nwith an advantage over those other ones?\n\n70\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.350\nIt works all within all of your Office\nproducts so it's all connected.\n\n71\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.140\nThat's the whole thing about Office 365,\n\n72\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.860\nis being able to use these different\ncollaborations in realtime.\n\n73\n00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.760\nThere's some really cool features.\n\n74\n00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.330\nSo, if you're not on a subscription,\n\n75\n00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.850\nyou might wanna look into it,\nif you have a need to.\n\n76\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.199\nYou might not need it, so\nthat's why we have different options.\n\n77\n00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:46.637\nSo, when we put our file into this shared,\nor this cloud location then\n\n78\n00:03:46.637 --> 00:03:51.997\nI can be able to share it out with\npeople and just send them a link to it.\n\n79\n00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:55.521\nSo this is different than\nthe tracking changes and emailing and\n\n80\n00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:57.460\nus all staying on the ground.\n\n81\n00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.270\nWe are going to be accessing\nthe same file at the same time and\n\n82\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.380\nworking in the same place.\n\n83\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.742\nIt's not taking different versions and\ncomparing and contrasting and tracking.\n\n84\n00:04:09.742 --> 00:04:15.410\nSo you do need to kind of\ndecide which work flow,\n\n85\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.650\nwork process that you want to do.\n\n86\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.600\nSo this will be the first step.\n\n87\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.400\nSaving it into your OneDrive account.\n\n88\n00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.470\nAnd now I can keep it.\n\n89\n00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.772\nI can keep the same name,\ngot it stored up in the cloud.\n\n90\n00:04:27.772 --> 00:04:28.459\nI go ahead and click Save.\n\n91\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.010\nAnd it might take a little bit longer,\nyou get a little spinning and\n\n92\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.610\ndown at the status bar.\n\n93\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.300\nI don't know if you caught that, it was\npretty quick cuz I'm actually connected\n\n94\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.120\nto, I'm actually hardwired, I'm not\non a wireless connection right now.\n\n95\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.720\nIt was saying uploading to SharePoint.\n\n96\n00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.690\nAnd don't let the whole\nSharePoint thing confuse you,\n\n97\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.430\nlike well I'm not on SharePoint.\n\n98\n00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.240\nIt's all part of the Office 365,\nwhere everything's really on SharePoint.\n\n99\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.430\n&gt;&gt; SharePoint running in the background,\npulling the strings, as it were.\n\n100\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where some\norganizations, or large organizations,\n\n101\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.340\nmight actually use SharePoint\nto its fullest extent,\n\n102\n00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.510\nwhere you have different intranet\nsites and different places you can go.\n\n103\n00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.440\nIf you don't have that setup,\ndon't worry about that,\n\n104\n00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.960\nthat's just that thing that,\nwhat does Justin say?\n\n105\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.860\n&gt;&gt; The hand wave.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, nothing to see here,\n\n106\n00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.025\njust keep on going, trust me.\n\n107\n00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:23.730\n[LAUGH] So I put this up into the cloud so\n\n108\n00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.160\nnow I want to share this out with Joey and\nLance.\n\n109\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.450\nSo up on the top where it says share,\nI can come into here and\n\n110\n00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.726\nit will be down at the bottom.\n\n111\n00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:39.190\nYou could see, and it just popped up but\nwhere it says send as attachment,\n\n112\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.366\nthat was on of the options we had when\nI didn't have this shared into or\n\n113\n00:05:43.366 --> 00:05:45.394\nsaved into my OneDrive account.\n\n114\n00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:50.328\nBut now that I do I get a get\na sharing link and that's a little bit\n\n115\n00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:55.825\ndifferent than before cuz I could\njust get a straight up link, copy and\n\n116\n00:05:55.825 --> 00:06:01.414\npaste that and put it into my email or\nmaybe I'm texting it to somebody or\n\n117\n00:06:01.414 --> 00:06:05.890\nusing Skype as a way of\ncommunicating back and forth.\n\n118\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.000\n&gt;&gt; So usually kind of takes advantage of\nthe whole idea of what we do nowadays\n\n119\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.940\nwhere you're reading an article or\nyou're doing something online and\n\n120\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.310\nit says share this.\n\n121\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.670\nYou click that, it gives you a link and\n\n122\n00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.510\nyou can paste that into a text document or\nwhatever.\n\n123\n00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.670\nSame kind of idea.\n\n124\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nMy iPhone does that.\n\n125\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You know as far as you have that\n\n126\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.020\nlittle button at the top.\n\n127\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I can either email or message.\n\n128\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.040\nIt's the exact same thing.\n\n129\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.910\nJust all within Office.\n\n130\n00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.300\nAnd it's just a straight up link.\n\n131\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.240\nHowever you wanna do with it,\nis up to you.\n\n132\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.080\nBut it does get to a sharable link.\n\n133\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.860\nNow the other thing is,\nif I'm all connected using my Outlook and\n\n134\n00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.830\nI'm going to be emailing\nsomeone that also has Outlook,\n\n135\n00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.310\nnot that that's like a requirement.\n\n136\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.120\nThey could be on Gmail and they'll still\nget a link and everything like that.\n\n137\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.480\nBut I can just straight up right here,\n\n138\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.050\ninvite people to start sharing my\ndocument, and email it right from Word.\n\n139\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.930\nSo you don't even have to\ndo the whole get the link,\n\n140\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.730\nopen up Skype or\nOutlook and paste and send.\n\n141\n00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.010\nDo it all in one place.\n\n142\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.510\nBut it's nice that it gives\nyou that functionality,\n\n143\n00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.170\nbecause you might not always want\nto just email right from here.\n\n144\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.950\nSo I'm gonna invite some people, I'm going\nto type in Joey and it should pop up.\n\n145\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.800\nThere it is.\n\n146\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.870\nBecause I do have like my global\naddress list that is all part of\n\n147\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.160\nthe Office Pro demo code,\nthat's our company and\n\n148\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.945\nso Joey and Lance and\nJT are all within that same network.\n\n149\n00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:33.620\nSo that's why it's coming up and\nit's tied to my Outlook context.\n\n150\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:39.350\nSo I would like to go with Joey and let's\ngo ahead and throw one into Lance as well.\n\n151\n00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.970\nThey can edit, because I would\nlike them to contribute to this.\n\n152\n00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.970\nOr you could just set it to where, I just\nwant you to see it, I want you to read it,\n\n153\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.770\nand maybe, then, give me a phone call,\nand tell me what's going on there.\n\n154\n00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.439\nI mean, there's different reasons why you\ndon't want people to edit your document,\n\n155\n00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:57.554\njust read only, or edit.\n\n156\n00:07:57.554 --> 00:07:58.946\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nkeep that there.\n\n157\n00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:05.361\nI can type an additional message, for\nyou That's all I'm gonna take for now.\n\n158\n00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:08.641\n[LAUGH] But\nyou can add any type of note there, and\n\n159\n00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:13.160\nthen this goes ahead and\nshares right on out, sending the email.\n\n160\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.000\nOutlook does not have to be opened,\nit can be closed.\n\n161\n00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.219\nI just have this opened for making\nit a little faster within our demos,\n\n162\n00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:25.812\nwithin this particular episode.\n\n163\n00:08:25.812 --> 00:08:28.520\nAnd through that, where I was trying to\ndo two things at once, I'm talking and\n\n164\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.180\nthen reading that.\n\n165\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.090\nAnd then the word that I'm reading\njust came out of my mouth.\n\n166\n00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you could see now that Joey can edit\n\n167\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.320\nand also Lance can edit\nthis document in the cloud.\n\n168\n00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.510\nSo as this owner, I've shared it out.\n\n169\n00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.730\nWell, let's see what's gonna\nhappen on the receiving end.\n\n170\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.375\nSo now we're going to switch personalities\nagain, swipe on, I love the swipe.\n\n171\n00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

It just gives a generic error.\n\n531\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, file not found.\n\n532\n00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or page not found, you can't do it.\n\n533\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.140\nI'm not sure on the 404.\n\n534\n00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But it says something like,\n\n535\n00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.830\nhey this isn't working.\n\n536\n00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:04.030\nSo I can stop sharing and\nI will take him off and\n\n537\n00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:07.570\nnow Lance is the only one that can edit.\n\n538\n00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.560\nNow this is if your\nonline in your account.\n\n539\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:15.350\nI did wanna show you that if your in Word,\n\n540\n00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.960\nwere going to now, I can't open it, I was\nalways gonna go to one of the desktop,\n\n541\n00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.740\ndoesn't live there, does it, so we'll come\nover here to word let's start this up.\n\n542\n00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.640\nAnd I can see over my recent,\nsee that location over here?\n\n543\n00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.890\nIt's like, nope not that one.\n\n544\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.050\nThat's my desktop version.\n\n545\n00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.790\nThis is one that's in\nmy OneDrive account so\n\n546\n00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.720\nI'm gonna open it right\nhere from my recent.\n\n547\n00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:43.450\nYou can also remove\nthe sharing link within Word.\n\n548\n00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:48.730\nSo if I come over here to share and\nwe let connect and it's refreshing.\n\n549\n00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:53.071\nYou can see there that because\nI took off Joey in the cloud,\n\n550\n00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:56.361\nhe's not in this list anymore but\nLance is.\n\n551\n00:26:56.361 --> 00:26:59.467\nAnd this is where I could take Lance,\n\n552\n00:26:59.467 --> 00:27:03.385\nI can right click on this and\nI can remove user.\n\n553\n00:27:03.385 --> 00:27:06.848\nYou can also if there is one\nthat says like link to anybody,\n\n554\n00:27:06.848 --> 00:27:09.870\nyou can right click and say remove link.\n\n555\n00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.170\nSo you can do it right\nfrom within Word and\n\n556\n00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:17.700\nremove this person and\nit's gonna take that permission off.\n\n557\n00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:23.230\nI sometimes, I've learned to trust this,\ncuz I've, okay, I'm gonna test this out.\n\n558\n00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.140\nIt didn't work.\n\n559\n00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.370\nGo and sign in,\ngo into my OneDrive account.\n\n560\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.350\nIt's like,\nnow it says it's not being shared.\n\n561\n00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:30.830\nIt's only for me.\n\n562\n00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.060\nBut I get a little wary\nof that once in a while.\n\n563\n00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.382\nBut actually I'm like, you know what,\nthis is totally legit.\n\n564\n00:27:36.382 --> 00:27:37.290\n[LAUGH] It works.\n\n565\n00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:38.570\nIt really works.\n\n566\n00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.750\nJust trust it so but\n\n567\n00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:45.510\nif you know you can always double check\nit just like I do just to make sure.\n\n568\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.547\n&gt;&gt; Just to verify right?\n\n569\n00:27:46.547 --> 00:27:47.447\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes,\n\n570\n00:27:47.447 --> 00:27:50.703\nalways back up and always make\nsure you know what you're doing.\n\n571\n00:27:50.703 --> 00:27:55.444\nSo you guys you know that's the different\nways that we can collaborate in real time\n\n572\n00:27:55.444 --> 00:27:59.507\nonline through our Office 365 accounts and\nit's pretty awesome.\n\n573\n00:27:59.507 --> 00:28:02.643\nAnd well, of course, you do need\nto have an internet connection so\n\n574\n00:28:02.643 --> 00:28:04.951\nif you don't have that,\nthen this won't work.\n\n575\n00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:05.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n576\n00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.760\none kind of the caveats of cloud\ncollaboration or cloud anything.\n\n577\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.630\nIt's on the internet.\n\n578\n00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.920\nThat's what cloud means, basically,\nis it's out there in the internet.\n\n579\n00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.140\nSo make sure you have a working\ninternet connection or\n\n580\n00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.170\nthis isn't going to do very well for you.\n\n581\n00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.310\n&gt;&gt; And we were talking about that.\n\n582\n00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.715\nAren't we always online.\n\n583\n00:28:21.715 --> 00:28:23.046\nWe're talking online right now.\n\n584\n00:28:23.046 --> 00:28:23.627\nWait, no we're in.\n\n585\n00:28:23.627 --> 00:28:24.980\n&gt;&gt;

another great\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.660\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery and\n\n5\n00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.480\nin today's episode it is more in\nour Word 2016

Thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.770\nI'm fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.440\nI'm wonderful.\n\n13\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.400\nSo glad to be back.\n\n14\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.370\n&gt;&gt; We're glad to have you.\n\n15\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n16\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.820\nSo we're going to be talking\nabout something near and\n\n17\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.950\ndear to your heart, I know.\n\n18\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.490\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n19\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.094\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk\nabout document security.\n\n20\n00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:35.675\n&gt;&gt; Dun dun dun!\n\n21\n00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:36.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.780\n&gt;&gt; Right sounds so ominous so but\n\n23\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.520\nthis is just all the different\nthings that we can do to, well,\n\n24\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.460\nmake your documents a little bit safer.\n\n25\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.660\nAnd have people know that, hey don't\nbe messing with my document because\n\n26\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.310\nit's in its final state so\nplease don't mess with it.\n\n27\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.400\nBecause of course if I'm on my own\ncomputer I'm hoping that nobody's gonna\n\n28\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.140\nactually get on to my computer and\nstart messing with my word files.\n\n29\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.590\nBut in a larger organization, a lot of\npeople are on shared network drives and\n\n30\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.610\nso everybody has access to\neverybody's documents, really.\n\n31\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.480\nUnless you have certain permissions.\n\n32\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.570\nSo you want to say hey guys, don't mess\nwith this and then that's a warning.\n\n33\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.680\nBut then you wanna take\nit to the next level and\n\n34\n00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.270\nbe like okay, you can't open\nthis unless you have a password.\n\n35\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.180\nAnd then, I'm going to restrict\naccess even more to where\n\n36\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.410\nyou can't use certain styles.\n\n37\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.510\nSo this depends on what level of lock down\nyou [LAUGH] want your document to be on.\n\n38\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.796\nSo we are gonna be going through\nthose different options.\n\n39\n00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:36.710\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne I assume this will really\ncome in handy that being able to\n\n40\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.240\nlock down certain features or remove the\nability to do certain things altogether.\n\n41\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.141\nWhen you're talking about collaboration.\n\n42\n00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:47.223\nWe want somebody who is just reviewing\nsomething to make wholesale edits that\n\n43\n00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:48.734\nwould probably be bad-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n44\n00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:50.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so being able to do this,\n\n45\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.400\nI see where it would have\na really strong emphasis.\n\n46\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or maybe something like,\n\n47\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.060\ntake it to that level of you're only\nsupposed to change the content.\n\n48\n00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.680\nYou're supposed to edit it.\n\n49\n00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.760\nDon't change the way things look.\n\n50\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.510\nSo those different levels\nof where we need to be.\n\n51\n00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.570\nSo why don't we jump right on in and\nstart from the top.\n\n52\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.760\nWe have a file called restrict styles.\n\n53\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.450\nAnd this can be any document.\n\n54\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.590\nI just went ahead and\nnamed it that way just because and so\n\n55\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.120\nwe're back with Alice in Wonderland.\n\n56\n00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.490\nSo I wanted to start\noff with a simple one.\n\n57\n00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.140\nIt's hidden text.\n\n58\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.049\nNow why would you want to hide text?\n\n59\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.590\nJust because you want to hide text.\n\n60\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.140\n&gt;&gt; You're dabbling in the dark arts\nof secrecy and espionage [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI just want to hide it from people.\n\n62\n00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.680\nBut this is where you hide\nit from this view, and\n\n63\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.880\nwhat I mean by this view is where we\ndon't have our show/hide characters on.\n\n64\n00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.410\nWith our show/hide characters, this is\nwhere we can see all of the spaces,\n\n65\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.890\nall the tabs, every type of Input\nthat we have done in this document.\n\n66\n00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.190\nSo as soon as you turn that on,\nthen the hidden text shows up.\n\n67\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.280\nSo why would you want to?\n\n68\n00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.820\nI'm really trying to figure out\na reason why you'd want to hide text.\n\n69\n00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, actually, okay.\n\n70\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.270\nSo it's in a report, how about that,\nwe have an annual report and\n\n71\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.890\nyou have it for the shareholders and\nyou have all this information for that.\n\n72\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.010\nBut you're going to do another\ncopy maybe cuz you're printing it.\n\n73\n00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.130\nAnd for other people that you don't\nneed to see the stock value and\n\n74\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.290\nthe information about the CEO's cat.\n\n75\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.732\nI don't know i'm making it up [LAUGH].\n\n76\n00:03:27.732 --> 00:03:29.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like that information does not need to\n\n77\n00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.990\nbe shown you go ahead and hide it print\nit out and then go long your merry way.\n\n78\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.530\nNow like I said if you're\nsending this to somebody and\n\n79\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.430\nthey show the high characters\nare going to see it.\n\n80\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.308\nSo I don't want you to think that this is\nlike you're going to be hiding it from\n\n81\n00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:45.646\neveryone and nobody can ever see it.\n\n82\n00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:47.519\nIt's one of those half and\na half, it's a hybrid.\n\n83\n00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.837\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n84\n00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:52.295\nVonne likes to put, embedded into\nher text, Tim is a big stinkhead.\n\n85\n00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:54.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n86\n00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.070\n&gt;&gt; And laughs the whole time.\n\n87\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he would definitely\nget a kick out of that time.\n\n88\n00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.680\nBut yeah, so maybe I don't want\nto have Tim as a stinkhead to be\n\n89\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.121\nshown when I print out the document for\nhim to sign.\n\n90\n00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:08.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So how do I hide the text?\n\n91\n00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.070\nYou select it, so\nalways select the effect,\n\n92\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.000\nI'm just selecting\na random amount of text.\n\n93\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.250\nYou wanna go in to the Fonts dialog box.\n\n94\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.410\nIt's not on the button, so\nyou need to go into the More button and\n\n95\n00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.440\ngo to this dialog box.\n\n96\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.590\nYou can also right click on that text and\ngo to Font dot dot dot and\n\n97\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.350\nit brings you to this dialog box and\nit's right here, hidden.\n\n98\n00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.230\nCheck the box off, click OK.\n\n99\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.010\nWell that didn't hide,\ncuz on the show I hide the characters.\n\n100\n00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.790\nWell, let's go ahead and\ntry that again and well, okay,\n\n101\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.813\nwell it doesn't want to do that either.\n\n102\n00:04:41.813 --> 00:04:43.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Why did you not hide?\n\n103\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.680\nLet's try this again and\nthis is another one of those\n\n104\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.690\nI think it's at a different\nlevel of why this isn't working.\n\n105\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.350\nSo let's go through the whole stuff again.\n\n106\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.070\nWe'll do the fonts and we'll turn on the\nhidden and we know it's not gonna work.\n\n107\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.130\nBecause we show and then we hide and\nit’s still showing and\n\n108\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.020\nI’ve had this happen to\nme a couple of times.\n\n109\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.720\nTo where it’s supposed to be\ndoing what it’s supposed to do,\n\n110\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.130\nwow I just did a little circle yeah, I bet\nyou it’s something in the options okay.\n\n111\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.658\nAnd I don’t know how I turned\nthis feature on or off and\n\n112\n00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:18.118\nthen I bet you it's in display,\nyep, there it is, all right.\n\n113\n00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:20.972\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hidden text isn't really hidden.\n\n114\n00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:21.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n115\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.710\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's what it says,\n\n116\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.820\nalways shows these formatting\nmarks on the screen.\n\n117\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.090\nThis happen to me in my Mac at one point,\n\n118\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.340\nmy work from Mac of where I couldn't turn,\nI couldn't hide the characters.\n\n119\n00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.350\nI couldn't do the show hide.\n\n120\n00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.460\nI'm clicking the button and I'm like it\nwon't stop showing the paragraph parts.\n\n121\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.880\n&gt;&gt; Interesting option that they would say\nthey're going to give you the ability to\n\n122\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.610\nhide the text, but it's not actually hide.\n\n123\n00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You can not\n\n124\n00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.772\nnot hide your-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n125\n00:05:47.772 --> 00:05:49.730\n&gt;&gt; It's a little convoluted.\n\n126\n00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I've done this before and\nthere was one,\n\n127\n00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.390\nI don't know the specifics but it was\nsomewhere deep down in the Advanced.\n\n128\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.800\nAnd I had to find something where\nit was like showing all fields.\n\n129\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.440\nI just remember it was\nsomething about fields.\n\n130\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.460\nAnd as soon as I turned that off,\nit's like, my gosh,\n\n131\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.830\neverything is just, it's fixed.\n\n132\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.640\nSo I can't tell you how this\nis gotten into the option\n\n133\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.410\nof always showing hidden text but that's-\n&gt;&gt; I can't\n\n134\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.683\nwait till we're like Star Trek and I just\nsay computer turn off this hidden thing.\n\n135\n00:06:19.683 --> 00:06:21.031\n[LAUGH] I wanna hide this text.\n\n136\n00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:21.691\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n137\n00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:24.763\ncan you turn all the options back to the\nway I had it before I did something that\n\n138\n00:06:24.763 --> 00:06:25.971\nI didn't realize that I did?\n\n139\n00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:26.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n140\n00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.900\n&gt;&gt; That'll be nice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.418\n&gt;&gt; Alright\n\n142\n00:06:28.418 --> 00:06:28.974\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\n\n143\n00:06:28.974 --> 00:06:29.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.860\n&gt;&gt; Let's turn that off and we click OK and\n\n145\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.490\nwe will hide, there we go.\n\n146\n00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.560\nThat's what I was trying to show you.\n\n147\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.250\nIs that when you select any amount\nof text that you want to hide,\n\n148\n00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.630\nyou just select it,\nyou go into the font, make it hidden.\n\n149\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.980\nTurn off the hidden characters,\nand now you have hidden text.\n\n150\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.570\nPerfect but again like I said,\n\n151\n00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.540\nthis isn't that, if somebody knows\nabout the hidden characters,\n\n152\n00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.010\nthen turn this on and then it's right\nthere, it's the not, not [LAUGH].\n\n153\n00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the not, not.\n\n154\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.940\n&gt;&gt; It's hidden but kind of not.\n\n155\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.720\nPerfect but anyways letting you know\nthat hidden texts does exist and\n\n156\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.871\nwe've tried to figure out reasons\nof why [INAUDIBLE [LAUGH].\n\n157\n00:07:09.871 --> 00:07:10.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n158\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.020\nthe next one I want to show\nyou is restrict editing.\n\n159\n00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.180\nNow this one I would\nimplement in my regular\n\n160\n00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.090\nlife in a sense that if I am collaborating\nwith somebody and I have a reviewer.\n\n161\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.930\nI don't want them to change\nthe color of the text or\n\n162\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.690\nmaybe create their own style or\nmodify my existing styles.\n\n163\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.360\nOr maybe I have a set protocol what all\ndocuments are supposed to look like.\n\n164\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.430\nThat only uses heading 1s,\nheading 2s, and the normal text.\n\n165\n00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.770\nYou can't do anything\nelse in the document.\n\n166\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.830\nYou can't use heading 3s,\nyou can't use the emphasis.\n\n167\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.873\nThis is what I want you to do.\n\n168\n00:07:46.873 --> 00:07:50.308\nSo that's where you can\nrestrict the editing and\n\n169\n00:07:50.308 --> 00:07:55.264\nmore than just editing, the styles\nthat are allowed in the document.\n\n170\n00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:59.739\nNow, where you get to this is three\ndifferent places you can go to go to where\n\n171\n00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:00.675\nyou need to be.\n\n172\n00:08:00.675 --> 00:08:02.249\nYou can go to the developer tab,\n\n173\n00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:06.274\nnow you might not even see the developer\nif you haven't been working with macros or\n\n174\n00:08:06.274 --> 00:08:10.020\nwe have another episode that we're\ngoing to talk about, creating forms.\n\n175\n00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.470\nSo this is a tab that does not\nshow up automatically in Word.\n\n176\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:21.410\nYou would have to go into your Backstage\nView, go into your Options, go into your\n\n177\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:27.010\nCustomize Ribbon, and turn the checkbox on\nfor this particular developer tab, okay.\n\n178\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.740\nBut that's not the only way you can go.\n\n179\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.040\nYou can go to the Review tab.\n\n180\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.360\nWhat are you looking for?\n\n181\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.035\nSorry, you're looking for\nRestrict Editing.\n\n182\n00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you come over here to Review,\n\n183\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.860\nand there's Restrict Editing as well.\n\n184\n00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.610\nYou can also go to the file, or\nBackstage view, go to Protect Document.\n\n185\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.120\nAnd these are all the different things\nthat we're gonna be talking about in\n\n186\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.920\nthis episode.\n\n187\n00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.810\nAnd there is Restrict Editing.\n\n188\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.100\nAnd it brings up the Task pane\nover here on the right hand side.\n\n189\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.960\nAnd there's a couple options you have.\n\n190\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.470\nOne is formatting restrictions,\nlimit formatting to a selection of styles,\n\n191\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.350\nand that's the one we're\ngoing to explore first.\n\n192\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.800\nI'm gonna turn this check\nbox off cuz I don't wanna\n\n193\n00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.970\ngo over that particular\nrestrictions just yet.\n\n194\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.540\nSo we're going to click on the Settings,\nand these are all the different styles\n\n195\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.980\nthat are available or\ncould be used within a document.\n\n196\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.270\nAnd if I'm checking on the Limit\nformatting to a selection of styles,\n\n197\n00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:27.540\nI then need to select the styles that\nI want or not want somebody to use.\n\n198\n00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.070\nI think it's on all by\ndefault when you start this.\n\n199\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.250\nI've been working with this document and\nkinda playing around this.\n\n200\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.680\nSo you may have everything\nchecked on to begin with.\n\n201\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.970\nIf you click on none, that's none, and\nsometimes user just like turn everything\n\n202\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:48.300\noff and then systematically go\ndown through all of the different\n\n203\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.200\nstyles that you would want, like for\nexample we will go with headings.\n\n204\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:59.350\nWe'll do heading one and two, and\nwe will also say that you can use normal,\n\n205\n00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.410\nwhich is gonna be down in the ends.\n\n206\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.229\nSo let's scroll on down.\n\n207\n00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:03.810\nOops.\n\n208\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.550\nDid I go to, oop, normal, there we go.\n\n209\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.080\nNormal and it's a web version and\nthat's the recommended.\n\n210\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.040\nBut notice there's a lot of the other ones\nthat are also included in the recommended.\n\n211\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.530\nAnd they're like, why are there so many?\n\n212\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.850\nI'll demonstrate why in just a second.\n\n213\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.020\nBut down here there's\na couple more options where,\n\n214\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.870\ndo you want to block theme or\nscheme switching?\n\n215\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.430\nThat would be a big one.\n\n216\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.280\nBecause hey, I have everything in\nthe heading ones and everything.\n\n217\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.500\nBut we've talked about doing\na style switch to where\n\n218\n00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.510\neverything changes in the document\nby just one click of a button.\n\n219\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.230\nI don't want people to do that.\n\n220\n00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.280\nDon't change the theme on me.\n\n221\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.540\nAnd then blocking quick set\nstyle switching, that's\n\n222\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.040\npretty much the same thing as well where\nit's like everything is gonna be changing.\n\n223\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.080\nSo you might wanna go ahead and change or\n\n224\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.110\ncheck those on to block that\nparticular type of formatting.\n\n225\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:59.470\nAnd if I click OK, it says this document\nmay contain styles that aren't allowed\n\n226\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.270\nbecause I have a title in here.\n\n227\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.810\nSo if I click Yes, notice how anything\nthat I said is not allowed in the document\n\n228\n00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:11.860\nis going to be reduced down to whatever\nstyle I'm allowing which is normal.\n\n229\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.960\nSo you do have to be a little\nbit careful about this.\n\n230\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.190\nBecause if you get too limited,\nwell then you're gonna be too limited.\n\n231\n00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.547\nAnd you're going to be missing\nout on a lot of things.\n\n232\n00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:27.100\nNow I'm gonna start the enforcement\nto demonstrate this to you.\n\n233\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.100\nThe password I always use\nin all this is apple.\n\n234\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.030\nSo if you ever get a document from me as\nan exercise file that has a password,\n\n235\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.530\nits apple.\n\n236\n00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:41.300\nSo lowercase, I click OK and now it\nsays your document has been protected.\n\n237\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.440\nSo I start coming into here and\nmaybe I need to add some text like text,\n\n238\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.760\ntext cuz I type so well.\n\n239\n00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.640\nWe selected it because I\nneed to make this a list.\n\n240\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.520\nWell, this isn't even an option\nbecause a list is actually a style or\n\n241\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.510\nit's part of a style, and in that list of\nstyles you can see things like indents or\n\n242\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.000\nlists or numbers.\n\n243\n00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.730\nSo be careful about going too much\nwith this cuz things that you would\n\n244\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:15.330\nthink that aren't a style, like\ncreating a bulleted list, it really is.\n\n245\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.610\nSo that's why I'm gonna stop the\nprotection, put in that password again.\n\n246\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.400\n&gt;&gt; Now will that stop you from\ncreating like a note like we saw in\n\n247\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.310\nthe previous episode?\n\n248\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.650\nCould that create a note and say, hey,\n\n249\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.520\nbulleted list with this\ninformation might be good here.\n\n250\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.103\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like a markup?\n\n251\n00:12:29.103 --> 00:12:35.390\nYou can add a comment because I didn't\nrestrict that part of the document.\n\n252\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:41.130\nI'm just saying the stylistic\nparts of it are locked down.\n\n253\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.390\nSo back in here in the settings,\n\n254\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.070\nIf I didn't want them to go too crazy\nchoosing that recommended minimum.\n\n255\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.963\nAnd it's like see bibliography,\nblock text, body text, the balloon text.\n\n256\n00:12:52.963 --> 00:12:57.159\nThose would be for some other things like\nthe markup that we're talking about.\n\n257\n00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:59.278\nSo maybe I'll actually\nwould take out the comment.\n\n258\n00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:02.301\nNow that I said that,\nI feel like I wanna try it now.\n\n259\n00:13:02.301 --> 00:13:03.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n260\n00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:08.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So All of these different\nthings that you might want to keep on for\n\n261\n00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:13.800\nthe minimum and\nthen everything else can be locked out.\n\n262\n00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.690\nIt's up to you.\n\n263\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.120\nIt really depends on how\nyour workflow works.\n\n264\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.570\nAnd at least you know where it's at and\nyou can limit your choices.\n\n265\n00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.650\nOkay, thank you.\n\n266\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.290\nAnd I'm going to uncheck that box cuz\nI don't want to limit the formatting.\n\n267\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:35.317\nAnd let's just undo a couple of times,\nwell, come on let's try that again.\n\n268\n00:13:35.317 --> 00:13:38.730\nLet's delete that and\nput this back to a title just for fun.\n\n269\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.330\nSo now we're basically\nback where we started.\n\n270\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.770\nSome other things I wanna go through\nin this document security episode.\n\n271\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.190\nThe mark as final.\n\n272\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.310\nThis is the warning system\nthat you can do for people.\n\n273\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.448\nTo say, hey this done, don't touch it, but\n\n274\n00:13:55.448 --> 00:13:59.339\nif they really wanted to they\ncould go ahead and edit it.\n\n275\n00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:03.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's really just a system to say,\n\n276\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.149\nlet them know that it's read-only\n&gt;&gt; It's not true [CROSSTALK]\n\n277\n00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:09.650\n&gt;&gt; It's like a really passive guard.\n\n278\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.780\n[LAUGH] He's like,\nyou can't go pass, I'll go ahead.\n\n279\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.650\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n280\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.228\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you asked nicely, so.\n\n281\n00:14:15.228 --> 00:14:16.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly,\n\n282\n00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.154\nthat's a perfect example.\n\n283\n00:14:18.154 --> 00:14:21.510\n[LAUGH] Cuz I have\nprotected this as final.\n\n284\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.730\nI'm gonna close this and\n\n285\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:29.500\njust to show you that when I open this\nback up which is over here and I open it.\n\n286\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:36.840\nIt gives me a nice warning, this has been\nmarked as final to discourage editing.\n\n287\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.420\nDo you want edit anyways?\n\n288\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.888\nYes, I do.\nAnd then you can change it all day long.\n\n289\n00:14:40.888 --> 00:14:41.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n290\n00:14:41.868 --> 00:14:46.500\nthat's the only the thing\nthat the mark as final does.\n\n291\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.820\nIt's a gentle warning.\n\n292\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.030\nBut if I want people to like,\n\n293\n00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.700\nhey you can't open this,\nunless I give you the password.\n\n294\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.080\nNow that's where you're really\nlocking it down, all right.\n\n295\n00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:03.846\nSo we can password protect a document to\nwhere we can encrypt with the password.\n\n296\n00:15:03.846 --> 00:15:04.808\nYey!\n\n297\n00:15:04.808 --> 00:15:09.240\nNow if you lose or forget this\npassword it cannot be recovered.\n\n298\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.420\nWell I'm sure talking to you or Mike or\n\n299\n00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.435\nsomebody else here at ITProTV they're\nlike, I'm sure I could crack that thing.\n\n300\n00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:15.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n301\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.535\nwe probably have a tool or\ntwo up our sleeves.\n\n302\n00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:20.487\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure you do so and that's where I'm\n\n303\n00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:25.815\nnot sure if it's really worth you\ncracking my restricted styles document.\n\n304\n00:15:25.815 --> 00:15:28.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But hey, I mean you put stuff\nin Word documents that could be very\n\n305\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:35.082\nsensitive information so Yes, this is a,\nfor the normal people I would say.\n\n306\n00:15:35.082 --> 00:15:35.654\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n307\n00:15:35.654 --> 00:15:40.135\npeople not like you that are all\nin this crazy hashy thingies, and.\n\n308\n00:15:40.135 --> 00:15:41.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're always talking\n\n309\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.110\nabout hash values, and you and\nMike are talking about keys and stuff.\n\n310\n00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.110\nI'm like, hm.\n\n311\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.490\nOkay, so we're going to type in apple.\n\n312\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.430\n&gt;&gt; You're very fun Von.\n\n313\n00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.457\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know you guys geek out like crazy.\n\n314\n00:15:51.457 --> 00:15:52.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do.\n\n315\n00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.222\n&gt;&gt; It's quite a sight.\n\n316\n00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:57.528\nWe click okay and\nI am going to reenter this password,\n\n317\n00:15:57.528 --> 00:16:00.403\nI have now password\nprotected this document.\n\n318\n00:16:00.403 --> 00:16:01.562\nSo you can see that.\n\n319\n00:16:01.562 --> 00:16:02.448\nDo I want to save my changes?\n\n320\n00:16:02.448 --> 00:16:03.126\nYes.\n\n321\n00:16:03.126 --> 00:16:07.335\nThat if somebody came along and opened\nup this document, it's going to say,\n\n322\n00:16:07.335 --> 00:16:10.340\nyou can't get past this unless\nyou give me a password.\n\n323\n00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.950\nThat would be a little stronger\n\n324\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.260\nof a security measure than\njust marking this final.\n\n325\n00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.570\nThat's right and\ndepending on the password that you use,\n\n326\n00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.330\nit could actually be a very\neffective means of protection.\n\n327\n00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike and I did an episode\nabout the strength of your password and\n\n328\n00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.100\nhow long it would take them to crack it.\n\n329\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.220\nAnd you could see, by just changing\na couple characters here and there,\n\n330\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.130\nit went from three days to three months\nto three thousand years or something.\n\n331\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.628\n&gt;&gt; That's a short time.\n\n332\n00:16:41.628 --> 00:16:42.133\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n333\n00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:44.478\nTo where like all of the different tools\n\n334\n00:16:44.478 --> 00:16:48.970\nor whatever of mixing certain amounts of\ncharacters, it would take a computer or\n\n335\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.050\nwhatever that long to\nfind that combination.\n\n336\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.780\n&gt;&gt; I think that, by the time certain\npasswords actually could be cracked,\n\n337\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.211\nthe relevancy of the information\nwould be long since dead.\n\n338\n00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:00.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good point.\n\n339\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n340\n00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Totally, so there you go.\n\n341\n00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.970\nNow you know all about that\nyou can crack a password.\n\n342\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:07.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n343\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.230\n&gt;&gt; It's just so, keep those strong\npasswords really, really good.\n\n344\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.265\nDon't use Apple.\n\n345\n00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:12.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah don't use Apple.\n\n346\n00:17:12.235 --> 00:17:13.660\n&gt;&gt; That's not a good example at all.\n\n347\n00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.305\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think,\n\n348\n00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:16.240\nyou need a password program for that.\n\n349\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.560\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna try Apple on this.\n\n350\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.995\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Password is password right?\n\n351\n00:17:19.995 --> 00:17:22.260\nThat's another one that's not very good.\n\n352\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.405\n[LAUGH] All right so,\n\n353\n00:17:23.405 --> 00:17:28.630\nback to those restricting of\nthe editing of your documents.\n\n354\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.910\nLet's go to that second option\nthat I wanted to show you.\n\n355\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.680\nAnd, this does say that\nI have a password and,\n\n356\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.550\nsince I used the password to open it,\nto take it off.\n\n357\n00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.070\nSorry, before I move on to the next\nsubject I should complete this thought.\n\n358\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.890\nTo remove the password, I just come\ninto here and just hit the delete key.\n\n359\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.380\nI just delete out the password because\nI already got into the document.\n\n360\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.560\nSo now, I have the ability,\nI have the right to be here and\n\n361\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.840\nI also have the right to\ntake off the password here.\n\n362\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.520\n&gt;&gt; So, to remove the password, it's not\nlike you're unchecking a feature and\n\n363\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.790\nsaying, I don't even want.\n\n364\n00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.730\nYou just have to delete out your password\nand then, it won't even prompt you for\n\n365\n00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.150\na password when you re-open the document?\n\n366\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.690\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n367\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.470\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, you just delete it all out and\n\n368\n00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.190\nthen it's gone.\n\n369\n00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.890\nAnd now you can.\n\n370\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.593\n&gt;&gt; That is different than\nanything I have ever heard of.\n\n371\n00:18:12.593 --> 00:18:13.318\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's funny\n\n372\n00:18:13.318 --> 00:18:14.200\nabout what you said, like.\n\n373\n00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.130\nIt probably would be easier if\nthey just put a check box on it.\n\n374\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.410\n&gt;&gt; Instead of a checkmark?\n\n375\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.970\nYeah.\nDo you want passwords yes or no?\n\n376\n00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.480\nCheck. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; No,\nyou just again, delete the field.\n\n377\n00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n378\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.430\nSo now that we have removed the password,\nlet's go to restrict editing.\n\n379\n00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.650\nAnd this is the one where, when you\nsaid something about like the comments\n\n380\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.650\nthat kind of prompted me here too.\n\n381\n00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.670\nWith the editing restrictions, allow only\nthis type of editing in the document.\n\n382\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:43.470\nWhen I check this box on,\nthe options I get are going to be\n\n383\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.150\ntrack changes that we were talking about,\ncomments.\n\n384\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:52.460\nSo, I will allow you to put in comments,\nbut that's it.\n\n385\n00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.000\nYou can't do anything else.\n\n386\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.130\nSo, this might be good for\n\n387\n00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.080\nif you are in a collaboration to where\nyou're having somebody edit the document.\n\n388\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.920\nBut, the only thing they can do is put\nlittle sticky notes on the document then,\n\n389\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.670\nthat's where you would say, just doing\nthe comments or filling in the forms.\n\n390\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.740\nWe have an episode on forms\nin the additional topics.\n\n391\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.370\nTo where, hey, I've made this.\n\n392\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.460\nI don't want you to be\nable to change the form.\n\n393\n00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.320\nSo I'm going to limit it to,\nyou can only fill it in.\n\n394\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.390\nThat's it.\n\n395\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.370\nAnd then, if you really want\nlike a true read-only file.\n\n396\n00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.380\nLike, you can open it, but\n\n397\n00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:29.270\nyou can't make any changes at all then,\nthis is where you would do it.\n\n398\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:35.560\nThe no changes read only and then,\nyou can put that password protection on.\n\n399\n00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.890\nLet me clarify, password for\nthe enforcement of this protection.\n\n400\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.550\nNot password to open the document.\n\n401\n00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.240\nSo a couple of different places,\nbut you do have these exceptions.\n\n402\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.060\nSo say like, nobody can make any changes,\nbut maybe I gave you an exception.\n\n403\n00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.595\n&gt;&gt; So kind of like a white list?\n\n404\n00:19:51.595 --> 00:19:52.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I've accepted people that\n\n405\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.902\ncan make these changes.\n\n406\n00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:58.037\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nyou're not in the junk mail [LAUGH].\n\n407\n00:19:58.037 --> 00:20:00.054\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can give exceptions to people that\n\n408\n00:20:00.054 --> 00:20:02.571\nare going to be, of course,\non your network.\n\n409\n00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:05.773\nBecause there's this option where it says,\nmore users and then,\n\n410\n00:20:05.773 --> 00:20:08.354\nthere's a little bit behind my head so\nyou can see it.\n\n411\n00:20:08.354 --> 00:20:11.642\nThat if you have a network environment,\nI can just come into here and then,\n\n412\n00:20:11.642 --> 00:20:13.350\njust tell the people's name.\n\n413\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.440\nOr whatever the user name or\ntheir email that we're all on together.\n\n414\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.580\nBut, if you're like on\na standalone company or\n\n415\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.600\nyou're like a self business,\nthis probably wouldn't\n\n416\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.410\nnecessarily be something you would\nwant to do an exception for.\n\n417\n00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:32.670\nIn that sense, just give them the password\n[LAUGH] and password protected document.\n\n418\n00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.800\nAnd then, we have the yes, start\nenforcing, the button down at the bottom,\n\n419\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.990\nwhere it's the same idea.\n\n420\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.800\nSo, you could limit the styles and\nyou could do the editing restrictions,\n\n421\n00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.330\nthey're not mutually exclusive.\n\n422\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.260\nYou can have one or the other, or both.\n\n423\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:53.560\nIt's whatever combinations of\nthe restrictions that you want to put on.\n\n424\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.990\nAnd you would go ahead and\nput the password on it and\n\n425\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.290\nthen, it would be\na complete read-only file.\n\n426\n00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.990\nI’m going to cancel this for\nright now and turn these\n\n427\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:06.200\nbuttons off because I’m not going to\ndo any of the restrictions right now.\n\n428\n00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.180\nBecause you know where to find them.\n\n429\n00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.390\nThe other place where you can\nput on some password protection.\n\n430\n00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.920\nIt's in the Save As dialogue box, and\n\n431\n00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.900\nthis is where it always was before\nyou had this whole backstage view.\n\n432\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.380\nWhen we go to the File tab,\nit is this whole area,\n\n433\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.640\nand we went into the, hey,\ngo ahead and put a password on here.\n\n434\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.330\nYou never had this so,\n\n435\n00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:37.620\nwhere would I do a password to open and,\nor a password to modify.\n\n436\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.780\nThis is like old school, but yet\nit's still applicable because it's\n\n437\n00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.220\nthe same type of, you can open it,\nbut you can't change it.\n\n438\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.300\nOr you can't open it and you can't\nchange it, you can put it on both.\n\n439\n00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.699\nWe go to File &gt; Save As.\n\n440\n00:21:51.699 --> 00:21:56.181\nYou do need to go into the Browse from\nhere cuz you wanna get into the dialog box\n\n441\n00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:57.595\nwhere it gives you the.\n\n442\n00:21:57.595 --> 00:22:00.279\nWhere do you want to put it and\nwhat type of file?\n\n443\n00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:03.450\nThe old school box, as I like to call it.\n\n444\n00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.550\nAnd down here next to the Save button,\nthere's Tools.\n\n445\n00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.785\nAnd in the Tools, it goes into Generals.\n\n446\n00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:12.160\nIt's not Save Options cuz that's what\nyou would think it cuz you wanna save it\n\n447\n00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.780\nwith a password.\n\n448\n00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.018\nIt's not that.\n\n449\n00:22:14.018 --> 00:22:15.810\nYou go to General Options and\n\n450\n00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:21.700\nhere is the password to open and\nthen, the password to modify.\n\n451\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.280\nSo, I could give you a password\njust to open the document, but\n\n452\n00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:31.780\nI would give a second or separate\npassword for you to be able to change it.\n\n453\n00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.760\nThis is another part where it gets\ninto that read only, you can open and\n\n454\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.770\nnot change, or\nyou can change and not open.\n\n455\n00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.331\nThat doesn't really make any sense,\ndoes it?\n\n456\n00:22:40.331 --> 00:22:42.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But these are the levels that\n\n457\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.180\nyou can put that password protection on.\n\n458\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.120\nAnd then you would go ahead and\nenforce it.\n\n459\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.810\nYou retype it, you save it, and\nthen, the next time you open it,\n\n460\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.063\nyou get those prompts that I had\nshown you in the other examples.\n\n461\n00:22:55.063 --> 00:22:59.225\nSo, all of the different ways that we\ncan start restricting this access,\n\n462\n00:22:59.225 --> 00:23:00.740\nget into our document security.\n\n463\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.090\nThere are two other options that we want,\nthat I would like to cover,\n\n464\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.270\nbut you're kinda giving me\nthat little signal over there.\n\n465\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.210\nLike, I think we're getting close\nto the end of this episode, so.\n\n466\n00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might be beyond the scope of\nour allotted time for this episode, Vonne.\n\n467\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.150\nSo, let's do this,\nlet's break this into a part two.\n\n468\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.410\nAnd, we'll come back and we'll finish out\nthis topic of security for your documents.\n\n469\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.350\nWe do thank you good folks for joining us.\n\n470\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.142\nDefinitely come back for that part two.\n\n471\n00:23:28.142 --> 00:23:30.260\nIt would be kind of silly not to.\n\n472\n00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.200\nBut, that being said,\nwe're signing off for Office Pro TV.\n\n473\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.660\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n474\n00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n475\n00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.782\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n476\n00:23:37.782 --> 00:23:42.429\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Yes exactly.\n\n25\n00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.890\nSo the last two parts of\nthis particular episode,\n\n26\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.790\nthe topics were the information rights\nmanagement and digital signatures.\n\n27\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.670\nAnd since there are a little I wouldn't\ncall them heady, but they do get into\n\n28\n00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.708\na different level besides just like, let's\njust throw a password in, encrypt it.\n\n29\n00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:30.640\nNot encrypt it,\nput a password on it to go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.780\nrestrict access unless you actually have\nthe password and those types of things.\n\n31\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.470\nSo this does get into a different place.\n\n32\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.390\nSo let's jump into it.\n\n33\n00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.460\nAnd what are we talking about is\nrestricting access at a different level\n\n34\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.080\nthan where we had done in the part one\nwhere we went over into the review and\n\n35\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.510\nwent into the restrict editing.\n\n36\n00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.470\nI think we have actually been going\nmostly from the backstage view where\n\n37\n00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.940\nwe were saying, okay,\nlimiting the formatting and\n\n38\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.700\nlimiting the type of editing\nthat you can do in that.\n\n39\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.980\nAnd we did have the exceptions\nwhen we turn this check box on if\n\n40\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.890\nwho can do what, when.\n\n41\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.660\nSo the next part or\nthe other way I'm gonna show you,\n\n42\n00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.440\nit just takes this whole\nidea to a different level.\n\n43\n00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.970\nAnd it does involve you being on like\n\n44\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.710\na network to environment where\nyou have like a domain and users.\n\n45\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.820\nAnd that could be right\nhere in Office 365.\n\n46\n00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.537\nWhere your organization's set up that way\nor it can go into another level where\n\n47\n00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:31.553\nmaybe you're not on Office 365\nfrom an administrative point.\n\n48\n00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:36.257\nYou're on the whatever,\nit's not [LAUGH] management and\n\n49\n00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:40.182\nactive directories and\nall that kind of thing.\n\n50\n00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:41.447\n&gt;&gt; When you said administrative things,\n\n51\n00:02:41.447 --> 00:02:43.250\nthis will be like your\nsystems administrator.\n\n52\n00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.630\nWhen you have a problem and you call\na number and you get someone that's\n\n53\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.590\nhigher level that the immediate help desk,\nthat's what she's talking about.\n\n54\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.140\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and for on office end issue\nlike I don't know what's happened-\n\n55\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:56.578\n&gt;&gt; Come on, just turn the computer on and\n\n57\n00:02:56.578 --> 00:02:59.197\nsomebody tell me what to do,\nthat's totally fine.\n\n58\n00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:03.658\nSo, you don't need to even know past that\nlevel it's just that if you are in a large\n\n59\n00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:06.580\norganization, you're set\nup somehow normally.\n\n60\n00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That you're all talking to each other\n\n61\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.220\nin some way.\n\n62\n00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.680\nSo that's why we're talking about\nlike networked environments.\n\n63\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.790\nSo let's go over to file and we're going\nto go to our protect document drop down,\n\n64\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.660\nand these are the last two things that\nwe haven't covered within this area.\n\n65\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.820\nAnd this is the restrict access.\n\n66\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.220\nNow this is an unrestricted access right\nnow, but if I come into the restricted\n\n67\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.800\naccess, the dialog box is\ngoing to give me some options.\n\n68\n00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.230\nBut notice right even here,\nit says OfficeProDemoCo.\n\n69\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.484\nSo that right there is an indication\ninto that network environment.\n\n70\n00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:47.147\nJustin and Lance and Joey, they're all\nusers in the OfficeProDemoCo Group and\n\n71\n00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:53.929\nthat Ronnie, he did a whole series on\nthe administrative part of Office 365.\n\n72\n00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:58.152\nSo that's why both Ronnie and\nI kinda use these accounts to be able to\n\n73\n00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:01.882\ndemonstrate these different\nareas that we are experts on.\n\n74\n00:04:01.882 --> 00:04:03.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n75\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.319\nI'm gonna go into the restricted access.\n\n76\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.880\nAnd so you can see I can turn this on.\n\n77\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.780\nRestrict permission to this document.\n\n78\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.870\nAnd it says enter the email address\nof the users in the read and\n\n79\n00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.280\nchange example, someone@ [INAUDIBLE].\n\n80\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.415\nSo that would be that whole\n\n81\n00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:25.280\njoey@officeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com cuz\nhe's part of my network.\n\n82\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.450\nAnd I have the buttons over here for\nthe different check names and\n\n83\n00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.430\nthen the different people I want\nto find and checking to make sure\n\n84\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.276\nthat they are indeed on my network,\nand hey, guess what?\n\n85\n00:04:40.276 --> 00:04:44.470\n[LAUGH] I guess I have Outlook open\nbecause it's talking about my different\n\n86\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.640\nreminders that I did on my Outlook show.\n\n87\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.820\n&gt;&gt; That's funny, they're making\na re-comeback here on our show.\n\n88\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.720\n&gt;&gt; Well I obviously have\nto chat about the tour.\n\n89\n00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.438\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I mean it's our reunion tour.\n\n90\n00:04:55.438 --> 00:04:55.948\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:04:55.948 --> 00:04:56.778\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n92\n00:04:56.778 --> 00:04:58.490\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n93\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.930\nSo I'll go ahead and dismiss that, that is\nnot part of what happens when you're here.\n\n94\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was just funny\nhappenstance right there.\n\n95\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Well actually,\nwhen I did the check names,\n\n96\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.350\nI bet you that's what probably-\n&gt;&gt; It triggered it?\n\n97\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it probably triggered on Outlook.\n\n98\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.160\nMaybe cuz I'm like,\nI don't think I had that open.\n\n99\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.530\nYeah, Outlook isn't even open.\n\n100\n00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.190\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna blame it on the check names.\n\n101\n00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Learn something new every day, right?\n\n102\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.500\n&gt;&gt; It might be, who knows.\n\n103\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.440\nIt might be gremlins too, so.\n\n104\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.356\n[LAUGH] Those hamster wheels\nare chewing on the wires back there.\n\n105\n00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:25.175\n&gt;&gt; Settle suckers.\n[LAUGH]\n\n106\n00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:25.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n107\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.140\nI can put in who gets to read\nthese in the permissions.\n\n108\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.110\nAnd I can go ahead and do the change.\n\n109\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.440\nAlso I can get into the more options\nof where you can specialize for\n\n110\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.000\na specific people here.\n\n111\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.110\nThis is like talking about Outlook.\n\n112\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.020\nWe talked about sharing mailboxes and\nsharing different calendars and\n\n113\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.590\nwho has what permissions.\n\n114\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.300\nSo this kind of reminds me of that.\n\n115\n00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.900\nIf you're familiar with that area of\nOutlook, you're like, yeah, okay.\n\n116\n00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.140\nSo you can see,\ndo I want people to be able to print and\n\n117\n00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.560\nbe able to allow users read\naccess to copy content.\n\n118\n00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.600\nThat's the whole thing, if you can read it\nyou can copy but think you can copy and\n\n119\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.640\npaste the whole document and then they\nhave like a completely ready to go file or\n\n120\n00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.630\ncopy of your documents,\nI don't know if I want that.\n\n121\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.780\nAnd you can have it where the document\nexpires, so any of these permissions,\n\n122\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.720\nyou have a specific amount of time that\nyou have these rights to the document and\n\n123\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.980\nthese access level for\nthese different people.\n\n124\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.540\nSo you can get some different\noptions within this dialogue box for\n\n125\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.630\ndoing the types of access\nthat you want people to have.\n\n126\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.710\nBut gotta be on that\nnetworked environment, so\n\n127\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.930\nthis is where it's Does get into a\nseparate level, I’m going to cancel this.\n\n128\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.511\nI also have in the show notes there\nare some links to you document\n\n129\n00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:51.153\nprotection that’s in\nthe Microsoft help files.\n\n130\n00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:54.381\nSo it is talking about how you add\nprotection to a word document and\n\n131\n00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.152\nthis is all things that we've\nreally gone over as well.\n\n132\n00:06:57.152 --> 00:07:02.226\nSo there is that drop down and\nit does talk about in here, right there,\n\n133\n00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:06.784\nrestrict permission by people,\nnot what I was just talking and\n\n134\n00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:11.170\nit goes into information rights\nmanagement within office.\n\n135\n00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.390\nThis is more like of a home\nnetwork information.\n\n136\n00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.380\nNow, it says rights\nmanagement in Office 2010 I\n\n137\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.720\nthought we were in 2017 and\nthis is Office 2016.\n\n138\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.240\nBut the same idea applies about\n\n139\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.550\nwho can have what permission\nin certain places.\n\n140\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.630\nSo you might not be set\nup with the IRM and\n\n141\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.400\nit does tell you about like what it\ncan help do and what it can't do.\n\n142\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.479\nSo definitely check out this document,\nor this link within the show notes so\n\n143\n00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:45.490\nif you wanted a little bit\nmore information about that.\n\n144\n00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.629\nAnd really this is where you do need to\ntalk to your systems administrator if\n\n145\n00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:55.770\nyou are wanting to instill some of these\npractices within your documents or\n\n146\n00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.252\nwithin your office.\n\n147\n00:07:57.252 --> 00:07:58.382\nSo, talk to them and\n\n148\n00:07:58.382 --> 00:08:02.310\nsee what is and what is not possible\nthis might be completely blocked.\n\n149\n00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.650\nThey're like nope,\nwe won't let you do this.\n\n150\n00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.825\nAnd every system has its limits.\n\n151\n00:08:07.825 --> 00:08:10.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And operators that won't either\n\n152\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.172\ntell you yes or tell you no.\n\n153\n00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:13.241\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n154\n00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:14.595\n&gt;&gt; You know that one, right?\n\n155\n00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:15.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n156\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.770\nwhat if somebody using on the help desk of\n&gt;&gt; Yes yes.\n\n157\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.850\n&gt;&gt; People will call you and\nsay I wanna do this and you're like no.\n\n158\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.780\nThey're like why not, it's nope.\n\n159\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.835\n&gt;&gt; Because no that's why.\n\n160\n00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:28.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and it's also,\n\n161\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.260\nlike you didn't set up\nthe system it's like this is\n\n162\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.450\njust what maybe somebody above me has said\nwe're not allowing people to do this.\n\n163\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.520\n&gt;&gt; It becomes a policy is\nbasically what it comes down to.\n\n164\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.790\nThe higher up the powers that be, the\npeople above my and your pay grade have\n\n165\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:47.174\nsaid, you will go this far and no farther,\nand I'm just enforcing said policy.\n\n166\n00:08:47.174 --> 00:08:48.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am the enforcer.\n\n167\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.365\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n168\n00:08:49.365 --> 00:08:50.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n169\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.590\nkind of along those same lines,\ndigital signatures.\n\n170\n00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.530\nNow, this is the area where-\n&gt;&gt; Look how Vonne smiles like\n\n171\n00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.692\na Cheshire cat when she says that.\n\n172\n00:08:58.692 --> 00:09:00.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know right?\n\n173\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.320\nYes.\nThis fun area because It's quite cool.\n\n174\n00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.470\nI love the whole idea of it, but this gets\ninto another do you use signatures or not?\n\n175\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:17.830\nAnd does your company have a policy that\nyou have to have this digitally signed?\n\n176\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:23.020\nAnd we have to have a certificate\nserver and we have everything set\n\n177\n00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:28.210\nup to allow this type of Workflow really,\nto happen, so\n\n178\n00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.247\nit's one of these things you don't just\nkinda [INAUDIBLE] throw it on there.\n\n179\n00:09:32.247 --> 00:09:36.870\nIt has to be part of your everyday\nactivity, if you wanna say, and\n\n180\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.600\nif your network or the powers that be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n181\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.440\n&gt;&gt; Wanna do it, so\n&gt;&gt; So, what is a digital signature?\n\n182\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.450\nOops, let's not cancel that,\nlet's not close that.\n\n183\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.330\n&gt;&gt; Let's not do that.\n\n184\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.610\n&gt;&gt; No, we're not gonna go over here\nbecause I have a link here about\n\n185\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.680\ndigital signatures and certificates.\n\n186\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.990\nSee, I've already said that word once and\nif you kinda caught it be like,\n\n187\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.020\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n188\n00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:04.430\nSo, in a nutshell, what a digital\nsignature does, it verifies your identity.\n\n189\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.640\nAnd that you, you yourself,\ncreated the document.\n\n190\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.720\nYou are signing off on it.\n\n191\n00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.560\nAnd I'm sending it off to someone.\n\n192\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.190\nAnd with that signature,\nif I send it to Daniel,\n\n193\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.200\nDaniel can see one, is it really me, and\n\n194\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.490\ntwo, did any of the information\nget compromised along the way.\n\n195\n00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.250\nDid somebody change even\na single character?\n\n196\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.160\nDid they add a period where it\nwas supposed to be a comma?\n\n197\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.320\nSo, they changed something,\nthis digital signature just verifies\n\n198\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.290\nthe integrity of the information and\nthe sender.\n\n199\n00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.120\nAnd that's what it It boils down.\n\n200\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's in a nutshell what it does.\n\n201\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.560\nSo, how do you get to that point?\n\n202\n00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.820\nThis is where we start talking\n\n203\n00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.750\nabout algorithms and-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n204\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.050\nComplications\n&gt;&gt; Keys and hashes.\n\n205\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.578\n&gt;&gt; In life.\n\n206\n00:10:54.578 --> 00:10:57.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Complications in life, exactly.\n\n207\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.330\nYes, so it's just kind of talking\nabout what is a digital signature.\n\n208\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.050\nThat's why we talked about it make\nsure that it hasn't been altered and\n\n209\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.490\nthat it is you.\n\n210\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.110\nAnd so that's where you get.\n\n211\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.520\nBut now, you have a signing certificate,\nthere's that other part.\n\n212\n00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.490\nIt's almost like your birth certificate,\nif you want to say it.\n\n213\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.990\nLike if you have your birth certificate,\n\n214\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.170\nwhen you go somewhere to get your driver's\nlicense, you're verifying that this is me.\n\n215\n00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's a physical certificate that I\n\n216\n00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.390\nhave to\n&gt;&gt; Issue.\n\n217\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.780\n&gt;&gt; And that leads you to your next,\nyou see the certificate authority, right?\n\n218\n00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.800\nThat would be the issuing body, right?\n\n219\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800\nSo, the state of, we live in Florida so\n\n220\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.980\nthe state of Florida would have\nissued Vonne her birth certificate.\n\n221\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.220\nThey are the standards,\n\n222\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.230\nthe body in which issues this out that you\nknow you can verify, you can trust them.\n\n223\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.600\n&gt;&gt; That they are giving you this thing.\n\n224\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.260\nSo, that's what a certificate\nauthority would be.\n\n225\n00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.170\nSo, if you are digital, you're signing\ncertificate would be your birth\n\n226\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.115\ncertificate, the CA would be\nthe entity in which the certificate\n\n227\n00:11:54.115 --> 00:11:54.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n228\n00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:56.145\nthat's where you have to have this part,\n\n229\n00:11:56.145 --> 00:11:59.345\nlike if I'm gonna use this digital\nsignature, I have to have a certificate.\n\n230\n00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:00.505\nThose issued from somebody.\n\n231\n00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:03.755\nSo, I can't just willy nilly sign it over.\n\n232\n00:12:03.755 --> 00:12:06.750\nAnd it's like I'm gonna\nadd a digital signature.\n\n233\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.990\nI have to get this.\n\n234\n00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.140\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And this is something if you start\n\n235\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:16.140\nfollowing it, and you got into people that\ndo provide this, you have to pay for them.\n\n236\n00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.720\nYou have to pay for\na certificate to be issued to you.\n\n237\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.410\n&gt;&gt; If you want to be out there on\nthe internet inside the world,\n\n238\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.720\ninteroperating with different entities,\n&gt;&gt; Yes you'll have to pay for\n\n239\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.180\na digital certificates you can create\nyour own, you can create in house,\n\n240\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.670\nyou can do what is called self signing\ncertificate that is a possibility,\n\n241\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.990\nso if you just want to make it in\nhouse and have that functionality,\n\n242\n00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.110\nyou could do that using self signing but\nas you get out into the world,\n\n243\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.070\npeople are gonna go you signed it\nyourself, just like you saying I'm good\n\n244\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.860\nmen, trust me I'm totally need to\nworry about me being bad, right.\n\n245\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.180\nThey're not gonna really\ntake your word for.\n\n246\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:55.090\nIt needs some governing authority that was\nsay, yes I vouch for you as an entity,\n\n247\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:13:00.310\nI vouch for you as a user and that, that\nwould be a good thing for others to do.\n\n248\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.760\nSo, that's where we get into whole buying\nthings, that's what i'm talking about.\n\n249\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; You will spend some money.\n\n250\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's just to a level where like\n\n251\n00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.900\ni can't\n&gt;&gt; Fully\n\n252\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.070\ndemonstrate,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.630\n&gt;&gt; The full capability of\na digital signature because we're\n\n254\n00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.770\nnot set up that way and I-\n&gt;&gt; Right, and to create a self\n\n255\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.810\nsigning certificate, what's called a PKI,\na Public Key Infrastructure to do this.\n\n256\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.550\nA little overkill for the show,\nI'll be honest with you.\n\n257\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.330\nThat's a lot of back work just to create\nten seconds of content for you guys.\n\n258\n00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Basically, all it would do is\ncreate those signatures for us and\n\n259\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.600\nwe could use them in house.\n\n260\n00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.910\nI could pass one out to Von.\n\n261\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.140\nYou want one no problem,\n\n262\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.740\nissue her a certificate as\nlike a systems administrator.\n\n263\n00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.970\nThat's where you would get those from.\n\n264\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.480\nThey would probably issue them if\nit is important to your company\n\n265\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.330\nas you become a user they would issue\nthose out as you were a new employee.\n\n266\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.800\nPerfect and\nyou've already said the word key.\n\n267\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n268\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.040\n&gt;&gt; When I think of key\nI think of an actual\n\n269\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.340\nphysical key that you put into a lock and\nyou turn it.\n\n270\n00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.610\nAnd it kinda means the same\nidea just digital.\n\n271\n00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.250\n&gt;&gt; Think of it not so\nmuch as a key that goes in a lock,\n\n272\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.040\n&gt;&gt; But as a, if you were to, like a kid,\n\n273\n00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.280\nand you jumbled up words, what is the key\nthat straightens them back out, right?\n\n274\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.880\nA equals N kinda thing.\n\n275\n00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.220\nThat's the kinda key\nwe're talking about here.\n\n276\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.570\nYou usually get a public and\na private key.\n\n277\n00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.020\nThis is called asymmetric cryptography.\n\n278\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:20.810\nIt doesn't matter,\n\n279\n00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.610\ndon't need to know that for anything\nother than your own personal pleasure.\n\n280\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.710\nRight, so the keys are what bind us.\n\n281\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.770\nAnd the cool thing is that your\nprivate key stays private.\n\n282\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.090\nYour public key is public.\n\n283\n00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.050\nAnybody can have it.\n\n284\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.610\nGive it out.\n\n285\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.570\nPut it on a billboard somewhere.\n\n286\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.210\nPut it on a website.\n\n287\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.760\nIt is meant to be public.\n\n288\n00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.710\nAnd this is how this works.\n\n289\n00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:46.750\nI can then take my private key and\ncreate a little signature, and hash it up.\n\n290\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.960\nThis is a little one-way algorithm,\n\n291\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.350\njust basically spits out a unique\nstring of numbers, right.\n\n292\n00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.510\nThen I encrypt that with my private key.\n\n293\n00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.150\nThis is where it gets a little wierd,\ncuz usually you encrypt things with public\n\n294\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.270\nkeys, but not this time because this is\na digital signature, it's special, right.\n\n295\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.810\nSo use your private and then Vonne can\ngrab my public key which is public, and\n\n296\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:12.130\nverify that it was my actual private\nkey that encrypted that signature.\n\n297\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:17.444\nShe will then run the hashing algorithm\nagainst it, get the exact same results,\n\n298\n00:15:17.444 --> 00:15:20.040\nnd she knows the integrity\nof the document is secure.\n\n299\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.680\nI know that Vonne actually sent\nthat because it was her private key\n\n300\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.650\nthat generated the hash.\n\n301\n00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.750\nOr was used to encrypt the hash.\n\n302\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] Perfectly said,\n\n303\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.490\nand it's more like I'm sending\nyou this secret decoder ring.\n\n304\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n305\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.540\n&gt;&gt; I went ahead, and I have my own.\n\n306\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.910\nMy special decoder ring\nthat I used to make it.\n\n307\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.910\nI'm sending you the decoder ring with it.\n\n308\n00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.493\nAnd if anybody changed that A to an N and\nnow it's A to an M,\n\n309\n00:15:47.493 --> 00:15:50.880\nyou'll see that when you try\nto use the decoder ring.\n\n310\n00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.527\nIt's like that doesn't match,\nso yeah safe decoder.\n\n311\n00:15:52.527 --> 00:15:55.817\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, this is on no sensitive data.\n\n312\n00:15:55.817 --> 00:15:57.552\nThis is just on Vonne's digital signature.\n\n313\n00:15:57.552 --> 00:16:01.468\nRight, this is why you can encrypt\nit with your private key and\n\n314\n00:16:01.468 --> 00:16:03.360\ndecrypt it with a public key.\n\n315\n00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.340\nYou want people to be able\nto decrypt it to verify you\n\n316\n00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.790\nare who you say you are because only your\npublic key will decrypt it correctly.\n\n317\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.410\nAnybody who tries to fraudulently\ncreate one it won't work.\n\n318\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.943\nSo I can pretend I'm Yvonne Smith\nall day create a private and\n\n319\n00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:22.444\npublic set of keys but my private key or\nmy public key neither of those are gonna\n\n320\n00:16:22.444 --> 00:16:26.623\nbe Vonnes actual encrypted staff so\nonly Yvonne's keys will work and.\n\n321\n00:16:26.623 --> 00:16:29.125\nAnd those keys tie in\nwith those certificates.\n\n322\n00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:32.015\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You know, its like I'm giving you my\n\n323\n00:16:32.015 --> 00:16:34.245\npublic version of my certificate.\n\n324\n00:16:34.245 --> 00:16:34.865\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n325\n00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:39.105\nthen you put my certificate on\nyour server or in your computer,\n\n326\n00:16:39.105 --> 00:16:44.395\nsomewhere where you store all the people\nthat you deal with on a regular basis,\n\n327\n00:16:44.395 --> 00:16:49.500\nyou have their public version\nof their certificate, their key.\n\n328\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.790\nAnd so that way when it comes in,\nI store all of my certificates somewhere\n\n329\n00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:58.730\nto verify the identity and\nthe authority or\n\n330\n00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.050\nthe integrity of the document so\neverything is fine.\n\n331\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.347\nAnd so there's that whole setup of\nwhere do all the certificates live and\n\n332\n00:17:06.347 --> 00:17:07.409\nwho stores them?\n\n333\n00:17:07.409 --> 00:17:10.225\nAnd there's certificate servers\nin larger organizations or\n\n334\n00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:12.670\nareas of a server where\nthat's where everything is.\n\n335\n00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.690\n&gt;&gt; This keeps people from sending things\nthat look like they're from Vonne, but\n\n336\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:17.340\naren't from Vonne.\n\n337\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.170\nMaybe you're looking for\na document to come from Vonne, and\n\n338\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.554\nI fraudulently created one.\n\n339\n00:17:21.554 --> 00:17:23.427\nI put it in Yvonne's name,\n\n340\n00:17:23.427 --> 00:17:28.241\nI've even created of keys to encrypt\nthings and do all sorts of stuff.\n\n341\n00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:29.926\nMan everything looks legit, but\n\n342\n00:17:29.926 --> 00:17:34.077\nall of a sudden you pull Yvonne's actual\npublic key which is publicly available,\n\n343\n00:17:34.077 --> 00:17:37.650\nyou can go get and try to run the\nalgorithm and see if it actually works.\n\n344\n00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.411\nIt's a program it will do it for you not\nlike you have to do math or something.\n\n345\n00:17:41.411 --> 00:17:44.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and we're talking all about these\n\n346\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:48.477\nsignatures and I wanna make that point\nlike we're, you're encrypting and\n\n347\n00:17:48.477 --> 00:17:53.180\nencoding the signature and\nthe authority of that particular person.\n\n348\n00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.000\nBut if you sent me a document, I'm still\ngonna see the Word document so it's\n\n349\n00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.840\nnot like it's encoding the information to\nwhere you can't see the Word document.\n\n350\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.040\nYou're just gonna get a little warning.\n\n351\n00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.580\nThat says hey,\nyou can see the document but\n\n352\n00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.810\nI as word and then past that is\nlike looking at your certificate.\n\n353\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.875\nI can't verify the certificate so you're\nIt's almost like you're on your own now.\n\n354\n00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:22.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know who this came from,\nbut it wasn't Yvonne, right?\n\n355\n00:18:22.578 --> 00:18:24.415\nThat's what it'll basically tell you.\n\n356\n00:18:24.415 --> 00:18:25.655\n&gt;&gt; But you still get the document.\n\n357\n00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:26.675\n&gt;&gt; You still get the document.\n\n358\n00:18:26.675 --> 00:18:28.817\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna not not get Word.\n\n359\n00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:31.535\n[LAUGH] It happens and you can get it.\n\n360\n00:18:31.535 --> 00:18:36.155\nSo, actually I have a file that I did,\nI went through the steps and\n\n361\n00:18:36.155 --> 00:18:41.720\ndid the whole self signing, and you'll see\nthe warning that comes up, right here.\n\n362\n00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.790\nThe document contains a recoverable\nsignature and it's going over here and\n\n363\n00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:51.420\nit's going to say I can't\nverify this person over here.\n\n364\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:56.330\nIf I go to signature details, so\nit's like it can't be verified.\n\n365\n00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.420\nAnd look, I like that,\ncheck with your network connection.\n\n366\n00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.050\nCall your systems administrator.\n\n367\n00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.345\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to contact Verisign and\nthey're just not.\n\n368\n00:19:03.345 --> 00:19:04.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n369\n00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.230\n&gt;&gt; Coming up with anything.\n\n370\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.220\n&gt;&gt; I don't understand.\n\n371\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.450\nSo this is what,\nI still get the information.\n\n372\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.082\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n373\n00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:14.720\nI don't want you to think that it's like,\nI'll encrypt all of my data.\n\n374\n00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.000\n&gt;&gt; You can do that, but\nthat's not what we're talking about.\n\n375\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.690\nWhen it comes to digital signatures\nthat's not what it's about.\n\n376\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.610\nYou can encrypt data, and\nit does use keys to do that.\n\n377\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.060\nBut that is a different thing.\n\n378\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.770\nDigital signatures is just about\nverifying the integrity of the sender,\n\n379\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.240\nthat it was that the sender that\nyou expected it to come from and\n\n380\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.100\nnot anyone else, that's all it's about.\n\n381\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, and the data didn't get changed.\n\n382\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.470\nSo there''s-\n&gt;&gt; No only\n\n383\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.120\nif you encrypted the data with that.\n\n384\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.900\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n385\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.050\n&gt;&gt; Only the signature is hash and\nencrypted.\n\n386\n00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n&gt;&gt; With a digital signature.\n\n387\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd verifies of any changes that happened.\n\n388\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.650\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n389\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.120\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Now, you can encrypt the data as well.\n\n390\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.160\nThat's a different ballgame.\n\n391\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.730\n&gt;&gt; And this is where we start\ngoing down the rabbit hole.\n\n392\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.629\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're smiling.\n\n393\n00:19:54.629 --> 00:19:56.011\n&gt;&gt; I believe we even have\nCheshire the Cat too.\n\n394\n00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:59.228\nSo we've had Cheshire the Cat and\ndown the rabbit hole.\n\n395\n00:19:59.228 --> 00:20:00.431\nI was like okay,\nwe should probably stop right now.\n\n396\n00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:02.687\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well that's impermeated into my brain,\n\n397\n00:20:02.687 --> 00:20:05.899\nprobably because the document that we\nkeep using is Alice in Wonderland.\n\n398\n00:20:05.899 --> 00:20:07.077\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wish for\n\n399\n00:20:07.077 --> 00:20:09.411\nweeks now that we've just\nbeen looking at this stuff.\n\n400\n00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:11.996\n&gt;&gt; We've been indoctrinated,\nwe've been Stockholmed.\n\n401\n00:20:11.996 --> 00:20:15.162\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Totally, yes.\n\n402\n00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:17.110\nSo, that's where we're going,\n\n403\n00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:22.500\nwhen you start to getting into that other\nlevel of cryptography, and you know a lot.\n\n404\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.120\n&gt;&gt; Too much, too much, everybody,\nlet's all just take a breath.\n\n405\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.465\nIn the nose, out the mouth and the woosa.\n\n406\n00:20:28.465 --> 00:20:29.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even before the show,\n\n407\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.950\nhe started talking, I just went like,\nI don't know where I'm at anymore.\n\n408\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I lost you somewhere there.\n\n409\n00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.640\nSo but it is all fascinating stuff,\nand it's very much like\n\n410\n00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.650\nin the public presence really if you\ntalk about all of our information and\n\n411\n00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.261\nlike being hacked and you get-\n&gt;&gt; Depending on your job, this is very,\n\n412\n00:20:49.261 --> 00:20:53.950\nvery insignificant for you because if\nyou work in a government entity or\n\n413\n00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.390\nyou work with something\nwith trade secrets,\n\n414\n00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.660\ndigital secrets are probably\na real part of your day so\n\n415\n00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.230\nunderstanding how they work or if you are\ngoing into this business understanding.\n\n416\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.619\nAnd how they would be very,\nvery helpful for you.\n\n417\n00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:07.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and right now we're just laying\nthe foundation so you know the idea.\n\n418\n00:21:07.928 --> 00:21:11.663\nYou know the whole premise\nof why we're doing this and\n\n419\n00:21:11.663 --> 00:21:17.540\nwhy we want to put on digital signatures,\nand where you would find it in Word.\n\n420\n00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.170\nIs in this back stage view, and\n\n421\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:24.010\nthere is the add digital signature\nright there for your integrity.\n\n422\n00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:29.890\nAnd then this gets into well,\nwhat type of commitment are we doing here?\n\n423\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.860\nAnd then right here\nthe signing as issued by,\n\n424\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.530\nand if I come into this change,\nit's saying okay, well,\n\n425\n00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.840\nI have this communication server and\nit's only valid for today.\n\n426\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.240\nAnd that was kind of like one time\nsignature that we were talking about that\n\n427\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.090\nis through Office 365.\n\n428\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.108\nAnd I'd have to talk to Ronnie\na little bit about hey,\n\n429\n00:21:48.108 --> 00:21:51.743\nwhat did you put with Justin's\ncertificate going on over here.\n\n430\n00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:54.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So and it says right there,\n\n431\n00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.590\nI can't verify this, so I don't really\nexactly know where this is coming from.\n\n432\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.200\nYea and I forgot to go into\nthis certificate properties.\n\n433\n00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.260\nThis is the certificate information.\n\n434\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:11.874\nYou have a private key and then into the\ndetails and then the certification path.\n\n435\n00:22:11.874 --> 00:22:13.714\nAnd these are all the things that again,\n\n436\n00:22:13.714 --> 00:22:16.600\nyour system administrator would\nprobably set a lot of this up.\n\n437\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.000\nAll you have to do is like click,\nclick, boop, done.\n\n438\n00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.830\nAnd that's all you need to know.\n\n439\n00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.390\nYou don't even have to have the whole\nunderstanding of what we just\n\n440\n00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.270\nsaid about the whole premise of this.\n\n441\n00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.370\n&gt;&gt; You just click buttons.\n\n442\n00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] it’s one of those click,\nclick, next, next, next, continue.\n\n443\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And\n\n444\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.560\nyou’re fine with it because they told\nyou they are you know you trust them.\n\n445\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.460\n&gt;&gt; But\ndon’t say we didn’t try to show it to you.\n\n446\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.317\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n447\n00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:39.852\n&gt;&gt; Right so\n\n448\n00:22:39.852 --> 00:22:42.880\nthat where you can find\nyour digital signatures\n\n449\n00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.560\nand all\n&gt;&gt; All the information that's you need to\n\n450\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.380\nknow as an end user for\nwhat is it, when to use it and\n\n451\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.500\nthen call your help desk for\nmore information.\n\n452\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.410\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n453\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.620\nall right, Yvonne, well, that wraps\nup our talk on document security.\n\n454\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.480\nHopefully we didn't spin\nyour head around too hard.\n\n455\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.410\nIf we did, take a breather,\nhave a Coke and\n\n456\n00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:06.180\nsmile, come back re-watch,\nslow it down a little bit,\n\n457\n00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.980\nmaybe light some aromatherapy candles\nto help you through that, so.\n\n458\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.240\nCause we know this can\ndefinitely be heavy.\n\n459\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.110\nBut we are at the end\nof document security.\n\n460\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.370\nWe do thank you for watching, while we\nthank you for joining us today as well.\n\n461\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.890\nSigning off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your house Daniel Lowry.\n\n462\n00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:21.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Yvonne Smith.\n\n463\n00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:22.785\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n464\n00:23:22.785 --> 00:23:32.010\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.095\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.610\nwell we're continuing in our\nWord 2016 expert level series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.135\nAnd we're coming back at you\na little more on security.\n\n6\n00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:21.400\nVonne had a few more little odds and\n\n7\n00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.620\nends she wanted to throw\non the fire there for us.\n\n8\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.000\nSo here we are again to rattle\non some security stuff.\n\n9\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.050\nIt's going to be a lot of fun.\n\n10\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.280\nSorry I sound like Barry White.\n\n11\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.620\nI'm a little under the weather.\n\n12\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.223\nBut I guess it is better\nthan the opposite, maybe.\n\n13\n00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:34.500\n[LAUGH] Maybe weird.\n&gt;&gt; It is a nice tone but\n\n14\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.085\nhey I feel very relaxed right now.\n\n15\n00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:36.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but\n\n16\n00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.715\nobviously as you can see joining\nus is the lovely Vonne Smith.\n\n17\n00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\nI feel it is a special episode.\n\n18\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're not feeling so\n\n19\n00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.821\ngreat and we're in to part three.\n\n20\n00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:47.808\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do not think I have ever done a part\n\n21\n00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:48.591\nthree before, ever.\n\n22\n00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:50.140\n&gt;&gt; You are in uncharted waters.\n\n23\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.189\n&gt;&gt; And I am, yeah.\n\n24\n00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:55.473\nAnd this is really like, well, I thought\nyou kinda wrapped everything up in part\n\n25\n00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:59.440\ntwo cuz we talked about the IRM,\nthe Information Rights Management.\n\n26\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.420\nAnd we also talked a lot\nabout digital signatures.\n\n27\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.246\nWe had a lot of fun talking about hashing\nalgorithms and all sorts of keys and\n\n28\n00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:06.470\nfun stuff like that.\n\n29\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.871\n&gt;&gt; We have fun.\n\n30\n00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:09.089\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We did,\n\n31\n00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:13.943\nso it was like wow, that seemed like a\nnice finality, but I kinda forgot [LAUGH],\n\n32\n00:01:13.943 --> 00:01:14.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120\n&gt;&gt; A pretty important chunk in\n\n34\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.470\ndocument security.\n\n35\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.350\nAnd so I figured I'd come back at you.\n\n36\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.830\nWith a little addendum to go ahead and\ntalk about restricting access.\n\n37\n00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.740\nWe're talking about\ndoing the node changes.\n\n38\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.080\nSo I wanted to go over some of the\nexceptions that you might want to do in.\n\n39\n00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.111\nAnd talk about some scenarios of why\nyou might not wanna lock down all of\n\n40\n00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:37.010\nthe document.\n\n41\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.090\nAnd how can I keep some of the parts\neditable for certain individuals.\n\n42\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.060\nSo why don't we jump back into\nthe same file that we were working\n\n43\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.410\nwith in part one and part two.\n\n44\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.060\nWe have our restrict styles document.\n\n45\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.330\nNothing special going on except just\nsome information and some texts.\n\n46\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.730\nBut I did have a little part down here.\n\n47\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.470\nIt's funny, it wasn't until I actually\nscrolled down I'm like, yeah, this part.\n\n48\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.480\n&gt;&gt; That thing I was gonna talk about.\n\n49\n00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I've just forgot to scroll.\n\n50\n00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:11.735\n[LAUGH] So I was like,\nokay, so change title only.\n\n51\n00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.005\nAnd then I had this Name,\nDepartment and Date.\n\n52\n00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.575\nAll right, so let's just review.\n\n53\n00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:20.065\nWe can go to the Review tab.\n\n54\n00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:22.005\nWow, I didn't even mean to do that.\n\n55\n00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:25.045\nSo we're gonna go over here to Restrict\nEditing, cuz that's one way that we can\n\n56\n00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:29.300\nget to the Restrict Editing task\npane over here on the right.\n\n57\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.450\nAnd we talked about restricting\nthe formattings to a specific styles.\n\n58\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.770\nAnd talked about making sure we\nget them in the recommended.\n\n59\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.105\nBut then we also talked about\nthis editing restrictions and\n\n60\n00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:40.980\nallow only this type of editing.\n\n61\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.188\nAnd I've checked this off and\n\n62\n00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:44.860\nthis is where we're talking about\neither doing like no changes.\n\n63\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.490\nLike this is where you do a real read\nonly for your document security.\n\n64\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.000\nNot just that mark as final where\nit's like a slight suggestion that\n\n65\n00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.520\nyou don't want people\nmessing with this document.\n\n66\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.330\nSo if you go ahead and\n\n67\n00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.350\nsay no changes, then they won't be able\nto do anything with that document.\n\n68\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.060\nAnd we also talked about commenting and\nfilling in forms and\n\n69\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.530\nbeing able to do tracked changes.\n\n70\n00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.710\nSo, what if I don't want most people\nto be able to edit the document,\n\n71\n00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.220\nbut then maybe there's like one\nspecific part where they could change?\n\n72\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.530\nAnd maybe everybody could\nchange this one section.\n\n73\n00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.830\nMaybe this is like a legal form or\n\n74\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.440\nsome type of document that\nyou send all of your clients.\n\n75\n00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.340\nAnd all the legal jargon,\n\n76\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.920\nyou wouldn't want anybody to\nbe able to change any of that.\n\n77\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.640\nBut it is going to a specific client so\n\n78\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.470\nyou would have to put in their name,\ntheir department, and their date.\n\n79\n00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.990\nOr something to the effect\nwhere you can change this, but\n\n80\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.420\nyou can't change anything else.\n\n81\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.480\nAnd I could see a lot of\nscenarios where that would\n\n82\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.290\nbe the actual scenario in the workforce.\n\n83\n00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.420\nSo I wanted to make sure I come back and\nshow you this.\n\n84\n00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.120\nSo we have this no changes and some of\nthe stuff is a little bit further down.\n\n85\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.770\nSo we can go ahead and\nsee that we have Exceptions.\n\n86\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.660\nAnd it says,\nSelect parts of the document and\n\n87\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.960\nchoose users who are allowed\nto freely edit them.\n\n88\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.860\nBecause right now with this check box on,\n\n89\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.090\nwe're saying, the entire document\nis Read Only, No Changes.\n\n90\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.710\nSo it's nice it gives us\na little instructions here.\n\n91\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.330\nIt says go ahead and select what\nyou want them to be able to edit.\n\n92\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.780\nAnd then, check off who is\nallowed to be able to do that.\n\n93\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.240\nNow, the default right here is everyone.\n\n94\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.641\nAnd then the cool thing is this, and\n\n95\n00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.240\nyou will have to deal\na little bit of teaching.\n\n96\n00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.223\nIf you wanna say,\nI'm the receiving end of like, hey,\n\n97\n00:04:41.223 --> 00:04:44.983\nwhen you get this make sure you go\nover this restricting editing pane.\n\n98\n00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:49.804\nAnd they will see buttons that they will\nhave to show like the reasons where I can\n\n99\n00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:51.610\nedit and so on and so forth.\n\n100\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.030\nAnd then of course it also\nhas if you check this off,\n\n101\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.190\nyou could remove this for\nthis particular user which is everyone.\n\n102\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.280\nNow, the thing is everyone will be great.\n\n103\n00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.250\nBut maybe there are certain places where,\nhey, only Lance can edit this.\n\n104\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.320\nOr only Joey can edit this\nparticular part of the document.\n\n105\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.700\nSo you can get into the more users and\ncheck on individuals.\n\n106\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.830\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you that process.\n\n107\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.470\nI'm gonna click on\nthe More Users right here.\n\n108\n00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.240\nAnd then it brings it up and says enter\nuser names, separating them by semicolons.\n\n109\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.520\nAnd notice there's no checkbox or\nlittle box off to the side that says\n\n110\n00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.200\ncheck names or let me access your\ncontacts and get into everything.\n\n111\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.653\nIt's just type in their name.\n\n112\n00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:44.586\nSo I could type in lance@officeprodemoco,\nI always spell this wrong.\n\n113\n00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:45.769\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n[LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:50.025\n&gt;&gt; You can do it, microsoft.com.\n\n115\n00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:51.170\nOkay I'm pretty sure that's it.\n\n116\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.130\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nI always think it says on Microsoft.\n\n117\n00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah and I always switch\nlike the r and the o or something.\n\n118\n00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.550\nI always spell it wrong.\n\n119\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.350\nSo, you can see that it's telling me\nto type in that particular person's\n\n120\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.830\nemail address or you could see\nthat it has the domain slash name.\n\n121\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.490\nAnd that could be if you are on\ncertain domains within your network.\n\n122\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.365\nYou need to go ahead and type that in.\n\n123\n00:06:15.365 --> 00:06:19.300\nThe way that it appears within let's\nsay like an Active Directory or\n\n124\n00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.810\nsomething within your\nnetwork that that identifies.\n\n125\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.950\nIf you just type in Lance, it's not going\nto be able to like connect to anything.\n\n126\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.420\nSo you do have to be very specific on\nhow your network identifies people and\n\n127\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.470\ntheir full username and whatever.\n\n128\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.404\nSo, double check with your\nnetwork people on that.\n\n129\n00:06:39.404 --> 00:06:40.328\nAnd I can click OK.\n\n130\n00:06:40.328 --> 00:06:45.130\nAnd you can see that now I have everyone\nand then I also have individuals.\n\n131\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.475\nAnd so,\nI can check those boxes on Off as needed.\n\n132\n00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:55.365\nSo as maybe everyone can edit this part,\nbut only Lance can edit this part.\n\n133\n00:06:55.365 --> 00:07:00.075\nSo you can go through and\nspecifically check on who can do what.\n\n134\n00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:01.095\nSo here's another scenario.\n\n135\n00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:03.575\nWhat if you have a really\nlong document and\n\n136\n00:07:03.575 --> 00:07:08.260\nyou're assigning Lance to\nedit maybe the top portion.\n\n137\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.200\nMaybe pages 1- 10 and\nJoey is going to edit pages 11- 20.\n\n138\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.880\nSo you could go ahead and lock down\nJoey from Lance's and Lance's from Joey.\n\n139\n00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.330\nGo ahead and let them track changes cuz\nyou don't want them to do anything else.\n\n140\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.352\nSo you have these different options, so\nyou can see a bunch of different ways\n\n141\n00:07:28.352 --> 00:07:33.310\nthat you can utilize this restricting\nonly certain areas of the document.\n\n142\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:39.106\nRather than the whole thing and\nthen two individuals that you want.\n\n143\n00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:43.950\nSo let me go ahead and go through\nthe scenario of everybody can edit this.\n\n144\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.490\nAnd I'm gonna turn on the show hide\nchanges here or the show hide button.\n\n145\n00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.804\nBecause I don't want people to be\nable to change the word name or\n\n146\n00:07:53.804 --> 00:07:56.730\ndepartment or date those are set.\n\n147\n00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.490\nAnd so, this is where if you had these in\na table, it might make it a little easier.\n\n148\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.182\nBut I wanted to do this specific example\njust to throw in another little kicker\n\n149\n00:08:05.182 --> 00:08:05.840\nin there.\n\n150\n00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.310\nSo let me zoom in a lot.\n\n151\n00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.480\nSo, I don't want them to change this and\nI don't want them to change the spacing.\n\n152\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.350\nI only want them to be able\nto edit right in there.\n\n153\n00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.320\nSo I'm just selecting the single space.\n\n154\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.950\nI'm not selecting the paragraph,\nI'm not selecting anything else but that.\n\n155\n00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.429\nNow, if it makes you feel better you can\nget a couple extra spaces in there so\n\n156\n00:08:25.429 --> 00:08:28.070\nthey can maybe see it a little bit better.\n\n157\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.990\nSo this is the only place that they will\nbe able to put and change information in.\n\n158\n00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.640\nNow let's do a couple more here and\na couple more there.\n\n159\n00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:43.830\nAnd I will use my Control key to hold\ndown and select multiple areas of text.\n\n160\n00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.509\nSo we get those three pieces and\n\n161\n00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:51.812\nthis is the only place that I\nwant everyone to be able to edit.\n\n162\n00:08:51.812 --> 00:08:54.880\nSo I come over here the check box for\nexceptions so\n\n163\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.028\nthere is that one section everyone can do.\n\n164\n00:08:58.028 --> 00:09:03.220\nWell, I could also take out,\nlet's say, this area right here.\n\n165\n00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.830\nThis particular place is\nthe place where Lance can edit.\n\n166\n00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.994\nSo I come over here to the check box\ndown where it says under individuals and\n\n167\n00:09:10.994 --> 00:09:12.280\nI check that box off.\n\n168\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.370\nAnd so now this particular section\nis lance area only not everyone.\n\n169\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.760\nSo you can see the differences\nin that check box right there.\n\n170\n00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.940\nWe have lance's here and\n\n171\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.570\nthen if I click my cursor here\nnotice there's no exceptions.\n\n172\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.237\nAnd then if click my cursor down here,\nthat's where everyone.\n\n173\n00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:36.225\nSo you can see there is check boxes\nchange throughout my document of where\n\n174\n00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:39.760\nI want to enforce and\nwhere I do not want to enforce.\n\n175\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.447\nAnd it can also see the little kind\nof brackets there, the grey brackets,\n\n176\n00:09:44.447 --> 00:09:48.140\nindicating that specific\narea that is editable.\n\n177\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.400\nAll right so let's scroll on down behind\nmy head to where we can go ahead and\n\n178\n00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.150\nstart that enforcement.\n\n179\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.790\nWe'd say I would like to enter a password.\n\n180\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:02.600\nSo I will type in apple because you all\nknow that that's my password of choice.\n\n181\n00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.290\nAnd now, I've restricted the editing.\n\n182\n00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.659\nSo you can see now that if I was anyone,\n\n183\n00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:10.820\nthat I would have this restrict\npermissions, your permissions.\n\n184\n00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.528\nFind the next place that I can edit.\n\n185\n00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:16.170\nAnd it's gonna jump me down and\nfind the next, find the next.\n\n186\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.160\nOr I can show all regions and it's going\nto give me, because now I'm everyone.\n\n187\n00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.680\nLet's pretend I'm Joey right now.\n\n188\n00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.100\nSo I would be able to do that and\nso I could type in here, but\n\n189\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.420\nnotice I can select this text,\nbut I can't type, anything in it.\n\n190\n00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.110\nI can't, delete anything.\n\n191\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.190\nAll of this other spaces,\nthey're all locked down.\n\n192\n00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.160\nAnd I can't, do that.\n\n193\n00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.360\nAnd notice, right here.\n\n194\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.250\nSince I'm, not Lance.\n\n195\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.780\nThis area, is not letting me,\nedit this, particular document.\n\n196\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.240\nSo that, can really, really helpful.\n\n197\n00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:54.820\nNow I will go ahead and give you a little\nasterisk cuz you know how it is Daniel.\n\n198\n00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.950\nWe go ahead and say, this is what you can\ndo, except if you're in this scenario or\n\n199\n00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.740\nthat scenario.\n\n200\n00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.190\nOr that, that, that wonderful world.\n\n201\n00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.770\n&gt;&gt; There's always a caveat, right?\n\n202\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:09.976\n&gt;&gt; Always, yes specially in all of these\nproducts and I have tried this out I\n\n203\n00:11:09.976 --> 00:11:14.735\nwent over to Lance's computer and I'm like\n&gt;&gt; This aren't working.\n\n204\n00:11:14.735 --> 00:11:16.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] it's not.\n\n205\n00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.960\nBut in theory it should, so of course,\nconsulted the Oracle, went out there.\n\n206\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.645\nAnd I found a lot of different message\nboards on the community the Microsoft\n\n207\n00:11:25.645 --> 00:11:27.350\nanswers community.\n\n208\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.840\nWhere this can get a little wonky\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.810\n&gt;&gt; It's like, hey, this is all gray and\n\n210\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.860\nthis is one of those like you do it\nthe way they tell you to do it and\n\n211\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.620\nit doesn't work [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, I read about some organizations\n\n213\n00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.744\nwhere people encountering that,\nwhere they went on shows, the individuals.\n\n214\n00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:51.288\nThey said there's that extra\nstuff of going into that IRM,\n\n215\n00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:53.370\nthe Information Rights Management System.\n\n216\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.300\nAnd to where your network is allowed to\nlike, they have to kind of have to set\n\n217\n00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:02.290\nthat up at a higher level than just\nlike a user to user type of level.\n\n218\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.530\nYou have to go one more.\n\n219\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.930\nSo if your system, if you wanna say,\nyour network, your system admins\n\n220\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:14.840\nare setting these type of permissions\nup within office and your network.\n\n221\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.090\nThen the check boxes\nshould work just fine.\n\n222\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:22.571\nSo if you encounter that you do this and\nyou're like cuz Office Prodemo go,\n\n223\n00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:27.710\nwe're a network, we're on Office 365 but\nIt wasn't setting up.\n\n224\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.822\nAnd so, I have seen some things\nacross multiple message boards\n\n225\n00:12:31.822 --> 00:12:36.460\nthat yeah we've had to go one more\nstep to make this actually work.\n\n226\n00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.470\nAnd then I also saw some other post of\n\n227\n00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:45.620\ndifferent scenarios where it's one of\nthose like this is a great feature.\n\n228\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:53.030\nAnd being able to limit areas of your\ndocument with restrictions is fantastic.\n\n229\n00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.050\nBut its one of those, I felt when\nI'm reading people's scenarios.\n\n230\n00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.055\nLike you're trying to make it do\nsomething its not really supposed to do.\n\n231\n00:12:59.055 --> 00:13:01.000\nIt's like any type of product.\n\n232\n00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.040\nI've always remembered this share point.\n\n233\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.800\nLike I have a boss.\n\n234\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.130\nHe's a great product.\n\n235\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.802\nBut then they're like-\n&gt;&gt; Then they try to use it.\n\n236\n00:13:08.802 --> 00:13:10.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, or they try to say,\n\n237\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.360\nwell I wanted to, it's set to do this but\nI really want it to do this.\n\n238\n00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n239\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.150\n&gt;&gt; And you're kinda forcing almost\nlike a square peg in a round hole and\n\n240\n00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.580\nit doesn't always work.\n\n241\n00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.860\nAnd I'm not saying that this won't work,\nI'm just saying try to just remember.\n\n242\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.855\n&gt;&gt; As Justin would say,\nyour mileage may vary.\n\n243\n00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:28.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love that, yes.\n\n244\n00:13:28.202 --> 00:13:31.923\nJust try to keep it within\nthe context of what it can do.\n\n245\n00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:33.894\nAnd if you're going all sorts of crazy.\n\n246\n00:13:33.894 --> 00:13:36.290\nThey're talking about all these forms and\nthey don't want people to change them.\n\n247\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.550\nWord is not necessarily\nthe best with forms.\n\n248\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.603\nIt's okay.\nIt's pretty good, but\n\n249\n00:13:40.603 --> 00:13:41.465\nyou might need a [CROSSTALK].\n\n250\n00:13:41.465 --> 00:13:43.230\n&gt;&gt; But if you're getting into that level.\n\n251\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.320\nOr it's probably not\nyour jumping off point.\n\n252\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.880\nIt's time to move to a more, a product\ncentered around doing that type of thing.\n\n253\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and a lot of times people they\ndon't even now what that product this.\n\n254\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.630\nAnd so it's like this but\nthis is the only product I have.\n\n255\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.640\nSo, I have to make it work.\n\n256\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.880\nSo I completely understand all.\n\n257\n00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.377\n&gt;&gt; And kudos to the good people at\nMicrosoft that say, you know what,\n\n258\n00:14:00.377 --> 00:14:03.470\nwe see that there are some people that\nmaybe aren't ready to jump into something.\n\n259\n00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.511\nThat is more professionally centered\ntoward this specific thing that they're\n\n260\n00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:08.500\ntrying to do.\n\n261\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.940\nSo let's try to add some of that\nfunctionality inside of word so\n\n262\n00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.330\nthey've already bought a product.\n\n263\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.260\nThey can use it to some extent.\n\n264\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and they always are expanding\nto make other products.\n\n265\n00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.880\nAnd they were talking about info path and\n\n266\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.870\nI know that's a specific product that\ndoes do a little bit more reforms.\n\n267\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.040\nThey were talking about moving\noff into and I'm like wait,\n\n268\n00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.455\naren't going the wrong way?\n\n269\n00:14:26.455 --> 00:14:27.880\n[LAUGH] But those are different things.\n\n270\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.420\nSo I just wanted to kinda put\nthat little caveat, that little.\n\n271\n00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.917\nIf you're going to that individual level\nthat we're saying in the exceptions,\n\n272\n00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.440\nyou might need to contact\nyour system admin.\n\n273\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.980\nTo make sure that that does work and\nalways test it out.\n\n274\n00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.228\nIf it's not working, there's always these\nlittle things you find work arounds.\n\n275\n00:14:46.228 --> 00:14:49.738\nCuz we do it all the time like, hey, this\nis how it will really work even though\n\n276\n00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:51.590\ninstructions tell you to do it this way.\n\n277\n00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.890\nSo that's my little\nnote on this Part Three\n\n278\n00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.052\nof Document Security and\nrestricting areas with those exemptions.\n\n279\n00:15:01.052 --> 00:15:04.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne now that we have\na more well-rounded knowledge base when it\n\n280\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.810\ncomes to document security.\n\n281\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.250\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nthank you for that.\n\n282\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.670\nBecause you've really spent some time and\neffort on this and we appreciate it.\n\n283\n00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.530\nThat being said, we appreciate our\naudience for joining us as well.\n\n284\n00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.990\nBut it is that time for us to sign off.\n\n285\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.420\nFor Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n286\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.420\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n287\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.205\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n288\n00:15:20.205 --> 00:15:26.022\n[SOUND]\n\n",

to another great\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:13.770\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.430\nit's all about Word 2016,\nright, our expert level though.\n\n6\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.688\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:22.770\nVonne, glad to have you, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.830\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n9\n00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.177\nWe are gonna talk about document\nproperties, like you said [LAUGH], or\n\n10\n00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:28.038\ndid you say that?\n\n11\n00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:28.616\n&gt;&gt; I did not.\n\n12\n00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:29.766\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.312\n&gt;&gt; She was so\n\n14\n00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:34.829\nexcited to get to document properties\nthat her mind told her I already said it.\n\n15\n00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I know, I'm like,\nwait, I don't know if he did say that.\n\n16\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.182\nOkay, so I'll say it.\n\n17\n00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:43.000\n[LAUGH] We're gonna talk\nabout document properties.\n\n18\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.870\nWhat are they?\n\n19\n00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.380\nWhere are they?\n\n20\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.850\nWhy do we use them?\n\n21\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.787\nAll of the what, where, why, how, when-\n&gt;&gt; Who.\n\n22\n00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:52.619\n&gt;&gt; Who, yeah [LAUGH],\nlike a missing one [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.903\nAll right, so the document properties\nare things that you add to your files.\n\n24\n00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:04.180\nIt's the hidden information in the back,\nwhat can also be referred to as metadata.\n\n25\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.692\nMetadata is the behind the scenes stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:12.580\nNow this is something that I remember from\nmy coding days of creating web pages.\n\n27\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.236\nWhere in the head section of your HTML\nfile, you have a head and a body.\n\n28\n00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:20.835\nThink about head, your brain,\nyour body, well, the body.\n\n29\n00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:22.165\nAnd then-\n&gt;&gt; The thing that does stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:26.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so in the head section,\nyou would put in metadata, and\n\n31\n00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:32.500\nthere's an actual tag called meta, and\nyou could have things like keywords.\n\n32\n00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.760\nSo what are different keywords that\nI would like to associate with this\n\n33\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.958\nparticular web page that people would\nthen maybe type in in a search?\n\n34\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.750\nAnd then they would match, and\nthen that would bring that up.\n\n35\n00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.580\nAnd so they use it for\n\n36\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.700\nwhat's known as search engine optimization\nand different things like that.\n\n37\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.570\nBut as a user,\nas somebody coming to the website,\n\n38\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.760\nyou don't see any of that\ninformation in the background.\n\n39\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.760\nBut it is used for certain things, like\nsearching and optimization for web pages.\n\n40\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.930\nAnd you can correlate\nthat directly into Word.\n\n41\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.570\nIf I add in information in\nthe background of this Word file,\n\n42\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.070\nit can be used for searching purposes.\n\n43\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.850\nI can use just Windows,\n\n44\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.080\njust a regular Windows search,\nI know I had this document.\n\n45\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.200\nAnd I was talking about fields and\nproperties.\n\n46\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.010\nWell, if I had added that into\na document's tags in that document\n\n47\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.880\nproperties, it would find that information\nand use that and give me the result in\n\n48\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.970\nmy search based on that extra information,\nso that's where it could be useful.\n\n49\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.938\nAnd then sometimes you might be in an\norganization that you're almost required,\n\n50\n00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:45.903\nif you wanna say, to put in those\ndifferent types of properties.\n\n51\n00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:50.212\nSo say, I know this was one that I had\nsomebody working in the legal industry.\n\n52\n00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:53.790\nAnd so they said, we had to put all\nthat stuff, what case it was, and\n\n53\n00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.350\nwhen we took it,\nall these different things.\n\n54\n00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.310\nBecause it really mattered in\nthat type of profession and\n\n55\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.940\nlegal services and court cases.\n\n56\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.940\nAnd what is all this and then it's\nimportant, but the other thing is, if you\n\n57\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.870\nare starting to put that information in\nthat document, it could be sensitive.\n\n58\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.330\nIt can be things that you don't\nwant people to be able to see,\n\n59\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.640\neven though they don't\nsee it in the front.\n\n60\n00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.820\nThey can still go and see it in the back,\nand you might want to remove that.\n\n61\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.410\nSo in this episode,\nwe're gonna be talking about\n\n62\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.370\nwhere to find the document properties and\nthen how to inspect a document to\n\n63\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.567\nsee if there are anything in there that's\nhiding back in there and then remove it.\n\n64\n00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:34.517\nWe'll also talk about accessibility,\n\n65\n00:03:34.517 --> 00:03:38.026\nwhich doesn't really go with document\nproperties necessarily [LAUGH].\n\n66\n00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:39.365\n&gt;&gt; But you have to throw it in somewhere?\n\n67\n00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:41.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and\nit's all in the same place.\n\n68\n00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:43.172\nSo that's where we'll just\ngo right on down the menu.\n\n69\n00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:44.255\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan, Vonne.\n\n70\n00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:45.205\nWhere do we start?\n\n71\n00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:49.415\n&gt;&gt; Well, wow, okay, well, how about we\nstart with me trying to talk, right?\n\n72\n00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:54.246\nAnd we're gonna open up a file\ncalled document properties added,\n\n73\n00:03:54.246 --> 00:03:57.449\nand here we go, Alice in Wonderland again.\n\n74\n00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.366\nI gotta put a picture of a bunny in there,\nit's either a bunny or\n\n75\n00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:01.423\na cat, one of the two.\n\n76\n00:04:01.423 --> 00:04:02.619\n&gt;&gt; It's a very, very unbirthday thing.\n\n77\n00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.984\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now I'm gonna\nstart singing it again.\n\n78\n00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:07.047\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know,\nsong's in your head forever now.\n\n79\n00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:09.619\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI can see the actual scene in the movie,\n\n80\n00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.025\nwhere they're all dancing around and\neverything, okay.\n\n81\n00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:17.916\nAll right, so, now we're gonna talk\nabout the document properties that is in\n\n82\n00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:19.955\nthe file or the backstage view.\n\n83\n00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:21.593\nIt's over here in the info,\n\n84\n00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:25.361\nthe info is on by default when you\ngo over into the backstage view.\n\n85\n00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.507\nBut just in case,\nmake sure you are on the info section.\n\n86\n00:04:29.507 --> 00:04:35.840\nAnd so, over here, I have properties like\nsize, pages, words, tags, and titles.\n\n87\n00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.160\nAll of these are ones that I have added,\nif I opened up, let's say,\n\n88\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.565\neven a new file or\neven a file that I already have created,\n\n89\n00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:50.020\nwhich is here, tocindex, and\nI come over here to the properties.\n\n90\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.192\nNotice that there isn't a title,\nthere isn't a tag, and\n\n91\n00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:57.359\nthere's not gonna be any of the same\ninformation because it didn't add it.\n\n92\n00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:03.870\nOkay, so in the document properties added,\nhence the name, I put that all in there.\n\n93\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.760\nSo I put in word, properties, fields,\n\n94\n00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.280\nthese are the different tags that I\nassociated this particular file with,\n\n95\n00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.500\nand again, using for\nthat searching capabilities.\n\n96\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.260\nI put a title, and actually,\nyeah, some of these fields and\n\n97\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.700\nthese properties, they tie indirectly\nto when you put in things,\n\n98\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.210\nlike cover pages or\nall of those different things.\n\n99\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.300\nWe've talked about fields\nin other episodes.\n\n100\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.840\nIn the Word Advanced series,\nwe did those with the quick parts,\n\n101\n00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.560\nand specifically, with those cover pages,\n\n102\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.640\nwhere it just goes ahead and\nautomatically generates this information.\n\n103\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.420\nWell, it's pulling from\nyour document properties.\n\n104\n00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.423\nSo they do work together in other\nplaces in Word besides just,\n\n105\n00:05:48.423 --> 00:05:52.670\nhey, I wanna put this\ninformation back type thing.\n\n106\n00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.462\nAnd if I scroll on down through here,\n\n107\n00:05:55.462 --> 00:06:01.326\nthe ones that are always good is this one,\nthe last modified and the created.\n\n108\n00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:05.714\n[LAUGH] I’ve talked about this\nbefore where, say, you’re a teacher,\n\n109\n00:06:05.714 --> 00:06:10.317\nand my dog ate my homework, or\nI didn’t get my computer broke, or\n\n110\n00:06:10.317 --> 00:06:13.120\nwhat have you, but I know I have it done.\n\n111\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.168\nI did it last week and\nI’ll turn it in tomorrow.\n\n112\n00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:19.077\nWell, I could come into here and see like,\nno, you didn't create it last week.\n\n113\n00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:21.174\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You created it just the other day.\n\n114\n00:06:21.174 --> 00:06:22.052\n&gt;&gt; Last night.\n\n115\n00:06:22.052 --> 00:06:24.075\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you told me, so\n\n116\n00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:28.939\nthis whole created days is information\nthat not really seeing on the front,\n\n117\n00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.950\nbut I can see in the back.\n\n118\n00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.475\nAnd these authors, I have Lance and\nJustin, I added those,\n\n119\n00:06:35.475 --> 00:06:38.062\neven though I am Justin right now.\n\n120\n00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:43.310\nBut I went ahead and added that this\noriginally came from Lance’s computer,\n\n121\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.794\nand I added Justin on as\nan author of this document.\n\n122\n00:06:46.794 --> 00:06:49.500\nAt the very end,\nyou see Show All Properties.\n\n123\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.623\nWhen I click here,\n\n124\n00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:55.050\nit's just gonna give me a couple more\noptions within this view right here.\n\n125\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.294\nYou saw where it has a status,\nthe categories,\n\n126\n00:06:58.294 --> 00:07:00.578\nwhat template it is based off of.\n\n127\n00:07:00.578 --> 00:07:05.767\nRemember when we talked about templates\nin Word Advanced, all documents are based\n\n128\n00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:10.748\noff of normal, if you did not start it\nfrom any specific template to begin with.\n\n129\n00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:13.649\nAnd you can add comments and\nso on and so forth.\n\n130\n00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.478\nAll of this here, we have\nthe company name that I put in here.\n\n131\n00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:21.300\nBut there's even more that you could\nadd into the document properties.\n\n132\n00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.470\nAnd this, at the top,\nit's not just like a heading,\n\n133\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.900\nit's a drop down to where you can\nsee more advanced properties.\n\n134\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.420\nAnd then you can come into this dialogue\nbox and start filling it out from here,\n\n135\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.120\nso you might not wanna necessarily\nfill it out from the fields over in\n\n136\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.290\nthe information.\n\n137\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.490\nYou can go in to this dialogue box, and\nyou have the general information about\n\n138\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.050\nwhen it was created and\nmodified and things like that.\n\n139\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.850\nThe summary of where I typed\nin the author, the category,\n\n140\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.630\nthe comments, if I wanted to.\n\n141\n00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.360\nThe statistics is kinda fun.\n\n142\n00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.131\nI just wanna see, okay, well, how many\ncharacters that I use, how many words.\n\n143\n00:07:57.131 --> 00:07:59.756\nNow, we have all of this\nwithin the status bar, but\n\n144\n00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:02.151\nit's nice to have it in\none particular place.\n\n145\n00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:07.502\nThe number of revisions, wow, I've done\nthis I did 13 provisions on this document.\n\n146\n00:08:07.502 --> 00:08:08.297\nI didn't even know that.\n\n147\n00:08:08.297 --> 00:08:09.970\n[LAUGH] That's kinda fun.\n\n148\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.660\nAnd then you can also create\ncustom tags and custom metadata,\n\n149\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.020\ncustom properties that you want\nto include within this document.\n\n150\n00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.100\nAnd that's where you could go up and\ntag each one of your files.\n\n151\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.410\nNow I also have had people say that\nwhat they do is they have specific\n\n152\n00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.400\nworkflow that all their documents need.\n\n153\n00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.915\nThey always have to have the company name\nand the different tags or the title.\n\n154\n00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.651\nSo if these are things that,\nlike will always be the same for\n\n155\n00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:41.773\nevery single document you create,\nyou could always fill this in and\n\n156\n00:08:41.773 --> 00:08:44.263\nthen make your own template,\nyou can do File Save As.\n\n157\n00:08:44.263 --> 00:08:47.396\nAnd change this template and\nthen use that to create, and\n\n158\n00:08:47.396 --> 00:08:51.962\nmaybe thinking about if you have different\ncases, going back that legal example or\n\n159\n00:08:51.962 --> 00:08:54.526\ndifferent lawyers that you're working for.\n\n160\n00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:58.131\nAnd maybe you're a legal assistant so\nyou can make a template for\n\n161\n00:08:58.131 --> 00:09:02.510\neach Individual case or lawyer\nbecause maybe you're doing all that.\n\n162\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:07.711\nUse that templates episode which is\nback in the word advance series,\n\n163\n00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:12.284\ngo ahead and look at that episode and\ntie this into it if this is\n\n164\n00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:17.232\nsomething that appeals to you and\nit's something that you need.\n\n165\n00:09:17.232 --> 00:09:21.920\nSo that's where you find your\ndocument properties within your file.\n\n166\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:29.280\nMoving on to inspecting your document and\nit's right over here in the same place.\n\n167\n00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.820\nWe're in the backstage\nview we're in the info and\n\n168\n00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.315\nwe have the inspect documents\nbefore you doing anything,\n\n169\n00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:39.365\nmake sure that it has like, hey we\nchecked to see what type of properties.\n\n170\n00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:42.785\nDoes it have document properties,\ndoes it have hidden text?\n\n171\n00:09:42.785 --> 00:09:47.605\nWe talked about hidden text in\nour document security episode.\n\n172\n00:09:47.605 --> 00:09:51.410\nSo maybe I wanna make sure that\nthere's nothing going on in here.\n\n173\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.874\nSo we can inspect that document,\nand that's where accessibility and\n\n174\n00:09:54.874 --> 00:09:56.821\ncompatibility right in the same menu.\n\n175\n00:09:56.821 --> 00:09:58.504\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why they're in this episode.\n\n176\n00:09:58.504 --> 00:10:00.745\nSo we'll go with inspect the document.\n\n177\n00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:04.665\nDo you want to, okay so\nmake sure that you save the changes.\n\n178\n00:10:04.665 --> 00:10:09.326\nCuz it's making sure that it needs\nto scan my most recent information.\n\n179\n00:10:09.326 --> 00:10:10.690\nSo I'll say yes, that's fine.\n\n180\n00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.790\nAnd so\nyou can see it is going to check for\n\n181\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.870\ncomments, properties, embedded documents.\n\n182\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.250\nSo those are ones that maybe\nare like a file within a file.\n\n183\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:27.540\nNot linked necessarily, so they're just\nlike an Excel file inside of Word,\n\n184\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.810\nand then the macros and\nso on and so forth,\n\n185\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.388\nyou can the different list of information\nand the things that it's going to Inspect.\n\n186\n00:10:34.388 --> 00:10:38.395\nAll right let's go ahead and\ndo it, goes to my document.\n\n187\n00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:43.053\nOkay It found that there are document\nproperties there's an author there is\n\n188\n00:10:43.053 --> 00:10:47.563\nrelated people this is what part where\nI said like hey that can be sensitive\n\n189\n00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:52.462\ninformation that inside of our legal\norganization or whatever organisation.\n\n190\n00:10:52.462 --> 00:10:55.152\nWe're talking about like its good for\nus but\n\n191\n00:10:55.152 --> 00:10:59.380\nif I'm sending this out to the client or\na newspaper or what have you.\n\n192\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.844\nI don't want them to see\nall that information.\n\n193\n00:11:01.844 --> 00:11:04.752\nSo the cool thing is with\nthe document inspector,\n\n194\n00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:07.530\nyou can also just remove\nit all really quickly.\n\n195\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.490\nThink of like I had all those fields,\nI didn't want it to go back through and\n\n196\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.740\nedit and\ndelete every single word in every field.\n\n197\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.220\nYou have to move it right from here.\n\n198\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.672\nSo that's a nice thing to do.\n\n199\n00:11:16.672 --> 00:11:19.750\nAnd you can see it's gonna give\nyou a report of all the things.\n\n200\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.242\nLike, it did find headers and\nfooters and watermarks.\n\n201\n00:11:22.242 --> 00:11:24.600\nYeah, there is a watermark there.\n\n202\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.380\nSo I did that on purpose so you could see\nsome of the results that's gonna come in\n\n203\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.120\nwhen you do our document inspection.\n\n204\n00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.960\nAnd look, there was hidden text found.\n\n205\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.320\nI swear like, hey,\nwhat do you mean there's hidden tax?\n\n206\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.260\nIf you didn't know that hey if you\nturn the show character button on,\n\n207\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.500\nyou'll see any hidden text there and\n\n208\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.710\nit's cool that you could have the option\nto remove it all really quickly.\n\n209\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.130\nSo, a nice handy little\ndocuments inspector and\n\n210\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.930\nthen you can decide removing or not remove\nor just like, hey it's good to know.\n\n211\n00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.740\nThank you very much.\n\n212\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.130\nFor this example that's\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n213\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:05.030\nSo, always good to inspect the document,\nthe other thing when you're talk about\n\n214\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.840\nsending this off to somebody or\njust in its final form.\n\n215\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.550\nAccessibility, now accessibility\nis important especially if\n\n216\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:20.961\nyou're in a government organization, you\nknow the whole, I think it's section 508,\n\n217\n00:12:20.961 --> 00:12:24.840\nthere's certain guidelines and\nthere's rules now that you have to.\n\n218\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.310\nIt's like for different buildings.\n\n219\n00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.305\nLike you have to have wheelchair\naccessible bathrooms or you have to have\n\n220\n00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:35.439\nwheelchair ramps and the buttons that\nwill automatically open the doors.\n\n221\n00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:38.650\nSo like working at the university,\nthat was a huge thing.\n\n222\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:45.310\nWe always had to make sure that you were\nADA compliant American Disabilities act.\n\n223\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.410\nAnd that's where I think\nthe actual number is 508,\n\n224\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.490\n&gt;&gt; Something.\n\n225\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm, it's just coming out\nof my mouth like it's nothing so\n\n226\n00:12:52.365 --> 00:12:54.134\nI'm pretty sure it's that.\n\n227\n00:12:54.134 --> 00:12:56.713\nBut we'll double check.\n\n228\n00:12:56.713 --> 00:13:00.826\n&gt;&gt; Regardless there are checks in place\nto make sure that you might be in an area\n\n229\n00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:03.848\nthat requires you to do\nthese accessibility options.\n\n230\n00:13:03.848 --> 00:13:06.207\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so the nice thing is Word and\n\n231\n00:13:06.207 --> 00:13:10.812\nOffice altogether has really kind\nof beefed this whole section up.\n\n232\n00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:12.590\nAnd really, the documentation for it, so\n\n233\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:18.110\nit's nice that it's going to give us a lot\nof help in what we would need to do.\n\n234\n00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.910\nSo checking the accessibilities for,\nchecking the document for\n\n235\n00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.960\ncontent that people with disabilities\nmight find difficult to read, nice.\n\n236\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.284\nWe've talked about this in our images and\ngraphics section of\n\n237\n00:13:31.284 --> 00:13:36.035\nWord Advanced too about adding that\nalternate text to your images.\n\n238\n00:13:36.035 --> 00:13:37.893\nWell, what is alternate text?\n\n239\n00:13:37.893 --> 00:13:42.225\nThis is where the description of this\nimage because as cited individuals,\n\n240\n00:13:42.225 --> 00:13:46.966\nwe can see, that's a picture of a really\ncute bunny laying on a bed looking all\n\n241\n00:13:46.966 --> 00:13:48.155\nadorable, right?\n\n242\n00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:52.417\nWell I could put that description,\nso somebody that is non-sighted,\n\n243\n00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:55.825\nthis is being read to them\nthrough their screen readers,\n\n244\n00:13:55.825 --> 00:13:59.540\nthrough their software and\nhardware on their computer.\n\n245\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.260\nAnd so it's like, image of and\nthen you give a description.\n\n246\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:10.410\nSo this accessibility checker is telling\nme that I am missing alternative text\n\n247\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:16.120\non this particular picture or this\nparticular table, this particular diagram.\n\n248\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.520\nSo it's nice that is also becomes like\na clickable this is where you're having\n\n249\n00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.290\nsome issues here.\n\n250\n00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.830\nAnd the other cool thing is that\nbehind my head it's giving me some\n\n251\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:32.070\ninformation about what exactly\nthe problem you're having,\n\n252\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.610\nor the issue that this\naccessibility checker is finding.\n\n253\n00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:42.520\nSo it's nice to kind of learn as\nyou go as to what you need to do.\n\n254\n00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.830\nSo you can see that it's going\nthrough the alternative text.\n\n255\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.251\nAnother warning would be like\nI have blank rows in a table.\n\n256\n00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:54.242\nAnd so I click here, and it tells me\nblank tables cells can mislead a person\n\n257\n00:14:54.242 --> 00:14:59.770\nwith vision disability into thinking\nthere is nothing more in the table.\n\n258\n00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:00.410\nOkay think about that.\n\n259\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.680\nScreen reader, if it's reading across,\nif like, I see it's empty, it might kind\n\n260\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.330\nof throw it off and not understand that,\nno it's all still a part of the table.\n\n261\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.360\nAnd it goes along with the merged cells or\nsplit cells.\n\n262\n00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.790\nAnd so it's saying table should have\na simple structure that is easily\n\n263\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.990\nnavigated and understood by people\nwith disabilities, okay cool.\n\n264\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:29.472\nSo I really like all of that additional\ninformation that it is giving to me.\n\n265\n00:15:29.472 --> 00:15:33.945\nAnd then it also talks about\nhow the pictures are not\n\n266\n00:15:33.945 --> 00:15:38.938\nin-line with the text cuz,\nwe see that is related to this\n\n267\n00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:43.620\nparticular paragraph but\nnow this is where you know,\n\n268\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:49.467\nif you put all your graphs in line\nyou do lose some stylistic thing.\n\n269\n00:15:49.467 --> 00:15:50.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So for a lack of a better word,\n\n270\n00:15:50.763 --> 00:15:51.729\nI want it over there on the right.\n\n271\n00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:55.610\nI don't want it just as a big picture\nall in line in the text and so\n\n272\n00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.670\nthat might throw it off that way.\n\n273\n00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.131\nSo you have to kind of compromise,\nmaybe saving two different versions.\n\n274\n00:16:01.131 --> 00:16:06.536\nIf it's something that you have to have\na full accessible document that's where\n\n275\n00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:11.714\nyou do a Save As and then Change the\nlayout to where you're fully accessible.\n\n276\n00:16:11.714 --> 00:16:14.054\nAnd then the nice thing\ndown at the bottom,\n\n277\n00:16:14.054 --> 00:16:18.390\nthere is a link that says read more\nabout making documents accessible.\n\n278\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.076\nAnd it takes you out to\nthis website that again,\n\n279\n00:16:22.076 --> 00:16:27.330\ngives you more information about\nthe best practices, what to fix,\n\n280\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:33.045\nwhy to fix and then also where to find\nmore information on those specific,\n\n281\n00:16:33.045 --> 00:16:39.339\nthings that you would need to do to make\nyour document to be fully 88 compliant.\n\n282\n00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:41.570\nSo good, like that?\n\n283\n00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.010\nGood information about our\naccessibility checker.\n\n284\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:50.320\nThe last one that's in that little\nmenu over there in the backstage view,\n\n285\n00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.650\nover in our inspecting and checking for\nissues is check compatibility.\n\n286\n00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.287\nThis is where if I was going to\nbe saving this down to a .doc not\n\n287\n00:17:00.287 --> 00:17:05.370\na .docx so\nsomebody that would have 2003 or\n\n288\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:10.440\nolder Word, now I feel like this is,\nit can get further and further away.\n\n289\n00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:17.470\nI mean this is 2017 at the time of this\nrecording, 2002 was a long time ago.\n\n290\n00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.320\nBut I mean we still have\npeople on Windows 7.\n\n291\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.640\nOr god forbid Windows XP right?\n\n292\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.210\n&gt;&gt; There's a few hundred thousand XP\n\n293\n00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.730\nmachines still running around out in\nthe wild so, you've got to be prepared.\n\n294\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and right now this is July of 2017\nthere was just a whole nother report about\n\n295\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:39.800\nransomware, another attack On these\nvulnerable machines that are out there.\n\n296\n00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.682\nSo they're still there, like you said.\n\n297\n00:17:41.682 --> 00:17:43.693\n[LAUGH] And there's a certain percentage.\n\n298\n00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:48.020\nIt's kind of scary to think, like, really?\n\n299\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know of one.\n\n300\n00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.100\nNot personally, but\nthrough an intermediary, another person.\n\n301\n00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.439\nWho knows of a Windows NT4\nmachine still in use.\n\n302\n00:17:56.439 --> 00:17:57.241\n&gt;&gt; Wait, what?\n\n303\n00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:00.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is from like 1998?\n\n304\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.090\n&gt;&gt; Wow\n\n305\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.148\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n306\n00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.159\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, so\n\n307\n00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:09.771\nif it's still out there, so how many of\nthe percentage of people that you're going\n\n308\n00:18:09.771 --> 00:18:15.764\nto be working with still have Window,\nor, sorry, Word 2002 or 2010.\n\n309\n00:18:15.764 --> 00:18:16.918\nYou never know.\n\n310\n00:18:16.918 --> 00:18:18.319\nWait, 2000, 2010 is okay.\n\n311\n00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:19.080\n&gt;&gt; 2000.\n\n312\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.825\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] I'm\ngetting myself confused.\n\n313\n00:18:21.825 --> 00:18:25.420\nIt's like that long ago but\nhey you need to know.\n\n314\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.950\nSo doing a compatibility check,\nit's just gonna say what is wrong here.\n\n315\n00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.216\nSmart art,\nsmart art wasn't around until 2003.\n\n316\n00:18:34.216 --> 00:18:38.177\nSo it would say that it just gonna\nconvert into a single object,\n\n317\n00:18:38.177 --> 00:18:41.630\nthat can't be edited\n&gt;&gt; It will just be a picture.\n\n318\n00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:42.870\nThat's all it will be.\n\n319\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.650\nAnd then it also talks about\na Scalable Vector Graphic, SVGs.\n\n320\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.810\nWe're starting to get into file\nformats and everything when you talk\n\n321\n00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.598\nabout graphics, and this is where\nI need to keep my surface level.\n\n322\n00:18:54.598 --> 00:18:55.637\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You pull on it, Vonne,\n\n323\n00:18:55.637 --> 00:18:56.481\nkeep pulling on it.\n\n324\n00:18:56.481 --> 00:18:57.945\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, I know.\n\n325\n00:18:57.945 --> 00:18:59.617\nSo, where did this come from?\n\n326\n00:18:59.617 --> 00:19:05.110\nThis guy right over here, this tear drop,\nI added this from the icons.\n\n327\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.000\nAnd, you can go into insert\nicons if you have Office 365 and\n\n328\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.060\nyou have a subscription,\nyou can get access.\n\n329\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.580\nIt's almost like emojis.\n\n330\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.000\n&gt;&gt; You know those types of things\nwe have on all of our phones and\n\n331\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.980\nthey're just little pictures.\n\n332\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.370\nBut they save it in a SVG\nfile format to where.\n\n333\n00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.212\nIt is a scalable vector graphic.\n\n334\n00:19:23.212 --> 00:19:25.520\nYou have Raster information.\n\n335\n00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.830\nRaster is made of pixels,\nor Raster is pixel.\n\n336\n00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.030\nSo, JPEGs, PNGs, those things,\n\n337\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:37.900\nI feel like is general of that,\npictures are made of pixels,\n\n338\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.960\nnot everybody knows that, maybe so,\nI don't want to assume, you know.\n\n339\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.950\n&gt;&gt; You can hypothesize.\n\n340\n00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.430\n&gt;&gt; I can hypothesize,\nthat most people know\n\n341\n00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.430\nnowadays about pixels because the TV is\nin, movies and all that kinda fun stuff.\n\n342\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.070\nVector information, there's no pixels,\nit's just points and lines.\n\n343\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:59.240\nAnd that way it can be scalable, you can\nmake an SVG file really, really big.\n\n344\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.780\nAnd when you're working within the world\nof pixels however many pixels you\n\n345\n00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.490\nyou have, that's all you got, if you start\nmaking pictures bigger, they start getting\n\n346\n00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.830\nall not good looking, they get kinda fuzzy\n&gt;&gt; What we call pixellated [LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.932\n&gt;&gt; Yes, pixellated, yes, or fuzzy [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:20:14.932 --> 00:20:17.292\n&gt;&gt; Just blurry and not attractive.\n\n349\n00:20:17.292 --> 00:20:18.459\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n350\n00:20:18.459 --> 00:20:22.956\nSo, that's the whole idea here, is that,\n\n351\n00:20:22.956 --> 00:20:31.480\nit's an SVG is in this document that isn't\nsupported in earlier versions of Word.\n\n352\n00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.363\nSo it's really just saying, I'm going\nto convert this into a raster graph.\n\n353\n00:20:35.363 --> 00:20:40.336\nI'm going to convert it into a png and\nit's just going to become an image.\n\n354\n00:20:40.336 --> 00:20:45.280\nCool, and it does have these help buttons\nout here that will take you out onto\n\n355\n00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.226\nthe support documents and it will tell\nyou about these different things that\n\n356\n00:20:50.226 --> 00:20:54.730\nare supported and are not supported,\nso kind of good stuff.\n\n357\n00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.780\nAlways good to know at least\nwhere they are and what they do.\n\n358\n00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:02.660\nYou might not ever need to save it down\ninto a doc, so you might not need to do\n\n359\n00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.990\na compatibility checker but, like I said,\nknow where it's at, know what it does and\n\n360\n00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.670\nyou are a Word expert,\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n361\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Because you know about it.\n\n362\n00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.190\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nWe're talking about the minutia here.\n\n363\n00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.560\nThat's what makes us experts\nis knowing the little details\n\n364\n00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.320\nabout the program not just the basics,\nright.\n\n365\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.760\nSo we're moving into it.\n\n366\n00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.726\nRon we do thank you for\n\n367\n00:21:19.726 --> 00:21:22.641\nshowing us how to work with\nproperties inside of our documents.\n\n368\n00:21:22.641 --> 00:21:26.590\nSo that meta data that's floating around\nup there, God knows who's done what.\n\n369\n00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.793\nNow we can find out.\n\n370\n00:21:27.793 --> 00:21:31.888\nWhat that has happen and also\ncompatibility and human accessibility for\n\n371\n00:21:31.888 --> 00:21:34.180\nthose people don't have this ability.\n\n372\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.813\nSo, very cool stuff,\nbuilt inside of our Word Suite.\n\n373\n00:21:37.813 --> 00:21:39.920\nLooks like we are out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n374\n00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.290\nWe do thank you folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n375\n00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.640\nSigning off for Office ProTv.\n\n376\n00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.190\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n377\n00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n378\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.427\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n379\n00:21:47.427 --> 00:21:51.658\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It'll work.\n\n117\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.960\n&gt;&gt; It'll work.\n\n118\n00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.981\nSo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll troubleshoot\n\n119\n00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:24.612\nthat when we get there.\n\n120\n00:04:24.612 --> 00:04:26.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, perfect.\n\n121\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.170\nAnd so\nnow you can see that if I have here,\n\n122\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.090\nI can also click and\nadd a picture into it.\n\n123\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.520\nThese are all the different\nform fields that you can use.\n\n124\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.120\nIn Word to make a form.\n\n125\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.260\nSo it's a lot of fun.\n\n126\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.160\nAnd then also taking\nthis to another level.\n\n127\n00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.120\nLet's say hey, now that I've got this,\n\n128\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.700\nI want to be able to just start\na new one every single time.\n\n129\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.601\nInstead of like doing a file open.\n\n130\n00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:55.697\nIs like when I fill this all out, and I\nsave it, and then the next time I want to\n\n131\n00:04:55.697 --> 00:04:59.111\nmake a new one, I'm gonna have\nto change all the information.\n\n132\n00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.117\nSo, if I want to start a brand new one\nevery time, say there's a template, and\n\n133\n00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:05.750\nthen you can start it,\nand I already did this.\n\n134\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.030\nSo, if I go to File New and\ncome over here to Personal,\n\n135\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.014\nI have Christmas Cat template,\nit has, it's over here, sorry.\n\n136\n00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:15.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Christmas Cats Purchase Order.\n\n137\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.270\nTest and then it just starts a new one,\nand then I can keep on going.\n\n138\n00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.860\nSo, you can hopefully see right now how\nthis could be really, really handy for\n\n139\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.480\nthings that you need to do, that might\nbenefit you from doing it as a form.\n\n140\n00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.180\nSo cool stuff, like it.\n\n141\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.200\nWe'll go ahead and\nnot save the changes for any of this.\n\n142\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.010\nSo how do I build a form.\n\n143\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.570\n&gt;&gt; Really quickly, Ellen.\n\n144\n00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.920\nHow do we build a form?\n\n145\n00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.570\n&gt;&gt; Why don't I show you?\n\n146\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.110\nLet me demonstrate.\n\n147\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.050\nI have a file that I started\njust the information.\n\n148\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.780\nThere's no form fields on here.\n\n149\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.700\nSo, I did have to type out the text and\nthink about the spacing.\n\n150\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.800\nAnd if I turn on my show hide characters,\nI used a tab stop here and\n\n151\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.110\nI made some spaces with my, space bar for\nthose check boxes and a table.\n\n152\n00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.420\nSo, you do need to create all of the not\nform field part first, or as you go.\n\n153\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But for this demonstration,\n\n154\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.055\nI've already got it, so\n&gt;&gt; How do I get to my form fields?\n\n155\n00:06:15.055 --> 00:06:16.595\nYou do have to have the developer tab.\n\n156\n00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:19.525\nOkay we've covered this in some other\nepisodes but just in case you haven't\n\n157\n00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:24.575\nwatched them, this is where you do need to\nget into customizing your ribbon by going\n\n158\n00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:29.255\ninto your options and in the customize\nribbon you have to turn this on.\n\n159\n00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.270\nIt is not on by default.\n\n160\n00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.910\nIn Word, so you do have to activate\nthis particular tab on the ribbon.\n\n161\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.860\nAnd once you do, you have these\ndifferent form controls over here.\n\n162\n00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.770\nAnd if I hover over some of these and\nhopefully my computer\n\n163\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.070\ndoesn't freak out if I scroll in too much,\nso you have a rich text control.\n\n164\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.706\nThis is just a text box or\na text field, text area.\n\n165\n00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:56.090\nIt's just text\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n166\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.320\n&gt;&gt; It's a textbox.\n\n167\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.260\nNow why is this one, this is a plain text\nversus rich text, so this is going to\n\n168\n00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.650\nallow for formatting as opposed to just\ntext as text, no other things there.\n\n169\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.410\nThis is where you can add that picture.\n\n170\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.540\nThat was the thing where you clicked it\nand you can go ahead and get the picture.\n\n171\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.250\nYour quick parts in your\nBuilding Blocks Gallery Control.\n\n172\n00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.680\nYour Check Boxes.\n\n173\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.140\nThese two ones right here I'll tell\nthey're pretty much the exact same thing.\n\n174\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.810\nThey're just drop down boxes.\n\n175\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.910\nAnd there's a Date Picker and\nthen the other one.\n\n176\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.240\nThis is that Repeating Section\nthat I thought it was so exciting.\n\n177\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.470\nAnd then there's some other legacy\ntools in here that work on a different,\n\n178\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.140\njust, it's called a language.\n\n179\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.280\nThey work on ActiveX versus\nwhatever we've got going on,\n\n180\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.810\nwhich I think is just VVA, forms,\ndon't quote me on that one.\n\n181\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.500\nBut it's just, these are old, okay?\n\n182\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; These are our legacy tools.\n\n183\n00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.910\n&gt;&gt; Hence the term legacy\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so, but they do have things like\n\n184\n00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.056\nradio buttons that are not\npart of the choices from here.\n\n185\n00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:57.673\nSo I'm not saying like don't use them, but\n\n186\n00:07:57.673 --> 00:08:00.795\nwe're just gonna stick with\nthe ones that are here.\n\n187\n00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:04.049\nAnd then there is the Properties button\nthat is grayed out right now but\n\n188\n00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:05.938\nI’ll tell you where it comes into play.\n\n189\n00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:10.876\nBecause you wanna change the properties\nof your form fields to have\n\n190\n00:08:10.876 --> 00:08:13.090\nthings like a title or a name.\n\n191\n00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.220\nSo you just go ahead and\nstart adding in the fields.\n\n192\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.360\nSo if I want a date picker we click\non the date picker button and\n\n193\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.970\nthat’s it, perfect, it gave me this\nlittle drop down to choose a date.\n\n194\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.130\nPut my cursor where I want\nto have my text field.\n\n195\n00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.430\nAnd I choose insert a rich\ntext content controls.\n\n196\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.210\nAnd that's all you have to do,\nis really just go ahead and add them.\n\n197\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:41.197\nBut you do need to start adding in\nproperties to especially certain form\n\n198\n00:08:41.197 --> 00:08:45.640\nfields cuz otherwise you're not\ngonna get any of the choices.\n\n199\n00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.350\nRight now, you don't have to really put\na property on the text box, cuz you know,\n\n200\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.170\nyou're just gonna click and start typing.\n\n201\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:57.810\nLet me show you where the one that might\nbe an important one is in this department.\n\n202\n00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.010\nRemember we saw that drop-down, right,\nthe drop down where I had choices.\n\n203\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.600\nSo I'm gonna choose this,\nput my cursor, put in the combo box.\n\n204\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.530\nAnd if I just kept on going,\nI wouldn't have anything in there for\n\n205\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.020\npeople to choose.\n\n206\n00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.180\nSo with this form field selected,\nI go into properties, and\n\n207\n00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.960\nfrom properties, I have a title.\n\n208\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.140\nAnd that's where you can add, where it\nputs the little grey title on top of it.\n\n209\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.463\nSo I will say this is department.\n\n210\n00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:31.810\nAnd then down here, what do I want\nto add into my drop down box?\n\n211\n00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.630\nWell I don't want to choose an item so\nI'm gonna remove that.\n\n212\n00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.700\nAnd I'm gonna add another one.\n\n213\n00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.000\nSo I click on Add, Display Name.\n\n214\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.650\nI'm going to say, Kittens,\ncuz that was one of our display or\n\n215\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.750\nour departments within\nChristmas cast incorporated.\n\n216\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.880\nBut now your value could\nbe something different,\n\n217\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.970\nnow this gets into where we get\nan area of like forms in general.\n\n218\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.150\nIf you have form information\nthat goes into it,\n\n219\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.370\nwell then you want the data\nto come out of it.\n\n220\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.580\nNow, we're trying out word here so\nyou don't really kind of go pass that but\n\n221\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.960\nit could.\n\n222\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.470\nSo in a sense,\nif I have all of these different forms,\n\n223\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.422\nwell I want it stored somewhere.\n\n224\n00:10:09.422 --> 00:10:13.909\nI want it stored in some type\nof database or Excel file or\n\n225\n00:10:13.909 --> 00:10:17.590\nsome depository where it needs to go.\n\n226\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:23.060\nAnd while it shows a certain way\nto me as the user of the form but\n\n227\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.140\nme as the collector of the information,\n\n228\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.700\nthe value might actually be different\nthan what you are choosing.\n\n229\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.600\n&gt;&gt; So it could be, the display name is\nkitten, which is what I as the user would\n\n230\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.080\nsee, but the value might be\nan item number or something.\n\n231\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or like a set of numbers.\n\n232\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.430\nCuz you know,\nthe kitten department is 009.\n\n233\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n234\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.750\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n235\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.620\nSo that's the difference here.\n\n236\n00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.860\nI wouldn't probably, if you're gonna go\nthat level, you shouldn't be using Word.\n\n237\n00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.880\n&gt;&gt; No, it's database time at that point.\n\n238\n00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need a different product\nto get into collecting information and\n\n239\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.060\nwhere it's going to be going.\n\n240\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.800\nThis is really more for, it's kinda cool\nto have these drop down features for\n\n241\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.690\nus to be able to use.\n\n242\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.520\nI would just keep it the same.\n\n243\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.978\nWe will click add for another one and\n\n244\n00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:12.985\nwe will say we had kittens and\ncats and then we have bunnies.\n\n245\n00:11:12.985 --> 00:11:16.980\nLet's spell bunnies correctly, and\nthat's where we can go ahead and add them.\n\n246\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.027\nNow notice that you have some other\noptions in the properties of your\n\n247\n00:11:21.027 --> 00:11:22.522\ndifferent form fields.\n\n248\n00:11:22.522 --> 00:11:28.370\nYou can go into content cannot be deleted,\ncontents cannot be edited.\n\n249\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.550\nYou could also use, if you had styles\nthat you want the information that people\n\n250\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.425\nare choosing or\ninputting into that field you can set it.\n\n251\n00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:39.009\nBut by default, it's just gonna\nuse the normal style anyways.\n\n252\n00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:44.836\nBut if you do want to have it formatted,\nyou can choose these options in here for\n\n253\n00:11:44.836 --> 00:11:49.197\nthe text that goes in there and\nwhat color and everything.\n\n254\n00:11:49.197 --> 00:11:52.595\nWe're just gonna keep all the basics and\ndefaults for now.\n\n255\n00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:55.823\nBut you know where they're at so\nyou can go ahead and\n\n256\n00:11:55.823 --> 00:11:57.785\ngussy it up as much as you want.\n\n257\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.852\nAnd the item I want to put a form\nfield here or a text field.\n\n258\n00:12:03.852 --> 00:12:07.325\nAnd I'll come into the properties here\nto show you that in the text field,\n\n259\n00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:10.955\nnotice that the properties don't have\nthe same options that the drop down.\n\n260\n00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:12.976\nWell, because they are two\ndifferent types of form fields.\n\n261\n00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:17.810\nThey don't have the same options but\nI will put in a title.\n\n262\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.540\nAnd then click OK to see that's what you\nare seeing there is that it puts a little\n\n263\n00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.560\nname, a title on this particular field for\nyou.\n\n264\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.340\nIt's like one of those in good form,\neverything should have a title.\n\n265\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.320\nBut if you didn't put a title,\nit's not gonna break the bank.\n\n266\n00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.030\nCuz again, we're not going down into,\nwhere is this going into and\n\n267\n00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.210\npulling out the form information.\n\n268\n00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.950\nSo we'll add another text box.\n\n269\n00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:47.130\nThe signature, let's go ahead and\nadd a building block gallery.\n\n270\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.000\nWhen I chose this,\nthis is what was supposed to come up.\n\n271\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.460\nI'm not exactly sure why it was\nnot working in that other file.\n\n272\n00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:01.870\nBut I have it here to where it will\npull out from the building blocks I had.\n\n273\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:07.359\nThis is the one where remember I put like\nthe little hat on the things from bishop.\n\n274\n00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:08.304\n&gt;&gt; He's so cute.\n&gt;&gt; He is adorable.\n\n275\n00:13:08.304 --> 00:13:09.873\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n276\n00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:14.720\nyou can pick from those building blocks or\nthose different quick parts that you have,\n\n277\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.050\nso that could be really handy as\na form picker, chooser, thinger.\n\n278\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.942\nWow, yep, I went there.\n\n279\n00:13:20.942 --> 00:13:22.861\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I will spare you guys me trying\n\n301\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.010\nto find exactly where it's at.\n\n302\n00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.770\nBut you could change the font if you\nwanted to, if you wanted to go from\n\n303\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.140\nWebdings to Wingdings that's\nwhere it might be located.\n\n304\n00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.590\nBut it's right there since\nI've already used it.\n\n305\n00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:41.640\nI click OK, and now that can be my\nchecked symbol for that cute little guy.\n\n306\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.330\nAnd I would do the same thing for\neach one of them.\n\n307\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.340\nYou can copy and paste,\ntechnically you wanna try to keep the,\n\n308\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:53.830\nif it has a title you wanna keep\nthe title unique to each form field.\n\n309\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:58.470\nBut in real life with checkboxes,\nI said that like this isn't real life.\n\n310\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; When I said\nwhen you get into like coding this,\n\n311\n00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.840\nI'm thinking like HTML\ncoding of doing your forms.\n\n312\n00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.770\nCheck boxes, they need to be,\nthey have to have a separate name but\n\n313\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.180\nradio buttons you need to name the same.\n\n314\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.190\nThat way it has the either or choice.\n\n315\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.280\nCheck boxes is where I\ncould check all of these.\n\n316\n00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.094\nAnd that's where I could turn on new and\nrepeat and returning.\n\n317\n00:15:20.094 --> 00:15:24.850\nWhich kind of breaks the logic if you\nwant to say, for what you would be doing.\n\n318\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.970\nYou're either one or the other.\n\n319\n00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.322\nSo technically you should\nprobably use radio buttons.\n\n320\n00:15:29.322 --> 00:15:33.297\nAnd radio buttons are like a set, they're\nnamed the same so that it gets the,\n\n321\n00:15:33.297 --> 00:15:35.270\nif I choose one it turns off the other.\n\n322\n00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.290\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nI'm remembering my Visual Basics from\n\n323\n00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.370\ncollege and\nit was check boxes are options.\n\n324\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.880\nI want this, I don't want that.\n\n325\n00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.388\nWhereas radio buttons were I want this or\nI want that.\n\n326\n00:15:46.388 --> 00:15:48.000\nIt was one or the other, not and.\n\n327\n00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.544\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so in this level since,\nlike I said, we're using Word,\n\n328\n00:15:52.544 --> 00:15:56.930\nyou would just have to know,\ndon't check off both of them.\n\n329\n00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.218\nYou're gonna either do one or another.\n\n330\n00:15:58.218 --> 00:16:00.512\nAnd it's nice cuz it's just like click,\nkeep on going.\n\n331\n00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:03.170\nSo it's a kind of a cute little feature.\n\n332\n00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.900\nSo I will just add two more, even though\nI don't have them formatted as cats but\n\n333\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.600\njust for time sakes,\nwe went ahead and did that.\n\n334\n00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.447\nWonderful, so here we go.\n\n335\n00:16:12.447 --> 00:16:16.446\nI'm gonna do a file Save As just so\nI don't mess up this original,\n\n336\n00:16:16.446 --> 00:16:19.719\nI'll say order I'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay show,\n\n337\n00:16:19.719 --> 00:16:22.760\nwe're doing it on the show,\nfor the recording.\n\n338\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.790\nAnd there we go,\nI'm good to go and I've saved it.\n\n339\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.150\nAnd I can, you know, use this the way that\nwe had done in the beginning, where I'm\n\n340\n00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.820\nchoosing the check boxes and I'm choosing\nthe date dropdown and so on and so forth.\n\n341\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.589\nBut I did wanna point out one thing, and\n\n342\n00:16:36.589 --> 00:16:39.549\nI'm wondering if this is why my\nbuilding block wasn't working.\n\n343\n00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.910\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those like,\nit's going in the back.\n\n344\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.200\nI have two things going on in my head,\n\n345\n00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.280\nlike actually telling you guys what's\ngoing on and like, why didn't that work?\n\n346\n00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.019\nWhy didn't that work?\n\n347\n00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:51.050\n[LAUGH] I think this might be why.\n\n348\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.550\nBut we'll see.\n\n349\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.560\nYou could lock down your form.\n\n350\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.700\nWe talked about in the document security\nepisode that we were saying I don't want\n\n351\n00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.020\npeople to be able to change things.\n\n352\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.175\nIf I were making this for multiple people,\n\n353\n00:17:04.175 --> 00:17:07.325\nI don't want them to be able to\nchange Repeat and Returning.\n\n354\n00:17:07.325 --> 00:17:10.975\nThose are words that I have determined and\nyou are going to use this.\n\n355\n00:17:10.975 --> 00:17:14.117\nI don't want them to change the date or\nanything else in this document.\n\n356\n00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:18.435\nThe only thing they're allowed\nto do is fill in the form.\n\n357\n00:17:18.435 --> 00:17:23.575\nSo that's something, since I'm on\nthe Developer tab, I can go right into\n\n358\n00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:28.877\nRestrict Editing and I can tell them or\ntell this document really only allow,\n\n359\n00:17:28.877 --> 00:17:32.812\nnow check the box off,\ndrop down, filling in the forms.\n\n360\n00:17:32.812 --> 00:17:34.830\nThat's the only thing that people can do.\n\n361\n00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.510\nAnd so if I choose that and\nI start the enforcement, and say,\n\n362\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.740\nokay, here's the password for\nthe filling in form only.\n\n363\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.347\nNow notice I cannot even select the word\nday, I can't come into Christmas Cats,\n\n364\n00:17:49.347 --> 00:17:52.985\nI can't type in anything but\nthe items for the form.\n\n365\n00:17:52.985 --> 00:17:58.646\nAnd so that's where I'm wondering now if\nI come down here to my building blocks.\n\n366\n00:17:58.646 --> 00:18:00.006\n&gt;&gt; That turned it off [LAUGH].\n\n367\n00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:03.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it's going\noutside of just the form,\n\n368\n00:18:03.055 --> 00:18:08.370\nit's connecting into my building blocks\nand when I said you can only fill this in.\n\n369\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.438\nThen it cut that access off so\nyay okay good I answered a question.\n\n370\n00:18:11.438 --> 00:18:12.340\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n371\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.070\nbe careful about that if you're\nusing the building blocks chooser.\n\n372\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:20.076\nIf you're not using that then\nthe security, you won't have any issues\n\n373\n00:18:20.076 --> 00:18:23.301\nbecause I was able to pick pictures and\nso on and so forth.\n\n374\n00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:26.755\nSo wanted to tell you about\nthe restricting the editing and\n\n375\n00:18:26.755 --> 00:18:30.008\nthen I did mention about,\nhey, make this a template.\n\n376\n00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:35.240\nSo just to review on how to\ncreate a template for yourself.\n\n377\n00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.760\nYou do a File &gt; Save As,\nyou change this dropdown to a document or\n\n378\n00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.410\na Word template, so it's a D-O-T-X.\n\n379\n00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.110\nYou keep the default location.\n\n380\n00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.120\nSee where it says Custom Office Templates.\n\n381\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.320\nThat's the only thing you gotta\ndo is just change the type.\n\n382\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.265\nYou can make it whatever name you want, so\n\n383\n00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.920\nif you don't want a different\nname that's fine.\n\n384\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.150\nAnd then you'll see just\nlike I have one right here,\n\n385\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.380\nyou'll be able to then go to File New, do\nthat whole, like here's your new document.\n\n386\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.640\nAnd you don't have to change all\nthe information, so I really like Forms.\n\n387\n00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.156\nI think it can be really handy.\n\n388\n00:19:09.156 --> 00:19:11.235\nI hope you're doing the same thing of,\n\n389\n00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:14.707\nI'm gonna make everything a form\nnow to make my life a lot easier.\n\n390\n00:19:14.707 --> 00:19:15.646\nSo there you go.\n\n391\n00:19:15.646 --> 00:19:17.602\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, you sold me on them.\n\n392\n00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:19.490\nI've gotta have them in my life more and\n\n393\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.649\nmore every day now I can't live\nany longer without having forms.\n\n394\n00:19:22.649 --> 00:19:24.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now I know how to create one.\n\n395\n00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.995\nI can work with them,\nI can and customize them and\n\n396\n00:19:26.995 --> 00:19:30.579\neven lock them down to where I can't\nuse them as I expected to [LAUGH].\n\n397\n00:19:30.579 --> 00:19:32.527\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As it does happen to us from\n\n398\n00:19:32.527 --> 00:19:33.260\ntime to time.\n\n399\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.650\nSo go out there everyone, play around\nwith forms, create those templates so\n\n400\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:41.300\nthat you can recreate a brand spanking\nnew one every time you need it and\n\n401\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.440\nthere you go, enjoy.\n\n402\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.340\nVonne, we do thank you for teaching us\nhow to work with forms, create them,\n\n403\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.350\nand make templates as well, but\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n404\n00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.319\nFor Office Pro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n405\n00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:52.218\n&gt;&gt;

shortcuts.\n\n20\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.120\nI love keyboard shortcuts!\n\n21\n00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.410\nAnd we'll talk about how you can\nmake your own if you want to.\n\n22\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.760\nSo let's jump in to my computer.\n\n23\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.160\nWe're just gonna start\noff with Word by itself.\n\n24\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.040\nWe don't necessarily need to have\na document, but I am going to open up just\n\n25\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.790\na blank document because there are gonna\nbe some things that I want to review\n\n26\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.510\nin the options that does require\nyou having a document open.\n\n27\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.990\nI've also reset my customizations\n\n28\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.200\nin my environment to kind\nof start from scratch where\n\n29\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.910\nI've got the ribbon to where everything\nis the way it comes out of the box.\n\n30\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.633\nI have my insert and design, and it's not\nlike these shows that we've been doing\n\n31\n00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:40.949\nthis expert level, I had that developer\ntab cuz we talked about forms.\n\n32\n00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:44.177\nYou also might have seen and\nI didn't really point it out, but\n\n33\n00:01:44.177 --> 00:01:46.176\nyou might have seen a Von tab up there.\n\n34\n00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:51.311\nAnd that was because I was playing\naround to get to film this episode about\n\n35\n00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:56.800\ncustomizing that ribbon, because we go\nto our ribbon for certain commands.\n\n36\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.140\nLike if I want to insert an image,\nyou go to the Insert tab.\n\n37\n00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.580\nIf want to go to insert a table of\ncontents, you go over to the References\n\n38\n00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.358\ntab of the ribbon and\nthen you go ahead and find that command.\n\n39\n00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.505\nAll right, well that's all wonderful,\n\n40\n00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:15.673\nand of course we also have some of those\nmore button, those dialogue box launcher\n\n41\n00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:18.700\nbuttons that get into commands\nthat are not on the ribbon.\n\n42\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.161\nAnd then the Word Essentials show,\n\n43\n00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:25.106\nwe did talk about customizing\nthe Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n44\n00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:28.979\nAnd this is the bar that usually is\non the top from when you start but\n\n45\n00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.712\nI went ahead and put it onto\nthe bottom because I wanted it to show\n\n46\n00:02:32.712 --> 00:02:35.685\nbelow the ribbon and\nInstead of above the ribbon.\n\n47\n00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:39.873\nAnd so we've talked about the use\nof this particular toolbar to\n\n48\n00:02:39.873 --> 00:02:44.377\nwhere you could add as many commands\non this Quick Access Toolbar for\n\n49\n00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:46.605\nyou to be able to quickly access.\n\n50\n00:02:46.605 --> 00:02:47.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, hey\n\n51\n00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:47.972\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n52\n00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:49.566\n&gt;&gt; And that was actually not too circular.\n\n53\n00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.230\n&gt;&gt; No, that was very good.\n\n54\n00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.399\n&gt;&gt; Using that words that-\n&gt;&gt; Getting better everyday, Vonne,\n\n55\n00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.963\nbetter everyday.\n\n56\n00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:56.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that.\n\n57\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.980\nAnd the nice thing about adding the\ncommands to the Quick Access Toolbar is\n\n58\n00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.510\nthat I don't have to jump\n\n59\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.000\naround to the different tabs on my\nribbons to get to that command.\n\n60\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.670\nBecause the quick access\ntoolbar always stays put and\n\n61\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.320\nI don't have to jump, jump, jump.\n\n62\n00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.510\nOkay that's great, well, you could also\ncreate your own tab on the ribbon and\n\n63\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.390\nthen just stay on that ribbon\ninstead of the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n64\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.330\nSo you have multiple ways of\ncustomizing where you need to go.\n\n65\n00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.880\nCuz maybe you only use\nWord in a certain way and\n\n66\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.830\nyou always use this set of commands.\n\n67\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.330\nSo put them all in one place and\n\n68\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.450\nif you put them on the ribbon\nyou get bigger buttons.\n\n69\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.970\nSome more information on there\nthan just a specific one icon\n\n70\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.160\non your Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n71\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.100\nYou can choose which one you wanna\nutilize, or utilize both of them.\n\n72\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.710\nSo where do we go to customize?\n\n73\n00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.873\nWe always go back into our backstage\nview and we go into our options.\n\n74\n00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:03.961\nAnd from our options,\nthese two right here, customize ribbon,\n\n75\n00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:07.620\nand customize our Quick Access Toolbar so\nwe can use that.\n\n76\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.791\nI'm gonna concentrate here on\nthe customized ribbon because that's where\n\n77\n00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:12.450\nI wanna be.\n\n78\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.957\nSo we have over here, the different\ntypes of ribbons that we see and\n\n79\n00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.460\nthe tabs that we see on the ribbon.\n\n80\n00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.377\nWe see the Home tab and\nif I expand out this Home tab,\n\n81\n00:04:23.377 --> 00:04:25.757\nwe have each one of our groups.\n\n82\n00:04:25.757 --> 00:04:29.955\nBecause just like I'm on Mailings\nright here, but where it says Create,\n\n83\n00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:34.180\nStart Mail Merge, Write and\nInsert Fields, those are the group names.\n\n84\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.550\nAnd then you can see the kinda\nlittle lines that come through\n\n85\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.960\neach one of those groups.\n\n86\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.640\nAnd so this is where,\nif you wanted to modify an existing\n\n87\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.790\nribbon cuz maybe you don't\nwanna specific button on it.\n\n88\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.820\nYou can come in to these different parts.\n\n89\n00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.990\nMaybe you don't want to\nhave the Cut command,\n\n90\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.870\nI'm not sure if you'd\nreally want to do that.\n\n91\n00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.340\nOr maybe you wanna change it.\n\n92\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.332\nYou could do that.\n\n93\n00:04:57.332 --> 00:05:00.817\nBut a lot of the times you should probably\nreally just keep the defaults that\n\n94\n00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:02.290\nare already there.\n\n95\n00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.791\nAnd then just make your own customizations\nrather than kind of changing the existing.\n\n96\n00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:12.030\nBut just before we even get too far, its\none of those, what were we talking about,\n\n97\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.004\ngo and mess it up a little bit, right?\n\n98\n00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:18.100\nAnd then you should probably do like\na save as before you start, right?\n\n99\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.160\nWell in this sense there is like a backup\n\n100\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.220\nbutton in the sense that you\ncan reset anything that you do.\n\n101\n00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.970\n&gt;&gt; So you can go crazy with this and\nhave a grand old time and\n\n102\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.030\nmake it just the worst\ndisaster ever known to man.\n\n103\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.750\nAnd then when you realize I've\nmade the worst disaster known to\n\n104\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.301\nman-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:34.175\n&gt;&gt; You can just go back and\n\n106\n00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:36.204\nhit the reset button,\ntake it right back to center.\n\n107\n00:05:36.204 --> 00:05:38.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's setting back to the factory defaults.\n\n108\n00:05:38.757 --> 00:05:39.535\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n109\n00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:41.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a really nice feature.\n\n110\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.790\nNow notice here it's saying\nreset all customizations.\n\n111\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.872\nThe reason why it's saying that right\nnow is because I haven't customized\n\n112\n00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:50.378\nthe Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n113\n00:05:50.378 --> 00:05:54.523\nBut notice that, or actually sorry I\nhaven't customized the ribbon yet, so\n\n114\n00:05:54.523 --> 00:05:57.430\nnotice that the ribbon's all the same.\n\n115\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.612\nBut the ribbon versus all, this is\nwhere it's changing your ribbon and\n\n116\n00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:03.224\nthe Quick Access toolbar.\n\n117\n00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:08.129\nAnd it's the same way that if you go\nto the Quick Access Toolbar, it's gonna\n\n118\n00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.130\ngive you the option to just reset the\nQuick Access versus the ribbon and both.\n\n119\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.418\nSo that's the all or just this one part.\n\n120\n00:06:15.418 --> 00:06:20.960\nOkay, so I have all of these\ndefault tabs on the ribbon.\n\n121\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.120\nI want to add my own tab,\nI wanna call it Vaughn,\n\n122\n00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.940\nI wanna make my own groups, and I wanna\ngo ahead and fill up all this ribbon with\n\n123\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.890\nall the commands that I want to use, cuz\nI know that's the place that I'm gonna.\n\n124\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.191\nSo you'd click the new tab\nbutton down at the bottom and\n\n125\n00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:41.374\nwhen you click that in, notice it\nstarts with a new tab and a new group.\n\n126\n00:06:41.374 --> 00:06:44.715\nYou do have to have a group to put\nbuttons into or commands into,\n\n127\n00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:47.504\nif you don't have a group,\nit's not going to work.\n\n128\n00:06:47.504 --> 00:06:50.030\nSo, that's kind of why they\ngive you both at the same time.\n\n129\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.360\nThe new tab doesn't really\ndefine what I want it to be.\n\n130\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.340\nSo you need to make sure you just click on\nthe right place and then you rename it.\n\n131\n00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.907\nSo I've clicked on the New Tab,\nI click Rename and I can rename it.\n\n132\n00:07:01.907 --> 00:07:04.041\nFun, yay!\n\n133\n00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:05.113\nClick OK.\n\n134\n00:07:05.113 --> 00:07:06.955\nThere's my name tab.\n\n135\n00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:09.851\nI can rename the group.\n\n136\n00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:15.970\nLet's name it My Stuff,\nokay, and I will click OK.\n\n137\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.610\nYou can put little symbols\non here if you wanted to.\n\n138\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.360\nBut since it's a group name it's not\nreally gonna probably do much for me.\n\n139\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.896\nSo I'm just gonna click OK.\n\n140\n00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:25.302\nSo now I have the My Stuff.\n\n141\n00:07:25.302 --> 00:07:28.965\nNow I need to come over here\nto the left-hand side and\n\n142\n00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:33.638\njust find the different commands\nthat I want add into that ribbon.\n\n143\n00:07:33.638 --> 00:07:34.820\nNow here's the kicker.\n\n144\n00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.289\nYou have to make sure you know which tab\non the ribbon that you need that they live\n\n145\n00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:39.881\nin to be able to put it into your Tab.\n\n146\n00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:43.456\nSo [LAUGHS] still need to kinda\nknow where everything's at.\n\n147\n00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:47.492\nSo you can see I have the File tab,\nAll tabs, and then I can go through and\n\n148\n00:07:47.492 --> 00:07:49.394\nfind these different commands.\n\n149\n00:07:49.394 --> 00:07:52.235\nYou could also go through All Commands and\n\n150\n00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:56.484\nit will alphabetized every\nsingle command that is in here.\n\n151\n00:07:56.484 --> 00:07:57.474\nThere's bibliography.\n\n152\n00:07:57.474 --> 00:07:59.154\nI do love adding a bibliography.\n\n153\n00:07:59.154 --> 00:08:03.284\nSo maybe I will add that\nover into my button.\n\n154\n00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:05.496\nI can make an Insert Bookmark.\n\n155\n00:08:05.496 --> 00:08:07.738\nI'm just probably gonna stay in the Bs for\na little bit.\n\n156\n00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:10.870\nAll right, Change Case,\nthat's another one of my favorite buttons.\n\n157\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.360\nSo you can see that I can start\nadding every single command\n\n158\n00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.440\nthat I like to use right\ninto this particular group.\n\n159\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.236\nI can make another group if I wanted to.\n\n160\n00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:25.440\nI can rename this, and\nI can name it Bunny,\n\n161\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.006\ncuz that's just what came\nto my mind right now.\n\n162\n00:08:29.006 --> 00:08:32.500\n[LAUGH] And then add some more\nin there to bring to the front.\n\n163\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.160\nAnd let's go ahead and throw in\nthat colors in there just for fun.\n\n164\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.580\nI'm just randomly picking things.\n\n165\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.713\nNow I have my tab.\n\n166\n00:08:39.713 --> 00:08:43.641\nIf I click OK, just so\nwe can see this, there it is.\n\n167\n00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:44.890\nLook at that.\n\n168\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.570\nSo I've got my own custom tab on\nthe ribbon, right after the Home tab.\n\n169\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.830\nAnd, I don't know if I want\nit right next to Home.\n\n170\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.780\nMaybe I wanna put it\ntowards the end after View.\n\n171\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.429\nOkay, well, let's go back and change it.\n\n172\n00:08:58.429 --> 00:09:03.235\nWe'll go to File Options &gt; Customize\nribbon, because you have little what\n\n173\n00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:07.150\nI call bumpy buttons,\nwhere you can bump it up or bump it down.\n\n174\n00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.849\n&gt;&gt; Again,\nI love your naming conventions, Vonne.\n\n175\n00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:12.166\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are very descriptive, and yet\n\n176\n00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:13.310\nentertaining as well.\n\n177\n00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.684\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you,\n\n178\n00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:18.511\nI pride myself on making some really\nweird words that come out of my mouth and\n\n179\n00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:19.991\nI'm like, really, okay.\n\n180\n00:09:19.991 --> 00:09:21.740\n&gt;&gt; I like how you air quoted that.\n\n181\n00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.110\n[LAUGH] I pride myself.\n\n182\n00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n183\n00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.540\ncuz I'm not sure, is it pride or just-\n&gt;&gt; Should I be proud\n\n184\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.024\nof making strange things?\n\n185\n00:09:29.024 --> 00:09:31.709\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sometimes that connection from\n\n186\n00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:35.780\nthe brain to the mouth, where you're just\nlike, that even kind of got me weird.\n\n187\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.975\nLike what?\n&gt;&gt; What am I doing with it?\n\n188\n00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:40.599\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and sometimes it's like,\nnope, that's right on point.\n\n189\n00:09:40.599 --> 00:09:43.746\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n&gt;&gt; So I have the bumpy buttons, and\n\n190\n00:09:43.746 --> 00:09:49.160\nI can bump it down and I can change\nwhere it shows up in the ribbon.\n\n191\n00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.770\nAnd you could also do that\nwith the existing ones cuz\n\n192\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.860\nmaybe you don't want the Home\ntab to be in the front.\n\n193\n00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.590\nYou want it to be in the back, up to you.\n\n194\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.540\nYou could go ahead and change it to your\nheart's content and that's pretty cool.\n\n195\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.520\nWe also have that Reset button,\nlike I said.\n\n196\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.080\nNow I have reset all\nof our customizations.\n\n197\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.780\nAnd it says it's the only\nselected ribbon tab.\n\n198\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.540\nOkay, well, it's not giving me that,\nbut you know what?\n\n199\n00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.100\nHey, it's all good to like\nknow that we can reset it.\n\n200\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.250\nIt's not giving me either one right now.\n\n201\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.120\nBut a lot of times,\nif I'm gonna reset one thing,\n\n202\n00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.330\nI'm gonna reset it all\ncuz I probably need to.\n\n203\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.950\nThe other thing that you can do\nhere is the import and export.\n\n204\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.650\nOkay, so this is where say\nyou're changing computers, and\n\n205\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:37.330\nyou need to keep all of these changes, or\nmaybe you wanna send it to somebody else,\n\n206\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.010\nlike, hey, I've set this for\neverybody in the office.\n\n207\n00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.590\nSo I've gone through.\n\n208\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.724\nI'm giving this to you, and\nI want you to then import it.\n\n209\n00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:50.660\nAnd I tried this with Justin's import or\nJustin's changes.\n\n210\n00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.690\nI exported it, brought it into\nLance's computer, imported it, and\n\n211\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.040\nit worked flawlessly,\nso it was pretty fun.\n\n212\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.560\nAnd I just sent it through the email so\n\n213\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.020\nit's not like you have to\npackage it some specific way.\n\n214\n00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.350\nSo when you export this,\nit will export out as a,\n\n215\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.410\nI'll do all customizations for\nthe quick access toolbar and the ribbon.\n\n216\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:17.770\nAnd exported UI file,\nthat's the actual file extension.\n\n217\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.030\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty descriptive.\n\n218\n00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.830\nIf I was looking at an email\nthat I got from you and it said,\n\n219\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.800\nexported UI attached file, cool,\nthis is a customized ribbon stuff.\n\n220\n00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.850\n&gt;&gt; And UI, by the way,\nmeans user interface.\n\n221\n00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.370\nJust in case you're like,\nwhat is that, so.\n\n222\n00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and so I can name this.\n\n223\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.110\nI can save it anywhere.\n\n224\n00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.160\nI don't have to save it in any specific\nplace because it's a very specific\n\n225\n00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.880\nfile format that only Word\nwould be able to import this.\n\n226\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.270\nSo it's one of those things that\nthis whole system knows what it is.\n\n227\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.890\nSo you just save it, change the name\nto whatever you want, email it or\n\n228\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.891\nsend it to your co-workers.\n\n229\n00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:58.757\nNow you will have to tell them how to\nimport it, because now they would come\n\n230\n00:11:58.757 --> 00:12:03.640\nright back to this same dialog box and\nclick the import instead of export.\n\n231\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.520\nSo then they'll bring it\ninto their environment and\n\n232\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.830\nthey will go ahead and get everything.\n\n233\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.010\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n234\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.660\nNow some more customizations that\nwe can do besides the ribbon and\n\n235\n00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.850\nthe quick access toolbar\nwhere we could go ahead and\n\n236\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.360\nput all of those different commands\nback over onto the quick access toolbar.\n\n237\n00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.820\nLet's go back over to Customize ribbon.\n\n238\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.370\nIt's the keyboard shortcuts, yay!\n\n239\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.443\nI love that.\n\n240\n00:12:27.443 --> 00:12:32.164\n[LAUGH] So if I click Customize, cuz maybe\nthere is a command that you're always\n\n241\n00:12:32.164 --> 00:12:35.595\ndoing and you don't want even\nwant to go up to the ribbon or\n\n242\n00:12:35.595 --> 00:12:37.690\ngo up to the quick access tool bar.\n\n243\n00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.220\nI just want to throw on\na keyboard shortcut.\n\n244\n00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:46.280\nFor example, maybe Enter Picture,\nmaybe you're always doing that in Word and\n\n245\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.670\nyou would like to throw a command\nmaybe like Ctrl+P to Insert Picture.\n\n246\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.867\nWell, if anyone of you\nknow some shortcuts,\n\n247\n00:12:53.867 --> 00:12:55.250\nCtrl+P, do you know what that is?\n\n248\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.670\n&gt;&gt; Print?\n&gt;&gt; It is, yes.\n\n249\n00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.890\nSo you don't probably wanna\noverride some of the defaults,\n\n250\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.770\nbut it is your environment so\nyou if you wanted to, I guess you could.\n\n251\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.670\nBut I would probably stick away from,\n\n252\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.970\njust try to find keyboard shortcuts that\naren't already mapped to one of them.\n\n253\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.700\nAnd they'll actually tell you here.\n\n254\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.660\nSo you will have to find, over on\nthe left-hand side what category or\n\n255\n00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.180\ntab that you want to find\nthat particular command.\n\n256\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.290\nSo I went to the Insert tab,\n\n257\n00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:26.750\nand I will come over to\nInsert Picture because that's the one.\n\n258\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.660\nNow notice it says that there aren't\nany current keys assigned to this.\n\n259\n00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.070\nGoing back to that print.\n\n260\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.130\nLet's just really quickly\ngo to the File tab.\n\n261\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:40.566\nAnd we come over here\nto File Print Default.\n\n262\n00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:41.625\nThat's not the one.\n\n263\n00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:42.560\nWell, there's Save.\n\n264\n00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.035\nHow about we go with this one?\n\n265\n00:13:44.035 --> 00:13:45.960\n[LAUGH] So File Save, it's Ctrl+S.\n\n266\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.494\nSo it's telling you your current keys that\nthis particular command is mapped to.\n\n267\n00:13:51.494 --> 00:13:52.218\nAnd the Shift+F12.\n\n268\n00:13:52.218 --> 00:13:54.040\nI did know about that one.\n\n269\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.917\nThat does a save?\n\n270\n00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.554\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And if you do Shift+F12,\n\n271\n00:13:56.554 --> 00:13:57.354\nit saves as well?\n\n272\n00:13:57.354 --> 00:14:00.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, and\nsometimes just F12 by itself.\n\n273\n00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:05.615\n&gt;&gt; So if I wanted to remap that Ctrl+S,\nwell, I still have Shift+F12.\n\n274\n00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:10.248\nSo I could remap Ctrl+S, but that was\na little more convenient do that for\n\n275\n00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:11.670\nsomething else.\n\n276\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:12.224\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you totally could.\n\n277\n00:14:12.224 --> 00:14:13.091\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\n\n278\n00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:15.173\nyou can change it if you wanted to.\n\n279\n00:14:15.173 --> 00:14:18.134\nAlthough F12 will save as, I'm sorry.\n\n280\n00:14:18.134 --> 00:14:20.741\nAs soon as I said that,\nlike wait, is it save?\n\n281\n00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:22.210\nNo, it's save as.\n\n282\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.670\nAnd then I actually use that all the time,\nbut\n\n283\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.350\nof course on my first machine\nI don't have an F12 key, but\n\n284\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.000\nI love that one for File &gt; Save as,\nand so I could change that.\n\n285\n00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.299\n&gt;&gt; And that's where if you wanted to,\nyou could always add another keyboard\n\n286\n00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:41.515\nshortcut to File &gt; Save As, because\nI know that it is a Ctrl+Shift+S or\n\n287\n00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:43.473\na Cmd+Shift+S in-\n&gt;&gt; In Mac?\n\n288\n00:14:43.473 --> 00:14:44.320\n&gt;&gt; Mac.\n\n289\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.860\nSo it's something that\nI'm kind of used to.\n\n290\n00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.790\nSo if I click my cursor in the press\nnew keys, then you actually just\n\n291\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.500\nhold the Ctrl-Shift+S, and\nthen well, this is actually.\n\n292\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.460\nI remember, yes,\nbecause this always happens to me.\n\n293\n00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.783\nI do it and it throws up the style-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:14:57.783 --> 00:14:58.351\n&gt;&gt; Pane.\n\n295\n00:14:58.351 --> 00:15:01.340\nI was like, do I want to do that?\n\n296\n00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.760\nI could assign it.\n\n297\n00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.460\nAnd so now Ctrl+Shift+S is not\ngoing to be apply a style.\n\n298\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.000\nMan, why haven't I done this before?\n\n299\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.370\nBecause it's always gonna\nthrow that up there.\n\n300\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.188\nWhy don't I just go ahead and\nmap it to the one I want?\n\n301\n00:15:12.188 --> 00:15:13.091\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, good question, Vonne.\n\n302\n00:15:13.091 --> 00:15:13.888\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm so\n\n303\n00:15:13.888 --> 00:15:14.923\nglad I'm doing this episode for you guys.\n\n304\n00:15:14.923 --> 00:15:16.449\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was like,\n\n305\n00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:17.779\nI'm teaching myself right now.\n\n306\n00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:19.647\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I totally am, I'm like, wow.\n\n307\n00:15:19.647 --> 00:15:21.970\nWhy didn't you do this?\n\n308\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.535\nOkay, so\nnow I've assigned Ctrl+Shift+S to Save As.\n\n309\n00:15:26.535 --> 00:15:31.272\nAnd now we'll stop throwing up that Styles\npane because that's what I want it to do.\n\n310\n00:15:31.272 --> 00:15:32.150\nAwesome, okay.\n\n311\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.840\nSo you could see right there\nthat I have mapped this.\n\n312\n00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.570\nSo you could go into the Insert and\ngo into Insert Picture.\n\n313\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:44.963\nNow I do know this one Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S,\nbe like wow, really?\n\n314\n00:15:44.963 --> 00:15:49.346\nI map a lot of my own keyboard shortcuts\nin a lot of products and it's like if I\n\n315\n00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:53.815\ndo Alt+Ctrl+Shift in whatever, and\nI've gotten a little claw going on.\n\n316\n00:15:53.815 --> 00:15:54.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nit's like guitar chords, right?\n\n317\n00:15:54.895 --> 00:15:58.353\nYou remember these These\nmuscle memory things.\n\n318\n00:15:58.353 --> 00:16:00.649\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nyou know I used to play guitar as well so\n\n319\n00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:03.348\nits like, okay that's not too bad of-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can do that.\n\n320\n00:16:03.348 --> 00:16:05.828\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds like [SOUND] and\nthen I can just go ahead and-\n\n321\n00:16:05.828 --> 00:16:07.128\n&gt;&gt; Learn Word then play guitar.\n\n322\n00:16:07.128 --> 00:16:09.192\nThis is a one stop shopping ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n323\n00:16:09.192 --> 00:16:12.108\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so you just go ahead and\n\n324\n00:16:12.108 --> 00:16:16.530\nget your claw shortcut and\nthen I can assign it and now insert pic.\n\n325\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:22.290\nI actually wanted to do a Ctrl Alt+Shift,\nyeah, S is fine.\n\n326\n00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:26.305\nI think I was gonna P, but\nthe S is closer, so we'll just go with S.\n\n327\n00:16:26.305 --> 00:16:29.400\n[LAUGH] So cuz S, you get the idea here.\n\n328\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.910\nBut you can see if I did not want this,\nif I wanted to remove it,\n\n329\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.380\nI could say, no, I don't want that,\nlet me try again,\n\n330\n00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.630\nput the cursor in there,\nCtrl Alt+Shift+P, there we go.\n\n331\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.160\nAnd I will assign, cuz P for picture.\n\n332\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.350\nThere we go, now it actually matches.\n\n333\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.650\n[LAUGH].\n\n334\n00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.160\nAnd if you start messing with this and\n\n335\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.270\nyour keyboard shortcuts get a little\nweird, you can reset all as well.\n\n336\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.333\nAnd it is saving it in that normal\ntemplate, because all new documents start\n\n337\n00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:59.200\noff with that new template,\nand so we're good to go.\n\n338\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.221\nAnd all of your documents are based\noff of that, so most of the time,\n\n339\n00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.818\nunless you have your own template.\n\n340\n00:17:03.818 --> 00:17:04.830\nOkay, well there you go.\n\n341\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.200\nSo we could go ahead [LAUGH] and\nclose this.\n\n342\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.290\nBut that would be based off a normal too.\n\n343\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.070\nYou'll be okay.\n\n344\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.280\nSo we've got that and\nwe've got our keyboard shortcuts,\n\n345\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.280\nwe've got our customized ribbons.\n\n346\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.750\nAnd that's pretty great how we\ncan start customizing everything.\n\n347\n00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.428\nI did want take this a few minutes to\ngo through some of these other word\n\n348\n00:17:22.428 --> 00:17:26.556\noptions because this has come\nup in a couple of our episodes.\n\n349\n00:17:26.556 --> 00:17:28.706\nThere were some, the hidden text.\n\n350\n00:17:28.706 --> 00:17:29.763\nRemember when we were doing dock and\nsecurity?\n\n351\n00:17:29.763 --> 00:17:33.865\nI'm like, why is it not hiding,\nwhy hasn't it, wait.\n\n352\n00:17:33.865 --> 00:17:38.680\nCuz this has happened to me\nquite a few times where there is\n\n353\n00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:43.700\nsomething that has gotten turned on\nsome how, I don't know how I did it.\n\n354\n00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:50.400\nI don't know if I hit certain amount of\nkeys that was a shortcut to showing this.\n\n355\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.320\nI'm kinda hypothesizing on that\none because I don't really\n\n356\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.700\nknow that's how it happened but\nyou know its one of those,\n\n357\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.260\nstranger things can happen\nin these environments.\n\n358\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.434\nBe like, I have no idea how it got there.\n\n359\n00:18:02.434 --> 00:18:03.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n360\n00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.633\nits my job to learn how to fix it back.\n\n361\n00:18:05.633 --> 00:18:07.670\nAll right, so just a couple of them.\n\n362\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.418\nNow the other thing I wanted to\npoint out in these Word options is\n\n363\n00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:16.716\nthat this is very much dependent\non your version of Word,\n\n364\n00:18:16.716 --> 00:18:21.305\nwhat update level you're at\nif you're on an Office 365.\n\n365\n00:18:21.305 --> 00:18:23.859\nIf you're not on an Office 365.\n\n366\n00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:27.757\nSo if you come in to your General tab or\nyour General section of your Word options\n\n367\n00:18:27.757 --> 00:18:32.880\nand you start scrolling there and like,\nI don't have Office Intelligent Services.\n\n368\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.270\nWell if you don't have that, then\nthat's because your version of Word or\n\n369\n00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.490\nsubscription doesn't allow that.\n\n370\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.490\nAnd that's where, also coming back here,\nlet me close this for a second and\n\n371\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.280\ncoming back over into our account.\n\n372\n00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.147\nI've probably pointed this out a few\ntimes throughout these episodes and\n\n373\n00:18:49.147 --> 00:18:52.637\nalso throughout other products,\nwhether we were in PowerPoint or\n\n374\n00:18:52.637 --> 00:18:55.564\nExcel is that right now,\nat the time of this recording,\n\n375\n00:18:55.564 --> 00:18:59.895\nI'm on version 1706 with this but,\nyou know what, that just got updated.\n\n376\n00:18:59.895 --> 00:19:06.622\nI was on 820, wow, okay, see even in the\nsequence of the show I have a new version,\n\n377\n00:19:06.622 --> 00:19:11.760\nI have a new build number that was\nhigher than the one that I had just\n\n378\n00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.390\nyesterday when I checked this before\nwe started filming this episode.\n\n379\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.379\nWow, [LAUGH] that's kind of interesting.\n\n380\n00:19:19.379 --> 00:19:23.020\nSo you can see that I am\non Office Pro Plus, and so\n\n381\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.420\neverything is a little bit different.\n\n382\n00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.510\nI even went into, this is when we were\ntalking about adding alt text for images.\n\n383\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.940\nRemember I had to like, I don't think\nyou were my host at that point,\n\n384\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.740\nwhere it does this automatically but\nit was being really weird and\n\n385\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.940\nit was crashing Word all the time.\n\n386\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.660\nAnd i went over and my co worker Nate,\nI'm like, let me see your computer.\n\n387\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.397\nAnd he's like, I don't even.\n\n388\n00:19:44.397 --> 00:19:47.971\nWe have the same build number,\nsame Office 365 Pro Plus,\n\n389\n00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:51.700\nbut he didn't even have\nIntelligent Services in his options.\n\n390\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.764\nI'm like, really?\n\n391\n00:19:53.764 --> 00:19:57.145\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that was one of those weird things.\n\n392\n00:19:57.145 --> 00:20:01.565\nI'm like, well wait,\nwe're like on an E5 subscription and\n\n393\n00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:07.535\neverybody else in the office is on a small\nbusiness, or a business pro plus plan.\n\n394\n00:20:07.535 --> 00:20:12.455\nSo again hypothesizing, well maybe it's\nbecause I'm on an enterprise license and\n\n395\n00:20:12.455 --> 00:20:14.630\nthey're not on an enterprise license.\n\n396\n00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:19.600\nIt's going to be those little things that\nyou might not be able to explain, but\n\n397\n00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.400\nthere are so\n\n398\n00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.330\nmany different versions of Word that\nsome of your options will be different.\n\n399\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.600\nSo just take that at night.\n\n400\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.160\nI honestly do not remember\nease of access being\n\n401\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.900\na actual category in the Word options.\n\n402\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.868\nUntil I started like,\nI don't remember that being there but\n\n403\n00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:38.391\nthat can happen a lot of times.\n\n404\n00:20:38.391 --> 00:20:41.395\nWhere it's been there a long\ntime I just didn't point it out.\n\n405\n00:20:41.395 --> 00:20:46.296\nBut again just to put down that point\nof it might be different for you and\n\n406\n00:20:46.296 --> 00:20:48.219\nthings can change around.\n\n407\n00:20:48.219 --> 00:20:52.851\nBut there's like in the display this\nwas the one that in that episode\n\n408\n00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.240\nwe saw hidden text.\n\n409\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.470\nThis was checked on it says, always show\nthese formatting marks on the screen.\n\n410\n00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.600\nAlways, meaning if you\ndo the show hide and\n\n411\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.530\nyou're hiding characters\nit's still gonna show that.\n\n412\n00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.690\nThe show all formatting marks and\nthat's where, this happened on my Mac,\n\n413\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.670\nI think I've said this a couple of times\nin some episodes where it just was on and\n\n414\n00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.220\nI'm like I could not turn it off.\n\n415\n00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.907\nI was just like, what's going on.\n\n416\n00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:19.239\n[SOUND] This has happened where maybe\nit's printing your document properties.\n\n417\n00:21:19.239 --> 00:21:20.939\nMaybe it's printing your hidden text,\n\n418\n00:21:20.939 --> 00:21:23.590\nwhere you thought it wasn't\nsupposed to do that.\n\n419\n00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:29.490\nSo check these things, if there are some\nweird things going on in Word, check this.\n\n420\n00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.900\nYou might have to go through it,\n\n421\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:35.330\nlike there was one in the advanced,\nokay, this one.\n\n422\n00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.320\nUse Ctrl+click to follow hyperlinks.\n\n423\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.142\nWe've been doing that throughout the show.\n\n424\n00:21:39.142 --> 00:21:40.973\nWhat if that was unchecked by somehow?\n\n425\n00:21:40.973 --> 00:21:42.963\nAnd you're like,\nmy hyperlinks do not work.\n\n426\n00:21:42.963 --> 00:21:46.008\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It might have turned off\n\n427\n00:21:46.008 --> 00:21:47.670\nsomehow, okay.\n\n428\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:53.040\nThere was another one in the show\ndocument content down here.\n\n429\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.580\nOkay, this one.\n\n430\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.840\nSee what it says, Show Bookmarks?\n\n431\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.940\nIn the bookmarks episode, I said well\nthere's not really anywhere where you can\n\n432\n00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.390\nshow where the bookmarks live.\n\n433\n00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.203\nWell then I found this,\nI'm like, yeah you can.\n\n434\n00:22:05.203 --> 00:22:06.036\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n435\n00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:10.430\nwhat they do is they indicate\nit with these little gray boxes.\n\n436\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.100\nAnd you can see where the bookmarks live.\n\n437\n00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.870\nI still think doing to go to and\nthen just having them all listed and\n\n438\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.930\nthen being able to navigate to\nthem is a lot easier because\n\n439\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:24.440\nyou're gonna have to really search for\nthis tiny little gray lines.\n\n440\n00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.260\nWhere it's either look like a little\ngray I beam or if you're doing a range\n\n441\n00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.510\nit's like an open bracket, close\nbracket to where this is the bookmark.\n\n442\n00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.550\nBut there's no names it's just\nthis weird gray character.\n\n443\n00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.240\nAnd those are some things that\nhappens from time to time.\n\n444\n00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.610\nAnd in the advance down here,\nthis is one that happened to somebody\n\n445\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.300\nwhere see where it says it's printing\nthe field codes instead of their values.\n\n446\n00:22:51.444 --> 00:22:55.454\nOkay, the field codes where\nwe were doing page numbers or\n\n447\n00:22:55.454 --> 00:23:01.817\nanything that we did with like, footnotes,\nend notes, or document fields altogether.\n\n448\n00:23:01.817 --> 00:23:04.680\nIf it's turned on,\nthen that's where it's gonna print.\n\n449\n00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.960\nIt's not gonna tab what's actually\nin there, just gonna have the code.\n\n450\n00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.397\nThat doesn't do anything for me.\n\n451\n00:23:10.397 --> 00:23:14.690\n[LAUGH] But again,\nstranger things have happened.\n\n452\n00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.370\nSo really, really scan through the,\n\n453\n00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:22.650\nespecially the advanced section of your\noptions and all of these different\n\n454\n00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:28.452\nplaces to where there might be some kind\nof weird things, it's probably in here.\n\n455\n00:23:28.452 --> 00:23:31.223\nI say probably because there's\nalways that time where it's like-\n\n456\n00:23:31.223 --> 00:23:31.917\n&gt;&gt; It's not in there.\n\n457\n00:23:31.917 --> 00:23:33.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nope,\n\n458\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.787\nand you're gonna just scour the internet\nfor a couple of hours Until hopefully you\n\n459\n00:23:37.787 --> 00:23:41.570\nfind some obscure message board\nthat finally has that one thing.\n\n460\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.509\nAnd then you don't even\nknow how to search for it.\n\n461\n00:23:43.509 --> 00:23:47.085\nIt's like what do I even type in\nto try to explain what this is?\n\n462\n00:23:47.085 --> 00:23:47.693\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n463\n00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:50.370\n&gt;&gt; So you type this really long sentence\nthen you get some really weird results.\n\n464\n00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:54.993\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, in IT one of the things\nI've learned to speak very noncommittally,\n\n465\n00:23:54.993 --> 00:23:55.802\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n466\n00:23:55.802 --> 00:24:00.260\nBecause as soon as you say, I guarantee\nit's gonna be right there, it's not there.\n\n467\n00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.040\nEvery time, it will get you every time.\n\n468\n00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.138\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly and\nduring those searching it's like, okay.\n\n469\n00:24:05.138 --> 00:24:09.030\nYou say, missing or not showing or\nyou find the one word,\n\n470\n00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.088\nit's like well I would not\nhave explained it that way,\n\n471\n00:24:13.088 --> 00:24:16.520\nbut yes that's exactly what I'm trying to-\n&gt;&gt; We\n\n472\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.150\nwould a series on how to Google search,\nright.\n\n473\n00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.810\nI'm kidding you not cuz very powerful.\n\n474\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.570\nGoogle has lots of ways in which you can\nmanipulate the way you are searching.\n\n475\n00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:30.760\nAnd being able to search out the exact\ncorrect thing, use it like a scalpel and\n\n476\n00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.130\nfind what exactly what you're looking for\nis a skill, and it's a good one to have.\n\n477\n00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.386\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI have also note just a few of them,\n\n478\n00:24:37.386 --> 00:24:41.911\nlike always type in Word 2016 cuz I\nhave found stuff and its like Word 2000.\n\n479\n00:24:41.911 --> 00:24:44.628\nAnd it's like, well that,\nwe're way past that.\n\n480\n00:24:44.628 --> 00:24:46.752\n&gt;&gt; Well then you got to put\nquotations around it so\n\n481\n00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:49.100\nthat it groups Word in 2016 together,\nright?\n\n482\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.819\nBecause you'll get a document about\nWord that was published in 2016 but\n\n483\n00:24:54.819 --> 00:24:56.974\nit's about Word 2000.\n\n484\n00:24:56.974 --> 00:24:57.625\nAnd so, who cares?\n\n485\n00:24:57.625 --> 00:24:58.640\n&gt;&gt; And you just reminded me.\n\n486\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.360\nI was like, wow, yeah,\nof course, the quotes.\n\n487\n00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.387\nI forgot about the quotes.\n\n488\n00:25:02.387 --> 00:25:05.691\n[LAUGH] So thank you, you've just\ntaught me something or reminded me,\n\n489\n00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:06.700\nI'm like, yeah.\n\n490\n00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.270\nThat would totally help me.\n\n491\n00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.230\nSo that's awesome, so.\n\n492\n00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:14.060\nAnd that's pretty much everything I wanted\nto go over with customizing interface.\n\n493\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.580\nThose Word options, there's a vast\narray of them and there's so\n\n494\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.650\nmany different ways that you can change\nyour ribbons and change your quick access\n\n495\n00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:27.110\ntoolbar to making your environment work\nas efficiently as you want it to work.\n\n496\n00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.550\nAnd so that's where everybody is different\nand you can be your own special unicorn.\n\n497\n00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Very cool Vonne, I kinda feel\nlike you've turned us to math scientist\n\n498\n00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:38.790\nwho can now manipulate the DNA\nstructure of Word to do things that we\n\n499\n00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.670\nwant to do that isn't typically\nmeant to do out of the box anyway.\n\n500\n00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:44.230\n&gt;&gt; I like that [LAUGH].\n\n501\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they've given us the power and\nnow we can go in and mess with it and\n\n502\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.890\ntotally hose it up.\n\n503\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.034\nIt'll be a lot of fun, enjoy.\n\n504\n00:25:49.034 --> 00:25:51.840\n[LAUGH] That being said, Vonne,\nwe do thank you for stopping by.\n\n505\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.290\nWe thank our audience for watching, but\nit is that time for us to sign off.\n\n506\n00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.560\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n507\n00:25:57.560 -->
