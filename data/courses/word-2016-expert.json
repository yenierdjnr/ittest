name is Von Smith, and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:18.320\nwe're going to be reviewing what we\nare doing in our Word 2016 Expert Series.\n\n5\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.986\nSo we're gonna be talking about,\nwell, what are we gonna be talking\n\n6\n00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:25.670\nabout in this series, and\nwhat episodes are we going to be covering?\n\n7\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.703\nWho is our target audience, what should\nyou know before you get started?\n\n8\n00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:34.289\nAnd any other extra information and\ntidbits that I have for you.\n\n9\n00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.470\nSo topics to be covered,\nsome of my favorites in all of Word.\n\n10\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.419\nWell, actually a lot of\nthem are my favorites,\n\n11\n00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:43.830\nI think I said that about every\nsingle one of these things.\n\n12\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.184\nBut long document creation, you have maybe\nmore than 100 pages, maybe 50 pages.\n\n13\n00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:54.162\nSo, there are things you can do with\ncreating a long document, if you really,\n\n14\n00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.770\nreally help,\nthat Word is really good at it.\n\n15\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.935\nSo, we're gonna be talking about\nbookmarks and cross-references.\n\n16\n00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:04.582\nThe things you see in your page that says,\nsee page so on and so forth.\n\n17\n00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:08.166\n[LAUGH] Well, you could go ahead and\nadd that right from within Word with\n\n18\n00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.525\na cross-reference, and\ncreate hyperlinks, super powerful.\n\n19\n00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:15.015\nWe also are going to be generating\na table of contents, and\n\n20\n00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.090\nthen an index that goes in the front and\nback of your book.\n\n21\n00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380\nTable of Contents, really handy and really\neasy, just gotta use those styles and\n\n22\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.110\nuse those heading levels.\n\n23\n00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.350\nAnd the index is just as easy,\nwith just a little bit more work\n\n24\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.530\nwith marking up your entries and\ngenerating that index.\n\n25\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.160\nThe nice thing is, all of these things,\nwhen you start modifying, you can update\n\n26\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.490\nthem really easily, by just updating\nthe fields from this generated content.\n\n27\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.970\nWe'll also be adding footnotes and\nendnotes,\n\n28\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.040\nthose things that I used to struggle\nwith when I was writing term papers.\n\n29\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.145\nAnd those different things in school where\nyou had to get the numbers just right.\n\n30\n00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.820\nWord it makes it so much easier, and\n\n31\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.690\nthen on that same note, generating\na bibliography and citing your works.\n\n32\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.600\nMan, when this came into Word,\nit was of those,\n\n33\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.920\nI really wished they had this when I was\nin high school and writing these papers.\n\n34\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.376\nIt would take those nights\nthat I spent all night crying,\n\n35\n00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:13.192\nbecause I couldn't get the typewriter or\nwhatever to work, or\n\n36\n00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:16.166\nmaybe even if it's writing on pen and\npaper.\n\n37\n00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.281\nGoodness gracious, that was a lot of fun.\n\n38\n00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:21.896\nWe're also gonna be talking\nabout master documents, and\n\n39\n00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:26.027\nhow you can create one big document\nwith little subdocuments, and\n\n40\n00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:30.619\nhow they're all connected, so\nit's a really powerful episode as well.\n\n41\n00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.702\nCollaborating, something I\nlove to do with people, so\n\n42\n00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:37.977\nif you work with multiple people on\nrevisions and editing of your documents.\n\n43\n00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:42.420\nHow to implement tracked changes is\ngoing to be really helpful for you.\n\n44\n00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.680\nHow to combine all of those\ntracked changes together, and\n\n45\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.100\nto be able to accept or\n\n46\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.290\nreject some of those changes that people\nhave made will also be part of that.\n\n47\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.450\nWe're gonna be talking about adding\ncomments into your documents, and\n\n48\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.770\nhow you can use those and\nhow to accept or reject, or\n\n49\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.740\ntalk within those comments back and\nforth with your collaborators.\n\n50\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.880\nWe'll also be discussing how you\ncan collaborate in real time online\n\n51\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.075\nthrough Office 365,\nif you have have that capability, and\n\n52\n00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.305\nyou have an Office 365 subscription.\n\n53\n00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:19.365\nAnd they've really come a long way in\nhow you can collaborate in the cloud\n\n54\n00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.045\nto where it's a really, really helpful and\n\n55\n00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:27.855\nefficient way to talk to your different\npeople in where you are working with.\n\n56\n00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:32.125\nSecurity and document properties, another\narea that's really great to know about.\n\n57\n00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.830\nOf all that hidden information\ninto your documents,\n\n58\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.390\nin the document properties, that metadata,\nand how we can use that efficiently.\n\n59\n00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.930\nAnd then document security,\nhow do I make this a true read only file?\n\n60\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.486\nHow do I allow people to\nonly fill in forms and\n\n61\n00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:50.183\nother different types\nof document security,\n\n62\n00:03:50.183 --> 00:03:55.040\nwith adding digital signatures and adding\npasswords, to protect that document?\n\n63\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.467\nAnd then we'll also throw\nin some additional topics,\n\n64\n00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:59.180\nthat's where I put in the forms.\n\n65\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.390\nSomething that Word can do,\nit's actually pretty simple\n\n66\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.020\nonce you know where you can actually find\nthe form fields in that developer tab.\n\n67\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.910\nAnd a few of the other additional topics\nthat we'll be adding throughout time.\n\n68\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.860\nWho is this product, what is this\nshow meant for, who is this for?\n\n69\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.215\nWe have all Office users, now,\nI have Office in capital letter because it\n\n70\n00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:24.162\ndoesn't mean that you're physically\nin an office environment.\n\n71\n00:04:24.162 --> 00:04:28.919\nYou could be an office of one,\nyou could be a school or university, so\n\n72\n00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.678\nit's office with a capital, as in the\nproducts, you are using Microsoft Office.\n\n73\n00:04:34.678 --> 00:04:39.670\nAnd Word, of course, is its flagship\nproduct that many people use.\n\n74\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.310\nAnd I've thrown this,\nintermediate to advanced Word users.\n\n75\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.126\nSo you will need to have a pretty\nsubstantial amount of information or\n\n76\n00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:51.795\nknowledge about Word.\n\n77\n00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:55.110\nNow I've changed this from foundational,\n\n78\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.600\nwhen we did our advanced overview,\nI went to substantial.\n\n79\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.000\nSo, you need to be comfortable\nwithin Word, pretty comfortable,\n\n80\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.570\nto when you know all about styles.\n\n81\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.770\nYou know about sections and\npage layouts, and\n\n82\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.660\nyou know where everything\nis on the ribbon.\n\n83\n00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.240\nSo, some of those things I\nmight start glossing over,\n\n84\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240\nlike selecting ranges of text.\n\n85\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.328\nIt should be, yeah, I know how to do that,\nI know what a style is,\n\n86\n00:05:20.328 --> 00:05:21.370\nI know how to modify it.\n\n87\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.220\nI know what you're talking about when I\ngo into the modify styles dialog box,\n\n88\n00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.820\nso that's why I threw\nthis up to a substantial.\n\n89\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.365\nAnd of course, the Windows operating\nsystem, you do need to know how to\n\n90\n00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:38.700\nwork within Windows, and get to your File\nExplorer, and different things like that.\n\n91\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.128\nAnd, of course, always having familiarity\nwith other Office products is always\n\n92\n00:05:43.128 --> 00:05:46.401\nhelpful, because the options\nare always in the same place,\n\n93\n00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:48.541\nno matter you're using Word or Excel.\n\n94\n00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.628\nSo you're familiar with that and\nyou know where your ribbons are and\n\n95\n00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:53.870\nyou're familiar with that interface.\n\n96\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.210\nEach product does something different, but\n\n97\n00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.360\nsome of those features will overlap\nfrom one product to another.\n\n98\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.242\nAnd then my extras, there's always going\nto be other options on how to do things.\n\n99\n00:06:06.242 --> 00:06:09.634\nI can already tell you I remember\nin the footnotes episode that I\n\n100\n00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:13.987\nwas showing you a little button up on the\nribbon of how you can jump back and forth.\n\n101\n00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:18.360\nWell, you could also right click on it,\nand I actually just didn't show it to\n\n102\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.479\nyou that way,\nI just decided to go through the ribbon.\n\n103\n00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.586\nSo there's always that right clicking or\n\n104\n00:06:23.586 --> 00:06:27.211\nthere's the same button on another\ntab that maybe I haven't covered.\n\n105\n00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:32.459\nSo there's always gonna to be multiple\nways to accomplish the same thing.\n\n106\n00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:36.070\nUpdates happen, we talk about this\na lot throughout our episodes.\n\n107\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.309\nThese products, if you're on an Office\n365 subscription, they do update.\n\n108\n00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:45.648\nAnd if you're on the cycle that updates\nevery month or every four months, you\n\n109\n00:06:45.648 --> 00:06:50.188\nmight see things differently now in your\nOffice environment than the time of this\n\n110\n00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:55.760\nrecording, of where my Office environment\nmight have been on a different update.\n\n111\n00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.459\nSo just know that that will happen, and\na lot of times, your updates are for\n\n112\n00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.648\nthe better, and it adds new features,\nwhich can be really fun.\n\n113\n00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:06.880\nSearching for answers, using the oracle,\nthe oracle as in the internet, and\n\n114\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.333\nyou go out there and\nsearch for your answers.\n\n115\n00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:13.283\nThere are so many different things that\nyou can learn about Word that we can't\n\n116\n00:07:13.283 --> 00:07:14.820\ncover all in these episodes.\n\n117\n00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.290\nI try give you as much as possible, and\nthings that I feel are really helpful and\n\n118\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.877\nimportant.\n\n119\n00:07:18.877 --> 00:07:23.685\nBut you're gonna run into things that are\nkind of weird sometimes, and you need to\n\n120\n00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:28.710\nknow how to fix it, so consulting the\noracle is going to be really important.\n\n121\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.614\nAnd everybody uses Word differently, so\nif we're covering a topic where it's like,\n\n122\n00:07:32.614 --> 00:07:34.913\nI'm never gonna need to\ngenerate a bibliography,\n\n123\n00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.638\nbecause I don't need to cite my work.\n\n124\n00:07:36.638 --> 00:07:41.511\nThat's fine, but you never know when\nyour child, or maybe you niece or\n\n125\n00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:46.242\nnephew, or maybe just a friend,\nis going to be writing a term paper.\n\n126\n00:07:46.242 --> 00:07:48.770\nAnd they need to cite their work,\nand you're like, hey, I know how you\n\n127\n00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.620\ncan actually generate a bibliography,\nand you can pass along that knowledge.\n\n128\n00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.300\nSo just knowing that it can do it\ncan be really helpful for you, or\n\n129\n00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.150\nsomebody else down the line.\n\n130\n00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.258\nAnd of course, having fun,\nI like to have fun in these episodes.\n\n131\n00:08:02.258 --> 00:08:05.222\nI actually try to keep it light and\nkeep it cheery so\n\n132\n00:08:05.222 --> 00:08:08.412\nwhen we're learning about this,\nit is fun to learn.\n\n133\n00:08:08.412 --> 00:08:13.353\nAnd I hope you will enjoy it, and\nthat way, once you learn it, it'll make\n\n134\n00:08:13.353 --> 00:08:18.394\nit to you can have more fun using Word,\ncuz you'll know how to work with it.\n\n135\n00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:22.052\nSo I look forward to seeing you soon,\nand stay around.\n\n136\n00:08:22.052 --> 00:08:26.998\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
