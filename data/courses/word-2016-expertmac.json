Mac.\n\n3\n00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.630\nIn this course overview,\nwe're going to be,\n\n4\n00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.650\nwell, what exactly does this course cover?\n\n5\n00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.400\nWhat and\nwho is our target audience of people?\n\n6\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.320\nDo we need to know anything\nbefore we get started and\n\n7\n00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.850\nany extra tip bits along the way?\n\n8\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.300\nSo let's talk about what is\nin this particular series.\n\n9\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.591\nThis is all about long documents,\n\n10\n00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:36.340\nthat's going to be where we have our\nmajor concentration of episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.473\nNow this is where concentrating on things\nthat are associated with a long document,\n\n12\n00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.160\nsuch as a table of contents.\n\n13\n00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.690\nMaybe go ahead in creating an index\nof terms that you wanna go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.970\nput in the back of your book.\n\n15\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.199\nWe'll also be discussing things known\nas bookmarks, cross references, we're\n\n16\n00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.215\ngoing to learn how to insert citations,\nand be able to create a bibliography.\n\n17\n00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:03.550\nA really great thing to know about if you\nhave to do any type of research papers.\n\n18\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.592\nAnd believe me, back in my day we\ndidn't have anything like this and\n\n19\n00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:12.400\nI really wish we did,\nmakes your life a lot easier.\n\n20\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.025\nWe'll also going to be discussing how to\ncreate and insert footnotes and end notes,\n\n21\n00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:18.890\nand how to format them.\n\n22\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.930\nWe'll also be adding\ncaptions to your images and\n\n23\n00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.180\nor tables or any type of graphics.\n\n24\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.730\nAnd then being able to generate\na table of figures or table of tables.\n\n25\n00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.800\nSo really great powerful stuff for\nyou to be using within a long document.\n\n26\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.580\nWe'll also get into the topic\nof what is a master document and\n\n27\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.560\nhow to insert or create sub documents.\n\n28\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.920\nAnd how that could be most effective for\nyou in creating a long\n\n29\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.770\ndocument that maybe needs multiple\nparts and multiple contributors.\n\n30\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.660\nAlong those same lines, we're going to\nget into some episodes that deal in\n\n31\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.730\ncollaborating with other individuals.\n\n32\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.543\nMy master documents could kind of\nfall into that but I went ahead and\n\n33\n00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:07.121\nput in the long documents.\n\n34\n00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:11.626\nBut the big think with track changes, a\nreally great powerful way of proofing and\n\n35\n00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:15.932\nediting and being able to track edits\nalong the way when you're using Word and\n\n36\n00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:18.900\nbeing able to collaborate\nwith multiple people.\n\n37\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.440\nSomething I've used extensively\nthroughout my work within Word and\n\n38\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.580\ncollaborating with others.\n\n39\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.349\nWe'll also learn how to compare or\ncombine documents and\n\n40\n00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.830\nwhat those particular functions do.\n\n41\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.765\nAnd then we'll also collaborate online\nwhere we're going to put things up\n\n42\n00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:40.709\ninto our OneDrive account that is\npart of our Office 365 subscription.\n\n43\n00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.417\nAnd then being able to share, and\ncollaborate, and edit in real time,\n\n44\n00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:49.968\neither using your locally installed\nversion of Word, or go ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:49.968 --> 00:02:53.908\nusing the online version of\nWord which is really powerful.\n\n46\n00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:57.362\nWe'll also get into documents\nsearch security, and\n\n47\n00:02:57.362 --> 00:03:03.030\nthen also document properties, that extra\nmetadata that's added into documents.\n\n48\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.305\nWhere to find it, how to edit it,\nwhy it's important, and\n\n49\n00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:09.135\nwhy it might be important\nto actually take it away.\n\n50\n00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:12.239\nAnd then security things\nlike item passwords and\n\n51\n00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.325\nlocking down those documents for\npeople to either open or edit,\n\n52\n00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:19.440\nand that way it keeps it\na little bit more secure.\n\n53\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.000\nAnd maybe also talk a bit a little\nabout just general security practices\n\n54\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.740\noutside of Word but\nworking within a networked environment.\n\n55\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.780\nWe have an additional topics area.\n\n56\n00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.708\nThat's where I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:36.387\nput in things I customized in\nthe interface, adding your own Ribbon.\n\n58\n00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:39.760\nAnd then also we put in forms in there.\n\n59\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.689\nMaking forms in Word, is it the best?\n\n60\n00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.197\nI don't know, the jury's still out on\nthere, but it can be very efficient and\n\n61\n00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:51.612\nvery helpful for you, so\nI definitely wanted to go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:55.870\nmake sure that you know you can\nmake forms in Word for Mac.\n\n63\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.840\nSo who is this show targeted towards?\n\n64\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.289\nAny Office user, so anybody with\na capital O that is, so Office 365.\n\n65\n00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:08.481\nBut this is really where you wanna\nget into the nitty gritty with\n\n66\n00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:11.260\nlong document creations.\n\n67\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.990\nNot everybody is going to be\nusing Word in that capability.\n\n68\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.850\nBut if you are creating these types of\nthings with table of contents and indices,\n\n69\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.600\nthis is definitely the series\nto go ahead and watch.\n\n70\n00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.231\nSo I would say you should have like\nan intermediate knowledge of Word.\n\n71\n00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:30.658\nSo you've been using this product for\na little bit, you feel really comfortable\n\n72\n00:04:30.658 --> 00:04:34.905\nwith the foundations and you just wanna\ngo ahead and up that to the next level.\n\n73\n00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:37.440\nSo that being said,\nwhat do you need to know about this?\n\n74\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.010\nAnd intermediate knowledge of Word,\nyou need to be very comfortable,\n\n75\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.060\nor at least decently\ncomfortable with styles.\n\n76\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.911\nA lot of the things that we're going\nto be talking about in this particular\n\n77\n00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:50.645\nseries deal with styles.\n\n78\n00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:53.205\nAnd then of course page\nlayout which is really,\n\n79\n00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:56.982\nkind of going in with the sections and\nunderstanding what that means,\n\n80\n00:04:56.982 --> 00:05:01.280\npage breaks, continuous section breaks,\nnext page section breaks.\n\n81\n00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.020\nAll of these are things that we\nhave covered in our other series.\n\n82\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.150\nThe Word essentials and Word advance,\nso be familiar with all of that.\n\n83\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.448\nI always put in that other Office\nproducts will help if you have some\n\n84\n00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:16.071\nfamiliarity with them.\n\n85\n00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:20.676\nIt's not essential to know any of\nthat within this particular level but\n\n86\n00:05:20.676 --> 00:05:25.129\nagain, if you're doing a Word Expert\nyou're probably going to have\n\n87\n00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.140\na little bit more exposure to\nmultiple Office applications.\n\n88\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.350\nAnd knowing something in one always\nhelps a little bit in some others.\n\n89\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.140\nThere are exercise files that\nare associated with each episode\n\n90\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.740\nin this whole series, so you are able to\ndownload them and be able to use them.\n\n91\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.172\nThey are available in its entirety for\n\n92\n00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:49.432\nall of the episodes with their file\nnames in this course overview.\n\n93\n00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.910\nSo you're more than welcome to\ndownload them all from here.\n\n94\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.483\nAnd if anything's awry, maybe it's\nthe wrong file, or it doesn't have\n\n95\n00:05:56.483 --> 00:06:01.274\nthe right corrections in it, let us know,\ncontact us, and I wanna make sure I\n\n96\n00:06:01.274 --> 00:06:05.969\nhave the correct file up there so you\nare able to follow along if you want to.\n\n97\n00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.050\nAnd as always,\nWord has about 15 ways to do things,\n\n98\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.755\nthere's always gonna be other ways,\nI might not mention them.\n\n99\n00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.943\nSo it's not that I left\nthat out on purpose, but\n\n100\n00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:20.587\nit's just always there's many,\nmany different ways to do things.\n\n101\n00:06:20.587 --> 00:06:24.071\nUpdates [SOUND], man,\nOffice updates can really throw you for\n\n102\n00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:26.930\na loop where everything goes ahead and\nchanges.\n\n103\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.680\nSo if your version of Word\nlooks a little bit different or\n\n104\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.860\nthere's some different\nfunctionalities than the one that\n\n105\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.710\nam using at this current time\nof recording, it happens.\n\n106\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.629\nYou can always check for your updates,\nyou can run your Office updates to\n\n107\n00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.913\nsee if you need to be, or\ncan get to the next level of the Office.\n\n108\n00:06:45.913 --> 00:06:50.054\nThose incremental updates with\nOffice 365 are always happening,\n\n109\n00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:52.615\nand sometimes can mess\nyou up a little bit.\n\n110\n00:06:52.615 --> 00:06:54.082\n[LAUGH] It's happened to me.\n\n111\n00:06:54.082 --> 00:06:57.562\nThere's tons of answers out there online,\nso doing Google searches or\n\n112\n00:06:57.562 --> 00:07:01.270\nwhatever search engine of your\nchoosing is really, really helpful.\n\n113\n00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.850\nI like to give you links within the show\nnotes for the ones that I refer to but\n\n114\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.990\nthere's always more.\n\n115\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.791\nAnd everybody has different\nreasons of why they use Word.\n\n116\n00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.821\nSo maybe some of these episodes are not\nnecessarily things that you need to\n\n117\n00:07:14.821 --> 00:07:15.740\nknow about.\n\n118\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.953\nMaybe you're not writing research papers,\nso you don't need a bibliography.\n\n119\n00:07:18.953 --> 00:07:22.612\nBut at at least you know that the\ncapability arises, and maybe you can tell\n\n120\n00:07:22.612 --> 00:07:26.850\na friend that actually is using that,\nand be able to pass along the knowledge.\n\n121\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.870\nAnd of course, as always,\nwe like to have some fun.\n\n122\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.530\nHopefully by learning these concepts and\n\n123\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.720\nyou getting more familiar with them\nwill make Word a lot more fun for you.\n\n124\n00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.216\nI hope you have fun enjoying these\nepisodes, and I will see you soon.\n\n125\n00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:48.429\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
