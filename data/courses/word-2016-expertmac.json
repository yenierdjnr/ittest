Mac.\n\n3\n00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.630\nIn this course overview,\nwe're going to be,\n\n4\n00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.650\nwell, what exactly does this course cover?\n\n5\n00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.400\nWhat and\nwho is our target audience of people?\n\n6\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.320\nDo we need to know anything\nbefore we get started and\n\n7\n00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.850\nany extra tip bits along the way?\n\n8\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.300\nSo let's talk about what is\nin this particular series.\n\n9\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.591\nThis is all about long documents,\n\n10\n00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:36.340\nthat's going to be where we have our\nmajor concentration of episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.473\nNow this is where concentrating on things\nthat are associated with a long document,\n\n12\n00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.160\nsuch as a table of contents.\n\n13\n00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.690\nMaybe go ahead in creating an index\nof terms that you wanna go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.970\nput in the back of your book.\n\n15\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.199\nWe'll also be discussing things known\nas bookmarks, cross references, we're\n\n16\n00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.215\ngoing to learn how to insert citations,\nand be able to create a bibliography.\n\n17\n00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:03.550\nA really great thing to know about if you\nhave to do any type of research papers.\n\n18\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.592\nAnd believe me, back in my day we\ndidn't have anything like this and\n\n19\n00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:12.400\nI really wish we did,\nmakes your life a lot easier.\n\n20\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.025\nWe'll also going to be discussing how to\ncreate and insert footnotes and end notes,\n\n21\n00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:18.890\nand how to format them.\n\n22\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.930\nWe'll also be adding\ncaptions to your images and\n\n23\n00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.180\nor tables or any type of graphics.\n\n24\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.730\nAnd then being able to generate\na table of figures or table of tables.\n\n25\n00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.800\nSo really great powerful stuff for\nyou to be using within a long document.\n\n26\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.580\nWe'll also get into the topic\nof what is a master document and\n\n27\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.560\nhow to insert or create sub documents.\n\n28\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.920\nAnd how that could be most effective for\nyou in creating a long\n\n29\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.770\ndocument that maybe needs multiple\nparts and multiple contributors.\n\n30\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.660\nAlong those same lines, we're going to\nget into some episodes that deal in\n\n31\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.730\ncollaborating with other individuals.\n\n32\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.543\nMy master documents could kind of\nfall into that but I went ahead and\n\n33\n00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:07.121\nput in the long documents.\n\n34\n00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:11.626\nBut the big think with track changes, a\nreally great powerful way of proofing and\n\n35\n00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:15.932\nediting and being able to track edits\nalong the way when you're using Word and\n\n36\n00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:18.900\nbeing able to collaborate\nwith multiple people.\n\n37\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.440\nSomething I've used extensively\nthroughout my work within Word and\n\n38\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.580\ncollaborating with others.\n\n39\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.349\nWe'll also learn how to compare or\ncombine documents and\n\n40\n00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.830\nwhat those particular functions do.\n\n41\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.765\nAnd then we'll also collaborate online\nwhere we're going to put things up\n\n42\n00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:40.709\ninto our OneDrive account that is\npart of our Office 365 subscription.\n\n43\n00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.417\nAnd then being able to share, and\ncollaborate, and edit in real time,\n\n44\n00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:49.968\neither using your locally installed\nversion of Word, or go ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:49.968 --> 00:02:53.908\nusing the online version of\nWord which is really powerful.\n\n46\n00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:57.362\nWe'll also get into documents\nsearch security, and\n\n47\n00:02:57.362 --> 00:03:03.030\nthen also document properties, that extra\nmetadata that's added into documents.\n\n48\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.305\nWhere to find it, how to edit it,\nwhy it's important, and\n\n49\n00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:09.135\nwhy it might be important\nto actually take it away.\n\n50\n00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:12.239\nAnd then security things\nlike item passwords and\n\n51\n00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.325\nlocking down those documents for\npeople to either open or edit,\n\n52\n00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:19.440\nand that way it keeps it\na little bit more secure.\n\n53\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.000\nAnd maybe also talk a bit a little\nabout just general security practices\n\n54\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.740\noutside of Word but\nworking within a networked environment.\n\n55\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.780\nWe have an additional topics area.\n\n56\n00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.708\nThat's where I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:36.387\nput in things I customized in\nthe interface, adding your own Ribbon.\n\n58\n00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:39.760\nAnd then also we put in forms in there.\n\n59\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.689\nMaking forms in Word, is it the best?\n\n60\n00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.197\nI don't know, the jury's still out on\nthere, but it can be very efficient and\n\n61\n00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:51.612\nvery helpful for you, so\nI definitely wanted to go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:55.870\nmake sure that you know you can\nmake forms in Word for Mac.\n\n63\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.840\nSo who is this show targeted towards?\n\n64\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.289\nAny Office user, so anybody with\na capital O that is, so Office 365.\n\n65\n00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:08.481\nBut this is really where you wanna\nget into the nitty gritty with\n\n66\n00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:11.260\nlong document creations.\n\n67\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.990\nNot everybody is going to be\nusing Word in that capability.\n\n68\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.850\nBut if you are creating these types of\nthings with table of contents and indices,\n\n69\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.600\nthis is definitely the series\nto go ahead and watch.\n\n70\n00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.231\nSo I would say you should have like\nan intermediate knowledge of Word.\n\n71\n00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:30.658\nSo you've been using this product for\na little bit, you feel really comfortable\n\n72\n00:04:30.658 --> 00:04:34.905\nwith the foundations and you just wanna\ngo ahead and up that to the next level.\n\n73\n00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:37.440\nSo that being said,\nwhat do you need to know about this?\n\n74\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.010\nAnd intermediate knowledge of Word,\nyou need to be very comfortable,\n\n75\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.060\nor at least decently\ncomfortable with styles.\n\n76\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.911\nA lot of the things that we're going\nto be talking about in this particular\n\n77\n00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:50.645\nseries deal with styles.\n\n78\n00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:53.205\nAnd then of course page\nlayout which is really,\n\n79\n00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:56.982\nkind of going in with the sections and\nunderstanding what that means,\n\n80\n00:04:56.982 --> 00:05:01.280\npage breaks, continuous section breaks,\nnext page section breaks.\n\n81\n00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.020\nAll of these are things that we\nhave covered in our other series.\n\n82\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.150\nThe Word essentials and Word advance,\nso be familiar with all of that.\n\n83\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.448\nI always put in that other Office\nproducts will help if you have some\n\n84\n00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:16.071\nfamiliarity with them.\n\n85\n00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:20.676\nIt's not essential to know any of\nthat within this particular level but\n\n86\n00:05:20.676 --> 00:05:25.129\nagain, if you're doing a Word Expert\nyou're probably going to have\n\n87\n00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.140\na little bit more exposure to\nmultiple Office applications.\n\n88\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.350\nAnd knowing something in one always\nhelps a little bit in some others.\n\n89\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.140\nThere are exercise files that\nare associated with each episode\n\n90\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.740\nin this whole series, so you are able to\ndownload them and be able to use them.\n\n91\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.172\nThey are available in its entirety for\n\n92\n00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:49.432\nall of the episodes with their file\nnames in this course overview.\n\n93\n00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.910\nSo you're more than welcome to\ndownload them all from here.\n\n94\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.483\nAnd if anything's awry, maybe it's\nthe wrong file, or it doesn't have\n\n95\n00:05:56.483 --> 00:06:01.274\nthe right corrections in it, let us know,\ncontact us, and I wanna make sure I\n\n96\n00:06:01.274 --> 00:06:05.969\nhave the correct file up there so you\nare able to follow along if you want to.\n\n97\n00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.050\nAnd as always,\nWord has about 15 ways to do things,\n\n98\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.755\nthere's always gonna be other ways,\nI might not mention them.\n\n99\n00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.943\nSo it's not that I left\nthat out on purpose, but\n\n100\n00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:20.587\nit's just always there's many,\nmany different ways to do things.\n\n101\n00:06:20.587 --> 00:06:24.071\nUpdates [SOUND], man,\nOffice updates can really throw you for\n\n102\n00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:26.930\na loop where everything goes ahead and\nchanges.\n\n103\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.680\nSo if your version of Word\nlooks a little bit different or\n\n104\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.860\nthere's some different\nfunctionalities than the one that\n\n105\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.710\nam using at this current time\nof recording, it happens.\n\n106\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.629\nYou can always check for your updates,\nyou can run your Office updates to\n\n107\n00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.913\nsee if you need to be, or\ncan get to the next level of the Office.\n\n108\n00:06:45.913 --> 00:06:50.054\nThose incremental updates with\nOffice 365 are always happening,\n\n109\n00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:52.615\nand sometimes can mess\nyou up a little bit.\n\n110\n00:06:52.615 --> 00:06:54.082\n[LAUGH] It's happened to me.\n\n111\n00:06:54.082 --> 00:06:57.562\nThere's tons of answers out there online,\nso doing Google searches or\n\n112\n00:06:57.562 --> 00:07:01.270\nwhatever search engine of your\nchoosing is really, really helpful.\n\n113\n00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.850\nI like to give you links within the show\nnotes for the ones that I refer to but\n\n114\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.990\nthere's always more.\n\n115\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.791\nAnd everybody has different\nreasons of why they use Word.\n\n116\n00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.821\nSo maybe some of these episodes are not\nnecessarily things that you need to\n\n117\n00:07:14.821 --> 00:07:15.740\nknow about.\n\n118\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.953\nMaybe you're not writing research papers,\nso you don't need a bibliography.\n\n119\n00:07:18.953 --> 00:07:22.612\nBut at at least you know that the\ncapability arises, and maybe you can tell\n\n120\n00:07:22.612 --> 00:07:26.850\na friend that actually is using that,\nand be able to pass along the knowledge.\n\n121\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.870\nAnd of course, as always,\nwe like to have some fun.\n\n122\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.530\nHopefully by learning these concepts and\n\n123\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.720\nyou getting more familiar with them\nwill make Word a lot more fun for you.\n\n124\n00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.216\nI hope you have fun enjoying these\nepisodes, and I will see you soon.\n\n125\n00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:48.429\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm doing fantastic,\n\n9\n00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.003\nhow are you doing Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, Vonne,\n\n10\n00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.931\nwe are about to enter into this world\nof bibliographies and citations.\n\n11\n00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:47.058\nAnd I remember when I was working\non my degree at some point in time,\n\n12\n00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:51.500\nthis was super frustrating for me and\nI didn't have Word at that point.\n\n13\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.830\nSo Vonne, hopefully,\n\n14\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.366\nthis is gonna be easier.\n&gt;&gt; My gosh,\n\n15\n00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.265\nthis actually kind of brings\nback some nightmares for me too.\n\n16\n00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:01.522\n[LAUGH] Because I remember having in\nour language arts class or whatever,\n\n17\n00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:05.360\nthat we would have quizzes and\ntests on the proper punctuation and\n\n18\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.250\nmaking sure you had all\nthese different things.\n\n19\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.090\nAnd you had the last name comma first\nname, and what if you had two authors.\n\n20\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.430\nAnd it was like, it was a little scary.\n\n21\n00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.540\nAnd our different sources, and this where\nwhen you're writing a research paper,\n\n22\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.980\nyou have to cite your sources, right?\n\n23\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.385\nWhere did you get this information from?\n\n24\n00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:29.833\nAre you taking it verbatim, or did you use\nthis as a reference within your research?\n\n25\n00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:34.314\nThere is all these different kind of\nparameters that you need to have for\n\n26\n00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:36.107\ndifferent writing styles,\n\n27\n00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:38.440\nremember the writing styles?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n28\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes, what are the big ones that\n\n29\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.810\nyou remember?\n&gt;&gt; I remember the APA, and the MLA and\n\n30\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.458\nthe Chicago style.\n\n31\n00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:48.870\nAnd I even remember a couple of different\nschools having their own style,\n\n32\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.230\nbecause they wanted to make sure it\nwas especially different for them.\n\n33\n00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.950\nSo they even came out with their own\nstyle of guide that you had to follow,\n\n34\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.650\nwhich was a bit more unnerving cuz I like\nthe following the general ones instead.\n\n35\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember the MLA, the APA, and\n\n36\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.020\nthe Chicago.\n\n37\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.479\nAnd then, of course.\n&gt;&gt; Arabian,\n\n38\n00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.742\nthere were a few others.\n&gt;&gt; Okay yeah [LAUGH].\n\n39\n00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:09.514\n&gt;&gt; I've been through all of them.\n\n40\n00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:11.502\n&gt;&gt; So I remember those big ones going\n\n41\n00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:13.207\nthrough school, so, yes.\n\n42\n00:02:13.207 --> 00:02:18.350\nThe thing is, when writing a bibliography,\nthat was a pain point,\n\n43\n00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.979\nbut now with Word, my gosh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.496\nEasier?\n&gt;&gt; It is one of those where I'm just like\n\n45\n00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:27.190\nwhy was this not available when I\nwas going through high school and\n\n46\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.681\ncollege and everything?\n\n47\n00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.751\nIt would have saved a lot\nof nights of crying and\n\n48\n00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.025\nbanging on the well I guess pen and\npaper really.\n\n49\n00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:37.930\n[LAUGH] Having to write them all\nout instead of typing them, so.\n\n50\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.948\nNow being said that I wrote papers myself,\nand\n\n51\n00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:45.350\nthey're pretty decent.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n52\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.810\n&gt;&gt; I could write a good paper here and\n\n53\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.545\nthere, I will say, but\nI am no English professor.\n\n54\n00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.450\n[LAUGH] And\n\n55\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.040\nI am definitely not the authority figure\non writing styles or how to do that.\n\n56\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.040\nYou're still gonna need to\nconsult your powers that be for\n\n57\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.560\nyour particular standards,\nwhere you're going, what they want.\n\n58\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.960\nI'm gonna show you how Word can do it and\ngive you kind of some general terminology.\n\n59\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.310\nAnd so don't quote me on anything here,\nthat's like, well Vonne said it.\n\n60\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.395\nNo, I'm putting that disclaimer\nout here right now, so.\n\n61\n00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:20.520\n[LAUGH] But I do have a couple references.\n\n62\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.300\nAnd just to go ahead and get started,\nI brought up some things,\n\n63\n00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.128\nthese are in the episode notes.\n\n64\n00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:31.200\nAnd the MLA style guides, I can still\nremember the cover of my writing book in\n\n65\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.130\nEnglish 1101, your Gordan Rule,\nat least in Florida we had these and\n\n66\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.425\nit was it was green and it was thick and\nsmall and it was, yeah,\n\n67\n00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:45.156\nand it was 7:30 in the morning, horrible.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:45.746\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n69\n00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:50.550\nanyways I just wanted to give you\na quick thing about like MLA, APA,\n\n70\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.936\nplagiarism, that's\na huge thing in college.\n\n71\n00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:58.760\nYou don't want to ever get caught copying\nsomething, or even maybe you're not\n\n72\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.380\nthinking, I'm just buying a paper\noff the Internet and turning it in.\n\n73\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.398\nIt's more of you are using\nsomebody's source,\n\n74\n00:04:06.398 --> 00:04:10.087\nand you didn't cite it, so\nit's not even you planed on it.\n\n75\n00:04:10.087 --> 00:04:13.371\nSo that's something that's very important\nthat you need to be very careful about,\n\n76\n00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:14.750\nciting your work.\n\n77\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.370\nAnd I know in college it's big\nwith the academic integrity,\n\n78\n00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.720\nnot integrity, academic excellence?\n\n79\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.378\nYou just gotta make sure you\ndon't get in trouble, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:23.378 --> 00:04:25.918\nSo this is just a quick resource,\n\n81\n00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:30.652\nlike I said consult your professor or\nEnglish teacher there.\n\n82\n00:04:30.652 --> 00:04:34.540\nAnd now the one thing that I found\ninteresting here Ronnie is that,\n\n83\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.388\nwhat is the difference\nbetween bibliography and\n\n84\n00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:38.530\nworks cited?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n85\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.880\n&gt;&gt; I thought they were the same thing,\n\n86\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.430\nI was like, okay, they're not are they?\n&gt;&gt; No they are not.\n\n87\n00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.205\n&gt;&gt; Did you know this?\n\n88\n00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:46.672\n&gt;&gt; I actually did know this.\n\n89\n00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:48.723\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] I think you went a little\n\n90\n00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:53.310\nfurther in school than I did, so.\n&gt;&gt;

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.110\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\nyou're watching the Word 2016 Expert Show.\n\n4\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.751\nAs we continue on, we're now gonna\ntake a look at footnotes and endnotes.\n\n5\n00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:30.188\nAnd here, once again, to help us,\nis gonna be our Office Pro guru herself,\n\n6\n00:00:30.188 --> 00:00:31.095\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:34.150\nVonne, how are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.310\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, Vonne.\n\n9\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.270\nWe are now continuing on, taking a look\nat some very interesting work, and\n\n10\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.990\nthe idea of footnotes and endnotes,\nvery important when people are asking for\n\n11\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.890\nthem, and we don't know how to do them.\n\n12\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.359\nI remember doing this manually\non a manual typewriter.\n\n13\n00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.765\nIt was nightmarish, Vonne.\n\n14\n00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:52.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can concur to that [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.680\nYes, I do remember the manual typewriter.\n\n16\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.424\nAnd [SOUND], just trying to get\nthe spacing and where it's supposed to go,\n\n17\n00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:07.279\nand God forbid, if you had to change it or\nyou had to add another one, nope.\n\n18\n00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:08.930\nYou gotta start all over.\n\n19\n00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.790\nSo I mean, the computer and\n\n20\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.550\nthe Word processor has really\nhelped us along the way to do this.\n\n21\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.321\nAnd Word specifically,\n\n22\n00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:22.895\non how it's advanced in how we do this\nlong document creation is just amazing.\n\n23\n00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:26.726\nI definitely feel like,\nI remember back in my day.\n\n24\n00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:28.138\nAnd I'm feeling a little old right now.\n\n25\n00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:30.151\n[LAUGH] But it was.\n\n26\n00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:33.985\nThe struggle was real, real, for real.\n\n27\n00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:35.504\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n28\n00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:37.100\nThe struggle was real.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n29\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.090\n&gt;&gt; For real.\n\n30\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.990\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt,\n\n31\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.880\nwhen we had to work with\nthe regular paper, right?\n\n32\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.280\nJust like what Vonne said.\n\n33\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.910\nIf you messed up, you had to pretty\nmuch take the whole thing out and\n\n34\n00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.450\njust start retyping again and hoping\neverything lined up better this time.\n\n35\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.547\nAnd if you're like me,\nthat took like six or\n\n36\n00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:54.992\nseven cheats before anything\never happened here.\n\n37\n00:01:54.992 --> 00:02:00.944\nSo Vonne, in terms of Word, this actually\ndoes work out relatively easily,\n\n38\n00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:03.468\ndoesn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I will throw a,\n\n39\n00:02:03.468 --> 00:02:05.990\nit's actually pretty simple, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.440\n[LAUGH] I say that,\nbecause I've done it a lot.\n\n41\n00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.402\nI do remember when I was first learning\nabout it, and kinda like [SOUND].\n\n42\n00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:20.264\nI was half and half, and also because it's\none thing to just learn the mechanical\n\n43\n00:02:20.264 --> 00:02:22.849\npart of put your cursor here, click here.\n\n44\n00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.960\nBut why am I doing it?\n\n45\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.457\nIt's more of a but\nwhy do I even need footnotes?\n\n46\n00:02:27.457 --> 00:02:30.420\nAnd what's the difference between\na footnote and an endnote?\n\n47\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.923\nAnd I don't know why I need\nto do this kind of stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:34.923 --> 00:02:39.110\nI think I forgot the history of I had.\n\n49\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.190\nWhen do you need this?\n\n50\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.350\nAnd I get too focused\non the mechanics of it.\n\n51\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.830\nSo what is a footnote, Ronnie?\n\n52\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.810\nIt is something that goes to\nthe bottom of a page within a document.\n\n53\n00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.540\nWe see this in books.\n\n54\n00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.480\nSorry, it's this really funny\nbook that Amy Schumer wrote, and\n\n55\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.270\nshe has like this whole section where it's\nher diary entry from when she's 19, and\n\n56\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.310\nthen she has footnotes.\n&gt;&gt; Footnotes.\n\n57\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.026\n&gt;&gt; From when she's 26.\n\n58\n00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:10.320\nHilarious, totally inappropriate and\nnot politically correct.\n\n59\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.980\nSo it is hilarious.\n\n60\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.600\nSo it's just where you have\na little number or a letter.\n\n61\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.300\nYou know what?\nWhy don't\n\n62\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.510\nI show them an example?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds\n\n63\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.052\ngood.\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n\n64\n00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:23.673\nThat would probably be better,\nwouldn't it?\n\n65\n00:03:23.673 --> 00:03:26.570\nAnd we'll come over here to these\nreferences in just a little bit.\n\n66\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.480\nWhy don't we come into\nour footnotes example?\n\n67\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.373\nNow we have one right here.\n\n68\n00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:32.310\nI do not have my hide and\nshow paragraphs on it.\n\n69\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.297\nAnd so it is right there.\n\n70\n00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:38.430\nDown, down, down, and\nthere is a number, whoops, wrong way.\n\n71\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.806\nNumber one right there.\n\n72\n00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:45.350\nSo that is just giving us some, hey,\nthere's a little extra tidbit right there.\n\n73\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.850\nSee it?\n\n74\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.320\nWhat does it say?\n\n75\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.949\nNow the neat thing with Word\nis that if I hover over it,\n\n76\n00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.216\nit will give me a little tool tip.\n\n77\n00:03:54.216 --> 00:03:56.720\nIt's down, down, down, not up, up, up.\n\n78\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.800\nIf I scroll out a little bit, notice\ndown at the bottom of the page, sorry,\n\n79\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.940\nI went a little, no, there it is.\n\n80\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.850\nRight there, not up, up, up.\n\n81\n00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.560\nOkay, cool.\n\n82\n00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.066\nThere's that little line right there,\nand it's going to go ahead and refer to\n\n83\n00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:13.958\nwhatever character, it can be numbers, it\ncan be letters, it can be little symbols.\n\n84\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.869\nAnd so cats might eat best,\nbut that might be bad.\n\n85\n00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:21.710\nOkay, so it's going to be\nreferring to some other places.\n\n86\n00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.320\nNow if we look, right there,\nthere is the number two right there.\n\n87\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.560\nI'm randomly putting us in here, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.610\nAnd then we have another one,\nbut you see right here it's like,\n\n89\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.450\nwhether the blows heard it or not, and\n\n90\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.040\nthen there is this little Roman numeral,\nbut that is not down here.\n\n91\n00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.315\nThat's an example of an endnote.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n92\n00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.958\n&gt;&gt; Footnotes go to the footer or\n\n93\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.381\nthe bottom of that particular page.\n\n94\n00:04:48.381 --> 00:04:53.408\nEndnotes go to the end of either\na chapter, or in this case or section or\n\n95\n00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:58.470\nto the end of the document,\nwherever you want to have that place.\n\n96\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.740\nSo if I scroll down, I believe it's right\nabout, no, I think it's the very end.\n\n97\n00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.816\nYes, I made it to the very,\nvery end of the document, so\n\n98\n00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:10.177\nyou could see pepper goes great with soup.\n\n99\n00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:13.120\nOkay, great,\nI made these things anyway [LAUGH].\n\n100\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.440\nAnd so those are our different end notes.\n\n101\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.910\nSo the footnotes were the number one, and\nthe endnotes were the Roman numerals.\n\n102\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.150\nYou might wanna probably separate\nthose out into letters and numbers.\n\n103\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.810\nThat might be a little easier to kind of,\nthey don't get a little confusing.\n\n104\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.200\nBut that would be the whole\npurpose of a footnote and endnote.\n\n105\n00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.260\nIt's usually something like you\nneed to give more information,\n\n106\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.810\nmaybe you're citing a reference.\n\n107\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.080\nYou see this in Wikipedia articles.\n\n108\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n109\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.050\nAnd you have that and then there's\na hyperlink that actually jumps down to\n\n110\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.950\nthe bottom of like where,\nit's like they're citing their source,\n\n111\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.990\nwhich we actually talked about in\nour citations and bibliography.\n\n112\n00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:53.880\nSo there's different\nreasons why you may or\n\n113\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.850\nmay not want to include footnotes in this.\n\n114\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.960\nI do have a little article in\nthe episode notes that just say like,\n\n115\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.550\nwhen do you need to use them, and\nI'll let you read this to yourself.\n\n116\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.329\nBut it's really more of like it, more\nof physical space where you want them.\n\n117\n00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:16.478\nAdvantages and disadvantages,\nthey're closer, so it's a little easier.\n\n118\n00:06:16.478 --> 00:06:21.328\nDisadvantage is if you have a lot,\nit might be a little cluttering.\n\n119\n00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:23.650\nAdvantages for\nendnotes gives you more room, but\n\n120\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.230\nthen the disadvantage is they have to\ngo all the way to the back of the book.\n\n121\n00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.126\nThose are kinda the whys.\n\n122\n00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:32.070\nAnd it's really just, hey,\nif you're gonna use them,\n\n123\n00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.170\njust care to format them properly,\nand then, as with anything,\n\n124\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.480\ndon't overuse them,\ncuz you don't want to perch your paper.\n\n125\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.608\nGreat, nice little tidbits\nof information there.\n\n126\n00:06:43.608 --> 00:06:48.300\nAnd the other thing I have in here\nis actually white papers from\n\n127\n00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.009\nMicrosoft's website to\nshow you how to do this.\n\n128\n00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.057\nBut you got me here, so\nyou don't need to look at this.\n\n129\n00:06:54.057 --> 00:06:58.546\n[LAUGH] All right, I love this and this\nwhere, hey, if we where typing this out on\n\n130\n00:06:58.546 --> 00:07:02.768\na manual typewriter, what if I needed\nto add another one in the middle, and\n\n131\n00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:05.765\nthen all of the numbers\npast that need to change?\n\n132\n00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:07.469\n[SOUND] Nightmare if you're doing it\n\n133\n00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.103\nmanually.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:07:08.103 --> 00:07:11.265\n&gt;&gt; Super easy if you're doing it in Word.\n\n135\n00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:12.517\nLove it, awesome.\n\n136\n00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:19.557\nNow with these, we saw that there was that\npreview when I hovered over the reference\n\n137\n00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:22.767\nand I was trying to remember, right here,\nsee either question there's that\n\n138\n00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:27.567\nsmall number two right above it, and I'll\nzoom in a little bit so you can see it.\n\n139\n00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:28.627\nWhen I hover over,\n\n140\n00:07:28.627 --> 00:07:33.390\nI do get that that little tooltip that\ngives me from within the document.\n\n141\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.140\nThe other neat thing is, if I'm down here,\nwhat if I didn't know where that\n\n142\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.880\nparticular footnote\nresides in the document?\n\n143\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.850\nI can see it at the bottom,\nbut where is that?\n\n144\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:50.735\nIf you right click on that footnote, it'll\ngive you the option to go to the footnote,\n\n145\n00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:55.334\nand then it will jump you up and\nput your cursor where that is.\n\n146\n00:07:55.334 --> 00:07:57.302\nThat's kind of nice.\n\n147\n00:07:57.302 --> 00:08:00.251\nI don't think it goes the other\nway around, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n148\n00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:02.923\nYou can't, Click on the number.\n\n149\n00:08:02.923 --> 00:08:07.460\nIt doesn't become a hyperlink,\nlike a cross reference would do.\n\n150\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.680\nSo you have to kind of go backwards, and\nit's actually easier to find where they\n\n151\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.150\nare at the bottom of\nthe page then trying to.\n\n152\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.537\nI think that's probably why they did it.\n\n153\n00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:17.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n154\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.880\n&gt;&gt; The other thing that you can do to kind\n\n155\n00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.240\nof jump around your\ndifferent footnotes and\n\n156\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.380\nend notes is if you go over\nto your References tab.\n\n157\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.330\nAnd you have this button at the top\nwhere we have in our footnote section,\n\n158\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.220\nis that we can go to the next footnote and\n\n159\n00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.600\nthen it jumps me down to where I\nhave something about sea turtles.\n\n160\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.780\nAnd then I can go to this next one and\nthe next one and the previous, or\n\n161\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.780\nI can go to the next end note.\n\n162\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.780\nRemember just physical locations as to\nwhere those notes are going to be located,\n\n163\n00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.850\nin a sense within the document, okay.\n\n164\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.530\nThe note itself is in a different\nphysical location, so that's pretty neat.\n\n165\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.500\nThe other thing you could do is if my\ncursor is here, we have show notes.\n\n166\n00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.570\nWhat's this button do?\n\n167\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.300\nWell then it says, hey it has both,\nwhich one do you want to view?\n\n168\n00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.390\nWell, in this case maybe I\nwant to view the end notes.\n\n169\n00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.270\nAnd click okay, and\n\n170\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.700\nthen it jumps me down to that particular\nplace where the end notes are.\n\n171\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.880\nSo, different ways of\nnavigating around where these\n\n172\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.000\nfootnotes and end notes live in your\ndocument, so how we can get around them.\n\n173\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.720\nOkay, lovely.\n\n174\n00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.690\nWhat about adding a footnote?\n\n175\n00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.220\nNow, I have ones that are already in here,\nand I could remove them all,\n\n176\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.840\nI could completely start over,\nthat's totally fine.\n\n177\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.670\nBut I'm just gonna start, well, from here.\n\n178\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:45.150\nLet's do this, and the nice thing is,\nand I'll show you the same thing,\n\n179\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.740\nhow you can add one, and\nhow it goes ahead and changes and\n\n180\n00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.660\nupdates everything,\nwhich is going to be really nice.\n\n181\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.470\nSo we know we have a first one on down,\ndown, down.\n\n182\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.940\nWe know we have a second one on near\nthe rabbit about answering a question.\n\n183\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.940\nMaybe I need one right here.\n\n184\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.930\nCuz I need more information, I need to\nput a footnote about the white rabbit.\n\n185\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.960\nPut your cursor where you\nwant to insert the footnote.\n\n186\n00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.990\nWe come over here and\nwe just click insert footnote.\n\n187\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.980\nAnd notice that as soon as I did\nit it puts it right down here.\n\n188\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.500\nThat number two turned\ninto a number three.\n\n189\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.160\nMy gosh this is so great.\n\n190\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.060\nIt's going to update everything.\n\n191\n00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:29.908\nAnd we could say the white\n\n192\n00:10:29.908 --> 00:10:33.820\nrabbit is cute.\n\n193\n00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.350\nAll right, sounds good.\n\n194\n00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:39.470\nSo you can see I went ahead and\ndid that, it jumped it right in there.\n\n195\n00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:45.300\nSo nice, so lovely, I think that's\npretty cool of how you can do that.\n\n196\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.130\nNow what if I, and\nall the other numbers change.\n\n197\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.920\nSo now what was three becomes four,\nwhat was four becomes five.\n\n198\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.660\nWhat if I realize I\ndidn't need one of them?\n\n199\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.700\nOkay, I can add one,\nyou can see how it updates everything, but\n\n200\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.220\nwhat if I need to delete one?\n\n201\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.550\nWhy don't I come up here to the very\nfirst one of the down, down down.\n\n202\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.090\nYou can do it in two different ways.\n\n203\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:11.420\nIf I take out the reference number in\nthe document just go ahead and select it.\n\n204\n00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.710\nAnd you can just hit the back space\nover the delete key get's rid of it.\n\n205\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.050\nOops I got a rid of that period.\n\n206\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.070\nGo down here.\n\n207\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.642\nTook that out too.\n\n208\n00:11:21.642 --> 00:11:24.430\nCool, you delete the reference\nnumber it deletes the note.\n\n209\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.260\nSame way is if you delete the note.\n\n210\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:31.690\nWhoops, there we go, okay.\n\n211\n00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.060\nIt will delete the one, where was that?\n\n212\n00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.280\nIt was right up here, wasn't it?\n\n213\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.919\nYes, cuz I did it [CROSSTALK], there's the\nwhite rabbit and it change the numbers.\n\n214\n00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:44.771\nSo yeah, it's doing it so\nfast that I got kinda confused as to,\n\n215\n00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:46.910\nno it needed to delete that.\n\n216\n00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.570\nOkay, we'll get that read.\n\n217\n00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.670\nOkay, well normally it should go ahead and\ndo both ways.\n\n218\n00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.552\nIt didn't really, [SOUND] double check.\n\n219\n00:11:54.552 --> 00:11:56.960\nBut now you can see that I\ntook out the up, up, up.\n\n220\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.800\nI took the one that I had added and now\ncats might eat bats has become number one.\n\n221\n00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.250\nAnd so that's neat.\n\n222\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.660\nBut do be careful about making\nsure that both get taken out.\n\n223\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.660\nI deleted the note and\nthe reference number.\n\n224\n00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.780\nJust in case something like\nI just demonstrated happens.\n\n225\n00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.180\nBut, really nice that it will go ahead and\n\n226\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.260\nchange everything in\nthe order of wherever I'm at.\n\n227\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.710\nNIce.\n\n228\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.120\nFew other things.\n\n229\n00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.500\nWhat if I didn't want it to be one,\ntwo, three anymore Ronnie?\n\n230\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.060\nWhat if I wanted it to be A,B,Cs, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.530\nWe can do that.\n\n232\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.330\nAgain, it would be really bad if\nwe were doing this without Word.\n\n233\n00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.220\nIf you right click on your footnote,\nnotice down at the bottom or\n\n234\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.410\nin this right click menu you\nhave footnote dot dot dot,\n\n235\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.730\nthis brings up what I call\nthe options dialogue pause.\n\n236\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.440\nAnd I click it.\n\n237\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.420\nIt gets into all the different\nthings that you can do right here.\n\n238\n00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.450\nWell, where do I want the location\nof that particular footnote?\n\n239\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.510\nBecause you could do it below the text.\n\n240\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.680\nI think that might get a little\ncumbersome personally.\n\n241\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.710\nI think footnotes should go to the bottom,\nthat's why it's the default location.\n\n242\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.270\nYou can also convert them,\nif you really wanted to.\n\n243\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.050\nYou could convert.\n\n244\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:22.250\nNow, I'm not exactly sure why it's greying\nout all of these sections right here.\n\n245\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.800\nWe'll come back around\nto that in a little bit.\n\n246\n00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.020\nI'm having a thought, Ronnie.\n\n247\n00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.130\nI don't know if this is completely right,\nthough.\n\n248\n00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.552\nThese files were originally made on a PC?\n\n249\n00:13:33.552 --> 00:13:38.670\nAnd maybe coming over and using the exact\nsame document on a Macintosh doesn't\n\n250\n00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.490\nsee them-\n&gt;&gt; Everything, yeah.\n\n251\n00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n252\n00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:47.360\nI'm rolling with that as my excuse or\nreason why I'm not seeing these options.\n\n253\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.400\nCuz normally, it's pretty awesome.\n\n254\n00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.672\nConvert all footnotes to endnotes,\nconvert all endnotes to footnotes.\n\n255\n00:13:53.672 --> 00:13:57.010\nSwap footnotes, then it's really\npowerful that way of how you\n\n256\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.460\nscroll that right from this\nparticular convert button.\n\n257\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.499\nWhy it's not showing me in this example,\ngremlins.\n\n258\n00:14:04.499 --> 00:14:08.460\n[LAUGH] All right, and\nthen we can see that we\n\n259\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.160\nwanna have like the layout level one, one\npalm, few palms, or a lot of footnotes.\n\n260\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160\nI think, I'll just go ahead and\nmatch the layout that it has.\n\n261\n00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:23.580\nI think it's the most the default\nway of doing I wanna say.\n\n262\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.780\nHere we go what I want\nmy number format to be,\n\n263\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.190\ndo I want them to be abcs, one two threes?\n\n264\n00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.290\nIs the a, b, c.\n\n265\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.030\nAnd where is it gonna start?\n\n266\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.260\nAnd is it continuous, do I want or\n\n267\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.470\ndo I want to restart now this\nis another thing to consider.\n\n268\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.670\nIf you have sections.\n\n269\n00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.730\nWe talked about the importance of\na continuous section break and\n\n270\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.860\nnext page section break,\nespecially if you're doing long documents\n\n271\n00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.690\nwith multiple chapters and you're going\nto have footnotes in each chapter.\n\n272\n00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:56.560\nMaybe you want it to restart\nat each change in chapter and\n\n273\n00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.360\nin this sense right here,\neach change in section.\n\n274\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.880\nOr maybe you want it for each page.\n\n275\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.780\nYou're gonna have that many footnotes\nthat every page is going to have\n\n276\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.290\na new numbering of your footnotes.\n\n277\n00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.370\nTotally can see every which reason\nof why you would want to do that, or\n\n278\n00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.210\njust keep in continuous.\n\n279\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.600\nI'm gonna go with restart each section,\njust for fun.\n\n280\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.650\nAnd then how do I want this applied?\n\n281\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.070\nDo I want to just change this section?\n\n282\n00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.340\nBut if I have multiple sections and\nI want it to restart,\n\n283\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.530\nthen I'd probably want to apply to what?\n&gt;&gt; Whole document.\n\n284\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.580\n&gt;&gt; The whole document so\n\n285\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.440\nevery section would go ahead and change.\n\n286\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.350\nSo I hope you're seeing\nalready the power and\n\n287\n00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:40.052\nflexibility of your end notes and\nfootnotes right here within Word.\n\n288\n00:15:40.052 --> 00:15:42.640\nAnd how just like poof,\nlet's just go ahead and do everything and\n\n289\n00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.720\nwe go ahead and apply and\nnotice that turns to an A, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.640\nAnd then the other one are gonna go\nwith b, there is our turtle season,\n\n291\n00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.900\nlet me scroll down a little bit more.\n\n292\n00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.950\nOkay, we'll keep on going.\n\n293\n00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.861\nI think there is,\nI think it's after page 5D and\n\n294\n00:15:56.861 --> 00:16:00.782\nthen, yes page five is\nthe change in my section.\n\n295\n00:16:00.782 --> 00:16:03.380\nLet's go ahead and show our hide.\n\n296\n00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.392\nPerfect, then let's see if it worked.\n\n297\n00:16:06.392 --> 00:16:08.950\nAll right, yep, there we go.\n\n298\n00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.989\nAnd I turned these off cuz it's a little\neasier to see without the show/hide\n\n299\n00:16:11.989 --> 00:16:12.950\ncharacters.\n\n300\n00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.410\nOf now my footnotes have restarted\n\n301\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.195\ntheir numberings right here\non that second section.\n\n302\n00:16:20.195 --> 00:16:24.410\nMan, it's starting to make me excited\nagain because I just love talking about\n\n303\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.160\nthis stuff and making your life so\nmuch easier with adding these\n\n304\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.030\nparticular things that you may or\nmy not want to add in your long documents.\n\n305\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.180\nNice.\n\n306\n00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.760\nWhat if I needed to move my entries?\n\n307\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.740\nSo right here on this particular page see,\n\n308\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.800\nI have within at the Duchess,\nmaybe as I, oops.\n\n309\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.970\nYou know what?\nI really needed to put that after\n\n310\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:45.480\nand the baby.\n\n311\n00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.150\nYou can just select it, just like it\nwould be any text, and woops, come on.\n\n312\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.810\nWe'll go ahead and select it, you can\nthen, with your selection, move your arrow\n\n313\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.440\nover it and just move it over and\nthere you go, it didn't change anything.\n\n314\n00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.570\nI got up another space right there, sorry.\n\n315\n00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.810\nBut that's a nice thing if ever if I\nneeded to change the location of it.\n\n316\n00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.380\nWe already talked about the leading and\nhow it'll go ahead and update everything.\n\n317\n00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.740\nOne thing about updating, you saw how easy\nit was once I go ahead and take this out.\n\n318\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.030\nIf you are using your cross references,\n\n319\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.920\nnow we talked about cross references\nin one of our first episodes.\n\n320\n00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.030\nMaybe I have here where I have,\n\n321\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:32.200\nI inserted a cross\nreference of C footnote.\n\n322\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.600\nAnd then I'm gonna put an extra space so\n\n323\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.330\nyou can see this and\ninsert this right here.\n\n324\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.532\nI want to say footnote B, right?\n\n325\n00:17:40.532 --> 00:17:44.006\nSo I'm trying to give\na reference to a footnote,\n\n326\n00:17:44.006 --> 00:17:48.520\ncuz we talked about it,\nit can reference anything really.\n\n327\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.320\nIt's like a mini hyperlink.\n\n328\n00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.920\nIf I insert that cross reference and\ngo to, let's reference that footnote.\n\n329\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.548\nDo you want the footnote number,\ndo yo want the,\n\n330\n00:17:58.548 --> 00:18:03.550\nthe above and\nbelow that's like see above, see below.\n\n331\n00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.530\nThat's something doesn't apply here, so\n\n332\n00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:11.660\nwhy don't we go with the footnote\nnumber and we will go to, we're there.\n\n333\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.680\nGreat [INAUDIBLE], sorry because\nthat one was a different section,\n\n334\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.570\nwasn't it Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n335\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.246\n&gt;&gt; This is section two and\n\n336\n00:18:16.246 --> 00:18:17.175\nthat is where we are right now.\n\n337\n00:18:17.175 --> 00:18:20.744\nI click insert,\nnotice it will go ahead and\n\n338\n00:18:20.744 --> 00:18:25.115\nput in footnote B,\nthere is a your cross reference.\n\n339\n00:18:25.115 --> 00:18:31.413\nWell, when you let's say come down here\nand delete this particular footnote,\n\n340\n00:18:31.413 --> 00:18:36.310\nall right, or maybe instead of\ndeleting it, let's do this.\n\n341\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.470\nLet's put in another one, let's go\nahead and insert another footnote,\n\n342\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.960\nwhere are they?\n\n343\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.390\nRight there, insert, and we'll just,\nso B is now something different,\n\n344\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.840\nisn't it, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n345\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.560\n&gt;&gt; The one that we\n\n346\n00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.309\nhave in that cross reference is C.\n\n347\n00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:55.131\nIt updates wonderfully through out\nour footnotes and endnotes, but\n\n348\n00:18:55.131 --> 00:18:57.469\nthat still says B, doesn't it?\n\n349\n00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:00.409\nSo you have to be careful\nabout making sure,\n\n350\n00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:03.673\ncuz this is more of a you\nhave to force the update.\n\n351\n00:19:03.673 --> 00:19:08.464\nThat was somewhat we did in that first\nepisode is, you'd have to come up here and\n\n352\n00:19:08.464 --> 00:19:09.690\nupdate that field.\n\n353\n00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.636\nAnd if you're doing a lot\nof changing around, and\n\n354\n00:19:12.636 --> 00:19:16.919\nmaybe you have this cross referenced\nmultiple places in your document,\n\n355\n00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:21.292\nthere is something that most of the time\nworks [LAUGH], can't always say.\n\n356\n00:19:21.292 --> 00:19:26.984\nIf you just select all of your text, your\nwhole document, and then you go ahead and\n\n357\n00:19:26.984 --> 00:19:32.038\nupdate your fields, then all the fields\nin your document will updated.\n\n358\n00:19:32.038 --> 00:19:33.750\nBe careful if you have table of content.\n\n359\n00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.650\nIt's gonna give you that whole like,\nhey, do you want to change the table,\n\n360\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.450\nthat kind of fun stuff.\n\n361\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.370\nSo just in case you're\nusing cross preferences.\n\n362\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.390\nSo we've talk about removing\nthe ones that has so\n\n363\n00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:50.200\ngreat be able to change the numbering.\n\n364\n00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.130\nWhat about, I need to,\nwe also went over the options that,\n\n365\n00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.330\nI'm just consulting my notes to make sure\nI'm covering everything for you guys.\n\n366\n00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.980\nWe talked about how we could change with\nthe options for converting our footnotes\n\n367\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.810\nto endnotes, or endnotes to footnotes\nthat was all greyed out for me.\n\n368\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.510\n[LAUGH] Or you can change,\nyour foot note numbering,\n\n369\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:13.410\nlocation, the renumbering, all those\noptions we just did in a little bit.\n\n370\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.615\nBut one thing about the converting,\nremember how I said those options were\n\n371\n00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:20.610\ngreyed out and it was kind of like,\ndidn't really like that?\n\n372\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:25.320\nYou can say if this one right here that\nI have, that is a very good thing.\n\n373\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.970\nLet's see what that\nactually is referring to.\n\n374\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.540\nLet's go to the footnote.\n\n375\n00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.710\nAlice was not a bit hurt.\n\n376\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.445\nThat is a good thing, isn't Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n377\n00:20:32.445 --> 00:20:36.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can go individually and\n\n378\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:41.450\ntake this footnote, this one footnote,\nand convert it to an endnote.\n\n379\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.570\nMaybe I need to put that there.\n\n380\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:48.440\nSo you can go through and\nconvert individual ones and\n\n381\n00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.410\nmake footnote, endnote, or\nyou can make your end notes.\n\n382\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.480\nThis one might be a little bit\nmore like across the board.\n\n383\n00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.640\nCuz the endnotes, they all go at the end.\n\n384\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.000\nYou could select them all and\nthen you can convert those to footnotes.\n\n385\n00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.560\nAnd the same place,\n\n386\n00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.110\nthey're gonna still have your same\nreferences in the same place.\n\n387\n00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.140\nIt's gonna update everything and\n\n388\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.530\nit's gonna put the notes back\ninto the specific pages.\n\n389\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.610\nAnd then that's one of those,\nit's a little easier.\n\n390\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:22.045\nConverting all footnotes to\nendnotes should be in that option.\n\n391\n00:21:22.045 --> 00:21:23.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.010\n&gt;&gt; You're just gonna have to trust me, and\n\n393\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.290\nif it doesn't, well I guess you still have\nthe backup of doing every individual one.\n\n394\n00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.569\nNot as fun though.\n\n395\n00:21:31.569 --> 00:21:36.959\n[LAUGH] So there you go, notice that\nnow it becomes a endnote to footnotes.\n\n396\n00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:41.566\nWow, I feel like I've said those\ntwo words a lot in this episode.\n\n397\n00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:42.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:42.766\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n399\n00:21:42.766 --> 00:21:48.910\nthen the last one that I want to point\nout is yes, removing a single, right?\n\n400\n00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.996\nBut removing all of them.\n\n401\n00:21:49.996 --> 00:21:55.370\nMaybe I've gotten this paper and\nit is my job to clean everything up and\n\n402\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.690\nyou know what, the person who did it\nbefore me, it's just all sorts of wrong.\n\n403\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:05.050\nSometimes it's easier to start over,\nclean house, and go from the beginning.\n\n404\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.570\nIn this it's just like when we did\n\n405\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.020\nthe index entries.\n\n406\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.830\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Remember\n\n407\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.500\nthat Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n408\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.340\n&gt;&gt; And we had a special\n\n409\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.850\ncode.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n410\n00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:12.930\n&gt;&gt; This one's a little easier, but\n\n411\n00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.210\nit's the same idea.\n\n412\n00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.719\nYou're going to need to go into\nthe advanced find and replace.\n\n413\n00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.180\nAnd right here what am I finding?\n\n414\n00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.020\nThe neat thing is you don't\nhave to remember the code like\n\n415\n00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.270\nthe end of centuries.\n\n416\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.110\nGo to the options and\ngo to the special, it's right here.\n\n417\n00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:35.632\nEndnote, foonote, if you had both,\nyou'd to make sure you do it twice, and\n\n418\n00:22:35.632 --> 00:22:37.938\ndo you see, it's just like a carrot f.\n\n419\n00:22:37.938 --> 00:22:42.049\nSo take the footnotes,\neeplace with nothing and\n\n420\n00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:46.471\nthen replace all and\nit takes all of your footnotes.\n\n421\n00:22:46.471 --> 00:22:51.030\nSo it's a little easier, but same idea and\nyou could do it with both and\n\n422\n00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.440\nthen you can go ahead and start over.\n\n423\n00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.200\nAnd that is kind of nice.\n\n424\n00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.590\nI kept all my text there.\n\n425\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.430\nThat's very nice.\n\n426\n00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.520\nOkay, well you know what,\nyou probably have to go ahead.\n\n427\n00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.020\nIt would just convert it to text,\ndidn't it?\n\n428\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.090\nWell, that wasn't as simple as I though\nit would there Ronnie, wouldn't it.\n\n429\n00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.240\nThat's kind of odd.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that is kind of odd.\n\n430\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.750\n&gt;&gt; Well that just kind of backfired on me.\n\n431\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.910\nOkay, well you know what,\n\n432\n00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.082\nthis would be something you always\nsave a copy that doesn't happen.\n\n433\n00:23:22.082 --> 00:23:25.420\nAll right yeah, you know what?\n\n434\n00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.920\nThat might be a little interesting.\n\n435\n00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:33.110\nI'm not sure how I would get rid of all\nthe footnote text and the references.\n\n436\n00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.230\nCuz it seems like it just took out\n\n437\n00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.060\nthe numbers.\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n\n438\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.280\n&gt;&gt; It did, didn't it?\n\n439\n00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.880\nOkay, well hopefully you don't have a lot\nof them and you go through and find each.\n\n440\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.751\nThis one, honestly if I wanted to\nmake sure I would do this right I\n\n441\n00:23:44.751 --> 00:23:48.313\nwould come over here to the references,\nI would go to the very first footnote and\n\n442\n00:23:48.313 --> 00:23:50.615\nthen just go [SOUND], and\njust start deleting them.\n\n443\n00:23:50.615 --> 00:23:53.198\nMight take me an hour if\nI have a 150 pages, but\n\n444\n00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:56.100\nhopefully you don't have\nthat many footnotes.\n\n445\n00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.045\nRemember we talked about it, it said,\n\n446\n00:23:58.045 --> 00:23:58.700\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n447\n00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.800\n&gt;&gt; So all right,\n\n448\n00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.655\nso little bit of a backup on that one.\n\n449\n00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:06.632\n[LAUGH] You should always, Back up,\nback up, back up, back up,\n\n450\n00:24:06.632 --> 00:24:07.263\nright?\n&gt;&gt; No doubt.\n\n451\n00:24:07.263 --> 00:24:08.588\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n452\n00:24:08.588 --> 00:24:09.325\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\n\n453\n00:24:09.325 --> 00:24:12.812\nthere's no doubt that having a good backup\nis something that we definitely want to do\n\n454\n00:24:12.812 --> 00:24:15.310\nbefore we start messing\naround with our documents.\n\n455\n00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.300\nNow Vonne, you mentioned that we\ncould remove these one at a time.\n\n456\n00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.719\nIs there a way that we can actually\nremove all of them at one time?\n\n457\n00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:23.328\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good question,\n\n458\n00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:27.715\nbecause I do like to make\nlittle suggestions to people.\n\n459\n00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:30.837\nWhen they start doing these\nlong document processes, or\n\n460\n00:24:30.837 --> 00:24:35.000\nprocesses like adding footnotes and\nthen when get into adding captions, or\n\n461\n00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.220\neven index entries, keep a clean version.\n\n462\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.595\nBut you don't always get that luxury,\n\n463\n00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:41.772\ncuz you might be taking this\nover from somebody else, right?\n\n464\n00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:45.520\nSo I don't have it,\nhow can I get rid of them?\n\n465\n00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.170\nJust like we did with the index entries\nwhere we had to find that special,\n\n466\n00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.510\nthere was like a carat and\na D space XE, I think it was.\n\n467\n00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.560\nYou can do the same thing\nin our advance find and\n\n468\n00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.440\nreplace to get rid of all of your\nendnotes and your footnotes.\n\n469\n00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.751\nYou have to do two separate rounds,\n\n470\n00:25:00.751 --> 00:25:02.906\nyou'd find all your endnotes,\nfind all your footnotes.\n\n471\n00:25:02.906 --> 00:25:06.299\nThe nice thing is, you don't have\nto remember the special characters,\n\n472\n00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:08.646\nit's in the specials, so\nwhy don't we see this.\n\n473\n00:25:08.646 --> 00:25:12.576\nSo if we come back up\ninto our advanced find,\n\n474\n00:25:12.576 --> 00:25:19.315\nwhich is over in our Edit menu and\nwe go to Find Advanced &gt; Find and Replace.\n\n475\n00:25:19.315 --> 00:25:24.220\nYou can come here, and notice that down\nhere on the special, if this isn't\n\n476\n00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.350\nshown in where you have all the options,\nit's just that button right there.\n\n477\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.090\nIn the special,\nwe have endnote and footnote.\n\n478\n00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:35.420\nAnd actually, you can see that I was\nalready trying to do this before our\n\n479\n00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.720\nepisode there, Ronnie, because I\nalready had this inserted in there.\n\n480\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.500\nThat's what you can do, before I start,\nlet's just do one thing.\n\n481\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.040\nI just wanna zoom out a little bit, so\n\n482\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.340\nwe can see them all going away,\nlike a big picture type thing.\n\n483\n00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.001\nAnd I'll put my cursor somewhere in there,\nwe'll Edit, we'll Find,\n\n484\n00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:56.495\nwe'll go back to there and\npretend that wasn't there to begin with.\n\n485\n00:25:56.495 --> 00:26:00.482\nGo down into our special, and\nlet's find all of our footnotes.\n\n486\n00:26:00.482 --> 00:26:05.910\nYou can see [LAUGH] just redoing it,\nwe're gonna replace with what?\n\n487\n00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.810\nWe're not replacing it with anything,\nso we're gonna leave that blank.\n\n488\n00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.640\nAnd when we click on the Replace All,\nit should go through.\n\n489\n00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.090\nIt's all done, we've made our ten\nreplacements, that's wonderful.\n\n490\n00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:20.210\nI close this, and\nthere you go, it's all gone.\n\n491\n00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:25.050\nSo it's nice that it's that simple of\nwhere we don't have to do anything crazy.\n\n492\n00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.970\nBut if you did have endnotes,\nyou would just do that the same.\n\n493\n00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:32.980\nYou would do it again, and then just use\nfind all endnotes and replace with blank.\n\n494\n00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.708\nAnd then all of those references or\nnotes are gone, and\n\n495\n00:26:35.708 --> 00:26:37.379\nthen you can start from scratch.\n\n496\n00:26:37.379 --> 00:26:40.506\nAnd start over inserting\nyour own footnotes and\n\n497\n00:26:40.506 --> 00:26:43.880\nendnotes into the places\nwhere you want them to be.\n\n498\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.485\nSo not too terribly hard, and you don't\nhave to remember any special codes,\n\n499\n00:26:46.485 --> 00:26:48.478\njust go to the special.\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, well,\n\n500\n00:26:48.478 --> 00:26:52.202\nthank you again for helping us out here\nas we deal with endnotes and footnotes.\n\n501\n00:26:52.202 --> 00:26:55.377\nThis is one of those things that\nyou'll probably end up, of course,\n\n502\n00:26:55.377 --> 00:26:57.421\ndealing with as you write academic papers.\n\n503\n00:26:57.421 --> 00:27:01.776\nOr if you're actually writing a technical\npaper or an article for some magazine,\n\n504\n00:27:01.776 --> 00:27:05.865\nit is possible that you'll see that\nthey ask you for endnotes or footnotes.\n\n505\n00:27:05.865 --> 00:27:09.640\nVonne is just showing us how,\ninside of Word, it can work very easily.\n\n506\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.854\nAnd the idea of us trying to move back and\nforth, and creating and recreating them.\n\n507\n00:27:13.854 --> 00:27:17.130\nThat is all reality as you're\nmaking a paper like this up.\n\n508\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.580\nThey're just thinking about them and\ngoing,\n\n509\n00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.810\nwow, that was kind of weird\nhow we had to do that.\n\n510\n00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.410\nBut that is the reality,\nas you write papers, you'll remove some,\n\n511\n00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.340\nyou'll add some in, you'll take some out.\n\n512\n00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.344\nYou'll change it,\nbecause it's the style and everything.\n\n513\n00:27:27.344 --> 00:27:31.495\nSo there's a lot of differences here, but\nis worth your time and effort to actually\n\n514\n00:27:31.495 --> 00:27:35.440\nlearn All right Vonne, any other words?\n&gt;&gt; I just wanted to kind of point out\n\n515\n00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.778\nthat thing you just said at the very end.\n\n516\n00:27:37.778 --> 00:27:42.666\nCuz I've been the person designing\na technical manuscript or\n\n517\n00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:45.680\na textbook, or even annual reports.\n\n518\n00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.911\nAnd I think everything's great,\nthey go ahead and give me it, and\n\n519\n00:27:48.911 --> 00:27:51.693\nthere's at least six rounds\nof revisions to go through.\n\n520\n00:27:51.693 --> 00:27:54.798\nAnd like, we need to change this\nfootnote and have it go over here and\n\n521\n00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:56.220\nblah blah blah, goodness.\n\n522\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:03.901\nSo I can't emphasize enough how awesome\nit is to have it kind of just fix itself.\n\n523\n00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:08.939\nAnd all the options that Word gives\nus in these more advanced features.\n\n524\n00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:13.255\nLike the index, the table of contents and\nthe cross references, and the,\n\n525\n00:28:13.255 --> 00:28:14.430\nwhat did we just do?\n\n526\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.117\nThe footnotes and endnotes, it just,\nyeah, It's made my life a lot easier.\n\n527\n00:28:19.117 --> 00:28:22.575\nSo you can tell that I've done this\nquite a few times, so yes, you're so\n\n528\n00:28:22.575 --> 00:28:25.238\nvery right [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, thank you for\n\n529\n00:28:25.238 --> 00:28:28.793\nhelping us once again, and\nthank you also for joining us here,\n\n530\n00:28:28.793 --> 00:28:31.650\nwith the Word 2016 expert show

00:00:19.240\nYou're watching the Word\n2016 Expert show for Mac.\n\n4\n00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.100\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n5\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.460\nwe'll be taking a look at working\nwith captions and table of figures.\n\n6\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.490\nAnd here to help us to\nunderstand that better, and\n\n7\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.710\neven tell us what a table of figures\nactually means, is gonna be, well,\n\n8\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.640\nour Office Pro prima donna herself,\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.736\nVonne, how are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing lovely.\n\n10\n00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:38.959\nI like prima donna.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n11\n00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:40.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.800\n&gt;&gt; It takes me back to my ballet days.\n\n13\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.350\n&gt;&gt; That is what it is designed\n\n14\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.170\nto do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.510\n&gt;&gt; So show us, Vonne, how you do, no.\n\n16\n00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.140\nGo ahead.\n\n17\n00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.220\nSpin on your toes and there you go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne, here we are.\n\n19\n00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.200\nWe're taking a look at captions and\ntable of figures.\n\n20\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.470\nI think I know what a caption is, but\n\n21\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.470\na table of figures, what is this about?\n&gt;&gt; I saw where you're like,\n\n22\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.990\nokay what are we doing, all right.\n\n23\n00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.080\nLike you said captions,\nokay we have captions on an image.\n\n24\n00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.320\nI'm already thinking of closed captioning.\n\n25\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.336\nBut it's really just kind\nof showing you what is the-\n\n26\n00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:17.299\n&gt;&gt; Telling you what\n\n27\n00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.508\nyou're.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:24.315\nWell then, a table of figures is\nwhat do you usually put captions on?\n\n29\n00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:29.410\nImages, maybe diagrams, maybe tables.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n30\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.770\n&gt;&gt; Those are all\n\n31\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.450\nfigures.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n32\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.870\nMakes sense.\n&gt;&gt; It's just like a table of contents\n\n33\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.270\nwhere it's going to list, and\nwhat does a table of contents hold?\n\n34\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.940\nDo you remember from our\nother episode that's\n\n35\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.830\npulling out all of your?\n&gt;&gt; Headers,\n\n36\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.393\nheadings.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n37\n00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:43.320\nheadings.\n&gt;&gt; Headings.\n\n38\n00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.820\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n39\n00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.410\n&gt;&gt; And headers.\n\n40\n00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.140\n&gt;&gt; So table of contents is going to\n\n41\n00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.480\nbe connected to your heading one,\nheading two, heading three.\n\n42\n00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.333\nYour table of figures is going\nto be connected to the captions\n\n43\n00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:58.505\nthat you place on your graphical elements.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n44\n00:01:58.505 --> 00:01:59.615\n&gt;&gt; And look at that nice\n\n45\n00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:04.135\nsegway from our Word advanced\nright into our Word expert series.\n\n46\n00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:08.985\nSo if you don't know how to insert\na table or insert a smart art graphic, or\n\n47\n00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:14.275\ninsert a picture, then you're probably\ngoing to be very confused about why or\n\n48\n00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:19.320\nhow you would even add a caption\nto those said graphical objects.\n\n49\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.190\nNice, so that's how they all tie together.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n50\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.800\n&gt;&gt; And so it's pretty neat, pretty great,\n\n51\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.520\nand in a long document you might\nneed to be labelling the pictures.\n\n52\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.060\nThe textbook that I do the layout for, the\nanatomy and physiology textbook that I do\n\n53\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.150\nthe entire design for, all of\nthe pictures in the book are labelled.\n\n54\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.490\nIt's like figure1.whatever-something.\n\n55\n00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.040\nBecause, think about it, in an anatomy and\n\n56\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.200\nphysiology textbook you're going to need-\n&gt;&gt; A lot of figures [LAUGH].\n\n57\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n58\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.970\nyou're going to need to refer to\nthose figures as an instructor.\n\n59\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.850\nLike go ahead and\nlook on page bla bla, figure 2, great.\n\n60\n00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.430\nSo another way of adding structure in\nan organization to your document if it\n\n61\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.980\nis having a lot of graphical elements,\nand then where to find them on the page.\n\n62\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.890\nAnd as long as you add them, pull them\nout, put them in as a table, you're great.\n\n63\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.730\n&gt;&gt; The idea of the table sounds great too,\n\n64\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.200\nbecause it allows me to\nhave it in one location.\n\n65\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.660\nWhen I'm looking for\nsomething specific, instead of going,\n\n66\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.220\nI remember seeing that somewhere and\nthen trying to flip through the book and\n\n67\n00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.900\nfind exactly what I want to, having that\ntable of figures there in one location,\n\n68\n00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.520\nit really is kind of a nice hint that\ngets you there very quickly if you're not\n\n69\n00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.530\nsearching the whole book.\n&gt;&gt; And just like our table of contents\n\n70\n00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.570\nhelps you there, your index, and the back\nof where you go ahead and find these.\n\n71\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.860\nAll things that we find in our books,\nin our day to day lives,\n\n72\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.860\nif you've gone through\nany type of schooling.\n\n73\n00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.070\nSo now it's kinda neat to be able\nto see how we can create it.\n\n74\n00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.780\nSo I have an example that we can start\nwith so you can see one that's done.\n\n75\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.808\nAnd then I'll show you how to do it.\n\n76\n00:03:58.808 --> 00:04:02.666\nSo we have our long document example.\n\n77\n00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:05.560\nIt has all of the different\npieces in here.\n\n78\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.140\nAnd if we look at, here's our table\nof contents, and then our table of\n\n79\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.070\nimages, table of tables,\n[LAUGH] table of figures.\n\n80\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.120\nJust do take notice of image,\ntable, figure.\n\n81\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.240\nBecause those are the different\nlabels that I have on the captions\n\n82\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.439\nof my graphical elements.\n\n83\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.570\nNeat.\nAnd these are hyperlinks, so\n\n84\n00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.110\nif I click on the first one it will\ntake me to, it can't open, okay.\n\n85\n00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.750\nWell then, you know what?\n\n86\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.260\nNevermind, let's pretend that,\nthat didn't, you know what?\n\n87\n00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.010\nI bet you this is,\nI know why this is happening [LAUGH].\n\n88\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.640\nWell, I used these files for\nboth my PC and my Mac shows.\n\n89\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.240\nI was creating them on my Windows show,\nand that's why I was like.\n\n90\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.890\nYes, see right here.\n\n91\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.080\nIt says files is\nuser/jt/desktop/word/expert,\n\n92\n00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.250\nI know that that is my user\naccount on my virtual machines\n\n93\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.124\non my other Mac account on my PC.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:11.630\n&gt;&gt; That's the reason why it's not working.\n\n95\n00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.760\n&gt;&gt; It's trying to follow it all the way\n\n96\n00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.670\nback there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it-\n\n97\n00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.415\n&gt;&gt; It's not doing it.\n\n98\n00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:16.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nope, nope.\n\n99\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.285\nIt has too many divides to cross.\n\n100\n00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:22.620\n[LAUGH] But when you create your own,\nit will work when we make our own.\n\n101\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.330\nSo anyways,\nwe'll pretend that those hyperlinks work.\n\n102\n00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.200\nAnd then down right here,\nthat's all it is.\n\n103\n00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.780\nNotice that it says that this\nis the image one, white rabbit.\n\n104\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.635\nScroll down a little bit more.\n\n105\n00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.795\nLook at that cute little piggy,\nisn't he adorable?\n\n106\n00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:37.443\n&gt;&gt; Making buds.\n\n107\n00:05:37.443 --> 00:05:42.462\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We can go with that.\n\n108\n00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:46.735\nAnd then this is a different\ngraphical element, but\n\n109\n00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:49.657\nit's not image 3, it's a table.\n\n110\n00:05:49.657 --> 00:05:52.710\nIt's a different label that I have for\nthis picture caption.\n\n111\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.310\nThis one is above the table, this one is\nbelow the image, so you have that option.\n\n112\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.780\nAnd then if we keep on going down here,\nlook at this, image 3,\n\n113\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.710\nbaby sea turtles are so darn cute.\n&gt;&gt; So darn cute.\n\n114\n00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.890\n&gt;&gt; They got little green shells for\n\n115\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.050\nbathing suits.\n\n116\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.600\nOkay, sorry.\n\n117\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.838\nThis is [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did not know\n\n118\n00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:12.620\nthat song.\n\n119\n00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.207\n&gt;&gt; This is-\n\n120\n00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:14.087\n&gt;&gt; Beyonce?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n121\n00:06:14.087 --> 00:06:16.768\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n122\n00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:19.280\n&gt;&gt; No, this is a song that I leanred as\n\n123\n00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.530\na child-\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n124\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.440\n&gt;&gt; Growing up in Stewart,\n\n125\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.810\nFlorida, going to the Environmental\nStudies Center where we learned\n\n126\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.780\nabout baby sea turtles and their green-\n&gt;&gt; Bathing suits.\n\n127\n00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Shells as bathing suits.\n\n128\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.880\nAnd their flippers\nflapped like angel wings.\n\n129\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.375\nBaby sea turtles are funny little things.\n\n130\n00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:41.258\nIt's all [LAUGH] about this [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all about\n\n131\n00:06:41.258 --> 00:06:44.030\nthe baby.\n&gt;&gt; It's all about learning about how\n\n132\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.728\nbright lights lead them astray-\n&gt;&gt; And we have turn off the lights and\n\n133\n00:06:48.728 --> 00:06:50.384\nhelp them on their way.\n\n134\n00:06:50.384 --> 00:06:54.826\n[SOUND] Yeah so\nthen [LAUGH] you're probably like wow.\n\n135\n00:06:54.826 --> 00:06:55.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:56.417\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n137\n00:06:56.417 --> 00:07:00.782\nanyways, that's why I went ahead and put\nthis caption in here for this particular\n\n138\n00:07:00.782 --> 00:07:03.410\npicture cuz it reminds me of turtles.\n&gt;&gt; The\n\n139\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.145\nsong?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n140\n00:07:04.145 --> 00:07:06.900\n[LAUGH] And you notice that\nthey're all changing the numbers.\n\n141\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.820\nThis is a figure, so\nthis is something different.\n\n142\n00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.030\nGreat, I have different labels\nthat I can put on my captions, and\n\n143\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:19.480\nas long as I use them consistently,\nI can then generate a table of\n\n144\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:27.320\nwhatever the label is on\nthat particular figure.\n\n145\n00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.300\nYes, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; White buffalo is the one,\n\n146\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.310\nI can see the rest of them.\n\n147\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.900\nWhite buffalo is [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we call him,\n\n148\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.750\nhe's kind of large and rotund.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.510\n&gt;&gt; And he's white, so we call him,\n\n150\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.160\nwhite buffalo.\n\n151\n00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.840\n&gt;&gt; White buffalo.\n\n152\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n\n153\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.800\n&gt;&gt; And Bishop is very tiny, so\n\n154\n00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.796\nwe call him penicl cat.\n\n155\n00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:44.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n156\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.630\n[LAUGH] We will close this document,\nand we will go\n\n157\n00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.110\ninto showing you how to actually put\nthis in to a file called captions.\n\n158\n00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.447\nWe start our captions file, same thing.\n\n159\n00:07:55.447 --> 00:07:56.432\nGot our picture.\n\n160\n00:07:56.432 --> 00:07:59.361\nHow do I put in, A caption.\n\n161\n00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:05.756\nPretty easy, you select the item that you\nwant to add to it, in this case, an image.\n\n162\n00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:08.891\nYou can right click, I think it's\nthe easiest way to do this, and\n\n163\n00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:10.783\nit should be down a little bit further.\n\n164\n00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:13.336\nThere's Insert Caption, this would be for\n\n165\n00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:17.040\nany graphical element that\nyou have in your document.\n\n166\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.012\nAnd once I have my, once I right click and\ngo ahead and get to this dialog box,\n\n167\n00:08:22.012 --> 00:08:24.597\nI have a, here we go, Insert Caption.\n\n168\n00:08:24.597 --> 00:08:30.390\nNote, right now,\non my example, the labels.\n\n169\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.431\nI have extra ones that if you've never\ndone this before you are not going to\n\n170\n00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:35.417\nsee some of them.\n\n171\n00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:36.140\nThis is kind of like,\n\n172\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.798\nremember when we did the bibliography?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n173\n00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:39.918\n&gt;&gt; And we had our master list where we\n\n174\n00:08:39.918 --> 00:08:42.430\nhad if you add them in other documents.\n\n175\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.820\nIt's kind of got this,\n[LAUGH], master list, and\n\n176\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.901\nit remembers everything, same thing here.\n\n177\n00:08:48.901 --> 00:08:54.949\nIs that it remembers what labels I\nhave created from other files and\n\n178\n00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:58.280\nthen gives me that option here.\n\n179\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.569\nBecause, in another document,\nI had gone into this new label.\n\n180\n00:09:03.569 --> 00:09:08.712\nBecause maybe you wanted to\nhave diagram as the label for\n\n181\n00:09:08.712 --> 00:09:13.746\nthis particular caption,\nor ITPRO pictures.\n\n182\n00:09:13.746 --> 00:09:16.168\nAnything you want to do,\nyou would go ahead and click here, and\n\n183\n00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:16.911\nthen type that in.\n\n184\n00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:24.100\nAnd that's why I have an option for Image,\nand I also have one for Graphic, okay.\n\n185\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.501\nSo this one, since I've already\ncreated that new label, and\n\n186\n00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:28.962\nyou would do the same thing,\njust make a new label, type it up.\n\n187\n00:09:28.962 --> 00:09:33.967\nI'm going to click on Image, and\nhere we go, I will do a Image 1,\n\n188\n00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:37.430\ncolon, and we will just say, White Rabbit.\n\n189\n00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.183\nLovely, do I want it to go below or above?\n\n190\n00:09:41.183 --> 00:09:45.867\nI would like it to go below,\nhow do I want it to be numbered,\n\n191\n00:09:45.867 --> 00:09:48.270\ndo I want letters or numbers?\n\n192\n00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.148\nThat sounds good,\nI don't have any chapter numbers, and\n\n193\n00:09:52.148 --> 00:09:56.831\nthe chapter numbers are associated\nwith a particular heading style.\n\n194\n00:09:56.831 --> 00:09:59.470\nThey're not just going to\nautomatically be generated.\n\n195\n00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.865\nIf you do not have that particular\nstyle that includes it,\n\n196\n00:10:02.865 --> 00:10:04.955\nit doesn't really make any sense.\n\n197\n00:10:04.955 --> 00:10:09.320\nSo I'm going to cancel this,\nbecause I like the numbers, that's great.\n\n198\n00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.533\nThe Exclude label from caption just takes\nout a label, I'm just going to keep it.\n\n199\n00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:15.763\nYeah, Ronnie's like, hm,\n\n200\n00:10:15.763 --> 00:10:17.818\nI'm not sure why I'd want to do that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH],\n\n201\n00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:18.862\nif I'm going to create a caption,\n\n202\n00:10:18.862 --> 00:10:21.463\nI don't know why I'd exclude it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because that's kind of the whole\n\n203\n00:10:21.463 --> 00:10:23.531\nidea about having a label on a caption.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:24.265\n&gt;&gt; Go figure.\n\n205\n00:10:24.265 --> 00:10:24.993\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:10:24.993 --> 00:10:27.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The Auto Caption,\n\n207\n00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:33.380\nthis is where it's adding automatic\ncaptions for specific Microsoft items.\n\n208\n00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.494\nNotice it's a Word table,\na Word doc, and Excel worksheet.\n\n209\n00:10:37.494 --> 00:10:39.280\nIf you're doing embedded or\nlinked objects,\n\n210\n00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.895\nthat's where it could do the automatic.\n\n211\n00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:43.106\nIt's not going to be like enter image,\n\n212\n00:10:43.106 --> 00:10:46.804\nbecause it can't pull that type\nof information automatically.\n\n213\n00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:50.294\nSo I personally don't, oops, sorry,\nI, [LAUGH], clicked Cancel and\n\n214\n00:10:50.294 --> 00:10:51.585\nwent all the way out of it.\n\n215\n00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:54.675\nThat's all right,\nwe'll get back into it by right clicking,\n\n216\n00:10:54.675 --> 00:10:56.029\nchange this back to Image.\n\n217\n00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:58.199\nBut that's why I don't use auto captions.\n\n218\n00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:02.227\nBecause it's usually information\nthat I'm generating on my own and\n\n219\n00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:05.470\nnot connected to all that\nstuff that it recognizes.\n\n220\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.253\nSo we'll just go back to here,\nwe did have, yeah, it is an image.\n\n221\n00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:14.075\nOkay, White Rabbit, and lovely,\nwe just click OK, and there you go.\n\n222\n00:11:14.075 --> 00:11:19.226\nThe neat thing is, it adds it as\nits own text box, see how this\n\n223\n00:11:19.226 --> 00:11:24.922\nis not really connecting to the picture?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n224\n00:11:24.922 --> 00:11:27.486\n&gt;&gt; Making sure that you understand that if\n\n225\n00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:31.065\nI move this picture,\nthe textbox doesn't go with it.\n\n226\n00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:32.788\nAnd actually I don't know where it went,\n[LAUGH], so\n\n227\n00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:34.520\nwe're just going to go ahead and\nundo that.\n\n228\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.300\nThey are two separate entities,\nthis is one, this is another,\n\n229\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.730\nso you could format this,\nif you wanted to, separately.\n\n230\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.117\nI usually just keep the default because\nI don't want to change the font and\n\n231\n00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:47.260\neverything.\n\n232\n00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.380\nBut, if you did, remember, there's always\nthe styles, and they're connected.\n\n233\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.378\nAnd if you wanted to change it,\nmake your own style, or go ahead and\n\n234\n00:11:56.378 --> 00:12:00.480\nmodify the existing style,\nupdate your selection.\n\n235\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.432\nSo all the things that apply for\nformatting apply here, too.\n\n236\n00:12:05.432 --> 00:12:09.280\nAnd notice it does have its\ncurrent style as Caption.\n\n237\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.189\nSo then you would go ahead and\nmodify it and all that kind of stuff.\n\n238\n00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:17.108\nOther episodes, other shows that we talk\nabout, style definitions, lovely, great,\n\n239\n00:12:17.108 --> 00:12:19.410\nthat's how I add a caption.\n\n240\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.424\nSo let's keep on adding a few more,\n\n241\n00:12:21.424 --> 00:12:25.333\nwe won't go through the entire\ndocument because it's a lot of work.\n\n242\n00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:28.847\nAnd I don't need you to see me do\nthe exact same thing a bunch of times, but\n\n243\n00:12:28.847 --> 00:12:29.436\njust a few.\n\n244\n00:12:29.436 --> 00:12:33.834\nWe'll say, Cute Pig, great,\nit is an image, I want it below,\n\n245\n00:12:33.834 --> 00:12:37.070\nwe click OK, perfect, lovely.\n\n246\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.357\nLittle side note, I'm going to go\nahead and put this right in here.\n\n247\n00:12:39.357 --> 00:12:43.310\nYou see how I moved my text down a little\nbit because it's adding another element\n\n248\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.260\ninto my document.\n\n249\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.882\nThis is one of those,\n\n250\n00:12:46.882 --> 00:12:52.478\nback to the whole you should probably do\nthis last after everything is in place.\n\n251\n00:12:52.478 --> 00:12:56.509\nAll of your text is in there, a lot of\nthese things, even the footnotes and\n\n252\n00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:59.580\nendnotes, yeah,\nmaybe that you can do as you go along.\n\n253\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.644\nBut I don't know, when you're doing so\nmuch editing in the beginning,\n\n254\n00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:08.476\nI kind of like it getting\ninto its final resting place.\n\n255\n00:13:08.476 --> 00:13:12.256\nThen adding some of these things\nlike captions and everything,\n\n256\n00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:16.179\ncuz that way it's not going to\nmove around significantly, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:19.883\nAnd I always make a copy that doesn't have\nany of this, because back up, back up,\n\n258\n00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:22.350\nback up, we're always good about that.\n\n259\n00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.783\nSo now, this is a different type of\ngraphical element, so on this one,\n\n260\n00:13:25.783 --> 00:13:26.536\nit's a table.\n\n261\n00:13:26.536 --> 00:13:30.350\nI'm going to come up, and whoops,\nI'm going to select the whole table,\n\n262\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.110\nright click, Insert Caption.\n\n263\n00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.197\nI really think it's\nthe easiest way to do it, and\n\n264\n00:13:35.197 --> 00:13:38.374\nthis one is not an image,\nso this would be a Table.\n\n265\n00:13:38.374 --> 00:13:43.276\nAnd we will say a Seaturtle,\nlet's get a space in it, Sea Turtles,\n\n266\n00:13:43.276 --> 00:13:46.750\nwhoops, that's not how you spell turtle.\n\n267\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.990\nOkay, I just wanted to make sure I\ndidn't have anything else written in\n\n268\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.857\nthere, perfect.\n\n269\n00:13:50.857 --> 00:13:55.034\nThis one, maybe above, and\nthat's the default positioning,\n\n270\n00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:59.070\nit sounds great, we'll click OK,\nperfect, keep on going.\n\n271\n00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.099\nWe already have one of those,\nhere's a figure, right?\n\n272\n00:14:03.099 --> 00:14:06.559\nSo let's go ahead and\nadd a caption on, wait,\n\n273\n00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:11.560\nI need to select the whole outside of\nthe graphical element, there we go.\n\n274\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.708\nThat's why I didn't get that\nInsert Caption, so be careful about that.\n\n275\n00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:17.292\nIf you were right clicking\nin a cell of a table,\n\n276\n00:14:17.292 --> 00:14:20.420\nyou probably wouldn't get\nthe Insert Caption either.\n\n277\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.571\nIt has to be selected on the entire\nelement, and this one, we will, it's like,\n\n278\n00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:26.354\nI don't understand what this is.\n\n279\n00:14:26.354 --> 00:14:33.280\nWe'll go with Figure, and it will not\ngive me that option, I'm not sure why.\n\n280\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.429\nLet's try, okay, well,\nhm, that was a weird,\n\n281\n00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:40.613\nthis does happen sometimes,\nwe actually talked about this off camera.\n\n282\n00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:42.718\nSometimes you click the refresh and\n\n283\n00:14:42.718 --> 00:14:47.340\nit doesn't really kind of get it perfect,\nso let's try it one more time.\n\n284\n00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.109\nAnd we will go with Figure and\nwe will, you know what?\n\n285\n00:14:51.109 --> 00:14:53.750\nLet's just go ahead and do above the item.\n\n286\n00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:58.599\nIt did Figure 1, and then we'll just\ntype in the rest of the text, and\n\n287\n00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:00.345\nwe'll say, Cats.\n\n288\n00:15:00.345 --> 00:15:03.932\nBecause that is, right there,\nit is gray, so it's a field.\n\n289\n00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:06.567\nFor some reason it wasn't\nletting me type it in,\n\n290\n00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:09.265\nbut all of the rest of this\nis just regular text, so\n\n291\n00:15:09.265 --> 00:15:11.654\nhey, work arounds, right, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n292\n00:15:11.654 --> 00:15:12.685\n&gt;&gt; It's always good to have.\n\n293\n00:15:12.685 --> 00:15:17.365\nOkay, perfect, so\nnow I've got some different captions,\n\n294\n00:15:17.365 --> 00:15:20.370\nI've used three different labels.\n\n295\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.933\nWe have Images, Tables, and Figures, and\n\n296\n00:15:22.933 --> 00:15:26.622\nif I had multiples,\nthen everything would work out just fine.\n\n297\n00:15:26.622 --> 00:15:30.100\nLet's pretend I've done\nthe entire document, right?\n\n298\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.425\nI'm ready to generate\nthat table of figures.\n\n299\n00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:37.824\nBack up here to the beginning\nof the document,\n\n300\n00:15:37.824 --> 00:15:41.320\nput our cursor in front\nof Alice in Wonderland.\n\n301\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.699\nWe're going to do a command enter or\n\n302\n00:15:43.699 --> 00:15:47.439\ncommand return to be able to\ncreate a manual page break.\n\n303\n00:15:47.439 --> 00:15:50.064\nLet's turn on that show and\nhide so we can see it.\n\n304\n00:15:50.064 --> 00:15:54.076\nPut your cursor in front of it,\nenter twice, just to make some space, and\n\n305\n00:15:54.076 --> 00:15:55.889\nwe will go into our References And\n\n306\n00:15:55.889 --> 00:16:00.971\nthen, there's the insert caption button if\nyou don't like the right click, Ronnie.\n\n307\n00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:01.951\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n308\n00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:04.870\n&gt;&gt; I wanna insert table of figures.\n\n309\n00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.610\nSo everything's labeled properly,\nwe're fine.\n\n310\n00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.920\nSo now it's saying, okay, well great.\n\n311\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.770\nWell, then what label do\nyou want me to pull out?\n\n312\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.780\nIt sees that I have all the same\noptions that I had in my dropdown.\n\n313\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.310\nI don't have any equation,\nso it's not gonna work.\n\n314\n00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.010\nLet's go with image, there we go.\n\n315\n00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:26.320\nWhat our format needs to be looks very\nfamiliar to our table of contents,\n\n316\n00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.700\ncuz they're the tabs right across the top.\n\n317\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.510\nI do wanna show the page numbers.\n\n318\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.240\nI want to right align them,\nI wanna use hyperlinks.\n\n319\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.390\nI like that, I want my leader marks,\nI can pick here.\n\n320\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.580\nWe'll click okay, look at that.\n\n321\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.230\nIsn't that nice?\n\n322\n00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.640\nAnd I could do the same thing for\nmy table of tables,\n\n323\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.990\nand my table of, what do we call that?\n\n324\n00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.510\nWe called it a figure, didn't we?\n\n325\n00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.020\nYeah, table of figures.\n\n326\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.126\nThere's my figures, and\nthen one more just for fun.\n\n327\n00:16:57.126 --> 00:17:00.188\nWas our-\n&gt;&gt; Table.\n\n328\n00:17:00.188 --> 00:17:01.458\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n329\n00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:04.200\nAnd notice it didn't pull the tiles in,\nyou would put that in.\n\n330\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.920\nYou would go ahead and put your\ncursor right, use your left arrow,\n\n331\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.480\nenter, up, and\nthen we can save table of images, yes.\n\n332\n00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.290\nAnd I can't help it.\n\n333\n00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.710\nI need to, whoops, sorry,\nI need to format this.\n\n334\n00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.360\nWell, can't get away from it Ronnie.\n\n335\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.556\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n336\n00:17:25.556 --> 00:17:26.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Same thing for\n\n337\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.860\nour figure of cats and everything.\n\n338\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.220\nSee, it does work, okay?\n\n339\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.800\nCuz now it knows it's in\nthis particular document.\n\n340\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.480\nAwesome, we could stop there,\n\n341\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.680\nbut we should talk about what\nif I needed to change something?\n\n342\n00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.130\nWhat if I needed to add it something?\n\n343\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.930\nWhat if something went away?\n\n344\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.610\nAll of that stuff,\ncuz we've seen this in pretty\n\n345\n00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.540\nmuch everything we've done with\nthe table of contents, index.\n\n346\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.560\nWe're gonna update our fields, right?\n\n347\n00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.160\nWe add something in,\nremove something, all the numbers.\n\n348\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.978\nThe footnotes and\nendnotes [SOUND] were great, weren't they?\n\n349\n00:17:57.978 --> 00:18:00.770\nThey really went ahead and\nmade sure that everything updated.\n\n350\n00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:06.440\nThis one's a little more finicky.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n351\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.785\n&gt;&gt; We'll use that word, right?\n\n352\n00:18:07.785 --> 00:18:08.855\n&gt;&gt; Finicky is a good word.\n\n353\n00:18:08.855 --> 00:18:10.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A little not so much fun.\n\n354\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.490\nLet me show you.\n\n355\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.400\nLet's come back into here.\n\n356\n00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.240\nI'm scrolling up, by the way,\nwhile we're talking.\n\n357\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.520\nI need to add in another picture.\n\n358\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.230\nLet's just say in the beginning, cuz we\nknow that we had the white rabbit as one.\n\n359\n00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.330\nThe pig is two.\n\n360\n00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.480\nThe turtle is three.\n\n361\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.230\nMaybe I need to put in a new picture.\n\n362\n00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.890\nLet's insert a picture from file.\n\n363\n00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.190\nLet's pick, Ronnie,\n\n364\n00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.750\nwhat picture should we pick?\n&gt;&gt; It's gotta be a bunny picture.\n\n365\n00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.370\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n366\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.512\nHow about a cat?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's do a cat picture.\n\n367\n00:18:44.512 --> 00:18:45.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.830\n&gt;&gt; Usually, default answer is bunny.\n\n369\n00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.420\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n370\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.470\nare correct.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n371\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.440\n&gt;&gt; You are very much correct.\n\n372\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.200\nI don't have any bunny pictures.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go for\n\n373\n00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.040\ncats.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n374\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.715\nhow about Bishop?\n&gt;&gt; Bishop.\n\n375\n00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:56.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll go with Mr. Bish.\n\n376\n00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.185\nAnd he's really big.\n\n377\n00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:01.020\n[LAUGH] Isn't he beautiful?\n\n378\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.285\nLook at cute little-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he looks happy.\n\n379\n00:19:02.285 --> 00:19:05.328\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They love to get dressed up.\n\n380\n00:19:05.328 --> 00:19:06.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n381\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.850\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n382\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.070\nprobably should have found a smaller\npicture, but this is good enough.\n\n383\n00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.560\nSo here we go.\n\n384\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.420\nLet's put on the wrap text and\n\n385\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.200\nnow we'll add a caption.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n386\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.430\n&gt;&gt; But he's first,\n\n387\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.650\nisn't he?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n388\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.180\n&gt;&gt; So it should change.\n\n389\n00:19:23.348 --> 00:19:27.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n390\n00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.379\n&gt;&gt; I will insert this and\n\n391\n00:19:29.379 --> 00:19:31.000\nit will go to image.\n\n392\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.220\nIt will change to number one\nbecause it is the first.\n\n393\n00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.930\nAnd we will say Bishop and below, good.\n\n394\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.790\nWe click okay, image one.\n\n395\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.530\nAnd there's two.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n396\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.030\n&gt;&gt; And there's three.\n\n397\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.180\nHey, we're working.\n\n398\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:47.860\nI like this.\n\n399\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.070\nI'm thinking everything's doing okay.\n\n400\n00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:54.250\nA lot of times,\nif you add an image or anything,\n\n401\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:59.240\nand add a caption,\nit normally goes ahead and updates itself.\n\n402\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:06.330\nIt's when you delete things, that's\nwhere it might not do as well, okay?\n\n403\n00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.000\nSo let's take this out,\nlet's take out the picture.\n\n404\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.200\nBut remember, they are separate.\n\n405\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.860\nIf you really wanted\nthem to stay together,\n\n406\n00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.380\nyou could always group the two elements.\n\n407\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:20.890\nIt's just a image and a textbox, two\ngraphical elements, group them together.\n\n408\n00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.560\nLet's go ahead and delete this as well.\n\n409\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.090\nThat didn't change, did it Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; It did\n\n410\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.830\nnot.\n&gt;&gt; It didn't, no.\n\n411\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.514\nAnd the trick that we talked about\nin another episode is you could do\n\n412\n00:20:31.514 --> 00:20:36.680\na select all, Ctrl + A, and then\nthe keyword shortcut by the way is F9.\n\n413\n00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.150\nI'm wondering if this\nis actually gonna work.\n\n414\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.940\nIt might, it'll probably work, and\nit'll probably prove me wrong.\n\n415\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.870\nOkay, good, it didn't work.\n\n416\n00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.910\nAnd notice that, why is it doing this?\n\n417\n00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:51.500\nRemember, when you select all,\nyou're selecting all of your text.\n\n418\n00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.670\nAnd I have table of figures like a TOC.\n\n419\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.410\nSo it's like,\ndo I wanna update everything?\n\n420\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.190\nI always do entire table because you\nalways wanna do the entire table,\n\n421\n00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.270\nget everything, another table of figures.\n\n422\n00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.070\nOkay, let's update an entire table.\n\n423\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.990\nThere's another one.\n\n424\n00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.780\nI did have three, good.\n\n425\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.510\nThat still says image 2, doesn't it?\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n426\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.080\n&gt;&gt; It does, why is it doing that?\n\n427\n00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.570\nBecause when you do a select all, even\nthough it looked like it was highlighting\n\n428\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:24.050\nthe picture,\nit doesn't select all in the sense\n\n429\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.360\nof the text in a text box.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n430\n00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so do you see?\n\n431\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.090\nYeah, the text is kind of\nalmost in a separate layer,\n\n432\n00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:33.860\nif you wanna say.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n433\n00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.490\n&gt;&gt; So that's why the control A and\n\n434\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.850\nthen the update fields doesn't work.\n\n435\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.730\nSo how can I make this happen?\n\n436\n00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.940\nThere's actually a quick little fix.\n\n437\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.580\nYou just do a print preview.\n&gt;&gt; When you do a print preview, so\n\n438\n00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.655\nif I go to file, print, and let's just\nmake sure image too, okay there we go.\n\n439\n00:21:51.655 --> 00:21:56.590\nLet's go ahead and print, we go ahead and\nclick cancel and look, it's back.\n\n440\n00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.020\nThere you go, so that's a quick fix.\n\n441\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.220\nI found this in a forum,\nit's in the links or\n\n442\n00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.230\nin a, sorry, the link is in the notes\nif you wanted to see where that is, and\n\n443\n00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.220\nI just thought that was very clever.\n&gt;&gt; That is interesting.\n\n444\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:10.800\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n445\n00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.890\nWell, it will always go ahead and\nupdate itself if you go ahead and\n\n446\n00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.180\ngo to print preview.\n\n447\n00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.750\nSo that's something nice to know about,\nand then of course once I start\n\n448\n00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:26.360\nchanging or deleting or adding any\ncaptions to my graphical elements.\n\n449\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.560\nYou do need to make sure that you come\nup to here if you have it generated and\n\n450\n00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.560\nupdate your table of contents.\n\n451\n00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.470\nYou always, like I said,\nyou wanna do the entire table and\n\n452\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.300\nthen this, I didn't change anything here.\n\n453\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.700\nOops sorry,\nI just clicked on the hyperlink.\n\n454\n00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.100\nBut just make sure you go back and if\nthey are generated, update those as well.\n\n455\n00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.890\nSo kind of along the same lines of\neverything we've been doing throughout\n\n456\n00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.790\nour long document process, updating our\nfields, making sure we can go ahead and\n\n457\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:23:00.470\nconnect, use the same styles or\nin this case, the same caption labels and\n\n458\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.780\nit will automatically generate that.\n\n459\n00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.550\nPretty, not too terribly hard.\n\n460\n00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.410\nI think so.\nIt's just the updating thing that can\n\n461\n00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.010\nget a little weird.\n\n462\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:12.210\nPrint preview, nice little ditty there.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n463\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.770\nWell, thank you for helping us out here.\n\n464\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.480\nAnd when we start working with\nthe idea of captions and, of course,\n\n465\n00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.400\nthis table of figures,\nwe're starting to see a pattern here,\n\n466\n00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.350\nif you've been watching\nthe last few episodes with us,\n\n467\n00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.310\nin which we're seeing that the automatic\nway in which they renumber or\n\n468\n00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.500\nthey redo the orders that they have\nreally saves us a lot of time.\n\n469\n00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.800\nAnd so this is about efficiency, as well\nas about making the documents look good,\n\n470\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.940\nespecially when working\nwith long documents.\n\n471\n00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.400\nSo take advantage of the tools that you\nwill find right here in Word 2016 for\n\n472\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.230\nMac because it will\nsave you a ton of time.\n\n473\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.850\nYour documents will look fantastic and\n\n474\n00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.710\nyou'll impress people as they actually\nstart looking at your documents as well.\n\n475\n00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.170\nWell, that's gonna end it for\nthis episode then.\n\n476\n00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.700\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n477\n00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n478\n00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.195\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n479\n00:23:59.195 --> 00:24:01.637\nmore

00:00:19.540\nYou're watching the Word\n2016 expert show for Mac.\n\n4\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.570\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ngonna be taking a look at the use of\n\n5\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.410\nmaster documents, and\nwhy we need them as well.\n\n6\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.130\nAnd here, of course,\n\n7\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.572\nto help us is the master of the Office Pro\nuniverse herself, Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:34.968\nVonne, welcome to the studios,\nhow are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.320\n&gt;&gt; I'm wonderful [LAUGH].\n\n10\n00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.420\nI'm feeling very mastery.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that sounds great.\n\n11\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Is that a,\n\n12\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.990\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; I guess it could be,\n\n13\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.210\nnot exactly used that way.\n\n14\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.030\nBut sure that will work for us.\n\n15\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.326\nSo Vonne, here it is.\n\n16\n00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:49.050\nWe're now talking about this\nidea of a master document.\n\n17\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.615\nMost of us have created documents before,\nbut maybe working with master documents,\n\n18\n00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.990\nsomebody's actually mentioned it in\npassing as, you know somebody says,\n\n19\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.500\nyou should just put that in a master\ndocument all these other ones, and\n\n20\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.620\nyou're still going, you go all right.\n\n21\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.194\nAll right, that sounds great.\n\n22\n00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:03.724\nBut we're not sure exactly what it is.\n\n23\n00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:04.982\nSo Vonne, help us out here.\n\n24\n00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:07.961\nWhat are we going to do?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I even referenced it when we were\n\n25\n00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:10.447\ndoing another episode that\nI can't remember right now.\n\n26\n00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:11.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.170\n&gt;&gt; But I was like yeah,\n\n28\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.750\nyou could use a master doc.\n\n29\n00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.580\nAand then you out there\nmight have been like, sure.\n\n30\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.776\nJust like what you said.\n\n31\n00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:20.738\nSo what is it?\n\n32\n00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:23.965\nIt's a master document.\n\n33\n00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:25.482\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good one, Vonne.\n\n34\n00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:26.712\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n35\n00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:32.470\nWell let's equate it back to\nthe bibliographies episode.\n\n36\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.340\nIf you haven't watched it,\nit's pretty cool so check it out.\n\n37\n00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.830\nBut what we had was a master\nlist of all of the sources\n\n38\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.080\nthat we had used in\nother files in one list.\n\n39\n00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.880\nAnd so that was our master list.\n\n40\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.670\nIn that kind of same vein,\na master document is one\n\n41\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.680\nWord file that is actually\ncomposed of multiple\n\n42\n00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.950\nWord files all combined\ntogether in one document.\n\n43\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.710\nAnd it's creating links to\nthose particular files.\n\n44\n00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.230\nAnd it becomes like a two way street of\nediting the master document edits the,\n\n45\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.210\nwhat are known as sub-documents.\n\n46\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.110\nOr if you edit the sub-document,\nthen it edits the master document.\n\n47\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.770\nAnd so it's really just\na collection of other documents.\n\n48\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.450\nAnd it can be very helpful for,\nsay, you're doing an annual report.\n\n49\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.040\nAnd hey,\n\n50\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.710\nyour annual report's gonna cover all sorts\nof different places within your company.\n\n51\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.940\nYou don't know everything about,\nsay the marketing department, or\n\n52\n00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.850\nthe sales department.\n\n53\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.200\nSo you would want somebody from\nthat particular department to\n\n54\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.770\nauthor that section of the annual report.\n\n55\n00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.030\nWell then they could go ahead and\ncreate a Word file, and then Bob does one,\n\n56\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.300\nand Jane does one, and\nRonnie does one and Taylor does one,\n\n57\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.760\nand then it's my job to\nput them all together.\n\n58\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.690\nWell yeah, you could go ahead and like\ncopy and paste them into a big one, or\n\n59\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.210\nwhy don't you just put them all in\nMicrosoft and say here's one, and then put\n\n60\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.780\nin all those 4 files, and there you go.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n61\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.840\nSo Vonne, let me kind of give you\na scenario that I remember somebody\n\n62\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.010\nworking with here when we used to teach\nin different school systems around.\n\n63\n00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.310\nThere was one summer where I ended\nup talking to someone about this.\n\n64\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.330\nThey had to put together an entire\ndocument for everything that had to do for\n\n65\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.980\ntheir entire school district, and\nthat's exactly what they were doing.\n\n66\n00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.300\nThey were actually taking all those\ndocuments that were sent to them and\n\n67\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.070\nthey were really copying and\nputting that into one document in itself.\n\n68\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.290\nBecause it said it was just all the page\nnumbering was already wrong, it was not\n\n69\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.890\nformatted correctly, and so the only way\nthat she could figure out how to do this,\n\n70\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.390\ncuz it turned out to be 2,000 pages,\nright, and everything that it had to do.\n\n71\n00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.180\nBut the only way she could figure out\nhow to do this was to just paste it\n\n72\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.110\nall into one.\n\n73\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.480\nSo Vonne, the idea of master documents\nthat was supposed to help us to not\n\n74\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.260\nworry about doing that right?\n&gt;&gt; And on that same scenario that you're\n\n75\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.440\ntalking about, what if somebody within\nthose 2000 pages made some updates?\n\n76\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.380\nLike hey, I made some changes\nhere's my updated version\n\n77\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.300\n&gt;&gt; What is that person gonna have to do?\n\n78\n00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.900\nCopy and paste that back in.\n\n79\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.372\nSo the edibility of doing a master\ndocument and saying, okay,\n\n80\n00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:13.170\nI'm gonna take your file.\n\n81\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.380\nIf you do things in your file,\nit's gonna be fine in my master document.\n\n82\n00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.490\nNow of course, you do have to have it in\na central share or some type of, if you're\n\n83\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.810\nworking in multiple departments, you're\ngonna have to have, either a OneDrive, or\n\n84\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.590\nprobably a network drive to where you and\neverybody can get to the same files.\n\n85\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.090\nSo that's something to\nconsider along the way.\n\n86\n00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.370\nOr again,\nyou might have authored all of them,\n\n87\n00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.580\nyou wanna go ahead and put it in there.\n\n88\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.971\nSo yeah, I like the editability of\nthe link that is paraded from being\n\n89\n00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:51.486\na master documents to those subdocuments.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n90\n00:04:51.486 --> 00:04:53.848\nthat was just kind of just making me feel.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:04:53.848 --> 00:04:54.371\n&gt;&gt; That sounds horrible.\n\n92\n00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.462\nI'm so sorry, you poor thing.\n\n93\n00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.516\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I remember because the first time\n\n94\n00:04:58.516 --> 00:05:02.940\nI met you and I said, you should try\ncreate a master document out of this.\n\n95\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.322\nAnd that was the first time they had heard\nabout this, said somebody mentioned it,\n\n96\n00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:06.600\nbut I didn't know how to do it.\n\n97\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.320\nSo everybody defaults to\nwhat they know how to do.\n\n98\n00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.070\nAnd they just didn't realize how much\nextra work they were having to do here.\n\n99\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.000\nSo Vonne, you're gonna show us\nwhy we would choose this method,\n\n100\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.030\neven though I know that,\ntried and true, it works.\n\n101\n00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.520\nEven if I have to spend an additional\n20 hours to make it work, I know it'll\n\n102\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.990\nactually do what I want it to do.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we're all,\n\n103\n00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.490\nI mean we're all guilty of doing it.\n\n104\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.660\nI do the same thing.\n\n105\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.758\nIt's like I know it's good to be faster,\nbut this is yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:31.758 --> 00:05:34.390\nBut why don't we go ahead and\nget started and I'll show you.\n\n107\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.050\nSo I have some files that I actually\ncopied over from like the exercise\n\n108\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.400\nfiles that you guys are given to\nfollow along, I copied those and\n\n109\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.400\nput them on my desktop because I'm\ngonna need like to update them and\n\n110\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.410\nchange them throughout\nthe course of this episode.\n\n111\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.600\nSo I have a file called master document,\nlet's open it.\n\n112\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.208\nThere's nothing much going on\nhere besides Alice in Wonderland.\n\n113\n00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:55.257\nThat's it.\n\n114\n00:05:55.257 --> 00:05:59.290\n[LAUGH] Nothing hidden,\nit's just one paragraph, okay?\n\n115\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.460\nWell I have back over here, let's go.\n\n116\n00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.870\nLet's go again, get my Finder.\n\n117\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.089\nI'm just doing a Cmd + Tab to switch\nbetween, and let's go over here.\n\n118\n00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:16.550\nNotice I've labeled them sub down,\nsub queen, sub.\n\n119\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.820\nYou don't have to label them that way.\n\n120\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.100\nThere's nothing that says\nthe filename has to be that.\n\n121\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.490\nIt's just more for me to remember\nwhat files I'm working with.\n\n122\n00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.780\nSo if I open this, it's just text.\n\n123\n00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.970\nWe got some headings and\neverything, it looks great.\n\n124\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.860\nAnd then the same thing is gonna\nhappen with the queen of hearts.\n\n125\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.181\nOops, I opened the knights.\n\n126\n00:06:34.181 --> 00:06:34.738\nYou get the idea.\n\n127\n00:06:34.738 --> 00:06:39.630\nIt's just gonna have text, so\nI've maybe like tasked different people\n\n128\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.726\nwithin my organization to go ahead and\nwrite their portion.\n\n129\n00:06:43.726 --> 00:06:48.598\nWith that being said, there are some\nthings that you should really\n\n130\n00:06:48.598 --> 00:06:53.480\nconsider when you're going to be\nlike assigning people out this.\n\n131\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.900\nYou don't want them to get too\ncrazy on their formatting.\n\n132\n00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.840\nAnd making sure that they don't put things\nlike page numbers and all that stuff,\n\n133\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.170\nlike say I just want\nyou to write the text.\n\n134\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.520\nJust off of the text,\ndon't worry about anything else.\n\n135\n00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.231\nBut I do need you to use headings because\nthere is something that is important\n\n136\n00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:14.040\nabout what,\n\n137\n00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.250\nhow we are going to be creating a master\ndocument that is related to headings.\n\n138\n00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.620\nSo that's pretty important.\n\n139\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.313\nAnd you should be using heading anyways\nbecause as far as organizing documents and\n\n140\n00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:28.683\nall the things we've learned about\nwith the table of contents and styles,\n\n141\n00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:30.412\nyou really should just be doing that.\n\n142\n00:07:30.412 --> 00:07:31.673\nI'm gonna go ahead and claim that.\n\n143\n00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:34.785\nI'm gonna tell you, you should do that.\n\n144\n00:07:34.785 --> 00:07:39.130\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna get my judgey pants on,\nand be like you have to do this.\n\n145\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.940\n&gt;&gt; Judgey pants.\n\n146\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, so\n\n147\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.088\nthose are some things that\nyou need to consider.\n\n148\n00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.920\nHeadings, don't get too\ncrazy in the formatting.\n\n149\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.660\nAll right,\nhow do I make a master document?\n\n150\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.363\nThis is going to become, and\nI named it, again, anything you wanted.\n\n151\n00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:56.962\nJust for my brain,\nknow that this is the file.\n\n152\n00:07:56.962 --> 00:07:59.638\nSo I have my cursor here.\n\n153\n00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:03.113\nYou're gonna need to get into what\nis known as the Outline view.\n\n154\n00:08:03.113 --> 00:08:06.600\nNow this right now is\nour Print Layout view.\n\n155\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.690\nSo to change views we come over here and\n\n156\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:14.266\nI will tell you I don't normally work\nin Outline view, I really don't.\n\n157\n00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:18.340\nI understand like the advantages of it in\nthe sense that it's going to pull those\n\n158\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.298\nheadings and\nit acts almost like an outline.\n\n159\n00:08:21.298 --> 00:08:21.973\n&gt;&gt; An outline.\n\n160\n00:08:21.973 --> 00:08:23.545\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n161\n00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:28.040\nthen it kind of structures it and\ngives you indents almost,\n\n162\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.070\nkind of like a bulleted list would\nof where you want your levels to be.\n\n163\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.510\nBut it's doing it based on\nyour heading levels and\n\n164\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.280\nyour normal paragraphs and that's\nwonderful, so let's go into Outline.\n\n165\n00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.650\nIt does change everything, notice that\nyou have a new tab on the Ribbon.\n\n166\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.290\nYou have an Outlining tab that only\ncomes up if you're in Outline view.\n\n167\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.682\nYou don't see any margins, you don't see\npage, well I think you do see page breaks.\n\n168\n00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:55.106\nWe'll remind me, well I'll remind myself,\nI know you do though.\n\n169\n00:08:55.106 --> 00:08:57.620\nSo here we've got, this is our title, and\n\n170\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.940\nnotice you have these\nlittle squares next to it.\n\n171\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:07.430\nThat's just how it's organizing on\na paragraph level, your outline.\n\n172\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.550\nAnd then we have all of our levels,\nthat's great.\n\n173\n00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.180\nHow do i get to add in what's\ngonna say sub documents?\n\n174\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.019\nWe have a master document and\nthen multiple subdocuments,\n\n175\n00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:23.240\nyou gotta click this little button\nright up here called Show Document.\n\n176\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.600\nAnd that gives you some other options.\n\n177\n00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.980\nNotice that as we click that button again,\nthose options go away.\n\n178\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.018\nThat's your first step of trying\nto find this particular button.\n\n179\n00:09:32.018 --> 00:09:36.630\nThe Insert subdocument is\navailable now and I can,\n\n180\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.680\nwith my cursor where I wanna put it,\ndo that.\n\n181\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.360\nI will Insert, come out to my desktop,\nand come into, yes, I am staying\n\n182\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.270\nin my desktop cuz I don't want to go into\nthe source files or your exercise files.\n\n183\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.080\nAnd let's go Down the Rabbit Hole, and\n\n184\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.370\nthen notice it goes ahead and\nputs this in.\n\n185\n00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.520\nBecause of the heading levels,\nthere's that heading one,\n\n186\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.530\nhere's a paragraph heading two,\nparagraph, paragraph.\n\n187\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.400\nSee each one, little square or\n\n188\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.500\nbigger + signs indicate heading levels or\nparagraphs.\n\n189\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.350\nI have something on right now on this\nparticular outline that you might not have\n\n190\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:19.418\nautomatically, and notice it says show\nfirst line only, but uncheck that.\n\n191\n00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:23.610\nThere are full paragraphs in here,\nyou saw it in that example.\n\n192\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:28.120\nI just kind of condensed it down,\nI don’t need to see everything.\n\n193\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.070\nWhere are my headings, paragraphs,\nheadings, paragraphs, sounds good.\n\n194\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.984\nAnd yes you do see page breaks,\nI forgot about that so.\n\n195\n00:10:35.984 --> 00:10:38.050\n[LAUGH] We've got there, and that's it.\n\n196\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:45.155\nNotice the little line around this area,\nthat's indicating that subdocument.\n\n197\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.900\nCool, if I wanted to,\nI could collapse this subdocument.\n\n198\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.360\nNow it's asking me do I\nwant to save my changes.\n\n199\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.510\nAnd again, this is why I made\nduplicates of those files.\n\n200\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.340\nWe're gonna click OK, and\nthen it collapses down.\n\n201\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.990\nAnd then you can see there's that\nlink to that particular document.\n\n202\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.440\nCool, if I expand the subdocument out,\nthen it goes ahead and expands out.\n\n203\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.050\nBut this is just a view, and views can\nbe changed of how I'm looking at this.\n\n204\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.000\nSo if I leave the Outline view, and\nthere's a Close button right there,\n\n205\n00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.350\nI'll clock that.\n\n206\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:25.270\nIf I come back out to regular Print\nPreview land, then it's the same thing,\n\n207\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.450\nit's just regular text.\n\n208\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.760\nSo it's a normal, text document,\n\n209\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.770\nyou're just creating the links\nto it through the Outline view.\n\n210\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.320\nBut then working with it within\nyour regular Print Layout view and\n\n211\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.070\nit's just all the same.\n\n212\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.570\nOkay, neat.\n\n213\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.442\nFew little things, notice that it does\nalways give you these Next Page section\n\n214\n00:11:45.442 --> 00:11:49.087\nbreaks because you would really think\nabout this almost like in chapters, right.\n\n215\n00:11:49.087 --> 00:11:53.299\nIn chapters, you would probably want\nthem to start on the next page, so\n\n216\n00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:58.428\nthat's why it's just like a default thing\nthat happens when you do master documents,\n\n217\n00:11:58.428 --> 00:12:01.650\nis it gives you that\nNext Page section break.\n\n218\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.270\nJust be aware of it, you could\nget rid of it if you want to, but\n\n219\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.390\nevery time you bring back\nit's gonna come back.\n\n220\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.500\nSo there we go I've got my\nsection break wonderful, and\n\n221\n00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.980\nthen also you might think about how you\norganize the different subdocuments.\n\n222\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.170\nWhere like, here's one section, here's\nthe next section, we're on the next page.\n\n223\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.320\nSo think about that in the organization\nof the material that you want to and\n\n224\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.690\nhow you're going to be\nusing master documents.\n\n225\n00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:31.210\nSo I've saved this,\nI just did a command S to save this.\n\n226\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.720\nNotice that I have Down the Rabbit Hole,\n\n227\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.980\ndown, down, down,\nsame text we've been looking at.\n\n228\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.470\nIf I close this file,\nI'm just gonna do a command W to close.\n\n229\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.980\nOpen up that subdocument,\nQueen of Hearts, and, no,\n\n230\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.050\nthat's not the right file.\n&gt;&gt; The Knight,\n\n231\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.380\nI think is the other one pulled in.\n&gt;&gt; No, we did Down the Rabbit Hole,\n\n232\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.468\nthat's the first one we did.\n\n233\n00:12:51.468 --> 00:12:52.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I couldn't remember.\n\n234\n00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.170\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't remember them either.\n\n235\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I open this one, there it is,\n\n236\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.300\ndown, down, down.\n\n237\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:03.780\nIf I deleted this, maybe went ahead and\nmade this bold and\n\n238\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.650\nthen maybe here I'm just editing the\ndocument and making this a heading one.\n\n239\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:17.400\nRemember this is the subdocument right, so\nwhat do you think is gonna happen, Ronnie,\n\n240\n00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.540\nwhen I open up the master document?\n&gt;&gt; Those changes should show up as\n\n241\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.980\nwell.\n&gt;&gt; They do, why?\n\n242\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.760\n&gt;&gt; Because they're linked.\n\n243\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n244\n00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.170\nthis is one thing that will also throw you\noff about working in master documents.\n\n245\n00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.740\nYou open it up, it's like,\nwhere's my text,\n\n246\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.540\nright, all you're seeing is\nlinks to those subdocuments.\n\n247\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.250\nBecause we just said,\nthey're linked, but I need the text.\n\n248\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.520\nThis is where you gotta go back,\nand expand out the subdocuments.\n\n249\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.896\nSo you gotta go back to View, you gotta\ngo back to Outline, you gotta go to\n\n250\n00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:55.160\nExpand Subdocuments, close Outline view,\nand then you're back into regular view.\n\n251\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.580\nI will say that when you're\nworking with this a lot,\n\n252\n00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.910\nyou're gonna be clicking those button so\nmany times.\n\n253\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.300\nYou might wanna go ahead and\nadd those to your quick access toolbar.\n\n254\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.800\nYou know, go ahead and customize it,\nget those more commands, okay.\n\n255\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.200\nAnd that way you don't have to\nkeep clicking all over the place.\n\n256\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.102\nIt just might make it\na little bit easier for\n\n257\n00:14:15.102 --> 00:14:19.830\nyou, cuz every time, Save, Close, make\nchanges, it always comes back in links.\n\n258\n00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:26.270\nAnd I know It does throw people off,\nlike this doesn't work, it does,\n\n259\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.890\nyou just gotta expand it.\n\n260\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.010\nSo you can see that there's all\nthe changes, perfect, perfect, perfect.\n\n261\n00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:36.780\nAnd the same way would happen if I'm in my\nmaster document if I then took this and\n\n262\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.340\ndeleted it, and\nthen made this red or what have you.\n\n263\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.172\nSame thing will be reflected\nin that subdocument.\n\n264\n00:14:45.172 --> 00:14:49.730\nSo right there,\nI think you could see the editability of\n\n265\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.730\nthe way that you can have\nother people contribute.\n\n266\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.730\nAnd not have to keep\ndoing multiple copies and\n\n267\n00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.980\npaste like that poor woman had to\ndo that one time in your example.\n\n268\n00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.160\nAnd it acts just like a regular document,\nthere's nothing wrong.\n\n269\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.450\nAnd this is where if you had multiple\nsubdocuments, let's go back and\n\n270\n00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.650\nadd another one just to have some fun.\n\n271\n00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.730\nWe'll go back to View,\nwe'll go back to Outline,\n\n272\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.960\nI will show the Document button because\nthat's where I need to insert it, but\n\n273\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.240\nyou have to still think, where do I\nwant to insert the next document?\n\n274\n00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.160\nYou're gonna scroll down and\n\n275\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.080\nmake sure your cursor is in\nthe place where you want to be.\n\n276\n00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.580\nSo then you will Insert,\ncome out to our desktop and\n\n277\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.240\nwe will go with the,\nlet's go with the Queen of Hearts.\n\n278\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.150\nAnd there's the next one,\nwe'll do one more.\n\n279\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.720\nCursor is where I want it to be, Insert,\n\n280\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.230\nand then where are we?\n&gt;&gt; Knights.\n\n281\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.490\n&gt;&gt; The Knights, thank you.\n\n282\n00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.907\nSo now I have our three subdocuments,\nthey'er all there.\n\n283\n00:15:44.907 --> 00:15:49.883\nI can collapse the subdocuments, but then\nI'm gonna have to expand them anyways to\n\n284\n00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:54.525\nmake them look the right way, cuz if I\nclose this it's gonna look like links.\n\n285\n00:15:54.525 --> 00:15:59.136\nSo you gotta keep them\nexpanded to see the text in\n\n286\n00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:02.840\nits normal capacity in print layout.\n\n287\n00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.468\nSo let's expand it, let's close it.\n\n288\n00:16:05.468 --> 00:16:06.404\nThere we go.\n\n289\n00:16:06.404 --> 00:16:08.870\nAnd this is just one big old document.\n\n290\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:14.100\nAnd this is the same thing like if I\nwanted to create a table of contents.\n\n291\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.838\nI could do that, right?\n\n292\n00:16:14.838 --> 00:16:18.095\nBecause all it's doing is pulling\nthe heading, totally fine.\n\n293\n00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:23.140\nIf I had each sub-document already\nmarked with index entries, I could\n\n294\n00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:28.896\nthen generate an index in the master\ndocument pulling from the sub-documents.\n\n295\n00:16:28.896 --> 00:16:33.770\nAgain, it's special but\nit's still just a regular document.\n\n296\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.360\nIt's just how the text kinda got in there,\nbut it's still just text.\n\n297\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.970\nI think that's the thing\nthat throws people off.\n\n298\n00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.830\nTreat it normally.\n\n299\n00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.750\nIt's all good, it's fine.\n\n300\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.710\nIt's just that kinda weird\nviews that you have to do,\n\n301\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.650\nand the linking.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n302\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.170\nVonne, let's say that we\ncreate this sub document.\n\n303\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.780\nAnd just like the example\nthat I was using,\n\n304\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.330\none of the worst things that\nthis lady had to deal with and\n\n305\n00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.720\nwhy she chose to merge it all into one\ndocument, was the idea of page numbers.\n\n306\n00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.557\nWill this, if we tell them don't put page\nnumbers, can we actually use a master\n\n307\n00:17:06.557 --> 00:17:10.532\ndocument and put page numbers and actually\nhave them all do what we want them to do?\n\n308\n00:17:10.532 --> 00:17:13.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I go right into here and\n\n309\n00:17:13.817 --> 00:17:21.264\nwe go into insert and we go with a page\nnumber, and we'll go with center.\n\n310\n00:17:21.264 --> 00:17:23.820\nAnd we'll click OK, and there you go.\n\n311\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.930\nThey're just straight up\nregular page numbers.\n\n312\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:27.630\nEverything goes.\n\n313\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.060\nAnd then if you added\nmore in a sub-document,\n\n314\n00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.590\nsay somebody, I found a whole other\npassage that I wanted to, it's all there.\n\n315\n00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.550\nAnd the nice thing is you don't\nreally have to force the updates,\n\n316\n00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.270\nlike in a field like we had.\n\n317\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.050\nAs long as the files are all saved.\n\n318\n00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.590\nNow if you start moving things around,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.595\n&gt;&gt; Then it's gonna get all wonky, so\n\n320\n00:17:46.595 --> 00:17:47.148\nbe very,\n\n321\n00:17:47.148 --> 00:17:51.910\nvery careful about it because it is\ncreating a path to that particular file.\n\n322\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.948\nDon't rename it, don't move it.\n\n323\n00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:57.666\nYou're gonna have problems if you do,\nand then it's like [SOUND].\n\n324\n00:17:57.666 --> 00:18:01.140\nBut the other nice thing is,\nyou saw how easy that was.\n\n325\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.795\nIf you really get all out of sorts,\ngo ahead and find them,\n\n326\n00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:09.120\nstart a new file,\n[SOUND] pop them all in and\n\n327\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.260\nthen kind of start from scratch.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n328\n00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.870\n&gt;&gt; So that's something to always\n\n329\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.390\nthink about.\n\n330\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.560\nIt's not too tirely hard or\na long process to\n\n331\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.430\ncreate a master document.\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, now that we have\n\n332\n00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.990\nthose page numbers, you also mentioned\nthe idea that they're linked, and\n\n333\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.100\nusually they're linked because we really\nwant people to be able to edit them and\n\n334\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.020\nthat kind of shows up\nthe way they want to.\n\n335\n00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.870\nBut what if everything is done and\nover with, and\n\n336\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.790\nnow we want to be able to kind of\nremove that, is that possible?\n\n337\n00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.220\nAnd that way we don't affect\nthose other documents anymore?\n\n338\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.390\n&gt;&gt; Unconnecting the sub documents from\n\n339\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.620\nthe master document?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n340\n00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.470\n&gt;&gt; You can, yes you can unlink them.\n\n341\n00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.415\nAnd maybe cuz you're, maybe somebody's\ndone with the editing or they're doing\n\n342\n00:18:48.415 --> 00:18:51.973\ntoo much editing for what you need and\nyou need to cut them off or whatever.\n\n343\n00:18:51.973 --> 00:18:56.642\nSo there's multiple reasons of why\nyou want to not have links to them.\n\n344\n00:18:56.642 --> 00:18:59.864\nIt's not too hard, so why don't we\ngo ahead and come back down and\n\n345\n00:18:59.864 --> 00:19:01.400\ngo back into our outline view.\n\n346\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.380\nSo we need to go to view and outline.\n\n347\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.220\nAnd we can go ahead and show the document.\n\n348\n00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.590\nAnd then right there,\nright underneath insert, there's unlink.\n\n349\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:18.290\nSo if I'm here, with my cursor within that\nsubdocument, and then I click unlink,\n\n350\n00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.610\nnotice like the box goes away?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n351\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and once the box goes away,\n\n352\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.595\nnow we're just in regular outline mode.\n\n353\n00:19:25.595 --> 00:19:28.430\nIt has nothing to do with a subdocument.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n354\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.820\nthis is now just a copy of the original\ndocument and it is no longer linked.\n\n355\n00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.560\nSo we don't have to worry\nabout somebody editing and\n\n356\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.490\naffecting my master document?\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n357\n00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.720\nIf I made changes to this in the master\ndocument, not effect to the sub or\n\n358\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.820\nvice versa.\n\n359\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.780\nSo if I wanted to unlink all of them,\nI just get back down into the second one,\n\n360\n00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.470\ngo ahead and unlink, come down into here,\n\n361\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.750\nwe can unlink and\nthen this is just a regular file.\n\n362\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:57.040\nNo anything going on, I can take\nout the page breaks and everything.\n\n363\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.450\nSo that's also maybe like an easy\nway to almost like copying and\n\n364\n00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.830\npasting, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n365\n00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.440\n&gt;&gt; Bring them all in,\n\n366\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.510\ndo the master document, then unlink\nthem and then do what you need to do.\n\n367\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.680\nThat just came to me right now [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.497\n&gt;&gt; So I was like that's pretty smart.\n\n369\n00:20:13.497 --> 00:20:15.578\nSo yeah, master documents,\n\n370\n00:20:15.578 --> 00:20:21.327\nnot too terribly hard if everything goes\nperfectly and everything is wonderful,\n\n371\n00:20:21.327 --> 00:20:25.038\nand I gave you a perfect example, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n372\n00:20:25.038 --> 00:20:26.982\n&gt;&gt; We didn't have any warnings,\n\n373\n00:20:26.982 --> 00:20:28.410\nnothing barked at us.\n\n374\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.100\nEverything was in the same place.\n\n375\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.030\nI do have a part two running.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n376\n00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.050\n&gt;&gt; Because I wanted to go ahead and\n\n377\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:34.630\nshow you, yeah.\n\n378\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.330\nThis is the basics of it.\n\n379\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:41.630\nI wanna drive a little bit into the things\nwith the styles and how that works,\n\n380\n00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.980\nand when things might not always\ngo perfectly smooth for you.\n\n381\n00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.468\nSo we have a part two coming\nyour way in just a little bit.\n\n382\n00:20:49.468 --> 00:20:50.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, well thank you for\n\n383\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.060\nhelping us to get started here\nwith the use of master documents.\n\n384\n00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.440\nAnd you're starting to see\nwhere it becomes very powerful,\n\n385\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.265\nespecially when you think about\nthe idea of collaborating.\n\n386\n00:20:59.265 --> 00:21:02.930\nSso we gave you a couple of great examples\nthere, where it might be one person really\n\n387\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.810\ncollating everything together, needing to\nput things into the order that they need\n\n388\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.900\nto, and showing where we can even leave\nthat open for editing using subdocument\n\n389\n00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.960\nfeatures that we have available\nwhile I was renumbering the pages.\n\n390\n00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.350\nAnd now we have to manage\nthat a little bit better.\n\n391\n00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.577\nBecause even though it actually looks\ngreat when we give you a perfect example,\n\n392\n00:21:19.577 --> 00:21:21.455\nwe might find out that's\nthere more to come and\n\n393\n00:21:21.455 --> 00:21:23.351\nthat we have to actually\ndo some other things.\n\n394\n00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:25.464\nBut that is gonna for part two.\n\n395\n00:21:25.464 --> 00:21:27.883\nSo let's go ahead and\nend this episode then.\n\n396\n00:21:27.883 --> 00:21:31.899\nSigning off for OfficePro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n397\n00:21:31.899 --> 00:21:32.811\n&gt;&gt;

You know, I haven't either so.\n\n17\n00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.893\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was just like, hey, poof,\n\n18\n00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:55.140\nand I even said in the last episode,\nit's that easy, see?\n\n19\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.688\nJust insert your subdocuments and\nyou're done.\n\n20\n00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:00.605\nSo why do I need to go further?\n\n21\n00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.673\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n&gt;&gt; You have to have headings and\n\n27\n00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:19.250\neverything like that.\n\n28\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.280\nAnd that's so very important\nbecause of the outline mode and\n\n29\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.990\nhow it kinda treats everything.\n\n30\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.530\nAnd yes, that's great.\n\n31\n00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.397\nWonderful if everybody goes ahead and\nuses the same headings and\n\n32\n00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:32.624\nthey don't put in too much content.\n\n33\n00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:36.980\nIn the sense of like different elements\nand, I mean, cuz Word, you can make,\n\n34\n00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.620\nwe've seen all sorts of\ncool things from Word.\n\n35\n00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.108\nBut you have to have very specific\nguidelines, if you wanna say,\n\n36\n00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:46.590\nwhen creating your subdocuments.\n\n37\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.184\nDoesn't always work that way.\n\n38\n00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:47.785\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n39\n00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:48.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n40\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.020\nSo I wanna do a quick little\nthing about mix-match styles, and\n\n41\n00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.178\nhow the master document kinda\noverrides all of your subdocuments.\n\n42\n00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:05.670\nAnd that could or could not, depends which\nway you wanna look at it, be an issue.\n\n43\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.680\nBut it is something that does happen with\n\n44\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.280\nspecifically with the formatting of\nthe files in Word with master documents.\n\n45\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.950\nBest to just go ahead and demonstrate.\n\n46\n00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.340\nCuz you're just going mm-hm, what?\n\n47\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.976\nOkay.\n\n48\n00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:22.514\n[LAUGH] That's Ronnie,\nRonnie's face is doing that by the way so.\n\n49\n00:02:22.514 --> 00:02:23.370\n&gt;&gt; It always is.\n\n50\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.593\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:29.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's usually when I'm talking to,\n\n52\n00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:32.167\nthat he's like mm-hm, yeah, sure, Vonne.\n\n53\n00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:34.039\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's good that I'm learning\n\n54\n00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.075\nfrom the master herself.\n\n55\n00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:36.360\nAll right, so Vonne, here we go.\n\n56\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.280\nWe're really trying to deal with the very\nfact that we're going to have all these\n\n57\n00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.640\ndisparate styles.\n\n58\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.170\nAnd they can be, again,\npeople tend to like their own style.\n\n59\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.360\nThey don't care what you tell them.\n\n60\n00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.050\nIf it's saying, hey, we're gonna merge\nthis altogether, so keep it to a minimum.\n\n61\n00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.210\nAll of a sudden,\nyou get some that are just way out there.\n\n62\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.080\nAnd you're not exactly sure what happened.\n\n63\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.440\nVonne is talking about that\nidea of inconsistencies.\n\n64\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.740\nAnd Vonne, we've even seen as you\ngo around on the Internet, right?\n\n65\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.040\nSome of the different articles or\nblogs that are out there,\n\n66\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.870\nit can get a little bit dicey when\nyou start reading about it, right?\n\n67\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.524\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n\n220\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.000\n&gt;&gt; They're staying the same and\nthey're like, I don't care what you do.\n\n221\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.582\nBut see the green and the underline,\nthat's still gonna come through,\n\n222\n00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:29.230\nthat's a local override.\n\n223\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.070\nAnd then down here, well,\nthat's coming through too.\n\n224\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.660\nBecause, and that came over\nbecause it wasn't a mixed matched.\n\n225\n00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.929\nThere wasn't a book title already\ndefined in the master document.\n\n226\n00:11:40.929 --> 00:11:45.616\nSo that's where the whole,\nfrom the sub documents, it can come in.\n\n227\n00:11:45.616 --> 00:11:49.234\nNow this is where you're\ntrying to stylize and\n\n228\n00:11:49.234 --> 00:11:54.080\nhave consistent formatting\nacross multiple subdocuments.\n\n229\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.630\nAnd people are making and\n\n230\n00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.790\nupdating their own style definitions\nthat you don't have in your master doc.\n\n231\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.610\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna add.\n\n232\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.155\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n233\n00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:06.062\nI mean, can you see the kind of\nformatting nightmare you might have on\n\n234\n00:12:06.062 --> 00:12:09.880\nyour hand of trying to figure\nout who did what styles?\n\n235\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.495\nWhat are local overrides versus imported,\n\n236\n00:12:13.495 --> 00:12:17.606\nif you wanna say,\nstyles in the master document?\n\n237\n00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:18.457\nYuck.\n\n238\n00:12:18.457 --> 00:12:21.660\n[LAUGH] It can get very dicey.\n\n239\n00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.077\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Very quickly.\n\n240\n00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:28.095\nAll right, so that's the whole maybe,\nif you can conform people\n\n241\n00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:33.400\nto your parameters, just use\nHeading 1s and 2s, don't go crazy.\n\n242\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.240\nDo not format.\n\n243\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.690\nDon't do any local overrides,\n\n244\n00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.520\nthen you might have a chance [LAUGH]\nof having this work to your advantage.\n\n245\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.130\nAnd that's one of those things.\n\n246\n00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, would this be\nthe same thing if they chose to do\n\n247\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.980\na different font for the body?\n\n248\n00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.720\nAnd they pulled in that document\ninstead of whatever you chose,\n\n249\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.460\nwhich was Arial and\nthey chose your Bookhouse instead.\n\n250\n00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.375\nWould that also do an override as well?\n\n251\n00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:00.250\nIs that considered an override?\n\n252\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.053\n&gt;&gt; If they just selected it and\nchose change the font and\n\n253\n00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:06.503\ndidn't do the update style,\ndidn't update the normal style?\n\n254\n00:13:06.503 --> 00:13:07.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then yes, it is a local override.\n\n255\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.542\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:10.180\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna come in.\n\n257\n00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:16.960\nAnd that's where you could select it and\njust say to apply your normal.\n\n258\n00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To that text, but again,\n\n259\n00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.450\nthat's more work.\n\n260\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.574\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n261\n00:13:20.574 --> 00:13:23.781\nSo especially if you're working with\npeople who don't understand styles,\n\n262\n00:13:23.781 --> 00:13:25.410\ndon't understand local overrides.\n\n263\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.755\nAnd to be honest,\nthere's most of the people.\n\n264\n00:13:28.755 --> 00:13:30.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't understand this stuff.\n\n265\n00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:35.106\nI mean, I feel like I am in this\nweird echelon because I know this and\n\n266\n00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.730\neverything like that.\n\n267\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.400\nAnd I try to at least give some\npeople like, hey, just try and\n\n268\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.410\nuse it a little bit cuz it's so great.\n\n269\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.529\nBut 90% of the people out\nthere don't use styles.\n\n270\n00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:50.890\nThey just click the buttons and\ndo all sorts of local overrides.\n\n271\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.040\nAnd it just gets really out of hand.\n\n272\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:59.400\nSo that might be one reason why, honestly,\nyou might not wanna use master documents.\n\n273\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n274\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.650\n&gt;&gt; And we were just talking about\nthis right before the show and\n\n275\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.349\nthat's what we're gonna talk to you now.\n\n276\n00:14:04.349 --> 00:14:05.546\nDo I really want to?\n\n277\n00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:08.210\nJust because I can do it, do I want to?\n\n278\n00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n279\n00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.670\n&gt;&gt; Hm, sometimes you might not.\n\n280\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:17.650\nAnd the Internet is littered with\ncomplaints about master documents.\n\n281\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.264\nAnd where it said, you know what,\njust avoid it altogether.\n\n282\n00:14:20.264 --> 00:14:21.980\nYou are going to cause\nyourself a world of hurt.\n\n283\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.584\nYou get things like corrupted files.\n\n284\n00:14:23.584 --> 00:14:24.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n285\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Links are missing,\nit doesn't update itself.\n\n286\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.520\nI mean,\nwe gave you the best-case scenarios, and\n\n287\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.290\nI gave you a quick one like,\nokay, formatting things.\n\n288\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:38.180\nBut it's problematic to say the least.\n\n289\n00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.800\n&gt;&gt; And if we think about it,\nit's linked, right?\n\n290\n00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.950\nEven if somebody moves\nthat file by accident, and\n\n291\n00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.270\nyou don't know where it moved to, well,\n\n292\n00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.010\nyou're not gonna be able to find it very\nquickly, then you have to link it back.\n\n293\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.380\nSo there are pros and cons to using it.\n\n294\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.080\nJust remember it's part of the tool\nset that may be useful to you.\n\n295\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.700\nBut don't expect it to go\nproblem-free a lot of times.\n\n296\n00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's anything\nin [LAUGH] all these programs.\n\n297\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.206\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n298\n00:15:01.206 --> 00:15:07.845\n&gt;&gt; But this one particular I feel is\nmore problematic than it needs to be.\n\n299\n00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:09.105\nLike I said, just do a Google search.\n\n300\n00:15:09.105 --> 00:15:12.113\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or any search that is, for\n\n301\n00:15:12.113 --> 00:15:16.130\nmaster documents in Word issues.\n\n302\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:21.990\nThere are some people that very much do\nnot like this and just say do not do it.\n\n303\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.811\nBut I mean, it is also one of those things\nthat is covered on the certification exam.\n\n304\n00:15:25.811 --> 00:15:26.715\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n305\n00:15:26.715 --> 00:15:30.002\n&gt;&gt; And I think every exam that I\nhave taken of a Word expert level,\n\n306\n00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:33.370\nthey've always had a question\nabout master documents.\n\n307\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.376\nIt's like, this is a feature,\nmake sure you know it.\n\n308\n00:15:36.376 --> 00:15:38.670\n[LAUGH] So yeah, it can be great.\n\n309\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.570\nIt can maybe not be so great.\n\n310\n00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.393\nSo use it at your discretion.\n\n311\n00:15:47.393 --> 00:15:49.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, well,\n\n312\n00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.880\nthank you for\nhelping us to actually take a look,\n\n313\n00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.980\njust a brief little bit of time here that\nthere are other issues that we have to\n\n314\n00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.080\nconsider if we are using\nthe idea of master documents.\n\n315\n00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.960\nIf we can keep the limitation\nespecially in working with styles that\n\n316\n00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.230\nhelps out a lot.\n\n317\n00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.431\nBut if people are actually taking those\nsubdocuments and they are doing local\n\n318\n00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:10.985\noverrides that is just changing\nthe dtyles themselves inside and\n\n319\n00:16:10.985 --> 00:16:13.449\nyou don't use that in\nyour master document.\n\n320\n00:16:13.449 --> 00:16:16.657\nRemember that will also carry over too,\nas well as font changes and\n\n321\n00:16:16.657 --> 00:16:20.200\nsome of the different things we\ndo that Vonne has demonstrated.\n\n322\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.330\nAll of these are different things that\neven though they seem minor at this point,\n\n323\n00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.360\nif you start actually adding multiple\ndocuments in, like tons of documents and\n\n324\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.410\nhundreds of pages, it can get a little\nbit more overwhelming than you think.\n\n325\n00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.200\nBut here, Vonne has actually\ngiven us a great warning.\n\n326\n00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.420\nAnd it actually is a good reminder\nthat we have to pay attention here\n\n327\n00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.790\nof all the things we use especially\nthings like master documents.\n\n328\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.710\nSo thank you again, Vonne, and\nalso thank you for watching.\n\n329\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.070\nBut that's gonna end it for this episode.\n\n330\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.490\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n331\n00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.460\n&gt;&gt;

collaborator\nherself in OfficePro.TV, Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.890\nVonne, welcome to the show.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\n\n9\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.114\nI like what you did there.\n\n10\n00:00:34.114 --> 00:00:34.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n11\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.200\n&gt;&gt; Master collaborator.\n\n12\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.360\n&gt;&gt; Collaborator, that's right.\n\n13\n00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n14\n00:00:37.948 --> 00:00:43.542\nbecause we are starting a new topic\nin the series of collaboration.\n\n15\n00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:48.355\nAnd I feel track changes is definitely\na part that you're going to need to do if\n\n16\n00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:53.820\nyou're going to be collaborating with\nother people when creating your documents.\n\n17\n00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.660\nAnd it's funny,\nwhile we're talking about this I'm like,\n\n18\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.330\nI probably should have put master\ndocuments in collaboration.\n\n19\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.708\nBut it was really more of a long document,\nso I think it's there.\n\n20\n00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:01.508\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n21\n00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:02.973\n&gt;&gt; But you probably would maybe be\n\n22\n00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:04.837\ncollaborating with people there too.\n\n23\n00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:05.493\nLike, what's that,\n\n24\n00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:06.803\nwatch the master document.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:07.624\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:07.624 --> 00:01:08.481\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, check that one out.\n\n27\n00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:09.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:15.526\n[LAUGH] So track changes, this is\nsomething I've done extensively, honestly.\n\n29\n00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:18.958\nBecause I've been doing\ndifferent textbook layouts, and\n\n30\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.620\na lot of different articles\nwhere I need people's input.\n\n31\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.602\nI need people to proof either my work,\nor I'm proofing somebody else's work.\n\n32\n00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:31.769\nOr we have this huge project like\na textbook, and we need to be able to talk\n\n33\n00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:37.740\nto each other through the document and\nbe able to say move this or change that.\n\n34\n00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.553\nAnd this kinda goes back to the old days\nof getting our in those research papers\n\n35\n00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:47.514\nthat you decided to write by hand, and\nthen you get the little insert where it's\n\n36\n00:01:47.514 --> 00:01:51.763\na carrot where you're supposed to\ninsert a word or strike through.\n\n37\n00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:53.642\nDo you remember all that, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; I do remember those,\n\n38\n00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:54.792\nmy page is blood red.\n\n39\n00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n\n40\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.530\n&gt;&gt; But then they stopped using red pen and\n\n41\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.731\nyou're supposed to use the green pen.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wasn't around,\n\n42\n00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:04.716\nthey only had red when I was\ndoing my papers, it was red.\n\n43\n00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:05.594\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n44\n00:02:05.594 --> 00:02:09.400\nthere are some kind of\nstandardized editing,\n\n45\n00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.860\nwhat would you call it?\n&gt;&gt; Marks.\n\n46\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.480\n&gt;&gt; Marks, yes, there we go,\n\n47\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.447\nsome editing marks that\npeople would know about.\n\n48\n00:02:16.447 --> 00:02:19.154\n[INAUDIBLE] all that kind of fun stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:23.464\nThat stays in a sense when we\nstart doing our track changes,\n\n50\n00:02:23.464 --> 00:02:26.150\ncuz essentially we're doing that.\n\n51\n00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.920\nWe're editing the document and\n\n52\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.829\nwe wanna track all of\nthe changes that we're making.\n\n53\n00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.420\nTrack changes.\n\n54\n00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.750\nThere you go, super helpful.\n\n55\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.330\nI feel pretty okay in the sense\nof the difficulty level.\n\n56\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.210\nIt can get a little daunting, and\nif you're doing extensive editing,\n\n57\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.340\nit's just this huge list.\n\n58\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.100\nSo I wanna point out some things as we go\nthrough here to maybe help you with like\n\n59\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.030\nthe views, and the reviewing pane,\nand the bubbles or the balloons.\n\n60\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.650\nAnd, it can maybe make your life a little\nbit easier when you get into extensive\n\n61\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.110\ntrack changes and\nbeing able to see it a little bit better,\n\n62\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.580\nright?\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt,\n\n63\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.846\nespecially in the idea of collaboration\nwhen you're not only making the document,\n\n64\n00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:17.870\nbut you're needing help from other people\nto be able to spot things that you go,\n\n65\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.257\nI know I wrote it but I really need\nto make sure I caught every point.\n\n66\n00:03:21.257 --> 00:03:24.786\nAnd you're giving something that's\nan important presentation or research.\n\n67\n00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:28.366\nI can see this being very useful,\nlike you said in academic setting, and\n\n68\n00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:30.410\nyou're also doing peer review.\n\n69\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.980\nOr somebody can highlight something for\nyou and ask you those questions.\n\n70\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.005\nAnd actually haven't\nmarked to that individual.\n\n71\n00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:40.031\nSo these changes really can help us out,\nand being able to track them is gonna be\n\n72\n00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:43.392\nwonderful news for somebody.\n&gt;&gt; And in the academic world like you're\n\n73\n00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:46.873\nsaying, I mean you have a thesis that\nyou're working with a thesis chair,\n\n74\n00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.040\nand that they're going\nto be giving you help.\n\n75\n00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.932\nAnd this is something that I know\na lot of academics use extensively.\n\n76\n00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:57.860\nSo being very familiar with how to work\nwith track changes, and the accepting and\n\n77\n00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.287\nrejecting and all those different\nparts that we're going to go over.\n\n78\n00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:03.020\nIt's pretty important.\n\n79\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.325\nSo, I love track changes,\nI think it's fantastic, so.\n\n80\n00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:10.006\nAnd talking about this with\nthe textbook there with you,\n\n81\n00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:12.465\nI'm actually doing that in Acrobat.\n\n82\n00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:15.807\nCuz Acrobat has pretty\nmuch the same stuff,\n\n83\n00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:21.420\neven actually a little bit more options\nwhen doing editing of a document.\n\n84\n00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.890\nAnd I do love being in Acrobat.\n\n85\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.810\nSo I think it's a fantastic program,\nI do love to teach that.\n\n86\n00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.885\nSo look,\ncheck that out in the course library.\n\n87\n00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:35.135\nAt this point right now, on this day,\nI haven't recorded it yet,\n\n88\n00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:37.060\nbut it is on my list of things to record.\n\n89\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.541\nOr maybe you see it already and be like?\n\n90\n00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:44.700\n[LAUGH] Anyways, let's go ahead and\nget down into our documents.\n\n91\n00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.870\nAnd I am going to open\nup our expert files,\n\n92\n00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.490\nbecause we have some files\nthat we're going to work with.\n\n93\n00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.480\nWe're gonna do the night's track changes.\n\n94\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.862\nWe have to kinda go over the scenarios,\nin a sense.\n\n95\n00:05:00.862 --> 00:05:04.881\nI have this file that I have written, and\n\n96\n00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:10.730\nwhat I need to do is I need to\nsend this to Joey to proof.\n\n97\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.660\nI want him to be able to\ndo all the proofing but\n\n98\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.290\nI wanna be able to see what he does.\n\n99\n00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.230\nSo, one very important stuff\nthat you're gonna need to if you\n\n100\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.290\nwant to have either you, yourself or\nanybody else that touches this document\n\n101\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.500\nto have those changes tracked,\nyou got to turn it on from the Review tab.\n\n102\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.030\nSo, right here on review is a little\nswitch right there, right now it is off.\n\n103\n00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.010\nAs soon as you click that and\nturn it on, it's tracking.\n\n104\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.046\nSo everything that is going to be done\nfrom this point forward will be tracked in\n\n105\n00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:46.310\nthis document.\n\n106\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.118\nNow I would save this file,\n\n107\n00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:53.350\nemail it to Joey or upload it to\nOneDrive or whatever and get it to him.\n\n108\n00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.980\nHave Joey or Ronnie or\nwhoever go ahead and do their editing.\n\n109\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.710\nAnd then letting them know like hey,\nI'm doing my track changes so go ahead and\n\n110\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.357\ndo your edits, send it back to me.\n\n111\n00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:08.125\nAnd then me as the creator of\nthe document, I can then go through and\n\n112\n00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:12.657\naccept Joey's changes,\nreject Joey's changes,\n\n113\n00:06:12.657 --> 00:06:18.540\njust add them all in, delete them all,\nall of that kinda fun stuff.\n\n114\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.850\nAnd so that's the whole power\nof being able to do editing.\n\n115\n00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.430\nNow, let's do one more scenario.\n\n116\n00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.470\nLet's say I've turned this on.\n\n117\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.618\nI've passed it to Joey,\nthen Joey passes it to Lance, and\n\n118\n00:06:28.618 --> 00:06:30.745\nthen Lance passes back to me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n119\n00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:33.470\n&gt;&gt; So you have a two-step review, right?\n\n120\n00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.106\nSo it's good to have more\nthan one set of eyes on it.\n\n121\n00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:39.300\nThen we'll get back to where we\nhave those multiple reviewers, but\n\n122\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.050\ntrack changes turning\non is very important.\n\n123\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.300\nThat being said, if I send this to you,\nRonnie, I save this and\n\n124\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.770\nsend it to you, you\n\n125\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.320\ncould turn that button off, couldn't you?\n\n126\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n127\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.500\nAnd if you turn it off and\n\n128\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.090\nstart doing all of your edits,\nI'm not gonna see it, is it?\n\n129\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.350\nThat's bad.\n&gt;&gt; That is bad.\n\n130\n00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.910\n&gt;&gt; Probably don't want that.\n\n131\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.010\nSo if you want to ensure that that\nperson that gets this file does\n\n132\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:08.370\nnot have the ability to turn off the track\nchanges, it's good to lock this down.\n\n133\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.044\nAnd we do have episodes on document\nsecurity, but this is one part that\n\n134\n00:07:12.044 --> 00:07:15.985\nI think is very important in this\nparticular topic to go ahead and throw in.\n\n135\n00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:20.622\nAnd it's over here on the Protect Document\nbutton on the Review tab.\n\n136\n00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:24.312\nAnd if I click it up at the top, we're not\ngonna talk about like passwords to open\n\n137\n00:07:24.312 --> 00:07:26.810\nand everything like that, it's down here.\n\n138\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.990\nProtection, protect the document for\ntrack changes.\n\n139\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.430\nAnd it knows that because this is already\non, so I would put in a password on this,\n\n140\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:42.500\nsave this file and then sent it\nto Ronnie or Joey, or whoever.\n\n141\n00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.480\nThen you can't turn that off,\nit's not possible, and\n\n142\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.630\nI actually have an example of this.\n\n143\n00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.250\nSo in the track changes, Joey,\nthis one was already locked, and\n\n144\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.366\ndo you notice how there's a couple of them\nright here, and if I go over to review.\n\n145\n00:07:58.366 --> 00:07:59.029\nWait no that's not.\n\n146\n00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:01.316\nYou know what, that's, sorry wrong file.\n\n147\n00:08:01.316 --> 00:08:05.722\n[LAUGH] Let me go ahead and\nread my notes, it is It's this one,\n\n148\n00:08:05.722 --> 00:08:08.460\njust a regular track changes, no Joey.\n\n149\n00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.510\nThere we go.\n\n150\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.935\nIf I come over to Mailing, nope, Review,\n\n151\n00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:16.280\n[LAUGH] it looks like it's off, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n152\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.230\n&gt;&gt; But if I come into here and\n\n153\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.080\nstart doing this stuff,\nnotice it is doing some tracking.\n\n154\n00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.830\nAnd so, it's not even like an on or\noff, it just looks like it's off.\n\n155\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.330\nIt's not.\n\n156\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.290\nAnd the thing is I'm pretty sure\nI forgot the password that I\n\n157\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.300\nput to this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.200\n&gt;&gt; But if you gave somebody the password,\n\n159\n00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.000\nthey could turn it off.\n\n160\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.430\nBut it's a nice deterrent to make sure\nyou don't let people to turn it off.\n\n161\n00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.790\nSo, it's pretty cool and very easy to do.\n\n162\n00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.860\nI'm not gonna save the changes just\npick this file up, all right, great.\n\n163\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.140\nSo now, let's go to this scenario or\nlike the simulation of maybe I'm Joey or\n\n164\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.190\nmaybe I'm just myself and I've done\ntrack changes on a document just for me.\n\n165\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.795\nI'm not collaborating with anybody, but I\nneed to remind myself as to what I did to\n\n166\n00:09:00.795 --> 00:09:05.268\nedit the document and remember my steps,\ncuz maybe for some reason I'm gonna go\n\n167\n00:09:05.268 --> 00:09:10.056\nback later and tell myself I don't need to\nhave that done, or reject my own changes.\n\n168\n00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:10.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:09:10.654 --> 00:09:12.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it doesn't always have to\n\n170\n00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.390\nextend to working with others.\n\n171\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.260\nYou could just be me, myself, and I.\n\n172\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.485\nThere's my team.\n\n173\n00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:22.386\n[LAUGH] Ronnie's just shaking his head.\n\n174\n00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:23.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n175\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.080\nit is helpful when you\nare viewing your own work, and\n\n176\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.970\nyou're having to actually do that.\n\n177\n00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.521\nHow we do it with drafting work.\n\n178\n00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:30.665\nSo, yeah, it works.\n\n179\n00:09:30.665 --> 00:09:33.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So how do I go ahead and\n\n180\n00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.150\nmark up my document?\n\n181\n00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.990\nWith the track changes on, I can,\nlet's say, delete something.\n\n182\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.390\nI'm thinking this down, down, down just\ndoesn't need to be here and I go ahead and\n\n183\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.672\ndelete it and it takes it out.\n\n184\n00:09:46.672 --> 00:09:50.900\nI'm gonna zoom out just a little bit\nto show you where it says there's\n\n185\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.150\na few things that happen.\n\n186\n00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.313\nDepending on your settings,\nget that in a minute, it went ahead and\n\n187\n00:09:56.313 --> 00:10:00.766\nshowed me that I deleted, off to the side\nit becomes just like paint off to\n\n188\n00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.119\nthe right hand side, that I did this.\n\n189\n00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:09.250\nThe time, put time stamps all of this\nstuff, and then the user of who did this.\n\n190\n00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.524\nThere's also, on the left-hand side,\nit's kind of small, but\n\n191\n00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:16.515\nthere's like this little line off to\nthe left-hand side in the selection area.\n\n192\n00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.420\nSo, it's just letting you, oops, sorry.\n\n193\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.080\nIt's just letting you know that,\nthat's what has been done.\n\n194\n00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.650\nSo, let's do a few more edits,\nlike, I deleted.\n\n195\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.260\nLet's change do cat eats bats?\n\n196\n00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:35.740\nI wonder, maybe we'll take this\nvery like a cute little mouse.\n\n197\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.010\nMaking things up as we go.\n\n198\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.480\nNotice that now this turns into where\nit looks like it's underlined, but\n\n199\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.090\nthat's just the edits.\n\n200\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.850\nAnd notice that it's also\nshowing up in orange.\n\n201\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.660\nMaybe I wanna change this around.\n\n202\n00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.215\nMaybe I wanna take this and\nput this paragraph past the other one.\n\n203\n00:10:54.215 --> 00:10:58.410\nSo, I can cut this and\nthen I can paste this.\n\n204\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.400\nNow, notice that looks a little different,\ndoesn't it?\n\n205\n00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.640\nSo, now I have it as\nthese green underlines.\n\n206\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.280\nMaybe I went ahead and.\n\n207\n00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.300\nSo, as began running.\n\n208\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.032\nSo, notice that I selected it, and\n\n209\n00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:20.923\nover here it's saying that I deleted\ntalking and I inserted running, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:20.923 --> 00:11:25.090\nSo, I'm just editing like I\nwould any other document.\n\n211\n00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.960\nMaybe I take this text and I make it fold.\n\n212\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.870\nSo now, you can see that it's telling\nme that I have formatted my text.\n\n213\n00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.970\nIf I went ahead and\nmade this an extra paragraph.\n\n214\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.503\nDoesn't really show that I did that,\nbut it is a paragraph.\n\n215\n00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:42.897\n[LAUGH] Really?\n\n216\n00:11:42.897 --> 00:11:47.980\n[LAUGH] And maybe I could take this and\nmake it red, so\n\n217\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.290\nvariations of different types of things\nthat you would be normally doing\n\n218\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.400\nto a document, and\nis tracking everything that you do.\n\n219\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.189\nReally neat, I like that.\n\n220\n00:11:59.189 --> 00:12:04.886\nNow, sometimes there's feedback that I\nwant to give another person or myself,\n\n221\n00:12:04.886 --> 00:12:10.720\nbut I don't want to delete anything,\nI don't want to remove it, what have.\n\n222\n00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.420\nI guess delete and\nremove are the same thing.\n\n223\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.008\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n224\n00:12:13.008 --> 00:12:13.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n225\n00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:17.090\n[LAUGH] That's inserting a comment.\n\n226\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:22.140\nNow, comments don't always\nneed to go with track changes.\n\n227\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.640\nThey're not like, you can only do comments\nwhen you do track changes, but it's also,\n\n228\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.570\nto me it's when you do reviewing,\nthat's where it comes into place.\n\n229\n00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.530\nMaybe right here, if I select this text.\n\n230\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.097\nI just wanna make a note of is it?\n\n231\n00:12:36.097 --> 00:12:38.310\nAre you sure it's not the pink night?\n\n232\n00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:43.210\nSo, if I select the text\nthat I'm referring to,\n\n233\n00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.610\nclick this new comment button.\n\n234\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:51.260\nNotice that off the side,\nit doesn't do any editing per se.\n\n235\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:59.273\nIt just gives me the option to say\nare you sure it's not the pink night?\n\n236\n00:13:01.922 --> 00:13:04.440\nYay, so now I've got as a comment.\n\n237\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.762\nAnd notice it's kinda hard to see,\nbut you see right up there,\n\n238\n00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:13.590\nit's a different Icon\nthen these over here.\n\n239\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.547\nOkay, so that is just kinda a little\nindication that this is a comment and\n\n240\n00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:20.240\nnot an actual edit.\n\n241\n00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.062\nAnd it looks different altogether\nyou just go through and\n\n242\n00:13:24.062 --> 00:13:28.210\nmark this thing up and\nit is tracking everything you've got.\n\n243\n00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.482\nNow, all these colors and\nthe double underline for\n\n244\n00:13:32.482 --> 00:13:35.870\nthe move and how I added or deleted text.\n\n245\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:41.284\nThis is all part of the preferences that\nyou have and why does it say OfficePro.TV.\n\n246\n00:13:41.284 --> 00:13:46.478\nWhy does it not say Justin Timberlake or\nVonne Smith or whoever the user is?\n\n247\n00:13:46.478 --> 00:13:51.032\nNow normally usually it's\nconnected to your sign in,\n\n248\n00:13:51.032 --> 00:13:56.487\nwhen you go ahead and\ndo your Office 365 and it should connect.\n\n249\n00:13:56.487 --> 00:13:58.920\nNot always, but you can change that.\n\n250\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.063\nThat's in your preferences.\n\n251\n00:14:01.063 --> 00:14:05.356\nSo, I'm gonna go into my word preferences.\n\n252\n00:14:05.356 --> 00:14:10.530\nAnd right in here,\nthere is my track changes as an option.\n\n253\n00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.600\nAnd this is where,\nhow do you want to treat insertions?\n\n254\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.950\nHow do you want to treat deletions?\n\n255\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.013\nHow do you want to treat comments and\nformatting, and moves and\n\n256\n00:14:20.013 --> 00:14:24.394\nyou can see that there's giving\nyou the little examples over here.\n\n257\n00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:30.035\nAnd how is it color, and\nwhat color is it going to use?\n\n258\n00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:33.275\nI will tell you, I don't mess with this.\n\n259\n00:14:33.275 --> 00:14:36.665\nI don't know about you, Ronnie,\nI just don't think there's any reason for\n\n260\n00:14:36.665 --> 00:14:38.510\nme to go through and change this stuff.\n\n261\n00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.330\nIt just keep the defaults.\n\n262\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.990\nIt's nice because by author, that means\nthat when somebody else goes ahead and\n\n263\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.300\ndoes some other changes, it's gonna\nchange to whatever color that's not\n\n264\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.790\nthe other person.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n265\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.210\n&gt;&gt; So, I personally don't do this.\n\n266\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.750\nI'll take whatever it will do.\n\n267\n00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.224\nBut the thing that I found slightly\ninteresting right here, and\n\n268\n00:14:58.224 --> 00:15:00.614\nthat's where you might go, wait a second.\n\n269\n00:15:00.614 --> 00:15:03.200\nWhere it says deletions,\nit says strike throughs.\n\n270\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.365\nAnd it looks like in\nthis example right there,\n\n271\n00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:10.270\nit looks like it's taking the line and\ngoing through it.\n\n272\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.530\nAll right,\nI'll come back to that user in a second.\n\n273\n00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.490\nSorry, I forgot that.\n\n274\n00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.027\nBut, right here do you\nsee how I have deleted?\n\n275\n00:15:16.027 --> 00:15:18.760\nAnd it doesn't look like a strikethrough,\ndoes it, Ronnie?\n\n276\n00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't.\n\n277\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.180\n&gt;&gt; No, it's off to the side.\n\n278\n00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.390\nSo, why is it doing that?\n\n279\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.010\nI thought in the preferences it's\ngonna show the line through it.\n\n280\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.910\nThis comes back to how you are viewing or\nsetting\n\n281\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.090\nup the preferences if you wanna say of\nthe track changes, and that can change.\n\n282\n00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.270\nRight up here,\n\n283\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.010\ndo you see where it has this mark up\noptions and in the top of one above?\n\n284\n00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.088\nThese two are to me very important,\nbecause I've opened up track changes\n\n285\n00:15:47.088 --> 00:15:49.738\ndocuments, like why\ncan't I see everything?\n\n286\n00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:52.202\nAll I see is the little\nlines off to the side or\n\n287\n00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:55.941\nI don't even see any of the changes\nat all, what's going on here?\n\n288\n00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:59.403\nSo here, well,\nit's showing me all mark up.\n\n289\n00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:01.098\nBut if I do simple mark up,\n\n290\n00:16:01.098 --> 00:16:04.653\nit takes all of those other\nthings off to the side away.\n\n291\n00:16:04.653 --> 00:16:08.928\nI know that they're there,\nbecause I have these red lines.\n\n292\n00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:09.470\nSee right there?\n\n293\n00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.763\nSo it's really just like hiding\nall the details from me and\n\n294\n00:16:13.763 --> 00:16:18.861\njust showing me the general location\nof where track changes happen.\n\n295\n00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:22.750\nAnd notice when I hover over it,\nnow it just says show track changes.\n\n296\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.630\nAnd if you click that,\nyou can show and hide that.\n\n297\n00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:30.460\nSo that's a little shortcut,\nokay, from up here of simple,\n\n298\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.560\nall, or no markup, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.831\nThere's no markup, so\nyou think nothing's happened.\n\n300\n00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:37.882\nBut it is, and\n\n301\n00:16:37.882 --> 00:16:43.150\n[LAUGH] this has got me where I\naccidentally turned the track changes on.\n\n302\n00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.860\nI come in like, whoa,\nI actually didn't wanna see all that,\n\n303\n00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.610\nbecause I just wasn't viewing\nthe mark up there at all.\n\n304\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.870\nOr if I go with the original,\n\n305\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.320\nnow I'm seeing everything\nwithout any of my changes.\n\n306\n00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.520\nSo that might be an also good way\nof maybe compare and contrast.\n\n307\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.746\nWhat was my original looking like?\n\n308\n00:16:59.746 --> 00:17:04.579\nIt has my changes but\nit is not showing the markup,\n\n309\n00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.930\nso that could be a big difference.\n\n310\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.892\nBut that one always trips people up,\n\n311\n00:17:09.892 --> 00:17:13.200\nthat I've noticed with the whole\nviewing of what you can see.\n\n312\n00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.020\nAnd coming back around to the why is\nit not showing as a strike-through for\n\n313\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.360\ndeletion, this is where you\nget your markup options.\n\n314\n00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:29.490\nWhat am I asking or allowing to be\nseen with the changes that I'm making.\n\n315\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:33.880\nIt's comments, ink, insertions,\nformatting, I'd keep them all on.\n\n316\n00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.208\nBut sometimes with the formatting though,\nit's like, okay, the formatting,\n\n317\n00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:41.730\nevery single thing that I change\nthe format can get a little crazy.\n\n318\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:47.650\nSo I might not want to show that, so\nyou can filter it out, in a sense.\n\n319\n00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.959\nIt turns on, turn on or off,\nwhether I see, formatting, what have you,\n\n320\n00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:57.820\nthat whole stripe there,\nI know I'm gonna be just get to it.\n\n321\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.420\nIt's right here, the balloons,\nthese things off to the side.\n\n322\n00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.390\nI'm showing all revisions in balloons.\n\n323\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.710\nIf I wanted to see things in line,\nlet's see what it looks like.\n\n324\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.235\nLook at there, now you can see the down,\ndown, down with a strike-through.\n\n325\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.670\nGot it, now it shows it in line, great.\n\n326\n00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.665\nOr you can also just go ahead and do maybe\njust the comments and the formatting\n\n327\n00:18:27.665 --> 00:18:32.690\nare in balloons, and all of the other\ntext changes are going to be in line.\n\n328\n00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.900\nSo you get some of the other\noptions right there.\n\n329\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:40.541\nAnd that's why the preferences might\nnot look the same, especially when it\n\n330\n00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:45.443\ncomes to deletions and what it looks like.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do have to be careful with\n\n331\n00:18:45.443 --> 00:18:48.365\nsome of these changes in the way\nthat Vonne is showing us, and\n\n332\n00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:51.743\nthe reason why is that a lot of times\nif you were just to delete out that,\n\n333\n00:18:51.743 --> 00:18:54.490\njust like you see there, down, down, down.\n\n334\n00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.560\nWithout a comment, Vonne doesn't\nknow why you made the change.\n\n335\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.010\nAnd she might go, is that necessary?\n\n336\n00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:05.060\nAnd then she's racking her brain like\nwhy did Ronnie choose to do that?\n\n337\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.170\nSo always think about when you are making\nthese changes and marking these changes.\n\n338\n00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.580\nMake sure you're very clear\nabout why you do that.\n\n339\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.400\nCuz it's frustrating when\nsomebody gets a doc and\n\n340\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.810\nthey've deleted out a whole paragraph and\nyou're like, this doesn't make sense.\n\n341\n00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.020\nWhy would you do that?\n\n342\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.800\nThey just assume that you\nknow why they did it,\n\n343\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.530\nbut you don't?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n344\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.120\nthat's why doing those comments-\n&gt;&gt; Helps.\n\n345\n00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.670\n&gt;&gt; So that could be where\n\n346\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.520\nI just put my cursor here and\nI insert a comment, and\n\n347\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.520\nI say not needed.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n348\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.944\n&gt;&gt; Or what have you and\n\n349\n00:19:32.944 --> 00:19:38.375\ngive a little explanation because\ncomments and mark ups are different.\n\n350\n00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:41.235\nThey use them in the same place\nof where you're collaborating and\n\n351\n00:19:41.235 --> 00:19:43.930\neverything like that, but\nthey are not the same thing.\n\n352\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.300\nAnd the other thing is I can,\nwhoops, that's something different.\n\n353\n00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.390\nWhen you have comments,\n\n354\n00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:55.580\nyou can actually comment in a comment and\nhave almost like a conversation.\n\n355\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.240\nAnd that's what me and my author\nthat I just do the textbook layout,\n\n356\n00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.150\nshe's the author, we do that.\n\n357\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.522\nWe'll have full conversations back and\nforth in our comments.\n\n358\n00:20:05.522 --> 00:20:09.280\nIt's like why I did something, why she\nwants something changed, how is it?\n\n359\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.230\nOkay, I did this, so on and so forth.\n\n360\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.090\nSo it's a great dialogue to go back and\nforth from.\n\n361\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.043\nIt's really nice that it's all time\n\n362\n00:20:16.043 --> 00:20:16.790\nstamped.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n363\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.162\n&gt;&gt; Date stamped, so\n\n364\n00:20:18.162 --> 00:20:21.980\nreally, really good on that front.\n\n365\n00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.814\nSo neat things, the OfficeProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n366\n00:20:23.814 --> 00:20:26.356\n&gt;&gt; That's back in your preferences.\n\n367\n00:20:26.356 --> 00:20:29.958\nAnd in your markup options,\nI can get to it from here.\n\n368\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:33.738\nSo if I go to preferences,\nit's not in the track changes, though.\n\n369\n00:20:33.738 --> 00:20:38.539\nYou've gotta go to the Show All,\nand it's in your user information.\n\n370\n00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:39.790\nThere's OfficeProTV.\n\n371\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.930\nSo you would type in your name or\nwhat you would want to show up\n\n372\n00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.960\nin the little boxes when you're\ndoing your track changes.\n\n373\n00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.730\nI'm gonna keep it this way just for now,\nbut that's just something that's important\n\n374\n00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.025\nfor the actual person that you are.\n\n375\n00:20:56.025 --> 00:20:57.888\n[LAUGH] And\nif you wanted to change that information.\n\n376\n00:20:57.888 --> 00:21:01.040\nAll righty, a few other things.\n\n377\n00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.654\nWe have the right-hand side that's\nshowing in the balloons, but\n\n378\n00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:08.909\nyou also have this button here called\nReviewing up at the top on our ribbon, and\n\n379\n00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:11.318\nthen it brings it up\non the left-hand side.\n\n380\n00:21:11.318 --> 00:21:15.365\nAnd it gives you a little\nbit more of a summary.\n\n381\n00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:18.935\nSo you're saying how many insertions,\nhow many deletions, how many moves, yeah,\n\n382\n00:21:18.935 --> 00:21:20.585\nthat's kinda neat.\n\n383\n00:21:20.585 --> 00:21:24.755\nAnd then you can go through all of this,\nand as you can see,\n\n384\n00:21:24.755 --> 00:21:29.625\nif I click on it, it's actually moving\nme to those particular revisions.\n\n385\n00:21:29.625 --> 00:21:32.740\nSo that's nice to know about and\na little bit easier\n\n386\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:38.280\nway to get around in a doc\nthat has a lot of revisions.\n\n387\n00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.860\nSo pretty cool.\n\n388\n00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.730\nNow what about reviewing these changes?\n\n389\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.190\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and not save the\nchanges to this particular file because\n\n390\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.140\nI'm showing you all the different\nthings that you can do.\n\n391\n00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.226\nSo I'm gonna do a Cmd+W.\n\n392\n00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:54.480\nI'm not saving the changes to\nkeep it nice and clean for you.\n\n393\n00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.370\nCuz I have another file that\nwe're going to look at.\n\n394\n00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.860\nAnd this is where we actually\nhave two different reviewers.\n\n395\n00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:05.040\nThis is that whole I pass it to Joey,\nthen I passed it to me,\n\n396\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.301\nVonne, and\nthen it's bringing it back to me.\n\n397\n00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:08.770\nThis is a different Vonne.\n\n398\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:09.750\nWait, I'm Justin, aren't I?\n\n399\n00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I believe so.\n\n400\n00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.484\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He announced his tour dates.\n\n401\n00:22:13.484 --> 00:22:16.602\n[LAUGH] So we're.\n\n402\n00:22:16.602 --> 00:22:18.353\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n403\n00:22:18.353 --> 00:22:20.447\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna come with me, right,\n\n404\n00:22:20.447 --> 00:22:21.520\nRonnie?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n405\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.645\nnot even close.\n&gt;&gt; Come on, come with me and Marisha.\n\n406\n00:22:25.645 --> 00:22:26.444\nIt'll be fun.\n\n407\n00:22:26.444 --> 00:22:26.994\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:22:26.994 --> 00:22:29.457\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we have a document that\n\n409\n00:22:29.457 --> 00:22:32.068\nI've got some people in here.\nAnd\n\n410\n00:22:32.068 --> 00:22:35.130\nnotice that here's a perfect\nexample of timestamps.\n\n411\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.060\nYou can see the last time that\nI was doing the Word Expert\n\n412\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.782\nshow for PC.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n413\n00:22:38.782 --> 00:22:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it was around July 3rd.\n\n414\n00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:48.060\nCool, and this is an example of\nthat conversation of Justin said,\n\n415\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.810\nhe proved that Joey went ahead and\nanswered.\n\n416\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.780\nI went ahead and answered.\n\n417\n00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.610\nAnd so that's something\nthat you can do right here.\n\n418\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.010\nDo you see how in this comment,\nif I click on this,\n\n419\n00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:05.170\nit allows me, as this little button, it's\njust a reply to, I think I lost the hover.\n\n420\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.520\nIt's a reply to.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n421\n00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.431\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then I could say me 3.\n\n422\n00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:15.120\n[LAUGH] And so I have that conversation.\n\n423\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.210\nAnd notice that we have some\ndifferent colorings with Joey is,\n\n424\n00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.300\nthat's not green, what's that?\n\n425\n00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.058\nThat's blue, okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n426\n00:23:22.058 --> 00:23:23.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, blue.\n\n427\n00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.946\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I, Vonne, was green so\n\n428\n00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:32.550\nthat whole just keeping the preferences\nto choose the color base and the user.\n\n429\n00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.487\nI just think it's fine,\ndon't really mess with that.\n\n430\n00:23:35.487 --> 00:23:39.723\nBut if it's coming back around to me,\nand I've got everybody doing this stuff,\n\n431\n00:23:39.723 --> 00:23:42.330\nit's my job to now accept or\nreject the changes.\n\n432\n00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.830\nThis is the cool part of mm,\nyeah, you're good.\n\n433\n00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.940\nNope, don't want you,\ngo back to the way it normally was.\n\n434\n00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.950\nI'm gonna start up at the top.\n\n435\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:56.090\nI'm on the first word in\nthe sentence in the first paragraph.\n\n436\n00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:58.394\nGo back over to review.\n\n437\n00:23:58.394 --> 00:24:00.257\nAnd then we go through here.\n\n438\n00:24:00.257 --> 00:24:03.664\nWe have accept, reject.\n\n439\n00:24:03.664 --> 00:24:07.555\nMove to the previous and next.\n\n440\n00:24:07.555 --> 00:24:11.431\nSo there's a drop down because there's\none of those like, hey I'm right here,\n\n441\n00:24:11.431 --> 00:24:13.434\nlet's go to, well, you know what?\n\n442\n00:24:13.434 --> 00:24:16.344\nLet's do this.\nLet's go to the next change, and\n\n443\n00:24:16.344 --> 00:24:23.240\nI can see it highlighted right here it\nsays, Joe deleted down, down, down.\n\n444\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.790\nDo I wanna accept that or reject it?\n\n445\n00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.750\nMaybe I'll accept it.\n\n446\n00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.070\nNow I could click the button, but then I'd\nhave to click the move to the next button.\n\n447\n00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.980\nSo notice it's like,\naccept move to the next,\n\n448\n00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.770\nrather than just accept, so\nit kinda combines everything.\n\n449\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:38.450\nNotice I could be like,\n\n450\n00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:43.510\nyou know what, everything that has\nbeen given as changes, take them all.\n\n451\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.120\nYeah, I don't even wanna go through them.\n\n452\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.220\nI trust you guys.\n\n453\n00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.610\nI'll accept all the changes.\n\n454\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.401\nThe other one is, then I'll stop tracking,\n\n455\n00:24:51.401 --> 00:24:55.672\nbecause I don't wanna make more\nthings that I have to keep tracking.\n\n456\n00:24:55.672 --> 00:24:57.497\nWe'll just go ahead and\naccept and move to the next.\n\n457\n00:24:57.497 --> 00:25:01.208\nJust for the next one,\nmaybe we'll go ahead and let's just see.\n\n458\n00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:02.264\nWhere am I?\n\n459\n00:25:02.264 --> 00:25:03.430\nDino is the cat.\n\n460\n00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.206\nNow, we gotta keep the cat in there.\n\n461\n00:25:05.206 --> 00:25:07.800\nSo we'll go ahead and just reject and\nmove to the next one.\n\n462\n00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.312\nThere we go, now I can see it.\n\n463\n00:25:09.312 --> 00:25:10.206\nI kinda got lost for a second.\n\n464\n00:25:10.206 --> 00:25:15.013\n[LAUGH] Deleted lamps and now it's\nlit up by a row of Christmas lights.\n\n465\n00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:16.681\nYeah, that's good, okay.\n\n466\n00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:18.509\nLet's go to the next one.\n\n467\n00:25:18.509 --> 00:25:20.969\nWe gotta go to the button, sorry.\n\n468\n00:25:20.969 --> 00:25:21.758\nYou get the idea.\n\n469\n00:25:21.758 --> 00:25:24.545\nWe don't have to go through\nevery single one of them here.\n\n470\n00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:25.880\nMaybe I'll just, whoops.\n\n471\n00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.140\nI'll accept them all and\nstop tracking the changes.\n\n472\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:28.894\nSounds good.\n\n473\n00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:32.551\nYou're like, but wait a second,\nthis is not all done.\n\n474\n00:25:32.551 --> 00:25:34.606\nDo you know what these are, Ronnie?\n\n475\n00:25:34.606 --> 00:25:36.123\nMaybe.\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n476\n00:25:36.123 --> 00:25:38.945\nComments on somethings?\n&gt;&gt; They are, yes, because remember\n\n477\n00:25:38.945 --> 00:25:41.970\nchanges, track changes and comments.\n&gt;&gt; Different.\n\n478\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, while we use them a lot of time on\n\n479\n00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:48.870\nthe same space, you can do comments and\nnever do track changes.\n\n480\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:53.610\nSo, again, commenting in a document\ncan be done at any time.\n\n481\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.230\nDon't have to be doing track\nchanges to do comments.\n\n482\n00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.930\nThey're just little sticky notes.\n\n483\n00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.763\nIt's like putting those Post-it notes on\nyour document to just give yourself notes,\n\n484\n00:26:02.763 --> 00:26:04.558\nor to give somebody else notes.\n\n485\n00:26:04.558 --> 00:26:05.835\nThat's all they are.\n\n486\n00:26:05.835 --> 00:26:11.346\nBut the other thing is, hey, if I wanted\nto not, I don't need my comments anymore.\n\n487\n00:26:11.346 --> 00:26:12.760\nLet's just go ahead and\nstrip them all out.\n\n488\n00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.910\nLet's just go ahead and keep the text.\n\n489\n00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:21.060\nNotice that here that I have the Next and\nPrevious for my comments and\n\n490\n00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.990\nthen I could delete individual comments.\n\n491\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.131\nI could also delete all of them.\n\n492\n00:26:27.131 --> 00:26:29.878\nAnd that's something that\nI do when it's like, okay,\n\n493\n00:26:29.878 --> 00:26:32.251\nI almost said it's quitting time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n494\n00:26:32.251 --> 00:26:32.959\n&gt;&gt; Done.\n\n495\n00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:34.190\n&gt;&gt; When I'm done.\n\n496\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.508\nAnd usually I do a file\nsave as on this one.\n\n497\n00:26:36.508 --> 00:26:38.623\n&gt;&gt; Keep my document with all my tracked\n\n498\n00:26:38.623 --> 00:26:42.219\nchanges, keep another file\nthat's the clean, finished,\n\n499\n00:26:42.219 --> 00:26:44.130\neverything's good document.\n\n500\n00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.880\nSo if I delete all my changes,\n\n501\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.420\nI'm sorry, delete all my comments,\nnow I don't have any mark up.\n\n502\n00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.018\nI don't have any comments, I have gone\nthrough and accepted and rejected.\n\n503\n00:26:54.018 --> 00:26:59.547\nAnd now, I have a nice ready\nto go file that everybody\n\n504\n00:26:59.547 --> 00:27:05.843\nput their input into and\nI determine who stays and who goes.\n\n505\n00:27:05.843 --> 00:27:07.829\nIt is the ultimate power that you have.\n\n506\n00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:10.139\nAnd it's pretty neat.\n\n507\n00:27:10.139 --> 00:27:13.220\nLove it, I use this a lot.\n\n508\n00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.770\nAnd I think it's pretty cool.\n\n509\n00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.020\nAnd I hope that you think it's pretty\ncool, and you're going to be collaborating\n\n510\n00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.010\nwith other people and\nmaking them track changes.\n\n511\n00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.060\nAnd lock those track changes down so\n\n512\n00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.342\nthey can't turn it off.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n513\n00:27:26.342 --> 00:27:29.323\nWell, thank you for helping us out here\nwith some of these other details in\n\n514\n00:27:29.323 --> 00:27:32.170\nthe collaboration features that\nwe'll find inside of Word.\n\n515\n00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:36.230\nTracking changes are gonna be very\nimportant because it does help us to\n\n516\n00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.800\nbeing able to take our document and\nnot allow somebody to just change it and\n\n517\n00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.100\nus not know about it.\n\n518\n00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.630\nBut if they do make changes,\nwe can track the changes that were made.\n\n519\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.455\nAnd then instead of the just saying I\ndon't care, I'm gonna make the change,\n\n520\n00:27:48.455 --> 00:27:49.710\nVonne will never notice.\n\n521\n00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.350\nWe can either accept it or reject it.\n\n522\n00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.400\nThere's a lot of great features in here\nthat allow you to maintain control\n\n523\n00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.840\nof your document specially in\na collaboration environment.\n\n524\n00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.759\nThere's a lot more to come,\nnow we're gonna save that for\n\n525\n00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:03.437\nof course another episode then.\n\n526\n00:28:03.437 --> 00:28:07.431\nSigning off for OfficePro.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n527\n00:28:07.431 --> 00:28:08.383\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n528\n00:28:08.383 --> 00:28:09.858\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n529\n00:28:09.858 --> 00:28:12.466\nmore of Word 2016 Expert for Mac shows.\n\n530\n00:28:12.466 -->

Thank you so much,\n\n11\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.360\nI'm doing fantastic, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine, Vonne, we are ready to\n\n12\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.900\ntake a look at something I don't know\nif I've ever actually done before.\n\n13\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.120\nWhich is this idea of\nthe comparing the documents.\n\n14\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.900\nI have done some of the combining.\n\n15\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.540\nSo Vonne, what do we take away from that\nwhen we start talking about this topic?\n\n16\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.235\n&gt;&gt; We're going to be comparing documents\n\n17\n00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:53.285\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n18\n00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love to define a term with\n\n19\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.670\nits own word.\n\n20\n00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.980\nYes, okay.\n\n21\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.010\nDefine the term with the term.\n\n22\n00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.630\nBut that is exactly what\nwe're going to be doing.\n\n23\n00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.180\nBut let's give a scenario first.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n24\n00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.240\n&gt;&gt; And then\n\n25\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.730\nthis would be why you would wanna use a.\n\n26\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.400\nWe took a look at track changes\nin our previous episode,\n\n27\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.100\nwhere we turned on track changes.\n\n28\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.830\nSomebody went ahead and made changes\nto the document and we could see them.\n\n29\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.770\nBut what if we had a document,\nlike an original document.\n\n30\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.880\nYou sent it to somebody.\n\n31\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.480\nThey brought it back to us, but\nI forgot to turn the track changes on.\n\n32\n00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.290\nMy gosh.\nWell, I don't know what's different.\n\n33\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.360\nHave you ever done that Ronnie,\nwhere you take two pieces of paper, and\n\n34\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.870\nyou're looking and looking.\n\n35\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.890\nLike.\n\n36\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.670\nThere's a change.\n\n37\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.640\nLike, there's a change.\n\n38\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.100\nThere's a different word.\n\n39\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.810\nRight?\n\n40\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.740\nThat's where Word gonna do this for us.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n41\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.240\n&gt;&gt; It's going to take this original\n\n42\n00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.010\ndocument, compare it to this revise or\nsecond document and\n\n43\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.450\nthen show me what's the difference.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n44\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.208\n&gt;&gt; Nice, yes.\n\n45\n00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:58.340\nSo this definitely falls in line with the,\n\n46\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.260\nit can't be a completely\nseparate document.\n\n47\n00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.350\nLike we're talking about\nturtles in one and\n\n48\n00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.750\nwe're talking about bunnies in another.\n\n49\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.180\nNo, it's gonna be you made\nsome changes to a document,\n\n50\n00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.080\nand you didn't remember\nto track the changes.\n\n51\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.180\nSo you can compare it\nagainst an original and\n\n52\n00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.650\nit shows you where it's different.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds\n\n53\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.350\ngreat.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty neat.\n\n54\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.080\nAnd then we'll talk about combine\nafter we're done comparing, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.790\nSo, but they are two separate functions.\n\n56\n00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.275\nThey don't like, it's not, anyways.\n\n57\n00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:30.950\n[LAUGH] We, let's look at a few.\n\n58\n00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.219\nLet's look at this Knights1 document.\n\n59\n00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.500\nAnd, come one.\n\n60\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.250\nThere we go.\n\n61\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.820\nSo Knights one, you can see.\n\n62\n00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.770\nJust adds a comparison,\nwe will open up Knights2 and\n\n63\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.420\nthen just go back and forth between them.\n\n64\n00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.740\nAnd there we go.\n\n65\n00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.050\nTaking a while to get this done.\n\n66\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.840\nNow nights two, so\n\n67\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.080\nmake sure you look at the title bar up\nhere, it does have a comment in here okay?\n\n68\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.960\nAnd then we've got a few different things,\n\n69\n00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.320\nI'm just gonna move this over so we can\nsee them somewhat next to each other.\n\n70\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.670\nI could see there's a little\nbit different here.\n\n71\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.630\nLook red knight It started with The\nKnight2, it has the paragraph switched.\n\n72\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.430\nAnd then the White Knight and\nThe Knights2 is formatted\n\n73\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.560\na little bit differently and\nthe Bishop cuts.\n\n74\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.720\nSo, just tying to show you\nguys a little bit difference.\n\n75\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.330\nThis is a Heading 1,\nthis is Heading 2, so on and so forth.\n\n76\n00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.180\nSo I can tell right now\nthat there are some\n\n77\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.540\nchanges made.\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n78\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.260\n&gt;&gt; Between them and\n\n79\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.900\nI'm going to close both of them just\ndoing the command w to get us started.\n\n80\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.420\nSo I need to be able to show me.\n\n81\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.450\nI want Word to show me\nwhere the differences\n\n82\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.200\nare compare them to each other.\n\n83\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.370\nSo i'm going to start with\na blank new document.\n\n84\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.060\nIt's the easiest way to do this.\n\n85\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.400\nWe start here.\n\n86\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.230\nBlank slate.\n\n87\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.260\nWe come over to review.\n\n88\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.920\nAnd we come over to the compare button and\nwe drop this down.\n\n89\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.820\nThere's our two options.\n\n90\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.660\nDo you want to compare them?\n\n91\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.700\nOr do you want to combine them?\n\n92\n00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.220\nTwo different functions that work.\n\n93\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.450\nSo I'm going to compare.\n\n94\n00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.930\nSo when you click on compare you say\nwell what's the original document?\n\n95\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.880\nAnd I have the options showing.\n\n96\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.010\nSo see the little button right down here?\n\n97\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.620\nThis is where what is\nit comparing against.\n\n98\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.060\nSo you could choose and pick which ones.\n\n99\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.130\nI always pick all of them.\n\n100\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.330\nAnd notice that it will create\nthe results in a new document.\n\n101\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.560\nAnd I would always.\n\n102\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.650\nSo that way, the original and\nthe revised stay by themselves and\n\n103\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.300\nI get the results in a new file.\n\n104\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.500\nSo I would just keep all of the same\nsettings but you could do this drop down.\n\n105\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.450\nI was like I've been opening\nup a lot of documents.\n\n106\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.210\nI was like it might just be\neasier to go with this one.\n\n107\n00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.970\nClick the little folder button,\nbrings you out to your finder.\n\n108\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.310\nI will find the files in my Word,\nthere it is Word Expert.\n\n109\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.440\nAnd I will find knights1 because that's\nthe original document that I started with.\n\n110\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.130\nThe revised document that you\nare going to be comparing against.\n\n111\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.900\nSo I click on the button, we come over to\nthat same one, that's why it looks weird,\n\n112\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.540\nI have the we're sorted\ndifferently because\n\n113\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.270\nI'm used to looking down\nlike where did it go?\n\n114\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.365\nSo let's go with the expert files and\nwe'll go with Knight2.\n\n115\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.020\nBoth documents we're going to\ncompare them and click OK.\n\n116\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.220\nAnd, wow, that's pretty cool.\n\n117\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.260\nLook at that!\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n118\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.800\n&gt;&gt; So it's, yeah, isn't that neat?\n\n119\n00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.670\nSo it says that,\nbecause remember the Knights2,\n\n120\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.880\nthat's the one that\nJustin Timberlake was the author on.\n\n121\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.500\nAnd that's why it says Justin Timberlake\nbecause it's changing saying what\n\n122\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.050\ndid Justin do compared to\nthe knights1 document.\n\n123\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.700\nThat's why you don't see two\nreviewers in here, okay.\n\n124\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.300\nThat's just how it works.\n\n125\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.970\nSo, now I can see that he\ndeleted down down down and\n\n126\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.330\nthen he did some formatting,\nhe moved things.\n\n127\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.310\nSo you have all the same things\nthat your track changes.\n\n128\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.450\nWe'll show you all combined in together.\n\n129\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.440\nI really like that you can see that\nthis one is bold and it is italics and\n\n130\n00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.170\nit is font color purple.\n\n131\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.980\nGreat.\nAnd then you would go through your\n\n132\n00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.160\naccepting or rejecting like we\ndid in our track changes episode.\n\n133\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.050\nSo these big separate functionalities, but\n\n134\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.790\nthey do work together in the same things\nand the ways that you would work with.\n\n135\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.460\nAll of what you see here,\nnow what do I do?\n\n136\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.290\nAccept, reject, change your\noptions of what you're seeing, and\n\n137\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.330\nmove along your merry way.\n\n138\n00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.460\nAnd maybe I'll just go ahead and\naccept all the changes and then I'm done.\n\n139\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.860\nWell if I accept all the changes then I\nshould just kept the knights2 document,\n\n140\n00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.690\nright Ronnie?\n\n141\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.260\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.520\n&gt;&gt; So I kinda just defeated my purpose,\n\n143\n00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.440\nbut you get the idea of\nwhat you can pick and\n\n144\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.610\nchoose.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea of comparison is\n\n145\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.320\nactually a really good way to\nactually take a look at this.\n\n146\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.730\nEspecially when you don't\nknow what's changed.\n\n147\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.163\nWhich is probably where I would\nhave that feature [INAUDIBLE].\n\n148\n00:07:01.163 --> 00:07:04.225\nUsed to working with some of the\ncollaborative features that we looked at\n\n149\n00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:04.928\nin track changes.\n\n150\n00:07:04.928 --> 00:07:07.588\nAnd they go, I don't know what\nthe differences between these two.\n\n151\n00:07:07.588 --> 00:07:09.480\nBeing able to actually compare them.\n\n152\n00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.530\nMight help us out and point out\nwhere those differences really are.\n\n153\n00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.150\nAnd it can help us to\nevaluate that better.\n\n154\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, evaluate, keeping some,\n\n155\n00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.590\nrejecting some,\ngreat ways to do it, awesome.\n\n156\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.670\nAnd so, that's the example of why and\n\n157\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.680\nhow you use the compare.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n158\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.090\n&gt;&gt; And it is a new file, so\n\n159\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.620\nthat way if it really got messed\nup I could just close it.\n\n160\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.160\nNot save the changes and\nI still have my original documents.\n\n161\n00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.260\nI'm not merging them into\neither one of them and\n\n162\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.658\nI like to keep those default options.\n\n163\n00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:46.730\nNow combining,\ncombining my best example to do this and\n\n164\n00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.500\nwhat most examples are for\nis the you have multiple\n\n165\n00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.590\nreviewers on a document and\nyou've turn the track changes on.\n\n166\n00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.110\nThey have all the changes that have\nbeen done but I sent it out to you and\n\n167\n00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.810\nI sent that to Daniel and\nI sent that to Wes and\n\n168\n00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.510\nI got each one of your files together so\nI have.\n\n169\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.630\nYours and Daniel's and Ronnie's.\n\n170\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.580\nYou are Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n171\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.300\nam.\n&gt;&gt; Wes.\n\n172\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.370\n[LAUGH] Are you Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n\n173\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Are you an impersonator?\n\n174\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.065\n&gt;&gt; Possibly.\n\n175\n00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:18.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I've gotten all of them,\n\n176\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.430\nbut there is three separate files.\n\n177\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.150\nAnd then I also have mine,\nthe original one.\n\n178\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.790\nSo goodness.\n\n179\n00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.540\nHey, I just wanna go ahead and\nbring them all together.\n\n180\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:35.150\nI want to combine all the things\nfrom your document into Daniel's and\n\n181\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:41.370\nif I need another set then I would take\nthe results of the combination of you and\n\n182\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.230\nDaniel's and then take that and\nmerge it or combine it with Wes.\n\n183\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.400\nSo if you have three,\n\n184\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.780\nyou're gonna need to do this step twice.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n185\n00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.000\n&gt;&gt; If you have four people,\n\n186\n00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.580\nthen you're gonna need to\ndo it three times, right.\n\n187\n00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.240\nSo it's basically kinda like keeping,\nmoving-\n\n188\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.460\n&gt;&gt; Combine the first two, and\n\n189\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.800\nthen adding the third.\n\n190\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.780\nAnd then adding again.\n\n191\n00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.370\nOr something like that, combining again.\n\n192\n00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:02.935\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n193\n00:09:02.935 --> 00:09:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n194\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.660\nSo that's just something to keep in\nmind if you have more than two people.\n\n195\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.280\nThat's the best way to do it,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n196\n00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.210\nlook at them, I will just I'll\nminimize this new document for now.\n\n197\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.030\nAnd we're doing queen of hearts,\nwe have Joey and Lance, and Sher.\n\n198\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.480\nThis is our first one right\neverything's just fine, and\n\n199\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.330\nthen we have our Lance Option.\n\n200\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.630\nSo everything that Lance went ahead and\ndid.\n\n201\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.440\nSo that's great.\n\n202\n00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.415\nJoey, there, Joey's changes I\nneed to combine them together,\n\n203\n00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:43.540\nbecause maybe the share had some\nother change that it was doing.\n\n204\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.910\nThere's nothing really in here.\n\n205\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.330\nSo I guess we don't, no we'd wanna go\nahead and combine it with this one.\n\n206\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.620\nOr pretend this is somebody else.\n\n207\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.160\nRight, we'll do all that.\n\n208\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.800\nWonderful.\n\n209\n00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.550\nSo I need to combine them.\n\n210\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.310\nLet's bring back up that new document.\n\n211\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.680\nAnd let's come over to our review.\n\n212\n00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.780\nLet's go over to compare.\n\n213\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.380\nAnd we will combine the documents.\n\n214\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.350\nWhat is my original document,\nyes I think I have an original document.\n\n215\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.450\nLet's go to the button, and\nwe will go over to our desktop.\n\n216\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.540\nWe will go to our files,\nwe will go to the share, and\n\n217\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.540\nI want to then combine it with\nthe let's go with what we\n\n218\n00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.360\nshould we pick first Lance or Joey?\n&gt;&gt; Lance?\n\n219\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go with Lance.\n\n220\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.060\nSo we will go to share Lance, right?\n\n221\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.150\nWonderful.\n\n222\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.140\nAnd then we click OK.\n\n223\n00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.720\nAnd here is my result, brand new document.\n\n224\n00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.520\nIt's a document three.\n\n225\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.200\nAnd I can see everything that's in here.\n\n226\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.070\nBut now I need to combine Joey's!\n\n227\n00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.830\nI forgot who went first.\n\n228\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.760\nI just asked you that, didn't I Ronnie?\n\n229\n00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.230\nGoodness.\n&gt;&gt; This is Justin and\n\n230\n00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.980\nLance's combined work so far.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n231\n00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.935\nThat's why I have him\naround to keep me on track.\n\n232\n00:10:55.935 --> 00:10:58.530\n[LAUGHTER] So I will combine this again.\n\n233\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.140\nNow this is where I have to think about,\n\n234\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.500\nthis is the result of\nthe first combination.\n\n235\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.320\nThis is the time where I would drop\nthis down and choose Document3.\n\n236\n00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.370\nSo watch your title bars, and\nknow which files you're working with.\n\n237\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.810\nSo I'll take Document3.\n\n238\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:21.410\nI will combine them in with Joey.\n\n239\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.510\nLet's come over to the desktop.\n\n240\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.840\nAnd files and there's Joey.\n\n241\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.370\nGo ahead and click OK and now it does.\n\n242\n00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.130\nThis is an interesting one, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n243\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.700\n&gt;&gt; Keep formatting changes from your\n\n244\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.130\ndocument or the other document.\n\n245\n00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:45.850\nThis is kind of important where it's only\ngonna keep one set of formatting options.\n\n246\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.880\nAll right, well if you think about it\nbecause somebody formatted the same thing.\n\n247\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.410\nThat could be a little weird.\n\n248\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.940\nChanging like text and\nfont, that's one thing.\n\n249\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.920\nBut you gotta be careful about this,\n\n250\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.480\nso when you're setting your\ndocuments out for review.\n\n251\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.860\nYou probably want to go ahead and\nsend one person to the content and\n\n252\n00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.760\ncontent only, and then another person\nto formatting and formatting only.\n\n253\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.620\nNow in a perfect world,\nis that going to happen?\n\n254\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.160\nMaybe not.\n\n255\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160\nBut just know you can only do one.\n\n256\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.660\nSo you got to pick which\nis the more important one.\n\n257\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.500\nI'll go with, you know what?\n\n258\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.560\nI'll go with document three.\n\n259\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.190\nThat sounds good.\n\n260\n00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.106\nWe'll click it and continue with\nthe merge and then there you go.\n\n261\n00:12:25.106 --> 00:12:27.970\nNow I can see that I've got Lance.\n\n262\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.900\nI've got Justin.\n\n263\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.220\nI've got Joey.\n\n264\n00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.850\nI have combined everybody together.\n\n265\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.120\nAll of my changes have been combined, and\n\n266\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.370\nthen I can go through and\naccept and reject them.\n\n267\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:46.480\nSo while it looks similar\nin the dialogue box,\n\n268\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.530\nthe reason why in the functionality\nof the compare and\n\n269\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.380\ncombine are a little bit different.\n\n270\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.950\nSo but, again it's just\nanother way of collaborating,\n\n271\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.020\nof maybe not have\neverything as streamlined.\n\n272\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.810\nBegin with and then it's kind of like your\nbackup, whoops forgot to turn the track\n\n273\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.610\nchanges on, that's fine just go ahead and\ncompare it.\n\n274\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.180\nI forgot to go ahead and give it to Joey,\nthen give it to Lance, and\n\n275\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.350\nthen give it back.\n\n276\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.240\nI forgot to pass the same file around and\nI've got multiples.\n\n277\n00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.740\nWell then I'll go ahead and\njust combine my change from there.\n\n278\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.610\nSo that is compare and compile.\n\n279\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.058\nYes those two options.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Compare and combine.\n\n280\n00:13:24.058 --> 00:13:24.947\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Compare\n\n281\n00:13:24.947 --> 00:13:25.504\nand.\n&gt;&gt; Combine\n\n282\n00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:26.172\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n283\n00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:27.155\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Alright,\n\n284\n00:13:27.155 --> 00:13:29.820\nVonne well thank you again for\nhelping us to understand\n\n285\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.430\nsome of these other unique features\nthat we also find inside or Word.\n\n286\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.150\nThe ability to compare multiple documents\nand being able to see that in a third\n\n287\n00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.720\ndocument really does help us to take\na look and analyze some of those changes\n\n288\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.360\nin a streamline format instead of\nhaving to use those track changes.\n\n289\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.810\nWhich can, I don't wanna say confuse, but\n\n290\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.160\nit can be a little bit\nover-daunting at times.\n\n291\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.820\nWhether you accept it or reject it, and\nthen you're not sure what you lost.\n\n292\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.440\nComparing them on putting them that way,\nmight be another way.\n\n293\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.275\nThe ability to combine these, I could see\nit not only working in situation that\n\n294\n00:13:59.275 --> 00:14:01.810\nVonne told us about, but\nwhat if I'm writing a document?\n\n295\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.180\nAnd I just start opening\nup multiple documents.\n\n296\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.800\nAnd go,\nall those would actually be good together.\n\n297\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.540\nInstead of me having to copy and paste\nfrom multiple ones, I can combine them all\n\n298\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.830\ntogether using the feature that\nVonne also told us about here too.\n\n299\n00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.210\nAnd it really does help us out in\nthose types of situations as well.\n\n300\n00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:23.120\nA great bunch of utilities for us to think\nabout, but there's even more to come for\n\n301\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.020\nof course the Word 2016 Expert Shell for\nMac.\n\n302\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.840\nBut that's gonna be for another day.\n\n303\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.780\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n304\n00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.690\n&gt;&gt;

Eh, dorks.\n\n33\n00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:55.223\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much.\n\n34\n00:01:55.223 --> 00:01:56.082\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much the case.\n\n35\n00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:56.616\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n36\n00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.834\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, are we going to get started?\n\n37\n00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:03.629\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now this is our local\ninstallation of Word 2016.\n\n38\n00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:05.718\nI mean this is what this\nseries is all about.\n\n39\n00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:11.701\nWe are not doing a whole show\nright now on the Office online and\n\n40\n00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:18.637\nit's funny because people are like\nare you doing the O65 word.\n\n41\n00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:19.811\nI'm like, wait, what?\n\n42\n00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:23.479\nI'm like, well, yeah, no, the O one.\n\n43\n00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.640\nI'm like?\n\n44\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.960\nBut the online version of\nthis particular application.\n\n45\n00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.964\nJust like all of them are available to\nyou when you have an Office 365 account.\n\n46\n00:02:33.964 --> 00:02:37.901\nSo if you don't have one of those,\nthis is gonna probably not even work for\n\n47\n00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:38.860\nyou, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.970\nSo I could go ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.140\nnot have a locally installed version\nof Word and use that as my editor.\n\n50\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.520\nI'd use my OneDrive, right,\nas my storage system, and\n\n51\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.840\nI don't have anything located\non my computer itself.\n\n52\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.259\n&gt;&gt; That's great and we are going to\ndip into that world right now, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:00.860\nBut in correlation, and\nhow we use it on our locally\n\n54\n00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.104\ninstalled application within\nour Mac operating system.\n\n55\n00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:09.366\nSo just kind of giving you a little\nbit of clarification on that.\n\n56\n00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:12.849\nSo if I did need to talk to Ronnie and\nsay hey, I got these document and\n\n57\n00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.926\nwe need to work on it together,\nwe need to co-author this.\n\n58\n00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:19.666\nI need you to proof it and\nlet's talk in real time,\n\n59\n00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.440\nthat's something that you can do.\n\n60\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.190\nSo we're gonna show both sides,\n\n61\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.620\nwe're gonna show me sharing\na document with Ronnie.\n\n62\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.420\nAnd then us collaborating while I'm\nusing Word here on my computer.\n\n63\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.480\nWhy don't we get started?\n\n64\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.740\nI have a folder on my\ndesktop with all my files.\n\n65\n00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.400\nWell if you're gonna share online,\n\n66\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.090\nyou can't have this file store online,\nthat's the biggest thing.\n\n67\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.455\nThe cool thing is that\nwhen you get into Word,\n\n68\n00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:50.150\nit's gonna prompt you\nto do all this anyways.\n\n69\n00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.200\nSo let's go ahead and clarify really\nquickly what is OneDrive, Ronnie?\n\n70\n00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.361\nI'm gonna throw it to you.\n\n71\n00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.023\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n72\n00:03:57.023 --> 00:04:00.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; OneDrive is a cloud storage arrangement\n\n73\n00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:01.585\nthat you have.\n\n74\n00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:04.554\nYou only have to pay for it, you don't\nhave to worry about hard drives or\n\n75\n00:04:04.554 --> 00:04:05.610\nanything else.\n\n76\n00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.460\nBut it allows you to\npay a subscription and\n\n77\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.310\nthen you treat that\nparticular subscription\n\n78\n00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.870\nwith whatever amount of storage that\nyou bought as another hard drive.\n\n79\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.280\nAnd it shows up on your computer\nwhere you can now sync files to it.\n\n80\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.949\nAnd it does, it just essentially shows up\nas another hard drive for you and you're\n\n81\n00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.527\nusing that particular storage, instead\nof what's locally on your computer.\n\n82\n00:04:25.527 --> 00:04:28.246\nBut it's a combination,\nyou're still using storage on\n\n83\n00:04:28.246 --> 00:04:31.830\nyour computer because you're syncing\nit up, so there's a copy locally.\n\n84\n00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.030\nAnd then whatever changes you make\nthere gets also changed up into where\n\n85\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.570\nit's going to ultimately end up being,\nwhich is in the cloud.\n\n86\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.380\n&gt;&gt; And this is synonymous with Dropbox.\n\n87\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.547\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Google Drive.\n\n88\n00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:46.783\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is just the Microsoft\nflavor of a cloud storage file system.\n\n89\n00:04:46.783 --> 00:04:47.375\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n90\n00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:51.920\nOkay, and part of,\nnow you said you pay as subscription.\n\n91\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.770\nYou could do this singularly of paying\nto have a paid version of OneDrive.\n\n92\n00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.270\nBut as part of an Office 365 subscriber\nyou have that for free, correct?\n\n93\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's part of the subscription, so\n\n94\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.790\nyou generally end up with about one\nterabyte of storage on your own, yeah.\n\n95\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.881\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know it was that much.\n\n96\n00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:13.548\n[LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:17.490\n&gt;&gt; To do that at least in our accounts,\nthat's what we end up with.\n\n98\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.410\nIn our business account, we end up\nwith about one terabyte of storage.\n\n99\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.210\nAnd depending on your licenses, it can\nbe five terabytes per person as well.\n\n100\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.286\n&gt;&gt; This is per person?\n\n101\n00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:26.625\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; This isn't like-\n\n102\n00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:27.330\n&gt;&gt; Per person.\n\n103\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.910\n&gt;&gt; Per organization?\n\n104\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.761\n&gt;&gt; Nope, per person.\n\n105\n00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.940\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Really.\n\n106\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.812\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, that's [LAUGH] I\nreally did not know the stack.\n\n107\n00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:34.771\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy, but\n\n108\n00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:39.483\nyou did say that could possibly\nchange depending on if you have\n\n109\n00:05:39.483 --> 00:05:43.660\nan enterprise version, or\na personal subscription.\n\n110\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.820\nSo that level of subscription in buying an\nOffice 365 does come into play, correct?\n\n111\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.491\n&gt;&gt; It does, and\n\n112\n00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:54.457\nyou'll just have to look if you\npurchased your Office 365 subscription.\n\n113\n00:05:54.457 --> 00:05:56.462\nYou just make sure you go down and\n\n114\n00:05:56.462 --> 00:05:59.770\nyou find the little icon\nthat represents OneDrive.\n\n115\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.600\nAnd if it's there,\nthat's normally what you'll do.\n\n116\n00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.952\nThe default is one terabyte.\n\n117\n00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:04.957\nIf your organization has five or\n\n118\n00:06:04.957 --> 00:06:09.360\nmore accounts they'll bump that up\nto five terabytes with a request.\n\n119\n00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.038\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n120\n00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:14.346\n&gt;&gt; Now it's funny, I almost started to go\ninto, but now let's clarify that you have\n\n121\n00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:18.107\nOneDrive on your operating system and\nOneDrive on your subscription.\n\n122\n00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:20.166\nAnd then I realized we're in Mac.\n\n123\n00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:20.688\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n124\n00:06:20.688 --> 00:06:23.324\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That doesn't come\nwith the operating system.\n\n125\n00:06:23.324 --> 00:06:26.574\nIn PC world,\nin a Windows operating system.\n\n126\n00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:27.493\n&gt;&gt; It's built in.\n\n127\n00:06:27.493 --> 00:06:32.531\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's built into the operating\nsystem which may get so confusing.\n\n128\n00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:33.054\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:33.054 --> 00:06:37.048\n&gt;&gt; So you have OneDrive with\nyour computer with the OS.\n\n130\n00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:43.224\nThen you have OneDrive with your\nOffice 365 or O365 subscription.\n\n131\n00:06:43.224 --> 00:06:46.671\nBut they are not the same,\nthey're like two different places, but\n\n132\n00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:48.615\nthey're the same concept.\n\n133\n00:06:48.615 --> 00:06:50.514\nIt can get a little wonky.\n\n134\n00:06:50.514 --> 00:06:54.115\nI mean Microsoft is so notorious for\n[LAUGH] naming things the same, but\n\n135\n00:06:54.115 --> 00:06:57.269\nit's like, they are not the same, so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the difference\n\n136\n00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:59.860\nbetween OneDrive and OneDrive for\nBusiness is what you also end up seeing.\n\n137\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.999\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.\n\n138\n00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:03.034\nThat OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, and\n\n139\n00:07:03.034 --> 00:07:06.095\nOneDrive for Business is part\nof your Office 365 subscription.\n\n140\n00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:06.734\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n141\n00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:08.492\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n142\n00:07:08.492 --> 00:07:11.446\nNow we have got some\nbaseline of that knowledge,\n\n143\n00:07:11.446 --> 00:07:15.092\nwhen we're talking about\ncollaborating online.\n\n144\n00:07:15.092 --> 00:07:16.712\nPerfect, wonderful.\n\n145\n00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:22.270\nI'm going to open up a file, on my local\ncomputer, that is called share online.\n\n146\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.340\nNow, I have a share online copy,\njust in case we start messing,\n\n147\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.520\nbecause we are gonna be\nmessing this document up.\n\n148\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.010\nSo I am gonna open this one up.\n\n149\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.760\nRegular file, I wanna share it with you,\nI wanna email it to you.\n\n150\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.130\nI wanna do all that stuff.\n\n151\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.750\nThat's actually all built within Word.\n\n152\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.897\nI don't have to go to Outlook,\nsend it to you.\n\n153\n00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:46.170\nAnd even more than that, I need to\nmake sure that when I send it to you,\n\n154\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.849\nI'm sending you the one that's up in\nthat OneDrive for Business account.\n\n155\n00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:54.619\nSo I'm going to put it up\ninto my personal OneDrive,\n\n156\n00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:57.460\nwell not personal, business, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.073\nMy.\n\n158\n00:07:59.073 --> 00:07:59.695\n&gt;&gt;

It does work.\n\n557\n00:28:18.581 --> 00:28:23.015\nOf course, it would work better if both\nwere actually connected to the wire itself\n\n558\n00:28:23.015 --> 00:28:25.664\nand you'd probably see\nmore live time that way.\n\n559\n00:28:25.664 --> 00:28:29.378\nYou may get a little bit of delay if there\nis some congestion on the network and\n\n560\n00:28:29.378 --> 00:28:30.955\nacross the internet, as well.\n\n561\n00:28:30.955 --> 00:28:31.645\nBut overall,\n\n562\n00:28:31.645 --> 00:28:35.274\nthough, you can see the benefit of this\nif you are having to deal with that.\n\n563\n00:28:35.274 --> 00:28:40.227\nAnd the ability to share and\nthen unshare it gives you a lot power, and\n\n564\n00:28:40.227 --> 00:28:44.083\nthe access to files that you\nmay not have all the time.\n\n565\n00:28:44.083 --> 00:28:47.521\nSo it is a feature that you\nwant to take advantage of.\n\n566\n00:28:47.521 --> 00:28:50.316\nThe only limitation that we've seen so\nfar, and\n\n567\n00:28:50.316 --> 00:28:54.012\nthe word from Mac is it may not\nactually come in on the local copy.\n\n568\n00:28:54.012 --> 00:28:55.281\nBut doesn't mean you can't do it.\n\n569\n00:28:55.281 --> 00:28:59.050\nJust stay with the Word online, and\nyou'll probably be off and ready to go.\n\n570\n00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.962\nWell, there's still a few more\nepisodes to go for the Word for\n\n571\n00:29:02.962 --> 00:29:07.412\nMac 2016 Expert show here, but\nthat will be for another episode.\n\n572\n00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:11.317\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n573\n00:29:11.317 --> 00:29:12.258\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.540\nYou're watching the Word\n2016 Expert show for Mac.\n\n4\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.900\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.480\nAnd today, we're gonna be taking\na look at documents security.\n\n6\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.438\nAnd here of course to help us is gonna be\nour security queen OfficePRO.TV herself\n\n7\n00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:29.293\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:32.445\nVonne, welcome to our show.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, thank you for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.780\n[LAUGH] Security queen, hm.\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n10\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.340\n&gt;&gt; Well actually,\n\n11\n00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.380\nI always like to pair up\nwith the likes of you,\n\n12\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.760\nRonnie, or Daniel when we're\ntalking about document security.\n\n13\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.670\nBecause you guys are actually\nthe real security experts, so.\n\n14\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd like to claim that but\n\n15\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.940\nthat's probably more\nDaniel's area than mine.\n\n16\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.390\nI know a little bit about it,\nso here we go.\n\n17\n00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.160\nWe're talking about the idea of\ndocument security a little bit\n\n18\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.060\nin dealing with the files themselves.\n\n19\n00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.230\nNow, I know more about\nthe idea of network security,\n\n20\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.080\nbut Vonne there are a few different\nfeatures that we've seen over and\n\n21\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.650\nover again in the Microsoft world but\nwe're specifically focusing on the Mac\n\n22\n00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.470\ndocument security right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\n\n23\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.170\nI'm glad you point that out\nbecause this is an area or\n\n24\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.440\ntopic that in the sorry, Word for Mac,\n\n25\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.280\nit's much different than the document\nsecurity when you're working on a PC,\n\n26\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.820\nso that's something that we're gonna\nfocus on, and yes this is a Mac series.\n\n27\n00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.160\nBut we are going to talk\nabout some of the PC only\n\n28\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160\nsecurity things, I guess for lack of\na better term, that word can do for\n\n29\n00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.670\nyou and that they are not\npresent in your Mac environment.\n\n30\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.540\nSo especially if you go back and\nforth between systems, or\n\n31\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.180\nmaybe you've been on a PC for a long time.\n\n32\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.050\nAnd now you're switching over to Mac,\n\n33\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.940\nyou will find some significant\ndifferences in this particular area.\n\n34\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.190\nSo we're gonna highlight those and\ngo through them.\n\n35\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.880\nLike in the Word series,\nRonnie, I had three parts.\n\n36\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.240\nAnd for me to do a part three on anything,\n\n37\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.810\nthat's like that's\na pretty extensive topic.\n\n38\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.730\nSo, we're only gonna have one\nin this particular series,\n\n39\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.590\nbecause not as much to talk about,\nso why don't we get started.\n\n40\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.780\nNow I have pulled up the episode\nnotes that I have in my Haroopad,\n\n41\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.260\nmy markdown editor.\n\n42\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.470\nThe file format we use for\n\n43\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.085\nour notes, you've probably heard me says\na couple of time because I have some links\n\n44\n00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:31.830\nin here that we're gonna be using as\nreferences as we go through everything.\n\n45\n00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.860\nSo Mac supported security features and\nyou see that it goes down to here and\n\n46\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.770\nthen it just goes into\nthe PC only once and\n\n47\n00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.680\nit gives you other options and\nlinks to those particular areas.\n\n48\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.890\nSo you'll at least know\na little bit more about it.\n\n49\n00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.110\nSo let's also open up Word and a file\nthat we're going to be working with,\n\n50\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.010\nlet's get to document security,\nnothing too fancy in here,\n\n51\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.160\nI think there's a bunny in here so\nimagine that.\n\n52\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.778\nAnd no no this is not,\nthis isn't the file that I wanted to use.\n\n53\n00:03:07.778 --> 00:03:12.760\n[LAUGH] It is well, I don't know\nwhere it is, but you know what?\n\n54\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.450\nIt doesn't matter because\nI thought I had a bunny.\n\n55\n00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.100\nThat's all right.\n\n56\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.990\nIt doesn't really matter what\nfile we're working with,\n\n57\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.920\nbecause we're going to be just\ntalking about security of it.\n\n58\n00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.390\nIt's just one of those things\nlike you were used to looking at,\n\n59\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.430\nlike a certain way, and\nthen you're like this is all wrong.\n\n60\n00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.920\nIt's fine, this example.\n\n61\n00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.240\nWe're gonna go over to the review tab\nfirst of all because that's where\n\n62\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.280\nyou have some buttons over here of\nwhere you're going to be going for\n\n63\n00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.830\nyour document security.\n\n64\n00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.350\nNow, we talked a little bit about\nthis when we did the draft changes.\n\n65\n00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.430\nWhere if you wanted to lock down those\ndraft changes for other people that you\n\n66\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.810\ndon't want them to turn it off,\nthat is a place for you to go.\n\n67\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.510\nAnd that's really the only\nplace that you go to\n\n68\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.310\napply documents security\nin a Mac environment.\n\n69\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.310\nIn PC, there is like the bus stage\nview and there is the file menu and\n\n70\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.390\nthere is all these protect documents.\n\n71\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.590\nBut that's the place for\nyou I think it's in the tools maybe.\n\n72\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.730\nYeah, there we go, Protect Document.\n\n73\n00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.300\nBut that's really all we had.\n\n74\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.810\nAnd notice there's a couple other things\nin here, there's like Block Authors and\n\n75\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.680\nthere is a button right here.\n\n76\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.360\nAnd we'll get to like why that's\ngrayed out in just a second.\n\n77\n00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.440\nSo this is where you're going to be\ngoing to add things like a password\n\n78\n00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.260\nto open and modify a document,\nor to lock down specific things.\n\n79\n00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.780\nAnd so we're gonna get there and\nI'll show you the dialogue box and\n\n80\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.450\ngive you examples.\n\n81\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.530\nWe'll be saving and closing this file\na couple of times to demonstrate it.\n\n82\n00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.360\nBut I should start of with a little,\nI think this one's kind of weird, Ronnie.\n\n83\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.920\nI will be completely honest,\nof hiding text.\n\n84\n00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n85\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.433\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can do that.\n\n86\n00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:53.000\nYou can hide text.\n\n87\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.090\nWhy?\nYou don't want somebody to see it,\n\n88\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.630\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n89\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's like a pretty\n\n90\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.710\nlogical explanation for it, but\nthe thing with the hidden text is that\n\n91\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.320\nif you have the show hide characters\non it, you can still see it.\n\n92\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.240\nJust like when we have\nright now the show hide,\n\n93\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.970\nI can see there's a paragraph, or\nif I had hit tab key a couple of times,\n\n94\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.990\nthat's what they're\nsupposed to be there for.\n\n95\n00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.840\nSo, let's just turn them off for a second.\n\n96\n00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.280\nHow do you hide text?\n\n97\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.210\nYou select it and\nthen you right-click on it or\n\n98\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.693\nyou can go to the I believe the format\nmenu and you go to font dot, dot, dot.\n\n99\n00:05:28.693 --> 00:05:31.300\nOkay, when you go to\nthe font dialogue box.\n\n100\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.430\nYou're going to have different options\nof how you can format your text.\n\n101\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.970\nAnd one of them is the effects\nof being hidden, right?\n\n102\n00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.440\nIf you hide this text, click okay.\n\n103\n00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.110\nIt does exactly that, doesn't it Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n104\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.070\ndoes.\n&gt;&gt; It's gone.\n\n105\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.820\nOkay, because maybe there's sensitive\ninformation in the document\n\n106\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.190\nthat you don't want certain people to see.\n\n107\n00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.980\nSo you hide it.\n\n108\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.590\nBut then if they know this\nthey can see it anyways, okay.\n\n109\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.560\nSo if you really want to take out\nsensitive information in your document,\n\n110\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.985\njust go ahead and delete it, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.990\n[LAUGH] Make a copy, go ahead and\ndelete it, and there you go.\n\n112\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.960\nBut it is a feature that you can do,\ncan you think of any other reason why you\n\n113\n00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.070\nwanna hide text Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Not in a document cuz usually\n\n114\n00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.770\nthe reason why you're hiding it of course\nis to make sure they don't see it.\n\n115\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.850\nAnd if they don't see it,\n\n116\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.770\nit doesn't need to be in there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n117\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.570\n&gt;&gt; So I don't really know\n\n118\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.490\na reason unless this is\njust something temporary.\n\n119\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.900\nI just thought of one perhaps.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n120\n00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.160\n&gt;&gt; Like you are showing this like this and\n\n121\n00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.260\nnow you want to say, who has the answer?\n\n122\n00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.053\nAnd then you can select it and\n\n123\n00:06:29.053 --> 00:06:31.040\nunhide the answer.\n&gt;&gt; Cute.\n\n124\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.370\nA little game.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n125\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.710\na game.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n126\n00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.880\nI like that.\n&gt;&gt; Defy our\n\n127\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.220\nlearning.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n128\n00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.760\n[LAUGH] You know that's a decent example,\n\n129\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.070\nyou're creative!\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n130\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.630\nit does happen every once in a while,\n\n131\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.830\nsomething comes out of the old brain here.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n132\n00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.780\nyeah, that's why I feel like\nthis was kind of a weird one.\n\n133\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.240\nYou know of, okay just delete it\nif you really want to hide it.\n\n134\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.360\nBut figured I'd throw that in there and\nlet you know that that is an option, and\n\n135\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.990\nnotice that with this.\n\n136\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.210\nWhen I have the shown hide characters\nit has little dots beneath it.\n\n137\n00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.150\nSo that's just your indication of\nwhat this is, this is hidden text.\n\n138\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.850\nAnd your show hide and\nall that kind of fun stuff, so lovely.\n\n139\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.020\nWe know that, and this is something\nwhere if you did have hidden text,\n\n140\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.380\nyou could always hit like a Ctrl+A or,\nsorry, Cmnd + A to select all.\n\n141\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.960\nAnd then go into font and\nthen just make sure that,\n\n142\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.060\nsee how it has like a dash through it,\nif you see that, that means\n\n143\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.040\nthat it's all selected so it's not all\nhidden but there's some parts that are.\n\n144\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.590\nSo you could just go ahead and\ncheck it and\n\n145\n00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.300\nthen check it again to then make sure,\nhey, I\"m gonna find you.\n\n146\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.037\nIt's like a little hide and\nseek so you can't fool me.\n\n147\n00:07:38.037 --> 00:07:38.993\nI found your text.\n\n148\n00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:40.181\nThere you go.\n\n149\n00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:44.790\nPerfect, okay and that's why I went ahead\nand threw this in Document Security.\n\n150\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.910\nBecause where else would we put it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n151\n00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not really sure.\n\n152\n00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.460\nLet's go ahead and zoom out a little bit.\n\n153\n00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.576\nNow that whole I want to\nlock his document down.\n\n154\n00:07:55.576 --> 00:08:00.615\nI only want certain people to\nbe able to open the document.\n\n155\n00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:03.396\nAnd, I will give them that password.\n\n156\n00:08:03.396 --> 00:08:05.660\nOr if you don't have the password\nto open it, then guess what?\n\n157\n00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.810\nYou ain't getting in.\n\n158\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.410\nAll right, that's wonderful.\n\n159\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:13.080\nSo then, I could also put on\na password for allowing modifications.\n\n160\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.380\nOkay, so you could open it but you can't\nmodify it unless you have a password.\n\n161\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.750\nAnd then I can also hide\nspecific things or not hide.\n\n162\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.900\nI'm sorry.\n\n163\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.030\nLock down, or\nprotect certain areas like that track\n\n164\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:27.730\nchanges.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n165\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.380\n&gt;&gt; We didn't put any password to open or\n\n166\n00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.880\nmodify in that episode.\n\n167\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.800\nWe just went ahead and\n\n168\n00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.810\nchose that option of don't let\npeople turn off track changes.\n\n169\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:39.810\nSo you do have that level of\nrestricting access to a document.\n\n170\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.530\nBut that's all you have in\nlike the restrict access.\n\n171\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.530\nThis is that kind of\ncomparison over to the PC.\n\n172\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.220\nCuz remember in the PC you could like,\n\n173\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.650\nrestrict certain styles.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.720\n&gt;&gt; That you could use.\n\n175\n00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.800\nAnd so there's a little bit,\nit's a little bit more extensive as to\n\n176\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.420\nrestricting certain areas or\nparts of your document.\n\n177\n00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.370\nMac only has a couple of them.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n178\n00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.730\nWhy don't we look at that?\n\n179\n00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.460\nLet's go into review and\nwe'll go to protect document because this\n\n180\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.624\nAlice in Wonderland document is very,\nvery sensitive, right?\n\n181\n00:09:08.624 --> 00:09:09.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n182\n00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.240\n&gt;&gt; So set a password to open\n\n183\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.250\nthis document.\n\n184\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.590\nPerfect.\nLet's go with,\n\n185\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.630\nI always use the same one in my examples.\n\n186\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.690\nIt's always apple.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n187\n00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:18.440\n&gt;&gt; That's the first one,\n\n188\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.800\nand then I could set a password\nto modify and that is, sorry.\n\n189\n00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.790\nBefore we move on\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.420\n&gt;&gt; It's going to say hey,\n\n191\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.270\nmake sure you re-enter, we get this all\nthe time, to use the password twice and\n\n192\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.500\nthen you never get them the same way and\nyou can't remember what.\n\n193\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.170\nThe struggle is real Ronnie.\n\n194\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.010\nSo we click OK and now apple is\ngonna be the password to open, and\n\n195\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.464\nI could stop there\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n196\n00:09:40.464 --> 00:09:42.110\n&gt;&gt; I don't have to do both.\n\n197\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.510\nI'm doing both in the same example,\njust so you can see, so you pick and\n\n198\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:51.351\nchoose which password or\nlevel of password ability.\n\n199\n00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:54.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Password protection\n\n200\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.330\n&gt;&gt; Password ability.\n\n202\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.533\nThat's a scrabble [LAUGH].\n\n203\n00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:02.175\nWord Ability.\n\n204\n00:10:02.175 --> 00:10:06.790\nNow that's a real word.\n&gt;&gt; I know that's, now I make muff so much,\n\n205\n00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.350\nI am like, is that real or not [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:15.100\nAll right we have got this notice it\nhas only read only recommendation,\n\n207\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.040\nthat means that it is going to\nrecommend the read only part.\n\n208\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.130\nAnd let's go with orange.\n\n209\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.070\nI think I typed that wrong.\n\n210\n00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.870\nOrange.\nI think it's okay.\n\n211\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.374\nPerfect.\n\n212\n00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:25.760\nAnd so I have this.\n\n213\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.600\nThis was the part where you do not\nhave to set these first to set\n\n214\n00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.660\nthis particular protection up.\n\n215\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.730\nOnly do the track changes.\n\n216\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.990\nNow the thing that I wanted to point\nout is that it's a radio button.\n\n217\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.050\nWith radio buttons this\nmeans that it's one or\n\n218\n00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.780\nthe other.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n219\n00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.740\n&gt;&gt; You can't have\n\n220\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.210\nall of them.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n221\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.380\nyou either protect the track changes\nbeing locked that you could have it,\n\n222\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.780\nand we'll come back to another example\nof why you'd wanna do like the comments.\n\n223\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.470\nSo I'll keep that for the next example.\n\n224\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.170\nThe read only,\nlike I want this to be read only.\n\n225\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.140\nSo I could say don't put a password to\nopen, don't put a password to modify.\n\n226\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.635\nBut don't let them change the document.\n\n227\n00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:06.690\n[LAUGH] And\nalso kinda don't tell them in a sense.\n\n228\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.310\nThat's the read only one, it's kinda neat.\n\n229\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.410\nAnd if you are creating forms,\n\n230\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.850\nyou can set it to where all they\ncan do is fill out the form fields.\n\n231\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.780\nThey can't modify the form fields.\n\n232\n00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.680\nThey can't change the drop down\nto a text box or delete anything.\n\n233\n00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.390\nSo that's one of those\nthat you could do and\n\n234\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.640\nyou could put a password on all of this.\n\n235\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.170\nWhy would you wanna put\na password is that, if somebody\n\n236\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.500\nhas if you just didn't put a password they\ncan come into the protect document and\n\n237\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.670\nturn this thing off.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n238\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.810\n&gt;&gt; So you probably wanna go ahead and\n\n239\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.650\nlock these particular.\n\n240\n00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.407\nI'm pointing at my screen.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n241\n00:11:36.407 --> 00:11:38.821\n&gt;&gt; These particular restrictions to your\n\n242\n00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:40.214\ndocument and go that.\n\n243\n00:11:40.214 --> 00:11:43.600\nAnd we'll talk about what this means,\nthe remove personal information.\n\n244\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.670\nBut that takes into account\ndocument properties, and\n\n245\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.630\nwe have a separate episode for that one.\n&gt;&gt; Nice\n\n246\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.430\n&gt;&gt; So let's click OK.\n\n247\n00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.570\nYay, all right.\n\n248\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.400\nSo what happens?\n\n249\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.465\nYou need to save this file.\n\n250\n00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.648\nSo I'm gonna do a file save or\nCommand S for save.\n\n251\n00:11:58.648 --> 00:12:01.210\nI'm gonna do a Command W for\nclosing the file.\n\n252\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.550\nSo let's test this.\n\n253\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.650\nLet's see how it works.\n\n254\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.680\nOpen up document security,\n\n255\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.960\nwell hey guess what you need\na password to open this file.\n\n256\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.570\nWell what if I don't have one?\n\n257\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.370\nWhat if, oops I don't, you click cancel.\n\n258\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:12.870\nThat's it.\n\n259\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.410\nWell then guess what?\n\n260\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.380\nYou're not getting in.\n\n261\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.340\nSo there's no other warnings.\n\n262\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.340\nIt's just you gotta have the key.\n\n263\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.270\nSo let's try it again, and this is apple.\n\n264\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.540\nAwesome.\nWell now it says that this is reserved by,\n\n265\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.620\nthis also correlates into the document\nproperties that Lance Bass and\n\n266\n00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.590\nJT are the people who I believe\nare authors on this particular document.\n\n267\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.672\nSo I need to modify it, or\nI can open it up as read only.\n\n268\n00:12:40.672 --> 00:12:41.565\nSo that's the one thing.\n\n269\n00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:48.170\nIts like, alright I am saying that,\nagain, maybe no password to open.\n\n270\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.740\nYou can only have a read only,\n\n271\n00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.720\nand the read only it's not like\nyou can do a file save as and\n\n272\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.820\nget it to like an editable copy.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n273\n00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.640\n&gt;&gt; It is locked and you can't modify.\n\n274\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.320\nSo let's try that.\n\n275\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.450\nLet's go with read only.\n\n276\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.920\nAnd notice that okay, through,\nno, say, this is another one.\n\n277\n00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.830\nWell I could duplicate it, right.\n\n278\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.372\nOnce I duplicate it I can-.\n\n279\n00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:09.786\nThat doesn't work either.\n\n280\n00:13:09.786 --> 00:13:10.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n281\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.740\nYou can't even select the text.\n\n282\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.360\nNotice all of your ribbons are grayed out.\n\n283\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.590\nIt is not available for you to do.\n\n284\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:25.010\nBut that's where if you said like,\nyou could still allow them to comment,\n\n285\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.830\nthat's when it might be kind of neat.\n\n286\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.062\nAgain another example,\n\n287\n00:13:29.062 --> 00:13:31.945\nI said that particular way you\nmight wanna lock that down.\n\n288\n00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:36.451\nSo there's your read-only,\nit's true read only.\n\n289\n00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:37.616\nLet's go back and do it again.\n\n290\n00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:38.308\nI just closed it.\n\n291\n00:13:38.308 --> 00:13:39.771\nI'm opening it back up.\n\n292\n00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:40.494\nApple.\n\n293\n00:13:40.494 --> 00:13:41.560\nOrange.\n\n294\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.450\nGreat.\n\n295\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.500\nSo now it's like, but\nstill why it's still locked?\n\n296\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.110\nRemember you got the password.\n\n297\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:56.090\nSo you got in, you come off and\nyou would take off the protection, okay?\n\n298\n00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.530\nCuz that's where, that's why the whole\ngetting that password to modify,\n\n299\n00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.790\nit's like, sorry let's go ahead on orange.\n\n300\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.507\nYup, I.\n\n301\n00:14:04.507 --> 00:14:05.215\nUh-oh.\n\n302\n00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:05.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n303\n00:14:05.765 --> 00:14:08.792\nThis is orange.\n\n304\n00:14:08.792 --> 00:14:12.255\nUh-oh.\n\n305\n00:14:12.255 --> 00:14:13.776\nApple?\n\n306\n00:14:13.776 --> 00:14:14.512\nNo?\n\n307\n00:14:14.512 --> 00:14:15.313\nOrange?\n\n308\n00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:20.020\nUh-oh, this is a- [LAUGH].\n\n309\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.615\nDid I really do this?\n\n310\n00:14:21.615 --> 00:14:25.691\n[LAUGH]\nThat's not good.\n\n311\n00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:27.399\nWait, I know what I'm doing.\n\n312\n00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:29.135\nYou just gotta delete it.\n\n313\n00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:31.800\n[LAUGH] Sorry, I got myself really scared.\n\n314\n00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.680\nAnd this is something that\nyou should be scared of too.\n\n315\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.330\nIt's like do not lose your passwords.\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n316\n00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.990\n&gt;&gt; You know what it was?\n\n317\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.100\nI was in that field and\nI was trying to click off of it.\n\n318\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.230\nAnd just like you saw when I\nwas putting the passwords in.\n\n319\n00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.120\nIt's like for you to move on,\nyou have to reenter the password.\n\n320\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.405\nAnd that's where I got\nmyself a little little.\n\n321\n00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:53.906\nWhew, okay I can stop freaking out for\na little bit.\n\n322\n00:14:53.906 --> 00:14:54.415\nJust delete it.\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n323\n00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:55.905\n&gt;&gt; That's the easiest way to get your\n\n324\n00:14:55.905 --> 00:15:00.130\npasswords off of a document\nonce you have the permissions.\n\n325\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.110\nJust delete.\n\n326\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.092\nI will turn this one off and\ni will turn that off too.\n\n327\n00:15:03.092 --> 00:15:06.745\nSo everything is like opened up,\neverything is fine again.\n\n328\n00:15:06.745 --> 00:15:09.520\n[LAUGH] Wow, all right.\n\n329\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:16.380\nSo, [LAUGH] this is one where with\nthe protecting the document with comments.\n\n330\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.089\nLike you can go ahead and\nallow them to comment on\n\n331\n00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:24.740\nthe document even though it's\ngonna be a read-only file.\n\n332\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.327\nBecause that's something where maybe\nI want you to proof my document or\n\n333\n00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:29.535\ngive me some feedback.\n\n334\n00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:31.329\nBut I don't want you\nchanging any of my text.\n\n335\n00:15:31.329 --> 00:15:36.490\nSo the only thing you can do is add\na little comments in the document.\n\n336\n00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:41.060\nSo that's like another level of\ncollaborating with somebody, but\n\n337\n00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.370\nyou don't have the ability\nto change any of my text.\n\n338\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.203\nSo that's kind of nice.\n\n339\n00:15:44.203 --> 00:15:48.760\nSo if I go ahead and like,\nlet's go back and do orange for my modify.\n\n340\n00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.445\nThere's that field again.\n\n341\n00:15:51.445 --> 00:15:53.810\n[LAUGH] That got me in a loop last time.\n\n342\n00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.082\nSo now I have orange.\n\n343\n00:15:56.082 --> 00:15:58.171\nWe'll put apple down here.\n\n344\n00:15:58.171 --> 00:16:01.323\nSo remember Ronnie, modify orange.\n\n345\n00:16:01.323 --> 00:16:02.349\nTrack changes that one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n346\n00:16:02.349 --> 00:16:03.387\nI'm gonna remember that.\n\n347\n00:16:03.387 --> 00:16:04.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:08.000\n&gt;&gt; This is Apple, all right.\n\n349\n00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.660\nI'm mixing fruit Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; Yes you are.\n\n350\n00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.821\n&gt;&gt; It's getting scary.\n\n351\n00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:14.871\nSo if I save this and close this,\nnow I open it back up,\n\n352\n00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:21.380\nI don't have the password to modify, but\nwith the Read Only I can come into here.\n\n353\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.574\nAnd if I select the text,\nI can come in to the review.\n\n354\n00:16:25.574 --> 00:16:27.035\nIt didn't let me.\n\n355\n00:16:27.035 --> 00:16:28.194\nWell now it just backfired.\n\n356\n00:16:28.194 --> 00:16:32.503\n[LAUGH] Not what I had, and I was\nsupposed to be able to comment on it.\n\n357\n00:16:32.503 --> 00:16:36.112\nBut let's try this, let's go document 2.\n\n358\n00:16:36.112 --> 00:16:37.090\nThere, okay.\n\n359\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.150\nAll right, I forgot about that step.\n\n360\n00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:45.840\nSo once I have password modified, somebody\ndoesn't have it, they get a Read Only.\n\n361\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.522\nThey do have a duplicate to their like\nlocal if you want to say like they\n\n362\n00:16:50.522 --> 00:16:52.476\nhave to save the duplicate.\n\n363\n00:16:52.476 --> 00:16:56.487\nSo you might want to have this in\nyour log in to tell your people.\n\n364\n00:16:56.487 --> 00:17:00.774\nHey, open up the Read Only when you\nget the password prompt, go ahead and\n\n365\n00:17:00.774 --> 00:17:01.870\nduplicate it.\n\n366\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:07.660\nAnd now notice that in my review I do\nhave the option of selecting the text and\n\n367\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.380\nmaking a comment.\n\n368\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.632\nAnd I can say move sentence, or whatever.\n\n369\n00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:18.705\nThat's there, so notice I cannot go,\nI can't delete any text,\n\n370\n00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:24.333\nI can't type any text, I can't do any\nmodifications to the document but\n\n371\n00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:27.852\ni will allow them to insert comments,\nokay.\n\n372\n00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:31.256\nSo it did work, now I'm getting myself\nall sorts of in little circles,\n\n373\n00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:33.296\nall right Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:35.023\n&gt;&gt; Hey so you guys see that I did\n\n375\n00:17:35.023 --> 00:17:38.550\nthis too, all right so\ndoing it for your benefit.\n\n376\n00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.565\nDon't do what I do.\n\n377\n00:17:39.565 --> 00:17:42.155\n[LAUGH] Alright.\n&gt;&gt; New way to learn.\n\n378\n00:17:42.155 --> 00:17:44.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right.\n\n379\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.780\nGreat way to lead by example.\n\n380\n00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.970\nOf not.\n\n381\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.520\nGreat.\nSo\n\n382\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.420\nyou can see that I could take\nthe password protection off.\n\n383\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.590\nIt will notice,\n\n384\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.010\nwhen I'm checking this box off I have\nto have the password for this area.\n\n385\n00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.392\nWhich was Apple.\n\n386\n00:17:59.392 --> 00:18:00.717\nOkay, so there we go.\n\n387\n00:18:00.717 --> 00:18:04.090\nAnd now I can take it off and\nI could say, okay.\n\n388\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:08.680\nBut it is still, well now I just\nactually made it all not read only.\n\n389\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.610\nI just found a little hole, didn't I?\n\n390\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.860\nWhen I took that password off.\n\n391\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.180\nBut if I didn't have the password I\nwouldn't have been able to do that anyway.\n\n392\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.865\nSo that's why we password protect it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n393\n00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:22.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right lovely.\n\n394\n00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.800\nWonderful.\n\n395\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:29.370\nThis does get a little dicey in a sense.\n&gt;&gt; You have to track everything.\n\n396\n00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:29.880\nOkay.\nSo\n\n397\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.350\nwhen you're using this protection right?\n\n398\n00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.250\nBecause it is for your protection and\nfor your security.\n\n399\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.940\nJust remember the features here\nthat we're talking about right?\n\n400\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.240\nSecurity is really about securing\naccess to the document itself.\n\n401\n00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.370\nYou know I have the password, and\n\n402\n00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.290\nyou use this, you've got to have the right\npassword to get access to the document.\n\n403\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.160\nBut protection is about being able to say,\nI'm not gonna allow you to modify it.\n\n404\n00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.490\nIf you set a password on that and you\nforget it, it means that even if they have\n\n405\n00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.780\nthe one password that gives them\naccess to it they might not be\n\n406\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.500\nable to do anything that you're wanting\nsomeone to do without the other password.\n\n407\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.710\nSo that's why it's actually\na fairly nice idea here of\n\n408\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.000\nadding in document security for us.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n409\n00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.990\nbecause I had the password for\nthe comments, and I typed it in.\n\n410\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.250\nIt's like, well then you're in,\n\n411\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.430\nnow that makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n412\n00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.350\n&gt;&gt; That's why I could go ahead\n\n413\n00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.580\nand delete it.\n\n414\n00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.440\nCuz I took off all of that\nkind of security because I\n\n415\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.760\nhad the password.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n416\n00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.580\nOkay, see, this is why I need you here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n417\n00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.100\n&gt;&gt; To help me make sure I'm all right,\n\n418\n00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.805\nkeep me on track, but yes,\nmaking sure you track and testing it.\n\n419\n00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:31.470\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n420\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.230\n&gt;&gt; Test all of the parameters and\n\n421\n00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.080\nmake sure that this is what you want.\n\n422\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.026\nAnd if you really don't want\nsomebody editing anything,\n\n423\n00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:41.775\nyou could always send them a print copy.\n\n424\n00:19:41.775 --> 00:19:45.825\n[LAUGH] Or you could, there's also\nlike PDFs that you can lock down too.\n\n425\n00:19:45.825 --> 00:19:48.306\nBut just like with any good hacker,\n\n426\n00:19:48.306 --> 00:19:50.330\nthey are breakable.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n427\n00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.080\n&gt;&gt; This is isn't impenetrable and now\n\n428\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.040\nthe level of hacking that somebody wanna\ndo on an Alice-in-Wonderland document\n\n429\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.830\n&gt;&gt; But, you get into annual reports.\n\n430\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.648\nYou get company information.\n\n431\n00:19:59.648 --> 00:20:05.049\nI mean there's reasons why you\nwant documents to be locked down.\n\n432\n00:20:05.049 --> 00:20:05.880\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n433\n00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.451\n&gt;&gt; So, and\n\n434\n00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:09.719\njust make sure you're\nusing people you trust.\n\n435\n00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:13.938\nAnd that aren't going to,\nI guess that's just in life too,\n\n436\n00:20:13.938 --> 00:20:16.720\nright, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Well, the very reality, right,\n\n437\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.950\nthis is basic level security for\nthe individual computer itself.\n\n438\n00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.550\nSo on a local level it works great but if\nyou are in a large organization which you\n\n439\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.320\nare sharing documents or you're storing\nall of your stuff on a file share,\n\n440\n00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.670\nmore than likely you're gonna need\nan additional protection that Word for\n\n441\n00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.990\nMac itself is not going to offer you.\n\n442\n00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.710\nIt's going to be done at\nan administrative level.\n\n443\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.960\nSo for\nexample you might hear when somebody says,\n\n444\n00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.840\nyou don't have to worry about it,\nwe've got it protected in this way.\n\n445\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.960\nVaughn, there's ways\nthat we can protect it,\n\n446\n00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.779\nwhere we won't even allow you to e-mail\nthis document outside of the organization.\n\n447\n00:20:50.779 --> 00:20:52.540\nSo even if you said here's\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n448\n00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.040\nWe're gonna take that annual report, and\n\n449\n00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.280\nI'm just gonna e-mail it\nto my personal account.\n\n450\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.390\nWe can restrict it just based on\nthe very fact that we go this document,\n\n451\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.060\nit can't be e-mailed to anybody\noutside of this organization.\n\n452\n00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.480\nSo you name it, there's other protections\nthat you'll use this in conjunction.\n\n453\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.970\nSo this though, will at least help you,\nespecially if you're modifying or\n\n454\n00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.970\nyou're editing.\n\n455\n00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.870\nYou want to make sure that that\nediting from somebody else doesn't\n\n456\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.290\noverride what you do.\n\n457\n00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.760\nThis type of protection\nis pretty much key.\n\n458\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.000\n&gt;&gt; And now network drives who\n\n459\n00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.850\nhave folders that are protected or have a.\n&gt;&gt; Permissions.\n\n460\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, permissions,\n\n461\n00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.040\nhave all in these for the users or\n\n462\n00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.600\ngroups and we have it in our dropbox.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n463\n00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.830\n&gt;&gt; So it, yes,\n\n464\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.220\nthere is that level that does go\nbe on at the application level.\n\n465\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.660\nWhy I have him, but\nthat's a really good place to do it.\n\n466\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.725\nThis is a document end user level, and\n\n467\n00:21:41.725 --> 00:21:45.420\nit's good, but it's not fool proof.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n468\n00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.596\n&gt;&gt; And just know those different nuances\n\n469\n00:21:47.596 --> 00:21:49.437\nof why you would want to do that.\n\n470\n00:21:49.437 --> 00:21:53.983\nSo on that same level of\nblocking specific people.\n\n471\n00:21:53.983 --> 00:21:57.995\nI wanna come back down under here to\njust kind of glaze the surface if you\n\n472\n00:21:57.995 --> 00:21:58.727\nwanna say.\n\n473\n00:21:58.727 --> 00:22:01.990\n[LAUGH] These two buttons right here.\n\n474\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.500\nThe restrict permissions,\nnow notice it says no restrictions.\n\n475\n00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.360\nAnd then we also have block authors,\nand it's grayed out.\n\n476\n00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.330\nNow why do I have the block\nauthors grayed out?\n\n477\n00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.450\nWell I have my notes back over here.\n\n478\n00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.670\nSo we could look at it.\n\n479\n00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.180\nAnd if I click on this,\n\n480\n00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:22.120\nthis is something that's specific\nto Sharepoint and Onedrive.\n\n481\n00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.890\nOkay, so right here is, is saved in\na DOX on a Windows live Onedrive or\n\n482\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:31.130\na Microsoft Sharepoint Foundations\n2010 that supports Workspaces.\n\n483\n00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:35.220\nThat goes a little outside the scope of\nthis particular course, because if you\n\n484\n00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.060\nare on SharePoint then this is something\nyou would be at least familiar with.\n\n485\n00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.760\nIn a very general terms, SharePoint\nwould be kind of like an intranet\n\n486\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.040\nto where your organization goes ahead and\n\n487\n00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.660\nuses this particular platform to share\ndocuments and contacts and resources.\n\n488\n00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.640\nIs that an accurate description?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's exactly like you said,\n\n489\n00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.790\nthe idea here is that you put things\nup there for your own personal use.\n\n490\n00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.600\nAs well as for the collaborative\nuse inside of your organization.\n\n491\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.900\nThen you can restrict it.\n\n492\n00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.860\nHaving that centralized location,\npeople can access it by checking it out or\n\n493\n00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.660\nputting it back, and you'll know\nexactly what happened at that point.\n\n494\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.490\nThen you can prevent someone from\neven authoring something and\n\n495\n00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.950\nputting it in your place\nif you don't want them to.\n\n496\n00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.930\nSo it's actually a big part of what\norganizations are going to, especially in\n\n497\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.439\nthis cloud based world that we're in.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and along those same lines,\n\n498\n00:23:25.439 --> 00:23:26.695\nanother gloss over.\n\n499\n00:23:26.695 --> 00:23:30.548\nIRM information rights management,\nthis again,\n\n500\n00:23:30.548 --> 00:23:34.050\ngets a little higher up\ninto administration.\n\n501\n00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:40.590\nAnd whoever is setting up your Office 365,\nnot just Office 365 but your network and\n\n502\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.150\nyour folders and all that kind of stuff.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n503\n00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:48.710\nthis is again another one of those\nrights level of who can do what when,\n\n504\n00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:54.360\nand if you are set up you would have that\ndrop down, and be able to choose by users.\n\n505\n00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.511\nAnd by levels this read,\nchange, full control.\n\n506\n00:23:57.511 --> 00:24:03.141\nAnd so you can see that this is\nall part of a higher level of.\n\n507\n00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:05.822\nAccess and restriction,\nbut the buttons are there.\n\n508\n00:24:05.822 --> 00:24:06.368\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n509\n00:24:06.368 --> 00:24:08.980\nthis is not just affecting\nindividual documents,\n\n510\n00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.300\nlike what Vonne was showing us with\nthis protection of using the password.\n\n511\n00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.871\nThis instead will allow you to do\nsomething that's gonna be a little bit\n\n512\n00:24:16.871 --> 00:24:18.250\nbeyond what we cover here.\n\n513\n00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.789\nBut it's to set a policy,\na generalized policy,\n\n514\n00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:24.659\nthat says here's what we're gonna allow\nto happen with this document, and\n\n515\n00:24:24.659 --> 00:24:27.610\nhere's what we're not\ngonna allow to happen.\n\n516\n00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:32.650\nSo when you start doing that, now your\nsecurity becomes instead of password base,\n\n517\n00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:37.320\nwhich Vonne has showed us, to now a policy\nthat is actually going to be across\n\n518\n00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.600\nanything that's within that container,\nand even throughout the organization.\n\n519\n00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.070\nSo anytime somebody accesses that,\n\n520\n00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.270\nyou don't have to worry that I\nset permissions for that person.\n\n521\n00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.450\nIt's based on the policy itself.\n\n522\n00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:49.503\nAnd that's the key here.\n\n523\n00:24:49.503 --> 00:24:53.600\nAnd that's what the world is going\nto in the environment that we're in.\n\n524\n00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.730\nNo longer having to worry\nabout six different passwords.\n\n525\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.266\nVonne had to worry about two passwords and\nwe were getting confused with the two\n\n526\n00:24:58.266 --> 00:24:59.800\npasswords.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n527\n00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.322\n&gt;&gt; Well now, we set a policy and\n\n528\n00:25:01.322 --> 00:25:06.000\nthis manages it for us, makes us to be\nable to protect our documents much better.\n\n529\n00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.560\nBut you can use this if you\njust have your local machine.\n\n530\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.720\nIt is better than nothing\nis what we call it.\n\n531\n00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.619\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so, and this is where we're\n\n532\n00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:21.120\ngetting into more glazing of just some\nother areas of document security.\n\n533\n00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.984\nAnd I have this particular like remove\nprotection in your Office 2016.\n\n534\n00:25:25.984 --> 00:25:31.149\nThis is definitely very much a Windows\nbased help file of where you can,\n\n535\n00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:36.095\nwe talked about the add or\nremove passwords, so we did that.\n\n536\n00:25:36.095 --> 00:25:40.137\nBut there's also things in a Windows\nenvironment where in the backstage through\n\n537\n00:25:40.137 --> 00:25:44.309\nthey had this marked as final, restrict\ncertain areas, add a digital signature.\n\n538\n00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:48.366\nAll of these,\nthey're not available in the macro.\n\n539\n00:25:48.366 --> 00:25:50.175\nYou just don't have them.\n\n540\n00:25:50.175 --> 00:25:53.810\nSo, and the mark is final, I was always\nthis weird one and I have this one also in\n\n541\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.910\nthe notes where the answers just like if\nnot really, it doesn't really do anything.\n\n542\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.320\nYes, it puts mark as final, but\npeople can like take it off and\n\n543\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.930\nthen edit the document so\nit doesn't really restrict anything.\n\n544\n00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.981\nThe passwords in the read only,\nnow that's what you really\n\n545\n00:26:08.981 --> 00:26:12.594\nwanna do to make it to where somebody\ncan't mess something up, okay?\n\n546\n00:26:12.594 --> 00:26:15.741\nSo mark as final is really just\nlike putting a watermark on it.\n\n547\n00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:17.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a watermark, but\n\n548\n00:26:17.224 --> 00:26:20.180\nit also goes to those file\nproperties that you talked about.\n\n549\n00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.110\nThat allow somebody to do a search and\n\n550\n00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.720\nsay hey,\nwhat documents are still being edited?\n\n551\n00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.530\nWhich ones shouldn't be edited,\nand that way they can search and\n\n552\n00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.950\nthey can filter by that too.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n553\n00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.292\nit's more of a work flow.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n554\n00:26:30.292 --> 00:26:32.338\n&gt;&gt; If you wanna say hey our process,\n\n555\n00:26:32.338 --> 00:26:37.307\nan internal process of like, we have it\nin draft, then we have it in processing,\n\n556\n00:26:37.307 --> 00:26:39.470\nand then we have it as final.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n557\n00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.660\n&gt;&gt; So it's more of that.\n\n558\n00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.913\nAnd right there it just\nsays it's not a security\n\n559\n00:26:41.913 --> 00:26:42.537\nfeature.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n560\n00:26:42.537 --> 00:26:43.551\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Though go ahead and\n\n561\n00:26:43.551 --> 00:26:44.536\nclick the edit anyways and\n\n562\n00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:45.802\nbypass the settings.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n563\n00:26:45.802 --> 00:26:47.410\n&gt;&gt; So it's like, okay, that's fine.\n\n564\n00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:53.094\nBut again, not in Mac or Windows for Mac?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Word for\n\n565\n00:26:53.094 --> 00:26:54.587\nMac.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, okay.\n\n566\n00:26:54.587 --> 00:26:59.228\n[LAUGH] And then the a restrict editing\nthat we talked about where you can\n\n567\n00:26:59.228 --> 00:27:02.180\nlimit certain styles, not here.\n\n568\n00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.930\nAnd then the editing restrictions,\nwell we do have that,\n\n569\n00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.100\nwe saw that we could do a read only.\n\n570\n00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.160\nAnd then you would start the enforcement.\n\n571\n00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.560\nThis is the PC version.\n\n572\n00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.020\nJust a few other things.\n\n573\n00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.243\nDigital signatures, right?\n\n574\n00:27:16.243 --> 00:27:20.961\nThat gets into a whole other world of\nmaking sure you have certificates and\n\n575\n00:27:20.961 --> 00:27:24.470\nthe hashing and\nthen making sure that they all match.\n\n576\n00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.260\nAnd in a very simple way,\n\n577\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.750\nit's just verifying that I am\nthe one who made this file and\n\n578\n00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.800\nwhen you receive it you know that it\ndidn't get compromised along the way.\n\n579\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.724\nIs that good enough?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n580\n00:27:36.724 --> 00:27:39.180\nthat's the way that it\nactually is designed to do.\n\n581\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.810\nIt is an authentication of a sort.\n\n582\n00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:47.130\nThe very fact is, if Vonne is putting that\nsomewhere for me to locate, it doesn't\n\n583\n00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.500\nmean somebody can't just reproduce that\ndocument, put all the fake data in it.\n\n584\n00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.850\nThat Vonne didn't intend\nto put in there and\n\n585\n00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:57.150\nI read it and\nnot understand what's happened.\n\n586\n00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.800\nA digital signature works\nin a couple of ways.\n\n587\n00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.650\nOne, it verifies the origin.\n\n588\n00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.440\nOn other words, it came from Vonne.\n\n589\n00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.830\nSecondly though,\nit makes this mark on the file.\n\n590\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.500\nIt generates a mathematical process and\nputs an answer on it.\n\n591\n00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.120\nAnd then when my computer\nopens it up it goes, look,\n\n592\n00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:19.020\nthe hash that's on that file is different\nthan what is reporting when I open it up.\n\n593\n00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.010\nWhich means that somewhere along the line\nsomebody has messed around with that\n\n594\n00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.930\ndocument.\n\n595\n00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.800\nAnd that's what prevents\nyou from actually getting\n\n596\n00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.210\nunusual information\nthat you shouldn't get.\n\n597\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.130\nIt really does help identify and\nhelps to protect\n\n598\n00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.530\nthe idea that the information is the same\nas when it left Vonne's computer.\n\n599\n00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.622\nSame when I read it on my computer.\n&gt;&gt; And to just clarify,\n\n600\n00:28:39.622 --> 00:28:41.924\na hash is kinda like an ID code.\n\n601\n00:28:41.924 --> 00:28:46.323\nA unique ID code that is\ngenerated in that instance and\n\n602\n00:28:46.323 --> 00:28:49.880\nthen those hashes are compared.\n\n603\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.770\nI always call it the secret handshake.\n\n604\n00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:55.482\nIf you're getting into your organization\nyou have to do the [SOUND].\n\n605\n00:28:55.482 --> 00:28:56.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n606\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.410\n&gt;&gt; And if you don't do it in the right\n\n607\n00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.790\nsequence, then I know\nthat you don't know it.\n\n608\n00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.917\nSo there's this whole sending,\nif I'm trying to verify my authenticity\n\n609\n00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:10.141\nto Ronnie, I would have to send you my\ncertificate and then it gives to him.\n\n610\n00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:13.130\nSo now he has something to judge\nagainst when I bring it in.\n\n611\n00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:19.511\nSo it gets, it sounds very complicated and\nit can be kind of complicated.\n\n612\n00:29:19.511 --> 00:29:23.989\nBut it's something that is in Word for\nMac,\n\n613\n00:29:23.989 --> 00:29:28.670\nnot ingrained into the application.\n\n614\n00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.541\nYou can take a Word file and then use\na third party service outside of Word.\n\n615\n00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:33.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n616\n00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.370\n&gt;&gt; And maybe even do it with PDFs and\n\n617\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.210\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n618\n00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.850\nBut that's, again, outside of it.\n\n619\n00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:43.040\nIn the PC world,\nyou have digital signatures built directly\n\n620\n00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.840\ninto the Office applications, where you\ncan add it and do all of that same stuff.\n\n621\n00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.100\nSo there is lots of information about\nlearning about digital signatures, and\n\n622\n00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.710\ncertificates and how that works.\n\n623\n00:29:54.710 --> 00:30:01.020\nIt is one of those again, like if your\norganization implements this as a policy,\n\n624\n00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.360\nif you want to say, like a company policy\nthat you must digitally sign everything,\n\n625\n00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.360\nand all that, maybe government\norganizations, larger organizations that\n\n626\n00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:14.080\nyou do have to prove that kind of stuff,\nthat would be where you might see it.\n\n627\n00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.760\nIf your organization doesn't use them,\nthen I honestly,\n\n628\n00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.850\nI really wouldn't worry about it.\n\n629\n00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:23.000\nJust understand the general concept so you\nare just a little bit more aware of how\n\n630\n00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.260\nall that stuff works.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n631\n00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.830\nthere is no doubt that there's many ways.\n\n632\n00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.710\nAnd that's a good analogy to use.\n\n633\n00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:32.720\nAnother one that may be simpler, at least\nin my mind is, I do a math problem,\n\n634\n00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.350\nI know what the answer is.\n\n635\n00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.315\nAnd I just write down what the answer\nis when I send you the file.\n\n636\n00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:40.720\nVonne gets it, she goes I'm supposed\nto do this math problem, and\n\n637\n00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.660\nher answer should match mine.\n\n638\n00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.880\nAnd if it doesn't match,\n\n639\n00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.660\nwell then she knows that somewhere along\nthe line something has changed in that\n\n640\n00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.250\ndocument that actually ended\nup getting sent over to Vonne.\n\n641\n00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.820\nSo that way she knows that something\nchanged and then she can't trust it,\n\n642\n00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.010\nand that's really what the idea here\nof using those signatures are about.\n\n643\n00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.890\nMore than likely you're gonna see this\nin a more high secure environment.\n\n644\n00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.970\nBut if you actually want to do this,\n\n645\n00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.230\nespecially if you're sending these\ndocuments over the internet,\n\n646\n00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.930\nit's probably the way to go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good,\n\n647\n00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.430\nI've never actually heard that analogy for\ndigital signatures and\n\n648\n00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.740\nI've worked with you on\nthis a couple times.\n\n649\n00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.410\nI'm like, that sounds really cool!\n\n650\n00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:16.976\nBut then I'm like math, but that's scary.\n\n651\n00:31:16.976 --> 00:31:18.344\nSo [LAUGH] but yeah, so\n\n652\n00:31:18.344 --> 00:31:23.299\nthat was basically everything I wanted\nto cover in document security in Mac.\n\n653\n00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:25.280\nYou saw me get a little twisted in there.\n\n654\n00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.595\nI did a couple circles and\ngot myself confused.\n\n655\n00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:31.208\nAnd just remember if you're clicking\noff of a password field in that protect\n\n656\n00:31:31.208 --> 00:31:34.330\ndocument, it's gonna\nask you to reenter it.\n\n657\n00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.381\nJust remember to delete it [LAUGH]\nif you don't want it anymore.\n\n658\n00:31:36.381 --> 00:31:37.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n659\n00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.835\n&gt;&gt; And always remember your passwords, and\n\n660\n00:31:39.835 --> 00:31:41.099\nthat duplicate.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n661\n00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:43.217\n&gt;&gt; That other step that I got a little\n\n662\n00:31:43.217 --> 00:31:48.220\nmixed up on is read-only, make a duplicate\ncopy, and then they can comment.\n\n663\n00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.890\nSo that way when they call you and\nbe like, I can't make the comments on it.\n\n664\n00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.475\nTell them to do that extra step,\nand you can remember because\n\n665\n00:31:55.475 --> 00:31:57.670\nI messed it up [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n666\n00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.545\nWell thank you again for helping us out\nhere and understanding a little bit more\n\n667\n00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:04.258\nabout document security\nin the Word 2016 for Mac.\n\n668\n00:32:04.258 --> 00:32:08.953\nThere's a lot of information here, and\nthe idea behind the security that we're\n\n669\n00:32:08.953 --> 00:32:12.350\nfocusing on is really at\nthe end user basis, right?\n\n670\n00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.320\nOn the computer that you're on,\non the Mac that you're on,\n\n671\n00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.130\nyou're really only doing\nthat security basis there.\n\n672\n00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.550\nBut as you start moving in\nthe organizations that have more,\n\n673\n00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.750\nyou're actually going to depend on\nthose security features as well.\n\n674\n00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.200\nAlso, Vonne showed us and\n\n675\n00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.600\ncompared this with Mac versus the PC as\nwell in the different security features.\n\n676\n00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.680\nSome of the features that you actually\nsee with your friends that are working on\n\n677\n00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.440\nregular Windows computers, they'll have\nmore features than you'll have in the Mac.\n\n678\n00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.080\nNow that's not to say that it's not\ncoming because we have heard news that\n\n679\n00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.880\nthey're gonna start sharing\nthe same code base.\n\n680\n00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.990\nSo in future editions you\nmight see absolute parity\n\n681\n00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.340\nwhen it comes down to those features.\n\n682\n00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.780\nBut as of now in the Word 2016 for\nMac, you're not gonna see that.\n\n683\n00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.480\nWell, this is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n684\n00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.127\nSigning off for Office ProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n685\n00:33:00.127 --> 00:33:00.951\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n686\n00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:02.605\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n687\n00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:05.688\nmore of the

00:00:19.100\nYou're watching the Word\n2016 Expert show for Mac.\n\n4\n00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.737\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:24.708\nAnd today, we're going to be\nconquering the idea here, of course,\n\n6\n00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:27.810\nof document properties and\naccessibilities.\n\n7\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.050\nAnd who better to help us and\n\n8\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.840\nguide us up that mountain than\nour property master herself Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.150\nVonne Smith, how are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The property master, yeah,\n\n10\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.320\nProperty Brothers that's a fun show.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n11\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.495\n&gt;&gt; And they're really cute.\n\n12\n00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:44.333\n[LAUGH] Right Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, never heard of them, but sure,\n\n13\n00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:44.980\nlet's do it.\n\n14\n00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.418\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're gonna-\n\n15\n00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:48.834\n&gt;&gt; What the heck is a Property Brother?\n\n16\n00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:49.621\n&gt;&gt; It's a show.\n\n17\n00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.413\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go.\n\n18\n00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:51.404\n&gt;&gt; They flip houses and\n\n19\n00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:53.919\nthey do cool stuff, and\nthey're the twins, and-\n\n20\n00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.173\n&gt;&gt; I really, okay, let's-\n\n21\n00:00:55.173 --> 00:00:55.788\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:56.514\n&gt;&gt; Go on to Mac,\n\n23\n00:00:56.514 --> 00:01:00.351\n[LAUGH] work for Mac here.\n&gt;&gt; Focus, Vonne, come on now.\n\n24\n00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.632\n&gt;&gt; Apparently, popular TV is not my thing,\n\n25\n00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:04.206\nso there we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:05.367\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne, here we are.\n\n27\n00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:07.221\nWe're taking a look at these\ndocument properties and\n\n28\n00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:09.320\nof course some of\nthe accessibility features.\n\n29\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.774\nThese are not exactly dealing with things\nlike the content of our document anymore.\n\n30\n00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:17.338\nSo what are we taking a look at?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, great point.\n\n31\n00:01:17.338 --> 00:01:20.454\nAnd great way to start is that\nthe document properties are,\n\n32\n00:01:20.454 --> 00:01:23.278\nit's like the background information.\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n33\n00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:25.502\n&gt;&gt; It's a stuff that you don't visibly see\n\n34\n00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:26.096\nup front.\n\n35\n00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:31.241\nIt's not on the page necessarily, it's\nwhat would also be considered metadata.\n\n36\n00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:36.372\nMetadata is the data that works in files,\nwebpages, all sorts of\n\n37\n00:01:36.372 --> 00:01:42.270\nstuff that is in the background,\nthat explains the file if you want to say.\n\n38\n00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.832\nIt gives more information about it,\nthere's tags in it.\n\n39\n00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:50.211\nAnd maybe that's something like on the\nwebsites and everything, you see if you\n\n40\n00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:53.401\nhave something with it, it's tagged\na certain way, it's categorized.\n\n41\n00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:55.769\nAnd you can click on it,\nand be able to go to it.\n\n42\n00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:58.712\nIt's not exactly what document\nproperties are like, but\n\n43\n00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:02.085\nit is information that's like\nbuilt in to that particular thing.\n\n44\n00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:03.699\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna be talking about.\n\n45\n00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:05.892\n&gt;&gt; Right, the idea of metadata has always\n\n46\n00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:10.555\nbeen a little bit confusing to most people\nwhen they hear the term and read about it.\n\n47\n00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:14.685\nSo if we think about metadata, think about\nthis as being, which is weird, right?\n\n48\n00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:18.150\nWe have a file, but we actually have\nto have information about that file.\n\n49\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.444\nSo it really is information about\nthe information itself or the file itself.\n\n50\n00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:28.547\nAnd that's what we in the world of what\nwe're gonna take a look at today in,\n\n51\n00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:34.379\nWord for Mac, which I don't remember the\nprogram now, that we're taking a look at,\n\n52\n00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.481\nwe call it properties.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n53\n00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:37.724\n&gt;&gt; Nobody tends to actually label\n\n54\n00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.360\nit as metadata, but\nthat's exactly what we're talking about.\n\n55\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.053\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is through all of\n\n56\n00:02:42.053 --> 00:02:46.525\nyour Office products, Office applications,\nso Excel, anything to that effect.\n\n57\n00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:48.737\nSo let's show you where it's at, and\n\n58\n00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:52.759\nthen we'll explain along the way\nlike why you might want to use this.\n\n59\n00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:57.400\nAnd I know that we have both encountered\npeople in how we've taught this product\n\n60\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.693\nthat have told us how and why they use\ndocument properties, and why it is so\n\n61\n00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:04.600\nimportant for\ntheir particular organization.\n\n62\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.660\nThis is again one of those like,\non a need to know basis in a sense or\n\n63\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.350\nneed to use basis on what\nyou do in your organization,\n\n64\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.290\nor just in how you use the product.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n65\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.750\n&gt;&gt; So it's not for everybody, but\n\n66\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.600\nat least you're gonna\nknow where it's there.\n\n67\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.760\nAnd maybe I'll show you an example\nof why it will come into play\n\n68\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.550\nwith some other features that we\nlearned about in the advanced show.\n\n69\n00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.330\nCome down in the computer.\n\n70\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.340\nDocument properties is\nlocated in the File menu.\n\n71\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.405\nWhen you go to File,\ngo all the way down to the bottom.\n\n72\n00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:38.914\nYou go to Properties.\n\n73\n00:03:38.914 --> 00:03:42.083\nNow I have a blank document by the way,\nso I didn't have any thing started,\n\n74\n00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:43.050\nnothing's going on.\n\n75\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.940\nSo right now, you can see that there\nreally isn't any properties to talk about.\n\n76\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.020\nThere's a couple tabs or\nlittle buttons across the top,\n\n77\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.950\nwhere we have General, Summary,\nStatistics, Content, and Custom.\n\n78\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.970\nSo you see it's like, what's the location,\nthe size, when is it modified?\n\n79\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.533\nAll right, so these are some of the things\nthat are built into the file, but\n\n80\n00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.282\nyou don't always see them.\n\n81\n00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:09.578\nThen summarizing what's going on here, and\nthis is that information like the title,\n\n82\n00:04:09.578 --> 00:04:13.870\nsubject, author, company,\nnow why is this being populated for me?\n\n83\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.340\nWell, Justin Timberlake,\nthat's the account that I'm signed into\n\n84\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.040\non this particular Office 365,\nthis particular product.\n\n85\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.210\nAnd then the company ITProTV,\nthis is also tied into my user data,\n\n86\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.100\nso the ones that I,\nall with my accounts and\n\n87\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.690\neverything that kind of comes in there\nwhen you just set up your computer.\n\n88\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.470\nSo some of these might just go ahead and\nbe populated.\n\n89\n00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.674\nAnd then you have some statistics in\nyour content and your custom fields.\n\n90\n00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:48.589\nSo notice right now, blank, we don't\nreally have anything going on, but\n\n91\n00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.315\nif I open up another file.\n\n92\n00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:52.323\n[COUGH] So we have document properties.\n\n93\n00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:54.837\nAnd this is always one\nof those date modified,\n\n94\n00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:58.124\nI use this when I'm using my\ndetailed views in my Mac of like,\n\n95\n00:04:58.124 --> 00:05:02.054\nwhich one did I use last, especially\nwhen I start naming files the same,\n\n96\n00:05:02.054 --> 00:05:05.491\nlike version one, two, three,\nlike wait, which one was it?\n\n97\n00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:06.035\n[LAUGH] And\n\n98\n00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:10.806\nI have to look, well, I look at the date\nof whichever it is the most recent one.\n\n99\n00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:12.165\nThat's probably the one\nI was editing last.\n\n100\n00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:12.710\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n101\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.676\n&gt;&gt; So I like to use this, but\n\n102\n00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:19.652\nwhen it was modified,\nwhat about when it was created, right?\n\n103\n00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:23.710\n[LAUGH] That's something you can do\nwith looking at the document property.\n\n104\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.570\nSo lets open this up, and\nwe will open up, there's the bunny.\n\n105\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.216\nThis is the file that I thought we were\ndoing in the document security episode.\n\n106\n00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:34.896\n[LAUGH] Remember I was like, I thought\nthere was a bunny, wrong file Vonne.\n\n107\n00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:37.821\n&gt;&gt; That bunny looks like it's-\n\n108\n00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:38.359\n&gt;&gt; He's\n\n109\n00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:40.096\nlounging.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n110\n00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:40.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:43.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was not my first thought.\n\n112\n00:05:43.278 --> 00:05:44.647\n&gt;&gt; He's just relaxing.\n\n113\n00:05:44.647 --> 00:05:47.075\nHe's chilaxing there, Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; He's sleeping.\n\n114\n00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n115\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.548\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n116\n00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:49.246\n&gt;&gt; His eyes are open.\n\n117\n00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:50.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:52.009\n&gt;&gt; I'm now sad.\n\n119\n00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.967\n[LAUGH] Let's go back to File Properties,\nand if I look here,\n\n120\n00:05:56.967 --> 00:06:02.720\nnow you could see that when it was\ncreated versus when it was modified.\n\n121\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.863\nRight now, it's the same cuz\nnotice it's July 6, 2017.\n\n122\n00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:08.557\nIt's not July 6, 2017.\n\n123\n00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:12.608\n[LAUGH] So obviously, I haven't really\ndone much to this file since the last time\n\n124\n00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:15.277\nI taught this,\nwhich was on the expert four PC show.\n\n125\n00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:17.193\nSo you could see where I've got this.\n\n126\n00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:20.612\nAnd notice, if I did go ahead and\nmake some changes,\n\n127\n00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:24.780\nthen the modified date,\nlike I went here and add some text.\n\n128\n00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.600\nSave and close, open that back up.\n\n129\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.993\nJust using all my shortcuts, by the way.\n\n130\n00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:34.108\nNow you can see if I go back into\nthe properties that there we go,\n\n131\n00:06:34.108 --> 00:06:37.420\nit's modified today and\nthen it was created.\n\n132\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.060\nThis is a good one,\nbecause that's the whole, well,\n\n133\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.200\nmy computer broke or\nI didn't turn it in like I did.\n\n134\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.520\nTeachers and people,\nthey can look at this.\n\n135\n00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.380\nSo it's like no, you created it\na while ago or you modified it.\n\n136\n00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.010\nSo this is something that you can use to\nyour advantage in certain situations, and\n\n137\n00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.306\nit just gives more of that information.\n\n138\n00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:04.067\nThings you probably wouldn't see\nin the front end of the document.\n\n139\n00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:07.850\nAnd then, if I look at the summary, wow,\nthere's a lot of stuff filled out in here.\n\n140\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.739\nBecause I added, I had to come in and\nmanually add these particular\n\n141\n00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:16.767\nproducts of what is the title\nof this particular file.\n\n142\n00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:20.877\nNow notice that it says document\nproperties added, that's the file name.\n\n143\n00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:25.813\nBut the title of the document\nmight be something different,\n\n144\n00:07:25.813 --> 00:07:29.598\ncuz they don't have to\nbe the same as the file.\n\n145\n00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:30.295\nSo what is this?\n\n146\n00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:31.291\nIt's Alice in Wonderland.\n\n147\n00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:32.650\nWhat is the subject?\n\n148\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.112\nLearn about document properties.\n\n149\n00:07:34.112 --> 00:07:35.297\nWho are the authors?\n\n150\n00:07:35.297 --> 00:07:36.250\nWho's the manager?\n\n151\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.345\nYou can see how we've got all the stuff\nthat here, and even have some keywords.\n\n152\n00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:45.289\nThese keywords are kind of important,\nbecause that as you ties in not just with\n\n153\n00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:47.757\nword, this is just like\nyour operating system.\n\n154\n00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:51.719\nLike when you do your search light or\nif you're in a PC,\n\n155\n00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:57.333\nif you do your just the search down at\nthe bottom, you can tell it to use those.\n\n156\n00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:01.276\nParameters for\nyou files to look for things.\n\n157\n00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:05.412\nLook for keywords of properties and\nfields, that has nothing,\n\n158\n00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:09.710\nfields is nowhere in any of these\nfile names or anything like that.\n\n159\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.820\nSo I can use that as a parameter for\n\n160\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.280\nsearching my computer for\nthis particular information.\n\n161\n00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.550\nSo all that kinda good\nstuff that works with this.\n\n162\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.203\nAnd you can fill this out as\nmuch as you would like to do.\n\n163\n00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:27.897\nI do like the statistics, it's kinda nice\nto see how many words and characters and\n\n164\n00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:28.930\ntotal time edit.\n\n165\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.560\nWow, it's been an hour\nediting this file [LAUGH].\n\n166\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.800\nAnd a number of revision,\nthat's kind a cool.\n\n167\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.970\nI didn't know I did that\nmuch work on this file.\n\n168\n00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.560\nOkay, and then notice the content.\n\n169\n00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:44.170\nAnd then you can also have custom text or\nfields, sorry.\n\n170\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.840\nTags, fields, properties,\nkinda same thing.\n\n171\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.670\nAnd this is where in certain\norganizations you might need that.\n\n172\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.520\nAnd one of the, I thought was\nthe biggest example of when and\n\n173\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.740\nwhy they use document property is\nwhen I was teaching this back many,\n\n174\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.230\nmany years ago,\nwas somebody from a lawyer's office.\n\n175\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.412\nAnd it seems that in the legal field,\nthey use this like crazy.\n\n176\n00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:09.880\nLike depositions, and she's like, yeah, we\nhave to go ahead and add all these things.\n\n177\n00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.530\nAnd then we put who was the person\nrecording the information.\n\n178\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.700\nAnd so\nthey have all of these custom fields and\n\n179\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.640\nthey kind of live by this.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n180\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.251\n&gt;&gt; And that's their policy within\n\n181\n00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:23.030\ntheir office.\n\n182\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.970\nAnd so that was my biggest example\nwhere I'm like, that makes sense.\n\n183\n00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.330\nSo, I don't know if you've ever come\nacross any other examples Ronnie?\n\n184\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, in every file, right?\n\n185\n00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:37.490\nNot just in Word, but in every file, you\ncan start using these fields to help you\n\n186\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.560\nin a way that Vonne talked\nabout in terms of purchase.\n\n187\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.680\nAnd that is seen like a gigantic thing\nright here on the show, when Vonne has\n\n188\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.030\nbeen using handful of docs, even 20 or\n30 documents during the range of the show.\n\n189\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.300\nBut what if you're actually\nstoring this along with\n\n190\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.920\neverybody else on a centralized share and\nthere's 20,000 documents.\n\n191\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.420\nAnd you need to find everybody that\nended up working on some particular\n\n192\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.240\nportion of this while adding in these\nkeywords or adding in these properties for\n\n193\n00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.960\nthis particular project.\n\n194\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.662\nIt allows then for you to go back and\nsay search, and you can actually do\n\n195\n00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:16.224\nthings a date, you can do things\nlike project whatever it might be.\n\n196\n00:10:16.224 --> 00:10:19.733\nAnd that will pull in every document,\nand this can include whether it's a Word\n\n197\n00:10:19.733 --> 00:10:23.650\ndocument, or whether it's a PowerPoint\npresentation or anything else here.\n\n198\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.550\nIt allows you to gather all that and\nleave all the information in location\n\n199\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.660\nwithout you having to go, I gotta\nsearch through every single folder.\n\n200\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.415\nSo being able to do this in the legal\nfield is because they need it very\n\n201\n00:10:34.415 --> 00:10:34.990\nquickly.\n\n202\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.720\nIn your instance though, it's because\nyou need the completeness of it.\n\n203\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.280\nAnd the same thing in the legal field,\nbut it's quickness and\n\n204\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.090\ncomprehension that you're seeing.\n\n205\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.430\nSo doing this,\nespecially in an organization,\n\n206\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.190\nif you train everybody to do it, it really\nbecomes helpful because you know that\n\n207\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.250\nthere's such a large amount of documents\nthat are there that it's almost impossible\n\n208\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.740\nto find even by file names, just about.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n209\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.320\nmight be that you can't add that\nparticular information into\n\n210\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.430\nthe documents.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n211\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.356\n&gt;&gt; So, right here it does a deposition,\n\n212\n00:11:02.356 --> 00:11:04.775\nand then there's a typist and\nstuff like that.\n\n213\n00:11:04.775 --> 00:11:09.300\nAnd so, and maybe this is a file\nthat's not supported in a case.\n\n214\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.400\nAnd you can't put it again, in the actual\ndocument so you put it all back here.\n\n215\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.660\nSo I just thought it was a real\neye opener as to them using it and\n\n216\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.550\nhow they tie it all together,\nand like you're saying,\n\n217\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.500\nthe searching and the organization, or\norganize the information, is pretty cool.\n\n218\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.620\nInformation on the information.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n219\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.230\n&gt;&gt; So you can add all of this.\n\n220\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.980\nAnd she say another thing\nthat I thought was good and\n\n221\n00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:37.670\nI put it in the episodes note,\nis that you can create templates for this.\n\n222\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.850\nSo if you're,\n\n223\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.090\nI don't have to add this information\nevery single time that I make a document.\n\n224\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.430\nWell, you could start with a new\nfile like we did, yeah, right here.\n\n225\n00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.700\nGo ahead and put in all of your\nproperties, all of your fields.\n\n226\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.160\nYou can make a custom field\nthat you might need to do,\n\n227\n00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.170\nagain different tags that\nyour organization uses.\n\n228\n00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.061\nAnd then fill this all out,\nit's still blank, right?\n\n229\n00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:04.946\nBut you would then save it as a template,\nand\n\n230\n00:12:04.946 --> 00:12:10.750\nthen add it with document,\nwith information or properties.\n\n231\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.200\nAnd then when you make a new file\nyou'll go new from template, and\n\n232\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.860\nit'll be right there and you can check it,\nand all of that information is.\n\n233\n00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.940\nSo that's a pretty cool way to\nkind of automate if you wanna say\n\n234\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.400\nthis especially if you\nare required to do this for\n\n235\n00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.140\nyour job.\n&gt;&gt; Is about the only way that you can do\n\n236\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.510\nit efficiently, Vonne.\n\n237\n00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.970\nWhen it comes down to it is to have\nthat template for whatever you're doing.\n\n238\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.140\nIf it is an illegal organization and\nyou're having to type this out,\n\n239\n00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.410\nyou always select that base template\ninstead of the regular normal template, or\n\n240\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.130\nyou can modify the normal template,\nnot recommended.\n\n241\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.740\nBut you can do that and\n\n242\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.680\ninclude in all those fields that you know\nyou're gonna need on every basis here.\n\n243\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.770\nIf not, it means you have to go and\nadd them in every single time.\n\n244\n00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.610\nSo it is a good thing,\nit's about doing what you can do\n\n245\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.735\nanything like this efficiently.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n246\n00:12:58.735 --> 00:13:04.540\nSo, and another example of where document\nproperties might be applicable to you.\n\n247\n00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.240\nMaybe you're like, well,\nI don't work in a legal field.\n\n248\n00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.824\nBut, the cover page?\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK], yeah.\n\n249\n00:13:08.824 --> 00:13:09.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna show you.\n\n250\n00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.160\nSo right here, if I'm in this document,\nand I wanna add a cover page,\n\n251\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.350\njust like in a book report,\nyou have to have that first page.\n\n252\n00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.320\nIf you go into,\n\n253\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.407\nI remember my fifth grade book reports-\n\n254\n00:13:21.407 --> 00:13:22.018\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] different ones, yeah.\n\n255\n00:13:22.018 --> 00:13:26.870\nAnd then you had the little plastic\nones with the little slider on it.\n\n256\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.110\nAnyways.\n&gt;&gt; Those were the days.\n\n257\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.621\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So if you go over to Insert and\n\n258\n00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:35.480\nthen we go to Pages and we go to\nCover Page, and we have all of these.\n\n259\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.930\nBut look at what it's pulling from, and\n\n260\n00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.270\nI think it was this one was the one\nthat I think demonstrated it the most.\n\n261\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.510\nIs that look, Alice in Wonderland,\nlearn about document properties,\n\n262\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.190\nwhere'd that come from?\n\n263\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.730\nThe document properties!\n\n264\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.120\nSo these feels like that's what it is,\nthat Word 2016 and advanced in expert\n\n265\n00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.790\nshows, all of that is pulled from\nwhat I populated in my category,\n\n266\n00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:04.930\nmy title, my author, and\nthen that cover page was generated.\n\n267\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.820\nNice, so\ntie that back in to your template.\n\n268\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.630\nYou got to put a cover page on every\nsingle thing that you do, we've got that.\n\n269\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.610\nSo it's puling all of that information\nfrom it and that way, you don't have\n\n270\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.840\nto go and then populate your cover page\ninformation cuz it's already there.\n\n271\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.750\nSo, kinda tie it in with maybe\nsomething that is not just in,\n\n272\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.480\nhey, I just hanging it\nup in the background.\n\n273\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.890\nThis is in the foreground pulling\nfrom that information, kind of fun.\n\n274\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.296\nSo I'm gonna undo this,\nI'm just gonna Cmd+Z to back up.\n\n275\n00:14:37.296 --> 00:14:40.953\n[INAUDIBLE] the properties, good,\nnow we know about what they are,\n\n276\n00:14:40.953 --> 00:14:43.597\nI want to go ahead and\nput in accessibility here.\n\n277\n00:14:43.597 --> 00:14:47.904\nI didn't, also didn't really know\nexactly where else to put it, and\n\n278\n00:14:47.904 --> 00:14:51.774\nit does kinda tie in with document\nproperties kinda that hidden\n\n279\n00:14:51.774 --> 00:14:56.626\ninformation that metadata that we're\ntalking about, with accessibility.\n\n280\n00:14:56.626 --> 00:15:01.640\nNow, when we talk about in our\nadvance show like adding images or\n\n281\n00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.730\nadding any graphical elements.\n\n282\n00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:10.370\nWe do hit up the the ADA compliance,\nand it's a hot topic if you wanna say.\n\n283\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.510\nThis is a very important topic, especially\nin different government organizations or\n\n284\n00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.500\nanything with publicly funded information.\n\n285\n00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.620\nYou need to be ADA compliant, you need\nto make sure American Disabilities Act.\n\n286\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.230\nSo people for\n\n287\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:28.270\nnonsighted individuals that are using\ndifferent screen readers and hardware and\n\n288\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:35.280\nsoftware to be able to see the document\nby them, by reading the document to them.\n\n289\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.054\nI can see that this is\na picture of a bunny, but\n\n290\n00:15:38.054 --> 00:15:41.339\nwhat if we need to say that\nthis is a chillaxing bunny,\n\n291\n00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:43.885\nit's not what you think Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:45.755\n&gt;&gt; It's hanging out on a cute little bed\n\n293\n00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:47.052\nspread.\n&gt;&gt; Kind of stiff looking.\n\n294\n00:15:47.052 --> 00:15:50.897\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But that's information that\n\n295\n00:15:50.897 --> 00:15:53.961\nwe need to tell people.\n&gt;&gt; Total rigor mortis going on there.\n\n296\n00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:55.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Stop it!\n\n297\n00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:56.377\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n298\n00:15:56.377 --> 00:15:57.657\n&gt;&gt; So that's something that is\n\n299\n00:15:57.657 --> 00:15:59.009\nAlternate text.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n300\n00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:02.870\nAnd alternate text is something you can\nput on any of your graphical elements.\n\n301\n00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:08.591\nAnd so what the accessibility checker\nis going to check your document for\n\n302\n00:16:08.591 --> 00:16:15.590\ncommon accessibility compliance is that\nyou would want to make sure that you have,\n\n303\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:20.550\nor if you don't have,\nhow to fix it to be fully compliant for\n\n304\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.950\nnon sided or\nother disabilities in this document.\n\n305\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.480\nNice.\n\n306\n00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.640\nSo I gotta check this accessibility,\nit gives me a little report.\n\n307\n00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.010\nAnd it says, hey, you've got some errors.\n\n308\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.200\nYou've got missing alternative text.\n\n309\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.850\nOkay.\n\n310\n00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.050\nI also have merge or\nsplit cells in a table.\n\n311\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.090\nI have an image or an object not in line.\n\n312\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.910\nAll right, so\nthese are different things that are wrong.\n\n313\n00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.336\nAnd the neat thing that happens,\nand it's behind my head.\n\n314\n00:16:51.336 --> 00:16:54.348\nI feel like why is this happening and\nwhat do I need to do.\n\n315\n00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:58.357\nThe neat thing is I like how\nit gives you a little bit of\n\n316\n00:16:58.357 --> 00:17:03.080\ninformation of why do you wanna fix this,\nhow do you do this.\n\n317\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.290\nSo it gives you a little\nbit more information.\n\n318\n00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:09.560\nLike why do I need to\nhave the merge cells,\n\n319\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.010\ntable should have simple structures so\nthey can be easily navigated.\n\n320\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.970\nOkay, that things that you\nmight not think about cuz\n\n321\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.716\nwe're being able to see this.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n322\n00:17:18.716 --> 00:17:20.934\n&gt;&gt; But when we try to explain this\n\n323\n00:17:20.934 --> 00:17:26.526\ninformation, somebody, if there is\na screen reader reading this to you,\n\n324\n00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:30.067\nthat might be something to a visitor.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n325\n00:17:30.067 --> 00:17:31.728\n&gt;&gt; Right here I have this water mark.\n\n326\n00:17:31.728 --> 00:17:35.946\nOkay, it's not in line,\nit might be difficult for screen readers,\n\n327\n00:17:35.946 --> 00:17:38.678\nscreen reader users to interact with it.\n\n328\n00:17:38.678 --> 00:17:39.543\nThat's interesting.\n\n329\n00:17:39.543 --> 00:17:43.107\nThat is one honestly that I\ndidn't really think about before.\n\n330\n00:17:43.107 --> 00:17:47.895\nAll right, cuz it is going to read\nthat there's a picture here, but\n\n331\n00:17:47.895 --> 00:17:53.103\nif I have it moved over to the right or\nvisually changing where that graphic\n\n332\n00:17:53.103 --> 00:17:58.660\nis located in relationship to the text,\nthat might be something to consider.\n\n333\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:04.282\nSo where you anchor an image,\nin relationship to your text\n\n334\n00:18:04.282 --> 00:18:09.915\nis important to consider for\nthis type of accessibility.\n\n335\n00:18:09.915 --> 00:18:13.941\nIf that is something that you need\nto have your documents adhere to.\n\n336\n00:18:13.941 --> 00:18:18.020\nNow, I do have other episodes\nthat we talk a lot about this.\n\n337\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.850\nBut how to add an alternate\ntext on an image,\n\n338\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.100\neasiest way is just to right click on it.\n\n339\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.120\nAnd it goes into add alt text.\n\n340\n00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.650\nAnd it goes into the format picture.\n\n341\n00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.730\nAnd you can type in the title and\ndescription.\n\n342\n00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.160\nAgain, more information on\nour images episodes there.\n\n343\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.240\nSo I'm not gonna fix all of\nthe accessibility issues.\n\n344\n00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.306\nI just wanted to point out where\nit's at and how it is important to,\n\n345\n00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:43.588\npossibly your organization and\nall that good stuff.\n\n346\n00:18:43.588 --> 00:18:48.012\nThere's also some good\ninformation online if you\n\n347\n00:18:48.012 --> 00:18:51.922\njust type in accessibility word 2016.\n\n348\n00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:56.380\nLots of great information out there\non the Microsoft websites and others.\n\n349\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.580\nSo, good thing to know.\n\n350\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.384\nNow that's the only thing that\nthe accessibility checker is going to do.\n\n351\n00:19:02.384 --> 00:19:07.142\nThere used to be this accessibility report\nthat it would generate separate file\n\n352\n00:19:07.142 --> 00:19:08.213\nwith the report.\n\n353\n00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:12.738\nIt's kind of all built into it, so\nit's not that it really went away per se,\n\n354\n00:19:12.738 --> 00:19:15.370\nI think Streamline did\na little bit better.\n\n355\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:20.129\nSo just in case you are looking for that\nin some older versions, that's something.\n\n356\n00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:27.520\nI did wanna throw in a few last little\nthings that are a PC only functionality\n\n357\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.650\nthat do not exist in Word for Mac.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.995\n&gt;&gt; He wanna say Windows for\n\n359\n00:19:32.995 --> 00:19:37.433\nMac, like the last episode that we did\non the document properties, or sorry,\n\n360\n00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:38.659\ndocument security.\n\n361\n00:19:38.659 --> 00:19:42.912\nAnd I wanted to bring this up cuz Ronnie\nwent ahead and did a little snapshot for\n\n362\n00:19:42.912 --> 00:19:45.670\nme, or a snippet, and\nthen Slacked it over to me.\n\n363\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.500\nWe use Slack as our organization,\nhow we talk to each other.\n\n364\n00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:54.020\nAnd in the backstage view in our PC World,\nyou have this Inspect Document.\n\n365\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.970\nNotice that Check Accessibility.\n\n366\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:00.630\nGot that in Mac, just in a different\nplace, the check compatibility,\n\n367\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.740\nthat doesn't exist in Mac.\n\n368\n00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.190\nWhat it does is it does checking for\n\n369\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:12.778\nthings in your document that would not\nbe compatible with the DOC file format.\n\n370\n00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:16.840\nMeaning like the old version, that's 2003.\n\n371\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.958\nI think we might be a little past that but\nno, you never assume,\n\n372\n00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:25.781\nI've also talked to people,\nespecially in government, the military,\n\n373\n00:20:25.781 --> 00:20:29.357\nand they tell me what version\nof Office are you using and\n\n374\n00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:33.540\nwhat version of Windows and\nI'm like, I'm sorry what?\n\n375\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.280\nSo it's still applicable,\nwe can't totally discount it, but\n\n376\n00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.670\nyou don't have that feature in Mac Word.\n\n377\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:49.950\nYou also don't have the inspect document\nfor hidden properties and information.\n\n378\n00:20:50.982 --> 00:20:53.650\nThis will inspect whether\nyou have the high text,\n\n379\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.060\nremember that weird function that we\nshowed in document security episode?\n\n380\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.920\nAnd it will also check for\nthat personal information, or\n\n381\n00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.820\nreally what they're talking\nabout is document properties.\n\n382\n00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.210\nDoes this document have\ndocument properties and\n\n383\n00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.650\ndo you want to scrub that information?\n\n384\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.230\nIt would allow you to delete\nthat information from this\n\n385\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.510\ninspect document properties.\n\n386\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.690\nAnd it also kind of checks some stuff and\nfix it.\n\n387\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:19.750\nNot available here.\n\n388\n00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.100\nBut, I think that brings us back to\na point that I actually forgot is,\n\n389\n00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.650\nwhat if I didn't want to remove\nthe document properties?\n\n390\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.170\nCuz it might have,\nespecially in a legal, case numbers,\n\n391\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.540\nwho worked on a case, all of that stuff,\nit could be sensitive, and\n\n392\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.700\nyou don't want that to be on that\nparticular document anymore.\n\n393\n00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.600\nHow do I get rid of it?\n\n394\n00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.620\nI don't want to have to go into the\nproperties and delete all those fields.\n\n395\n00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:52.210\nYou can come over on the review tab,\ngo to protect document, and remove.\n\n396\n00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.280\nDid we do this yet?\n\n397\n00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.780\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think.\n\n398\n00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.470\nOkay, not in this episode, right?\n\n399\n00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.970\nAnd that's where I'm like I'm glad I went\nthrough this and I looked at my notes.\n\n400\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:03.530\nRemove personal information\nfrom this file on save.\n\n401\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:07.360\nOkay, so\nthat way it's gonna take it out and\n\n402\n00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.570\nI will then have it scrubbed, or\nremoved of those document properties.\n\n403\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:18.120\nSo that's kind of a good thing\nto know about of how to remove\n\n404\n00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.020\nthe properties in your document.\n\n405\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.130\nSo, that's a good thing to know.\n\n406\n00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:24.780\nOne last thing.\n\n407\n00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.510\nIf you wanted that prompt\non every time you save,\n\n408\n00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.920\nlike if document properties is important.\n\n409\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.910\nThere is something in your preferences and\nin the save.\n\n410\n00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.510\nRight there, prompt for\ndocument properties.\n\n411\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:43.910\nSo that's something that you might\nwant to turn on if you need it to,\n\n412\n00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.730\nas a reminder, hey, did I do this?\n\n413\n00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.540\nThat is something that\nis in the preferences.\n\n414\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.830\nSo throwing that out there, and\n\n415\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.620\nI think that covers everything that\nwe need in this particular episode\n\n416\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.370\nof Properties and Accessibility.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n417\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.470\nThank you for helping us out here and\nunderstanding more about the value of\n\n418\n00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.570\nthese document properties, as well as the\naccessibility features that's gonna help\n\n419\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:10.030\nus to comply with certain governmental\nrequirements that we may have,\n\n420\n00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.320\nif we deal with those types of\norganizations that require it.\n\n421\n00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.980\nIt is something for us to consider.\n\n422\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.560\nAnd the use of them can\nactually be very efficient\n\n423\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.170\nespecially in organizations that demand\nquick, as well as actually being able to\n\n424\n00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.830\nbe comprehensive in\ngathering the information.\n\n425\n00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:28.750\nThese document properties make\nsearchability much easier in what we see.\n\n426\n00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.771\nIn the accessibility of course,\nmakes it easier for\n\n427\n00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:36.716\nthose people that maybe using it, that do\nhave some particular accessibility reason\n\n428\n00:23:36.716 --> 00:23:40.100\nto actually be able to get\naccess to our documents as well.\n\n429\n00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.150\nIt helps us to comply with that, and\nthat’s gonna be great things for\n\n430\n00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.100\neverybody as it turns out.\n\n431\n00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.620\nWell, there is more to come for\n\n432\n00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:52.520\nWord 2016 Expert Show, but we are gonna\nsave that for another episode.\n\n433\n00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.650\nSo signing off for\nOffice Pro TV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n434\n00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:57.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n435\n00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:58.930\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n436\n00:23:58.930 -->

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:20.782\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and we're\ncontinuing on with our Word 2016 Expert\n\n4\n00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:25.740\nfor Mac show, in particular we're gonna\nbe looking at customizing interfaces.\n\n5\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.790\nThat sounds interesting to me.\n\n6\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.810\nLuckily, we have our customization queen\nin studio with us to show us all about it.\n\n7\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.820\nThe one, the only, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.085\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:37.707\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I am doing well,\n\n10\n00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:42.080\nI always like to think these things\nup just to see what you're gonna do.\n\n11\n00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.933\n&gt;&gt; Between you and Ronnie it's just like,\n\n12\n00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.294\nsometimes he'll say things\nI'm just like [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:46.828\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:48.134\n&gt;&gt; It shows me, I'm just laughing,\n\n15\n00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:48.990\nI'm like yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.376\nSo, but yes we are going to\nbe customizing our interface,\n\n17\n00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:55.778\nhonestly I wasn't really sure\nwhere to put this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:55.778 --> 00:01:00.260\nDo I put it in the advanced episode or\nseries, do I put it in the expert?\n\n19\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.820\nWell it landed in the expert.\n\n20\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.970\nSo we're gonna go ahead and just take\na look at customizing the ribbon.\n\n21\n00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.110\nWe have talked about customizing\nthe Quick Access Toolbar, and\n\n22\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.850\nI believe the Essentials series,\nbut this just goes a little deeper.\n\n23\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.820\nAnd we're also gonna look at some of the\nPreferences that I want to just point out\n\n24\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.920\nto hopefully solve some\nfrustrating issues.\n\n25\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.400\nBecause I've had some issues\nwhere I've opened up Word and\n\n26\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.260\nI'm like why does it look this way?\n\n27\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.960\nI have no idea, you go searching and\nit's like, it's one of those options,\n\n28\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.930\nyou know Justin, it's like it's\nburied way down in the Preferences.\n\n29\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.230\nAnd it's like a check box that's like,\nit's always worded weird.\n\n30\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.380\nWhere it's like if you don't want\nthis to happen, uncheck it, it's so\n\n31\n00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.041\nannoying.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n32\n00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:51.420\nit kinda feels like you need a Rosetta\nStone and maybe like a map or something.\n\n33\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.219\nAll right, so I went four levels deep,\nI'm on the sixth menu.\n\n34\n00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.805\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:56.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I need this rock that weighs exactly\n\n36\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.412\nthe same as this other thing.\n\n37\n00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:01.595\nI gotta switch them, uncheck that box,\nand then we're good to go.\n\n38\n00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:05.880\nSo now, maybe it's hidden\nthere to keep people, right?\n\n39\n00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.960\nYou have to work for it.\n\n40\n00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.450\nSo, maybe that's it, or\nmaybe it's just poor planning.\n\n41\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and unfortunately,\n\n42\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.520\nusually I accidentally hit some crazy\ncombination of keys to set that in motion,\n\n43\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.680\nand you're like, I have no idea\nhow I even made this happen.\n\n44\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.590\nSo, I feel you, I've been there.\n\n45\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.080\nSo I wanna go ahead and\nshow you some of those things.\n\n46\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.598\nSo we're gonna come down and, I just have\na blank document cuz I don't really need\n\n47\n00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:33.900\nany specific document since we're\nreally working on the interface.\n\n48\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.300\nAnd if I've thrown out two words where\nyou're like, I don't know what you're\n\n49\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.170\ntalking about, you should probably\ngo back and look at the Essentials.\n\n50\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.660\nBut we have our ribbon across the top\nwhere we have our different tabs,\n\n51\n00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.460\nour Insert tab, our Layout tab,\nwhich we've been working with a lot.\n\n52\n00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.970\nAnd we do have our Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n53\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.878\nAnd this is the one that I've\nkind of been cluttering up,\n\n54\n00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:54.860\nif you wanna say,\nthroughout these different episodes.\n\n55\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.948\nI think these were the ones\nthat I did with the macros.\n\n56\n00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:00.590\nAnd this was the one where I\nwas doing with the Show Fields,\n\n57\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.840\nall the placeholders, when we were\ndoing the Mail Merge for Mac series.\n\n58\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.490\nSo, got some extra things in here.\n\n59\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.670\nI think I've got some duplicated.\n\n60\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.530\nAll right, so but\nthat's the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n61\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.700\nAnd that is something, might as well\njust go ahead and quickly review that.\n\n62\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.290\nI can go down here to where\nI go to More Commands.\n\n63\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.890\nAnd then I can change things\non the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n64\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.425\nI really do like this cuz there's\none thing that I do a lot in\n\n65\n00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:31.883\nthe one on the PC,\nis taking screenshots and snapshots.\n\n66\n00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:34.721\nI love that, and I don't wanna have to\nkeep going to that particular ribbon\n\n67\n00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:37.080\noption, I just add it right here\non the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n68\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.877\nAnd once I'm in the Quick Access Toolbar,\nyou have over here,\n\n69\n00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:44.495\nwhere do you wanna choose\nyour commands from?\n\n70\n00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:49.224\nAnd sometimes you need to find,\nI don't remember what ribbon it's on, so\n\n71\n00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:51.040\nmaybe do the All Commands.\n\n72\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.350\nOr the ones that like, I know it's not on\nthe ribbon but I know it's a command and\n\n73\n00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.730\nI don't wanna have to keep\ngoing into the menus.\n\n74\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.830\nSo you choose your filter,\nif you want to say,\n\n75\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.530\nfor what commands are going to show on\nthe left hand side, and you add them\n\n76\n00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.020\nover on the right hand side by clicking\nthese buttons and moving them over.\n\n77\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.560\nBut if you ever wanted to remove one,\nyou can come over here, and\n\n78\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.621\nsee I have Remove Header, Remove Footer.\n\n79\n00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:16.721\nThat's what, they look the same but\n\n80\n00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.254\nthey're [LAUGH] actually\ntwo different commands.\n\n81\n00:04:18.254 --> 00:04:22.543\nBut if I wanted to take one out, then you\ncan use your plus and minus signs down\n\n82\n00:04:22.543 --> 00:04:26.930\nhere to go ahead and take them off, or\nuse the button and put it off to the side.\n\n83\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.790\nNow this little wheel guy down here,\nthis is where notice it's saying that if\n\n84\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.170\nyou wanted to reset your\nQuick Access Toolbar, then\n\n85\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.470\nyou can set it that actually the factory\nsettings and then you're going there.\n\n86\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.530\nNow why does it say Quick Access and\nthen All Customizations?\n\n87\n00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.050\nWell because there's two different things.\n\n88\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.240\nThis is kind of a lead-in to how we can\n\n89\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.380\ncustomize a ribbon because\nit's right up here.\n\n90\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.120\nNotice there's Quick Access and Ribbon.\n\n91\n00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.280\nWe could probably figure out\nAll Customizations would be\n\n92\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.550\nboth the Quick Access and\nthe Ribbon, or either one.\n\n93\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.180\nJust the Access, or when we come over\nhere, now that little wheel guy comes to\n\n94\n00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.910\nnow, well now it just goes ahead and\njust goes to All Customize.\n\n95\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.190\n[LAUGH] Only Selected Ribbon Tab,\nthat's why that's grayed out,\n\n96\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.575\ncuz I don't have a ribbon tab selected.\n\n97\n00:05:18.575 --> 00:05:20.890\n[LAUGH] All right, well that makes sense.\n\n98\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.970\nSo anyways, this is just another level of\ninterface customization that you could do.\n\n99\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.940\nLet's cancel this just for\na quick moment so\n\n100\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.400\nI can kinda get us back to why\nyou might want to do this.\n\n101\n00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.080\nThere are commands scattered\nthroughout all of these ribbons and\n\n102\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.810\nall of these menu commands.\n\n103\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.738\nSo if I have to go to Home to get the Bold\nbutton, I have to go to the Insert Tab to\n\n104\n00:05:44.738 --> 00:05:49.377\nget the Insert Picture, I have to go\nto the Mailings to do my Mail Merge.\n\n105\n00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:55.249\nWell if you wanted to, you can make your\nown ribbon, by itself, make its own tab,\n\n106\n00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.982\nput every command that you could ever want\nto do and never leave that one ribbon.\n\n107\n00:06:00.982 --> 00:06:03.045\nThat could be fun, right?\n\n108\n00:06:03.045 --> 00:06:07.113\n[LAUGH] I see Justin's\nface did this weird,\n\n109\n00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:09.810\nwhat is that look?\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure.\n\n110\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.844\nThere's something about having every\ncommand that I could ever want in a single\n\n111\n00:06:13.844 --> 00:06:18.377\nplace, it seems like it might get a little\ncluttered and calls me to go what's that?\n\n112\n00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:19.348\nClick.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:06:19.348 --> 00:06:19.848\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n114\n00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:20.372\nClick.\n\n115\n00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:22.129\nSo that's not my cup of tea,\n\n116\n00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:25.198\nbut maybe it does work for some people.\n&gt;&gt; Well, and\n\n117\n00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:29.862\nI think that's a perfect way to say it,\nbecause if you're going to customize\n\n118\n00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:35.420\nthe things that you commonly use in Word,\nI don't know about you, I use everything.\n\n119\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.910\nAnd I know where they are because of\nwhere they're located on the ribbon.\n\n120\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.060\nSo it's kind of like I'm coming in and\n\n121\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.470\ncustomizing my kitchen and\nputting everything I do into one drawer.\n\n122\n00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.200\nBut then like I keep going to the old\ndrawer of where it all lives.\n\n123\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.082\nIt's like, wait, I forgot.\n\n124\n00:06:50.082 --> 00:06:52.560\nSo it's personal preference.\n\n125\n00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.090\nAnd that's why, I think maybe\nthat's why I put it in the expert.\n\n126\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.664\nBecause once you get to a certain\nlevel of usability in Word,\n\n127\n00:06:59.664 --> 00:07:04.329\nthis might be the next step up\nto increase your productivity,\n\n128\n00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:06.678\nto increase your efficiency.\n\n129\n00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:11.260\nBecause this is something like,\nI just want this all in one place.\n\n130\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.140\nCool.\n\n131\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.930\nBut it takes a lot of time,\n\n132\n00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.300\nI feel it would take a decent\namount of time to set up.\n\n133\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.680\nBut it's one of those hey,\nyou spend 30 minutes planning,\n\n134\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.385\nit's gonna make your life better or,\n[LAUGH] I'm sure there's some\n\n135\n00:07:22.385 --> 00:07:25.382\nsaying right here.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure it goes something like that\n\n136\n00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:27.817\nVonne, I'm not sure if\nthat's the exact one.\n\n137\n00:07:27.817 --> 00:07:28.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:30.000\n&gt;&gt; Planning for 30 minutes is\n\n139\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.530\nan additional 30 minutes you\ncould've been doing something.\n\n140\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.070\nI'm not sure.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.698\n&gt;&gt; We jest, we jest, but, right?\n\n142\n00:07:37.698 --> 00:07:42.219\nPlanning is sometimes appropriate, and\nhaving a plan and then working the plan is\n\n143\n00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:46.872\nimportant for making appropriate progress,\nassuming that you don't over plan and\n\n144\n00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:49.729\ngo into analysis paralysis.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n145\n00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.939\nYeah, so this is for\nyou to choose if you'd like to do it.\n\n146\n00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.743\nSo, let me show you how.\n\n147\n00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:58.835\nNow I had gone to that place\nof where we could customize\n\n148\n00:07:58.835 --> 00:08:01.550\na ribbon from the quick access tool bar.\n\n149\n00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.780\nBut you can also get to it because\nit is part of your preferences.\n\n150\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.850\nSo if you go to Word and\n\n151\n00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.770\ngo to Preferences, you can see there\nis the option right here for ribbon and\n\n152\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.440\ntool bar, and I'm back to the same\nplace that I was just at.\n\n153\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.890\nSo if I have a ribbon, now there's a few\nthings that you do need to kinda set\n\n154\n00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.350\nup before you can start adding\ncommands onto that particular ribbon.\n\n155\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.380\nSo notice down here, and this is where,\n\n156\n00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.060\nif you really wanted to modify existing\nribbons, you could do the same thing.\n\n157\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.237\nSo it goes all which ways,\nbecause here's your home ribbon, and then\n\n158\n00:08:35.237 --> 00:08:41.136\nhere are the different groups that each\none of these commands are going to be in.\n\n159\n00:08:41.136 --> 00:08:46.060\nLet me just come over to home really\nquick, see Clipboard, Font, Paragraph.\n\n160\n00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.842\nSo you do need to know the group names\nto know kind of where they're at.\n\n161\n00:08:49.842 --> 00:08:54.430\nIf I come back over to my Preferences,\nI believe that's also something in\n\n162\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.834\nthe general,\nnow I can't remember where it's at, or\n\n163\n00:08:57.834 --> 00:09:01.740\nyou can actually show\nthat maybe it's the view.\n\n164\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.343\nIt's the group names, right there.\n\n165\n00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:06.510\nSee, Show group titles.\n\n166\n00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.120\nI don't think that's check on by default.\n\n167\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.950\nAgain, back in the essentials, so\nit's probably good to go ahead and\n\n168\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:19.090\ncheck that off first,\nbefore you go into customizing the ribbon.\n\n169\n00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.700\nAll right, but if you didn't know that,\nif you just see if you expand them out,\n\n170\n00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.910\nyou could probably get the idea of,\nthat's where the cut button is.\n\n171\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.030\nYou could take it off\nthe ribbon if you wanted to.\n\n172\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.530\nI'm not sure why you'd want to.\n\n173\n00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.565\nActually, no, you can't,\nyou can't modify existing.\n\n174\n00:09:30.565 --> 00:09:33.270\nOoh, okay, because I think in PC you can.\n\n175\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.937\nYou can actually take stuff off and\nmove everything around.\n\n176\n00:09:35.937 --> 00:09:38.630\nI guess here, you can only add.\n\n177\n00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:43.180\nSo if I wanted to add more commands\ninto the clipboard group, you can.\n\n178\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.300\nIf you wanted to add more into the font,\nyou can.\n\n179\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.116\nAgain, I have mixed opinions on whether\nyou should or should not do that, but\n\n180\n00:09:51.116 --> 00:09:54.022\nit's your Word,\nyou do what you want with it.\n\n181\n00:09:54.022 --> 00:09:58.692\n[LAUGH] If I wanted to add another\nRibbon tab, you gotta come down here,\n\n182\n00:09:58.692 --> 00:10:02.430\noops, sorry,\nI definitely wanna keep the home tab on.\n\n183\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.024\nNotice you can turn on and off ribbons\ntoo, I guess I should point that out.\n\n184\n00:10:06.024 --> 00:10:12.890\nSo if come down here to the plus sign,\nI'm going to add a new tab.\n\n185\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.189\nAnd once I add a new tab, it brings\nup notice that it says, new tab and\n\n186\n00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:18.258\nit says custom.\n\n187\n00:10:18.258 --> 00:10:23.025\nAnd it automatically adds a new\ngroup because you can't add\n\n188\n00:10:23.025 --> 00:10:28.450\ncommands into the ribbon itself,\nit's gotta go into a group.\n\n189\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.900\nOkay, so commands, groups, tabs,\nyou gotta have all of those.\n\n190\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.740\nNow once I have this, if I wanted to\nrename this, I can come into here,\n\n191\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.360\nyou can come up to the wheel button down\nat the bottom and then you can rename.\n\n192\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.615\nSo you have to make sure you are blued or\nselected on that\n\n193\n00:10:47.615 --> 00:10:52.703\nparticular area that you wanna rename,\nand I could name this 1,\n\n194\n00:10:52.703 --> 00:10:57.350\nI wanna all my stuff, and\nI want this group to be named cats.\n\n195\n00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:02.195\nIt doesn't make any sense, but you can\ngo ahead and make your different groups.\n\n196\n00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:05.889\nIf I wanted to add another\ngroup onto this tab,\n\n197\n00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:10.650\nnotice now I have the option of,\nnew tab and new group.\n\n198\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:16.140\nSo let's go ahead and go with a new group,\nand we can rename this, bunnies.\n\n199\n00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:22.600\n[LAUGH] This makes sense,\nno, but you get the idea.\n\n200\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.010\nIf I can go ahead and\ncustomize my ribbon, I can add a new tab,\n\n201\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:32.700\nI can add a new group, and then let's go\nahead and say I'm always using font color.\n\n202\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.790\nLike that's definitely something\nI'm always coming back and using.\n\n203\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.930\nYou find the command over\non the left hand side,\n\n204\n00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.420\nyou make sure that you have a group that\nyou want to be added into selected, and\n\n205\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.570\nthen you just click the little button and\nit moves over.\n\n206\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.860\nAll right, now I'm not gonna go through,\ndo every single one, but maybe I want\n\n207\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:55.030\nshapes to be added into here, but then I\nwant styles to be added into the bunny.\n\n208\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:00.950\nSo I highlight bunnies, click Styles,\nmove it on over, that's looking good.\n\n209\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.809\nI could reorder this if I wanted\nthe Vonne tab to be up at the top,\n\n210\n00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:09.683\nabove, meaning above to\nthe left of the Home tab.\n\n211\n00:12:09.683 --> 00:12:16.991\nYou select the tab, you can then\nmove it up, you just gotta drag it.\n\n212\n00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:19.683\n[LAUGH] I'm like, wait,\nwhere's the bumpy buttons.\n\n213\n00:12:19.683 --> 00:12:22.460\n[LAUGH] Wrong version.\n\n214\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.543\nSo we come up here and\nyou can notice that I drag this up,\n\n215\n00:12:25.543 --> 00:12:28.438\nI can put this back up into right,\nprobably there.\n\n216\n00:12:28.438 --> 00:12:33.396\nWe go ahead and maybe, okay let's go\nahead and collapse these first and\n\n217\n00:12:33.396 --> 00:12:35.640\nthen make that a little easier.\n\n218\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.974\nAnd okay, what, guess what?\n\n219\n00:12:40.974 --> 00:12:42.056\nThat's where it's at.\n\n220\n00:12:42.056 --> 00:12:45.180\n[LAUGH] Can you, no.\n\n221\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.480\nI thought you had little buttons that\nmoves it up and down within here.\n\n222\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:55.200\nSo it looks like you can just go ahead and\ndrag the commands around if you wanted to.\n\n223\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.063\nAll right, so I thought you could change\nthe order of the ribbons, like the tabs.\n\n224\n00:13:00.063 --> 00:13:02.448\nBut I just did it.\n\n225\n00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:06.890\nOkay, I just keep on dragging,\n[LAUGH] until it moves around.\n\n226\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.614\nI don't know if I wanna mess\nanything else up, honestly.\n\n227\n00:13:09.614 --> 00:13:13.742\nJust because I'm having a little\ndifficulty, but you can see,\n\n228\n00:13:13.742 --> 00:13:16.270\ntry dragging, see what moves around.\n\n229\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.175\nIf I click Save, there we go.\n\n230\n00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:23.250\nNow if I close this, there is my ribbon.\n\n231\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.330\nOkay, cool, yeah?\n\n232\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.600\nYou wanna go ahead and fill it on up?\n\n233\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.740\nGo right ahead.\nYou wanna move them around?\n\n234\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.980\nThat's fine too.\n\n235\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.220\nYou wanna move the positions\nof the others ones?\n\n236\n00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.670\nI'm not sure if I'd wanna do that and\n\n237\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.340\nI'm not sure if it would even\nlet me by sort of dragging them.\n\n238\n00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.920\nI could try, but-\n&gt;&gt; This seems to be one of those,\n\n239\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.710\nit's gonna limit you in some capacity.\n\n240\n00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.540\nWell you can do this if it was your\nCustom tab, but in regular it can't.\n\n241\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.860\nAnd I noticed, but then I saw this\noriginally and I was like, there it is,\n\n242\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.590\nand then it disappeared.\n\n243\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.100\nYou had to move it above a bunch of group,\nI couldn't nest it in things.\n\n244\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.616\nIt looks like you have to be\neither after or before, or\n\n245\n00:14:02.616 --> 00:14:07.004\nthere's some kind of limitation\nthere from what it appears to be.\n\n246\n00:14:07.004 --> 00:14:08.658\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I was looking at, see,\n\n247\n00:14:08.658 --> 00:14:09.750\nI'm moving the Home.\n\n248\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.210\nOkay, it looks like I can only\nmove this all the way up.\n\n249\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.770\nI can't put references between Insert and\nokay.\n\n250\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.936\nYeah, so it doesn't look like I'm allowed\nto put them in between each one, but\n\n251\n00:14:25.936 --> 00:14:27.644\nI can put it all the way to the top.\n\n252\n00:14:27.644 --> 00:14:30.038\nSo it's kinda like you have\nto put it up to the top and\n\n253\n00:14:30.038 --> 00:14:32.560\nthen go down.\n&gt;&gt; See, that's one of those,\n\n254\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.990\nsomething I didn't think about,\nlike user interactions appropriately.\n\n255\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.224\nBecause I've seen things like this where\nyou have to think about, all right,\n\n256\n00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.130\nthe last one that I want in the list.\n\n257\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.373\nI need to put that first.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n258\n00:14:42.373 --> 00:14:43.340\n&gt;&gt; What's the next to last one?\n\n259\n00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.500\nI have to put it up there, and so\nyou essentially queue it down into a stack\n\n260\n00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.400\nand then-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n261\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.450\nthat's what it looks\nlike we're doing here.\n\n262\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.359\nMac is always, any of these Office\nproducts for Mac always has\n\n263\n00:14:56.359 --> 00:15:00.929\nthe limitations that it doesn't have\nthe same options as your PC ones.\n\n264\n00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:03.051\nAnd that's why I was looking for\nthe bump buttons,\n\n265\n00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:05.580\ncuz that's what I know how\nit looks like in PC world.\n\n266\n00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.410\nSo, I mean, you are somewhat limited,\nbut it does open up the opportunity for\n\n267\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.150\nyou to customize if you so desire.\n\n268\n00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.840\nThis is one where since I've\nstarted really messing my stuff up,\n\n269\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.330\nguess what I'm going to be doing?\n\n270\n00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.998\nI'm gonna be resetting\nall my customizations,\n\n271\n00:15:19.998 --> 00:15:24.060\n[LAUGH] cuz I'm a little scared\nabout how much I've messed this up.\n\n272\n00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.328\nSo I'm gonna reset everything,\nnotice it's deleting all of my\n\n273\n00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:33.700\nquick access toolbar and my ribbon\nbecause I kinda do want a fresh start.\n\n274\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:40.010\nI'm done, I'm gonna go ahead and say yes,\nand then everything's back to normal.\n\n275\n00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.223\nWe save this, and then Quick Access.\n\n276\n00:15:44.223 --> 00:15:48.301\nThe Quick Access toolbar didn't\nactually change, that's okay.\n\n277\n00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:54.988\nNot that big of a deal, but at least my\ninsert, my layout Vonne is still there.\n\n278\n00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:57.550\nBut I can always come back out and\nchange it.\n\n279\n00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.871\nSo I can come over here to my preferences\nand I can really just go ahead and\n\n280\n00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:02.600\nhide that.\n\n281\n00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.105\nSo it really didn't reset\nthe customizations, did it?\n\n282\n00:16:05.105 --> 00:16:08.925\n[LAUGH] I'm a little confused.\n&gt;&gt; That's a little odd, Vonne,\n\n283\n00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:10.745\ncuz I was like the Vonne tab is gone no,\n\n284\n00:16:10.745 --> 00:16:11.815\nstill there.\n&gt;&gt; Me too,\n\n285\n00:16:11.815 --> 00:16:15.253\nI was like-\n&gt;&gt; Usually, when I think of reset,\n\n286\n00:16:15.253 --> 00:16:18.184\nI don’t know, I’m thinking hard reset.\n\n287\n00:16:18.184 --> 00:16:21.622\nEverything is gone that you’ve customized,\nbut that doesn’t appear to be the case.\n\n288\n00:16:21.622 --> 00:16:22.536\n&gt;&gt; Sure, okay,\n\n289\n00:16:22.536 --> 00:16:27.880\ndelete all ribbon in quick access to allow\ncustomizations for this program, Yes.\n\n290\n00:16:29.827 --> 00:16:31.062\nNow, Save.\n\n291\n00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:33.460\nAnd it's still there.\n\n292\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.880\nOkay, so maybe we should say that\nit might not reset anything and\n\n293\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.520\nyou should just be careful about [LAUGH]\nchanging your customizations, right?\n\n294\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.601\n&gt;&gt; That is weird, right?\n\n295\n00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:52.295\nThat is not intuitive whatsoever.\n&gt;&gt; No, I will say that the regular Home,\n\n296\n00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:54.465\nInsert, Design.\n\n297\n00:16:54.465 --> 00:16:59.950\nThose are your regular\norder of your ribbons.\n\n298\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.060\nSo that's good.\n\n299\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.509\nIt did keep Vonne on.\n\n300\n00:17:04.509 --> 00:17:08.307\nYeah, so a little wonky.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm wondering if\n\n301\n00:17:08.307 --> 00:17:12.982\nwhat they mean by customizations,\ncuz you've moved things, you've reordered.\n\n302\n00:17:12.982 --> 00:17:16.782\nBut the ones that are custom to you,\nthey still exist.\n\n303\n00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:17.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n304\n00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.967\n&gt;&gt; And then if we wanna get rid of Vonne,\n\n305\n00:17:19.967 --> 00:17:22.500\nwe actually have to delete that group,\n\n306\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.925\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n307\n00:17:23.925 --> 00:17:27.562\ncuz I put layout above the Vonne tab.\n\n308\n00:17:27.562 --> 00:17:30.840\nSo that is a definite change\nin how the interface works.\n\n309\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.280\nSo let's try this one more time.\n\n310\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.614\nLet's go back to Preference,\nlet's go to Ribbon.\n\n311\n00:17:34.614 --> 00:17:39.180\nAnd let's go to resetting\nall of our customizations.\n\n312\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.806\nAnd let's watch to see if\nthe layout moves, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:42.806 --> 00:17:47.877\nAnd we will say yes, Reset.\n\n314\n00:17:47.877 --> 00:17:50.740\nAnd I want to reset all of this.\n\n315\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.210\nAnd now it's not [LAUGH]\ngiving me anything.\n\n316\n00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.860\n&gt;&gt; I mean, this doesn't make any sense,\n\n317\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.970\nright?\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't.\n\n318\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.765\nMaybe the moral of the story\nis we shouldn't do this.\n\n319\n00:17:59.765 --> 00:18:04.130\n[LAUGH] That's a little weird.\n\n320\n00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:10.010\nOkay, well, I can go ahead and\nnow I got this.\n\n321\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.550\nOoh, guess what?\n\n322\n00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.465\nIt got angry.\n\n323\n00:18:12.465 --> 00:18:17.010\n[LAUGH]\nOkay, we will click OK.\n\n324\n00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.980\nAnd we will try it again and see.\n\n325\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.458\nY'all get to see that this is what\nwe experienced, too, just like look,\n\n326\n00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:27.150\nit's all back to normal.\n&gt;&gt; You know what it was?\n\n327\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:32.088\nI bet it was a hiccup,\nsoftware hiccup, and then it crashed.\n\n328\n00:18:32.088 --> 00:18:33.925\n&gt;&gt; Phew, cuz I'm like I know this works.\n\n329\n00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:36.559\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne, I probably haven't\n\n330\n00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:39.603\ndone as much customization as you have,\nbut I've done a little bit.\n\n331\n00:18:39.603 --> 00:18:41.850\nI'm like yeah, I need to reset that.\n\n332\n00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.210\nAnd I was like I'm pretty sure\nall of those should reset.\n\n333\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.015\nI'm pretty sure that should be gone.\n\n334\n00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:50.290\nSo part of that is if something\ndoesn't work as you expect it,\n\n335\n00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.690\ntry to reason through it, right?\n\n336\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.350\nWhy is this happening?\n\n337\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.860\nLuckily, you actually\ngot to see it crash and\n\n338\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.330\nthings are not good.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n339\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:03.360\nI think this also brings up\nanother point of it said deleting.\n\n340\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.555\nAnd then it said save and\nnothing happened, did it?\n\n341\n00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:08.044\nWhere I'm like,\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n342\n00:19:08.044 --> 00:19:10.980\nAnd we started doing our\ndeductive reasoning.\n\n343\n00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.844\nIs that maybe where, or just I mean-\n&gt;&gt; I would call it debugging.\n\n344\n00:19:14.844 --> 00:19:16.979\n[LAUGH] I'm like there's something\nwrong here, I had to figure this out.\n\n345\n00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:19.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but this is the tried and true,\n\n346\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.660\nlike did you tried turning it on and\nturning it off again?\n\n347\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.880\nDid you restart the application?\n\n348\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.586\nNo, we didn't restart the application.\n\n349\n00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:30.277\nSo what we did is we sent\nit into this loop of no,\n\n350\n00:19:30.277 --> 00:19:34.559\nremove the customizations since\nit's probably like I already did.\n\n351\n00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:36.156\nWait, wait, I'm trying.\n\n352\n00:19:36.156 --> 00:19:39.300\nAnd then I did it again and\nit just went, peace, I'm out.\n\n353\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.785\nI can't do this anymore.\n\n354\n00:19:40.785 --> 00:19:44.560\nAnd so it shut itself down,\ncuz I've freaked it out so bad.\n\n355\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.996\nAnd then it restarted itself,\nbut then when we restart it.\n\n356\n00:19:47.996 --> 00:19:52.020\nNo Vonne, no Quick Access Toolbars.\n\n357\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.539\nSo it did work, it got stuck.\n\n358\n00:19:54.539 --> 00:19:56.620\nIt just got stuck on itself.\n\n359\n00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.180\nSo if it doesn't work,\ngo ahead and close Word.\n\n360\n00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.116\nRestart Word,\nmaybe even restart your computer.\n\n361\n00:20:05.116 --> 00:20:08.358\nI've had that happen to where I just\nrestarted the computer and then okay,\n\n362\n00:20:08.358 --> 00:20:10.740\nit just magically fixed itself.\n\n363\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.955\nSo yes, try turning it on and turning\nit off again, and then see if it works.\n\n364\n00:20:15.955 --> 00:20:18.696\nAll right, phew, I was getting\na little worried there, Justin.\n\n365\n00:20:18.696 --> 00:20:21.122\nI was like ooh, gosh,\nam I showing them something that doesn't-\n\n366\n00:20:21.122 --> 00:20:21.794\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\n\n367\n00:20:21.794 --> 00:20:24.535\nI'm glad I wasn't on camera,\ncuz I was like breaking cold sweats.\n\n368\n00:20:24.535 --> 00:20:26.105\nI was like I'm not even\nthe one doing this.\n\n369\n00:20:26.105 --> 00:20:27.880\n&gt;&gt; His face was like.\n\n370\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was like I don't\n\n371\n00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.870\nunderstand why this works.\n&gt;&gt; I don't either.\n\n372\n00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.209\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, as far as customizing\n\n373\n00:20:32.209 --> 00:20:34.299\nthe interface,\nwhat else do we have to interact?\n\n374\n00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:36.911\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if we even wanna chance\n\n376\n00:20:36.911 --> 00:20:37.740\nit.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n377\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.620\n&gt;&gt; But I'm just gonna ask anyway.\n\n378\n00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.362\n&gt;&gt; There's a few other things that I do\n\n379\n00:20:41.362 --> 00:20:42.180\nwanna show you.\n\n380\n00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.796\nAnd that is, one that I like to do but\n\n381\n00:20:44.796 --> 00:20:50.139\nI don't go too far into it unless I\nhave to, keyboard shortcuts, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:50.139 --> 00:20:54.740\nI love to customize keyboard\nshortcuts when it works for me.\n\n383\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:59.338\nAgain, I think this is one of those,\nI wouldn't necessarily call it power user.\n\n384\n00:20:59.338 --> 00:21:02.975\nBut you get to a point where like man,\nI just wish I had a shortcut or\n\n385\n00:21:02.975 --> 00:21:04.779\nI don't have a shortcut for this.\n\n386\n00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:06.459\nThis is kind of bleh.\n\n387\n00:21:06.459 --> 00:21:09.407\nIn Word for Windows, for\nPC, it's like you edit and\n\n388\n00:21:09.407 --> 00:21:13.950\nyou're like you edit keyboard shortcuts or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n389\n00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.425\nIn Mac, if you want to customize\nyour keyboard shortcuts,\n\n390\n00:21:17.425 --> 00:21:20.144\nit's actually not at\nthe application level.\n\n391\n00:21:20.144 --> 00:21:25.530\nMeaning, inside of Word, you have\nto go into your System Preferences.\n\n392\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:29.390\nIn the System Preferences,\nyou have to go into your Keyboard.\n\n393\n00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.400\nAnd then, from Keyboard,\nyou go to Shortcuts.\n\n394\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.830\nAnd so this is like your OS,\n\n395\n00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.500\nyour operating system that you're\ngetting into your shortcuts.\n\n396\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:43.120\nBut you can get into your application\nshortcuts, and then you can\n\n397\n00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.420\nadd shortcuts for\nwhatever application you want to use.\n\n398\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.800\nSo [LAUGH] Justin is\ngiving me that look again.\n\n399\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.010\nSo I can go into Word.\n\n400\n00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.568\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I understand this, but\n\n401\n00:21:56.568 --> 00:22:00.910\nit's one of those things where\nthis is way more complicated.\n\n402\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.551\nBut I would say that this would\nactually make you a power user.\n\n403\n00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:05.865\n&gt;&gt; And this is where I've definitely used\n\n404\n00:22:05.865 --> 00:22:08.747\nthis for a lot more for\nmy Adobe products, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:08.747 --> 00:22:13.388\nBecause one of the biggest one of my\nAdobe products is just your regular,\n\n406\n00:22:13.388 --> 00:22:18.360\nI can't remember which one it is but\nwhere you go for your searchlight.\n\n407\n00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.250\nThis one, yeah, Ctrl+space bar.\n\n408\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.846\nCtrl+space bar is a macOS shortcut.\n\n409\n00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:28.700\nBut it's a huge shortcut that I use in\nPhotoshop to toggle to my Zoom tool.\n\n410\n00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:35.347\nAnd so I am trained to do that shortcut\nin Photoshop and it just kills me.\n\n411\n00:22:35.347 --> 00:22:37.226\nWhen I was like no,\nI don't want the spotlight.\n\n412\n00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:40.992\nSo I have to come in and\ncustomize this stuff.\n\n413\n00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:44.111\nSo it does work when you need it to.\n\n414\n00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:49.833\nAnd if you did need to say I really need\nto have this particular shortcut for\n\n415\n00:22:49.833 --> 00:22:55.480\nWord, because it's something I do so\nmuch that I need to do this.\n\n416\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.160\nYou can go ahead and\nprogram your shortcut keyboards.\n\n417\n00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.423\nYou just have to worry about, like you\nare messing with the customization and\n\n418\n00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:04.530\nthe shortcuts that are all assigned.\n\n419\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.970\nSo you do have to be a little\nbit careful about this.\n\n420\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:11.848\nI'm not saying don't do it because I've\ndone it, it's just if you want to.\n\n421\n00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:14.725\nI just wanted to show you where it's at,\n\n422\n00:23:14.725 --> 00:23:18.883\nbecause it's not in the program,\nit is from the PC world.\n\n423\n00:23:18.883 --> 00:23:21.191\nAnd especially,\nif you're coming from a PC world to Mac,\n\n424\n00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:23.380\nthat's where it's like\nwhere is it located?\n\n425\n00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.070\nIt's your System Preferences.\n\n426\n00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.198\nAnd I have a list of shortcut keys.\n\n427\n00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:31.448\nAnd it also tells you about how you\nneed to customize your shortcuts in\n\n428\n00:23:31.448 --> 00:23:32.409\nthe episode notes.\n\n429\n00:23:32.409 --> 00:23:34.890\nSo follow that if you wanna\na little bit more information.\n\n430\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.485\nFew last things that I'd like to show\nyou in the Preferences within Word.\n\n431\n00:23:40.485 --> 00:23:44.093\nSo let's go back in here\nto Word Preferences,\n\n432\n00:23:44.093 --> 00:23:47.708\njust pointing us a few\nout that I find helpful.\n\n433\n00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:52.306\nIn the General, [COUGH] first of all.\n\n434\n00:23:52.306 --> 00:23:54.688\nShowing the file extensions,\nthat's kind of a big thing for me.\n\n435\n00:23:54.688 --> 00:23:58.710\nI like to show file extensions,\nit's just a personal preference of mine.\n\n436\n00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.200\nThe other one, the Office Theme Colors.\n\n437\n00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.550\nIt's something you can do in the PC world,\nwhere you can make things with cool little\n\n438\n00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:09.100\nbackgrounds and it's fun, you can have\nlittle pieces of toast that go through.\n\n439\n00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.590\n[LAUGH] Yeah, cuz everybody wants that.\n\n440\n00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.270\nYou only get Colorful and\nClassic, that's it.\n\n441\n00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.630\nIf I go to Classic it's like OK,\nand then it's all gray.\n\n442\n00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.210\nNothing, that's all you get,\nnothing fancy.\n\n443\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.690\nThey kind of didn't really wanna\nconcentrate on getting fancy here for\n\n444\n00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:26.440\na Word for Mac.\n\n445\n00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.303\nYep, and it does apply for\nall of your Office apps,\n\n446\n00:24:29.303 --> 00:24:33.580\nthat is something with the Office 365,\nso we'll just keep it with that.\n\n447\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.215\nAutomatic Updates, okay,\nthat's Automatic Update Link on Open,\n\n448\n00:24:37.215 --> 00:24:38.860\nthat's something different.\n\n449\n00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.350\nSorry, but\nthat is something you probably wanna do.\n\n450\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.214\nSo choose that,\nShow Measurements of Units in Inches.\n\n451\n00:24:45.214 --> 00:24:46.886\nI didn't know that you\ncan change the units.\n\n452\n00:24:46.886 --> 00:24:51.539\nSo hey, if you're not in good old America\nthat we can't be on [LAUGH] the regular\n\n453\n00:24:51.539 --> 00:24:54.445\nmetric system with everybody\nelse in the world.\n\n454\n00:24:54.445 --> 00:24:56.727\nI know you're a math and science guy so\n\n455\n00:24:56.727 --> 00:24:59.163\nI'm sure you're just like, I know.\n\n456\n00:24:59.163 --> 00:24:59.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n457\n00:24:59.885 --> 00:25:01.901\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it's like it's 3.7 inches,\n\n458\n00:25:01.901 --> 00:25:05.454\nand I'm like, I don't have,\nI can't conceptualize that appropriately.\n\n459\n00:25:05.454 --> 00:25:06.009\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:25:06.009 --> 00:25:07.540\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I deal with it.\n\n461\n00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:12.307\nI deal with it with grace I think.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We willingly face challenges\n\n462\n00:25:12.307 --> 00:25:15.696\nwith optimism,\nthat is one of our values here at ITProTV.\n\n463\n00:25:15.696 --> 00:25:19.747\nAnd we have to tell ourselves\nthat when things like these\n\n464\n00:25:19.747 --> 00:25:22.415\ncustomizations aren't working.\n\n465\n00:25:22.415 --> 00:25:26.080\n[LAUGH] All right, the View tab,\nthis was the one that got me for\n\n466\n00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.620\na while is that like, these,\nShow Non-Printing Characters.\n\n467\n00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.131\nNow we have our Show and Hide button here.\n\n468\n00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:37.594\nAnd I remember this one time when\nI'd open any file in Mac Word, and\n\n469\n00:25:37.594 --> 00:25:39.440\nI would click this button.\n\n470\n00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.410\nI'm like no, turn off,\nand it wouldn't turn off.\n\n471\n00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.850\nI'm like why is it still showing\nme these paragraph marks?\n\n472\n00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.590\nIt's like, what is going on?\n\n473\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.790\nI found in here it had turned\non somehow just this one.\n\n474\n00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.840\nSo even though I was doing the Show, Hide,\n\n475\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.700\nit wasn't toggling it because this\npreference was overriding it.\n\n476\n00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.860\nDrove me crazy, for days on end.\n\n477\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.730\nSo yeah, that's when I said go start\nhunting through your Preferences.\n\n478\n00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.510\nSo that's kind of the big one.\n\n479\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.460\nAlso this Field Codes Instead of Values.\n\n480\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:11.250\nI've had a lot of people tell me I\njust see these squiggly marks and\n\n481\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.440\nall this stuff in here.\n\n482\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.375\nWhy?\nI'm like,\n\n483\n00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:15.330\ngo see if your field codes are on.\n\n484\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.582\nThey're like there it is.\n\n485\n00:26:16.582 --> 00:26:18.184\nSo that can be an interesting one, too.\n\n486\n00:26:18.184 --> 00:26:22.402\nBut notice, I'm not gonna go through\nevery single one of them, but\n\n487\n00:26:22.402 --> 00:26:26.330\njust start looking at,\nhey it's showing the object anchors.\n\n488\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.420\nIt's showing the text boundaries.\n\n489\n00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.030\nThese weird things that might\nhappen visually on your screen,\n\n490\n00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:38.240\nlook in the View preferences and see if\nthere's a check box on here that might\n\n491\n00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.140\nhelp you, or\nat least solve your problem a little bit.\n\n492\n00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:49.844\nThere's a couple of other ones in the,\nthat's a different one, sorry.\n\n493\n00:26:49.844 --> 00:26:53.440\n[LAUGH] I'm looking at my notes and\nI realize I left Advanced in there.\n\n494\n00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.690\nThat's for the Mac, that's for\nthe PC one, that's not in here.\n\n495\n00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.190\nSo but notice you have your editing\noptions of whether you want to have your\n\n496\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.397\nPaste buttons, that's always a good thing.\n\n497\n00:27:03.397 --> 00:27:06.687\nThe Drag and Drop Text Editing,\nthat's where you can select it and\n\n498\n00:27:06.687 --> 00:27:10.120\nthen drag the text around,\nthat can really throw people off.\n\n499\n00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.740\nSo once you understand what\nit does it's very helpful,\n\n500\n00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:18.670\nbut it might mess you up so you can\nalways turn that off in your editing.\n\n501\n00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.022\nAnd then the last one was the, what?\n\n502\n00:27:22.022 --> 00:27:26.982\nThere was one in there, where you could go\n\n503\n00:27:26.982 --> 00:27:31.088\ninto, Okay, right here.\n\n504\n00:27:31.088 --> 00:27:32.193\nEnable Click and Type.\n\n505\n00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:35.060\nI thought this was kind of interesting.\n\n506\n00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.853\nI was always taught that okay, if you want\nto get down lower into a page in Word,\n\n507\n00:27:38.853 --> 00:27:43.110\nyou have to like, Enter, Enter, Enter,\nEnter, Enter, Enter, and then go ahead and\n\n508\n00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.905\nstart typing.\n\n509\n00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:48.790\nBecause you couldn't type past\nwhere the flashing cursor was,\n\n510\n00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.550\nand you couldn't click down in there.\n\n511\n00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.680\nYou can actually like, double-click\nway down here in your document,\n\n512\n00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.970\nand it will allow you to start typing.\n\n513\n00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.210\nAnd I'm like, whoa,\nI didn't know you could do that!\n\n514\n00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.179\nNow, it does make a whole\nbunch of paragraphs.\n\n515\n00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:05.871\nBut I don't know, for\nsome reason I was always forced,\n\n516\n00:28:05.871 --> 00:28:07.660\nthat you had to force the Enter down.\n\n517\n00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.484\nBut no, you could click way down\nin a document, double-click and\n\n518\n00:28:10.484 --> 00:28:11.349\njust start typing.\n\n519\n00:28:11.349 --> 00:28:18.440\nI didn't know that you could do that,\nbut that's what is available there.\n\n520\n00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.620\nAll right, one last one and\nthen we'll wrap this up with the printing.\n\n521\n00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.930\nWith a printing, notice that it has\nthe background colors and images.\n\n522\n00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.850\nI've had people change the page color or\ndo some graphics.\n\n523\n00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.380\nIt's like it's not working,\nwhy is it not doing that?\n\n524\n00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.640\nAnd notice you could turn that on.\n\n525\n00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.310\nThe other thing about updating fields and\nupdating links, if you're printing it and\n\n526\n00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.800\nyou're, fields meaning like\nyour Table of Contents or\n\n527\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.410\nanything that we've used with fields.\n\n528\n00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.200\nIt's like, hey, before I print just go\nahead and run an update on all of them so\n\n529\n00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.060\nI have the most recent version.\n\n530\n00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.450\nWe did this for our captions and\n\n531\n00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:58.170\nour figure numbers, all of those\nthings throughout this episode.\n\n532\n00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.970\nSo that might be something\nthat you want to turn on.\n\n533\n00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:05.480\nI don't know why you'd want to print\nfield code, but you could, right?\n\n534\n00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.380\nSo there's some different options there\nin your printing that you could do for\n\n535\n00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.620\nyour preferences.\n\n536\n00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:16.370\nVery specific and very minute, but\nI at least wanted to run through them,\n\n537\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:20.610\nshow ones that I found worth\nat least pointing out to you.\n\n538\n00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.520\nAnd that was a customization episode,\nphew.\n\n539\n00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.616\nThat was a rough one there Justin.\n\n540\n00:29:23.616 --> 00:29:25.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what Vonne,\n\n541\n00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.730\nwe did have a little bit of a bumpy\nride there for a little bit.\n\n542\n00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:32.770\nBut what's important is if you go to\ncustomize, essentially make it your own,\n\n543\n00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.800\nyou're going to encounter\nthings like that, right?\n\n544\n00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.180\nWe know where to go find things,\nhey I wanna reset this, it didn't reset.\n\n545\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.860\nI'm gonna reset it again.\n\n546\n00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.020\nDidn't reset again, crash.\n\n547\n00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.080\nNow it's resetted.\n\n548\n00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.890\nSo I mean, it's one of those things\nthat's gonna happen, but that point,\n\n549\n00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.592\nthat Click and Type,\nthis entire episode was worth that.\n\n550\n00:29:51.592 --> 00:29:52.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n551\n00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.866\n&gt;&gt; And just, I was like, you can do that?\n\n552\n00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:56.430\nI didn't know you could do that, so-\n&gt;&gt; I didn't either!\n\n553\n00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.600\n&gt;&gt; You taught me something and\n\n554\n00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.640\nthank you so much for that.\n\n555\n00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.430\nAnd thank you for joining us, but\nwe are unfortunately out of time for\n\n556\n00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:02.067\nthis episode.\n\n557\n00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:03.800\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n558\n00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.630\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n559\n00:30:06.630 -->

another\nexciting episode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:18.670\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\nwe're continuing on with Word 2016 for\n\n5\n00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.780\nMac, our expert edition.\n\n6\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.660\nAnd well, in this episode, we're gonna\nbe talking about forms and luckily,\n\n7\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.620\nwe have our resident expert on hand today\nto help us out with that, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.316\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:31.854\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:32.840\nHow are you?\n\n11\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.250\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n12\n00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.110\nForms, you love them you hate them, right?\n\n13\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.725\nYeah, and\nI'm not sure this is the place to do them.\n\n14\n00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:43.800\n[LAUGH] So you're like,\nwhy are you going to show us?\n\n15\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.710\nWell, because you can.\n\n16\n00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.490\nYou can create forms in Word.\n\n17\n00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.140\nThere is nothing wrong with them.\n\n18\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.113\nAre there other places and\n\n19\n00:00:53.113 --> 00:00:56.839\nother applications to do\nthem a little bit better?\n\n20\n00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.358\nPossibly.\n\n21\n00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:01.441\nI always go to, well, if I'm gonna\ndo a form you're probably collecting\n\n22\n00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.681\ninformation, if you're\ncollecting information,\n\n23\n00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.940\nyou're gonna probably want to have all\nthat information stored somewhere.\n\n24\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.580\nSo I usually take it to the next level,\nand Word doesn't do all of that stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.170\nBut if, maybe it's internally.\n\n26\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.930\nYou have something that you're always\ngoing at, and wouldn't it be cool for\n\n27\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.780\nyou to click on a dropdown and\nchoose an option?\n\n28\n00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.579\nCheck a little box off for yes,\nno, maybe so, or whatever.\n\n29\n00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.151\nSo there a definite reasons why you might\nwant to create a forum for yourself for\n\n30\n00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:38.248\nother people, and maybe especially if it's\nWord, you might be printing those out.\n\n31\n00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:41.447\nYou're gonna take a survey, and\nyou want people to send it back to you and\n\n32\n00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:42.557\nthen you print them out.\n\n33\n00:01:42.557 --> 00:01:46.860\nI don't know, but it doesn't go beyond\nthe whole collection of information.\n\n34\n00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.850\nCuz me working in Web, Web form, you're\ngonna want the information stored in\n\n35\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.920\na database so you can go ahead and\ncollect all that, right?\n\n36\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI wanna know in database number one so\n\n37\n00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.409\nI can write easy analytics.\n\n38\n00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.096\nAnd when I say database,\nmaybe it's even a spreadsheet like a-\n\n39\n00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:02.306\n&gt;&gt; A collection of data somewhere.\n\n40\n00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:05.524\n&gt;&gt; A collection of data somewhere\nthat I can do transformations and\n\n41\n00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:09.050\ngather some kind of statistics on or\nsome kind of intelligence.\n\n42\n00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n43\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.777\nI don't want to be rifling\nthrough physical forms,\n\n44\n00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:15.390\nif I can [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n45\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.580\nWell, yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.900\nThat's the only way word does this.\n\n47\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.890\nSo connection to another place.\n\n48\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.400\nDon't think of it that way, but again.\n\n49\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.300\nLike I said, for personal use,\nthere are reasons for it.\n\n50\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.250\nNow s,o I've already kind of\npoo-pooed on the forums already,\n\n51\n00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.830\nthen I was like, okay, well guess what?\n\n52\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.090\nIf you're using Word for Mac,\nyou don't have near the capabilities\n\n53\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.220\nof creating form fields the way\nthat you have forms in Word for PC.\n\n54\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.700\nSo there's your next limitation for\nlike, well, I don't really have\n\n55\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.620\nhalf the options that the PC version has,\nbut you can still do it.\n\n56\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.670\nSo don't get discouraged,\ndon't stop the recording and say, well,\n\n57\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.310\nI'm not going to do this anymore.\n\n58\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.350\nIf this is something\nyou need to know about,\n\n59\n00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.716\nI will show you how to do it,\nand it does work, and\n\n60\n00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:07.420\nit can work within your workflow\nif it matches what you need, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.485\nSo let's start here.\n\n62\n00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:13.719\nI'm gonna start with the Word for\nMac cause that's, guess what,\n\n63\n00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.090\nthat's a we're doing Justin.\n\n64\n00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.620\nSo if you're gonna make forms in Word for\nMac, there is\n\n65\n00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.580\nsomething you definitely need to have and\nthat is the developer tab on the ribbon.\n\n66\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.570\nI don't see one.\n\n67\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.633\nYeah, they don't have it on by default,\nokay?\n\n68\n00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.500\nSo that's something that\nyou need to go and do.\n\n69\n00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.340\nIf you go into your preferences,\n\n70\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.535\nand we just said about customization,\nthat was quite painful.\n\n71\n00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:37.320\n[LAUGH] And\na little bit of roller coaster.\n\n72\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.140\nBut if I come over here to our ribbon, and\n\n73\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.570\nthere's our checkbox right there for\ndeveloper, that's gotta be on.\n\n74\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.250\nSo that's something that you need to have\non before you start doing any of this.\n\n75\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.050\nWe do this in the macros episode too.\n\n76\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.770\nSo once you come into our developer,\nright in here,\n\n77\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.200\nthis is where you have your form fields.\n\n78\n00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.610\nNow, notice they call\nthem legacy controls.\n\n79\n00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.220\nAnything when you see legacy, you're\nlike starting to talk about old stuff.\n\n80\n00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.900\nYeah, kind of, it's still there.\n\n81\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.439\nI don't like to assume but I'm probably\nam going to go ahead and do it anyways.\n\n82\n00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.003\n[LAUGH] And say that you filled out\nsome type of form on a website,\n\n83\n00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:21.903\nwell, I should go ahead and\nget into office ProTV.\n\n84\n00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:24.794\nSo you have like what's your name,\nand you type in and\n\n85\n00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:26.728\nthen like what is your preference.\n\n86\n00:04:26.728 --> 00:04:28.134\nThere's a dropdown.\n\n87\n00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.750\nThere is a checkbox.\n\n88\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.860\nSo those are the three, look,\ntextbox, checkbox and a dropdown.\n\n89\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.250\nThat's all you get.\n\n90\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.761\nYou don't have any other form fields.\n\n91\n00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.359\nYou don't have radio buttons.\n\n92\n00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.690\nYou don't have repeating regions.\n\n93\n00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.940\nI mean there's just certain things\nthat just doesn't let you do.\n\n94\n00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.542\nNow I just wanted to throw,\n\n95\n00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:51.896\njust as a comparison because\nI have two users on this Mac.\n\n96\n00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:56.831\nI'm going to flip over to,\nMy other user account, and\n\n97\n00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:01.091\nI already pulled up my virtual machine,\non my Mac.\n\n98\n00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:04.217\nThis is PC, this is our Windows.\n\n99\n00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:05.610\nLook at all of them right here.\n\n100\n00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.940\nYou've got all these little buttons,\nand you can drop this down.\n\n101\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.550\nYou got all these cool things.\n\n102\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.900\nYou've got this cool repeating region.\n\n103\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.651\nIt's got this date picker.\n\n104\n00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:18.933\nThere's a lot of neat things that\nyou can have in the PC Word,\n\n105\n00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:24.434\nthat repeating section content control,\npretty neat stuff.\n\n106\n00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:24.980\nAll right.\n\n107\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.950\nSo guess what, sorry guys,\nyou don't have it in our, what are we?\n\n108\n00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:31.460\nMac.\n\n109\n00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.030\nOkay.\n\n110\n00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.450\nSo let's go ahead and switch back on over,\nand let me log in really quick.\n\n111\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.030\nOkay, come back in here.\n\n112\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.490\nSo just know you're already\nslightly limited in this.\n\n113\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.770\nI'm going to open up a file that\nwe're going to start our little\n\n114\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.270\nform that I'd like to do because this\nis something, again, more internally.\n\n115\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.480\nI'm always gonna have to type in\nthe type of customer that we have.\n\n116\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.390\nI'm always gonna have to say if whether\nthey're a new or repeating or returning.\n\n117\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.390\nThat's something I could have cute\nlittle check boxes for, right.\n\n118\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.230\nMaybe I need to have little form fields\nhere, where it's only gonna be like.\n\n119\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.640\nThey're only gonna have one department,\none item, number of items.\n\n120\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.080\nAnd maybe the department,\nthere's only so many departments.\n\n121\n00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.190\nWouldn't it be cool to just drop it down?\n\n122\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.282\nIt can make it faster for you.\n\n123\n00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:25.870\nSo this is, again,\ninternal forms that could be fun.\n\n124\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.967\nDon't have a date picker so\nI can't do that fun little date picker.\n\n125\n00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:32.980\nI can answer the current date.\n\n126\n00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.460\nAgain, not necessarily for the forms, but\n\n127\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.130\nI could go ahead and\ninsert the current date and time.\n\n128\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.800\nThat might be neat.\n\n129\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.480\nSo maybe, I'll go ahead and\nput it as this particular format.\n\n130\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.160\nAnd that's one thing that's gonna update\nautomatically every time the date changes.\n\n131\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.350\nSo tomorrow, it will be the 10th and the\nnext day will be the 11th and so forth.\n\n132\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.940\nSo if I wanted to put in\na text field right here,\n\n133\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.930\nokay, I wanna be able\nto type in something.\n\n134\n00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.890\nYou come over to developer.\n\n135\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.530\nYou're gonna put your cursor where\nyou want that item to go to.\n\n136\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.900\nThat's something we've always been doing.\n\n137\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.260\nWe turn on text box.\n\n138\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.820\nIt just puts these little [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.675\nJustin is so impressed right now.\n\n140\n00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:17.796\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what it blew my mind.\n\n141\n00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:20.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just astounded.\n\n142\n00:07:20.382 --> 00:07:25.810\n&gt;&gt; As a fellow web designer,\nnot nearly the same way that you are.\n\n143\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.090\nYou can go super crazy with text boxes and\n\n144\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.950\neverything when you're doing for\nweb-based stuff.\n\n145\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.370\nSo it's like, hm, that's all you get.\n\n146\n00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:39.140\nAnd the thing with a text book is,\nany form field is gonna have properties.\n\n147\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.359\n&gt;&gt; So how do you get into that Properties?\n\n148\n00:07:41.359 --> 00:07:42.893\nYou need to select this.\n\n149\n00:07:42.893 --> 00:07:46.116\nYou can right click if you want to,\nand go to Properties.\n\n150\n00:07:46.116 --> 00:07:48.877\nThere's also this Options\nbutton up at the top, and\n\n151\n00:07:48.877 --> 00:07:52.892\nwhichever way you wanna go ahead and\nget into, it's gonna say, all right,\n\n152\n00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:55.876\nwell what do you wanna do with\nthis particular text box?\n\n153\n00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:58.596\nSo notice this is,\ndo I want this to be a number?\n\n154\n00:07:58.596 --> 00:07:59.644\nDo I want this to be a date?\n\n155\n00:07:59.644 --> 00:08:02.524\nDo I want this to be a current,\ncurrent date, look at that.\n\n156\n00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.558\nPlus is the same thing I just\ndid right there, so it's fine.\n\n157\n00:08:04.558 --> 00:08:11.556\n[LAUGH] But I could go ahead and choose\nwhat type of field that I want this to be.\n\n158\n00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:13.623\nAnd also notice that you can do this.\n\n159\n00:08:13.623 --> 00:08:15.440\nYou could do a calculation field.\n\n160\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.959\nSo you could have two numbers, and\nthen you want to add it up together.\n\n161\n00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:25.120\nI'm not gonna get that crazy in this\nparticular example, but you can do this.\n\n162\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.560\nI could choose that this is a number,\nmake another field,\n\n163\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.750\nmake that a number,\ncalculate them on entry.\n\n164\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.930\nSee, calculate on exit?\n\n165\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.940\nSo it does have that capabilities.\n\n166\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.214\nBut we're just gonna stick with just\nthe regular text for right now.\n\n167\n00:08:40.214 --> 00:08:44.862\nThe default text is what you\nwould want to show up in\n\n168\n00:08:44.862 --> 00:08:49.740\nthat little box of type here or\ninsert name here.\n\n169\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.880\nAny of those things you want to\nshow as a place holder values.\n\n170\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.960\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nsay Default Text.\n\n171\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.694\nYou can see it when it's done.\n\n172\n00:09:00.694 --> 00:09:01.960\nThe other thing, what about this?\n\n173\n00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.210\nMaximum Length.\n\n174\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.240\nThat could be kinda cool.\n\n175\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.440\nWhat if I'm using this\nas a zip code field, and\n\n176\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.670\nI can't do more than five characters?\n\n177\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.300\nThat could be something that you could\nlimit the length of what's in there.\n\n178\n00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.140\nIt's not going to,\nthis has to be a valid zip code.\n\n179\n00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.320\nSo it doesn't get into validation and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n180\n00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.900\nBut it is nice that you could at\nleast go ahead and check your length.\n\n181\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.680\nAnd then, the format.\n\n182\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.960\nDo you want to be uppercase or lowercase.\n\n183\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.180\nAnd I believe if you change\nthis to Number, yes.\n\n184\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.302\nHe knows what the number.\n\n185\n00:09:33.302 --> 00:09:37.400\nMaybe you want it to be in with\nthe dollar signs and everything.\n\n186\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.140\nSo you can change this format\nbased on what you want it to be.\n\n187\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.110\nSo that's kind of nice that\nyou could go ahead and\n\n188\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.590\ngo through that with these\ndifferent form field.\n\n189\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.190\nSo can be as creative as you need to be.\n\n190\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.710\nI'm just kinda showing you where is at.\n\n191\n00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.220\nAnd everything out.\n\n192\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.520\nYou could go ahead and\nhave macros to run on this.\n\n193\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.273\nAgain, goes a little to far.\n\n194\n00:10:00.273 --> 00:10:02.386\nJustin is making faces, again.\n\n195\n00:10:02.386 --> 00:10:04.823\nAnd I'm okay with this.\n\n196\n00:10:04.823 --> 00:10:06.171\nWait.\nLet's just go ahead and\n\n197\n00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:08.829\nsay default again so\nyou can see that and then we click OK.\n\n198\n00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:10.820\nAnd then there you go.\n\n199\n00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.249\nThat's all it looks like if I turn\noff this field just you can see it,\n\n200\n00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:17.130\nit's just looks like that.\n\n201\n00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.837\nNow before getting any further and\ngo to the other fields,\n\n202\n00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:25.526\nI do wanna just clarify right now,\nit's like you are not going to be able to\n\n203\n00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:29.350\nfill out this form until you go ahead and\nprotect the form.\n\n204\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:34.101\nIt's like, you're still in the designing\nof it to be able to make it usable,\n\n205\n00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.501\nyou got to protect it.\n\n206\n00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:37.483\nWe'll come back around that in a minute.\n\n207\n00:10:37.483 --> 00:10:40.002\nSo how about some checkboxes, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:40.002 --> 00:10:42.835\nI wanna put in a checkbox.\n\n209\n00:10:42.835 --> 00:10:45.738\nI'm gonna put it after\nthe after instead of before.\n\n210\n00:10:45.738 --> 00:10:47.675\nNew, and then you click the checkbox.\n\n211\n00:10:47.675 --> 00:10:49.163\nThere you go.\n\n212\n00:10:49.163 --> 00:10:50.277\nThere's my checkbox.\n\n213\n00:10:50.277 --> 00:10:53.161\nYou can go into once I select it.\n\n214\n00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:55.650\nYou can go into the options.\n\n215\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.060\nDo you want it to be\nautomatically checked?\n\n216\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.341\nDo you want,\nthere's not really much besides this.\n\n217\n00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:02.810\nIt's just like checked or not checked.\n\n218\n00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.976\nI'll keep it not checked.\n\n219\n00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:08.310\nAnd then if you want another one,\nput your cursor where you want, oops.\n\n220\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:13.076\nLet's not put the, there we go,\ncheckbox and checkbox.\n\n221\n00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:16.040\nCool, maybe I want a department.\n\n222\n00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.910\nThis is where I want to\nchoose from my options.\n\n223\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:26.525\nI wanna only choose from accessories,\nand human resources, and what have you?\n\n224\n00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:29.610\nPress where you want,\nclick on the drop down.\n\n225\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.779\nYou gotta go ahead and go into\nthe properties of that drop down, and\n\n226\n00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:35.799\nthen you gotta add your option.\n\n227\n00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.811\nSo in the drop down I will go ahead and\nput in caps,\n\n228\n00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:41.700\neven though I said accessories.\n\n229\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.080\nWe will go ahead and do bunnies.\n\n230\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.890\nAll right, Justin, give me something.\n\n231\n00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.085\nWhat other department should we have?\n\n232\n00:11:47.085 --> 00:11:47.715\n&gt;&gt; Tacos.\n\n233\n00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:52.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so cuz perfect.\n\n234\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.587\nAny other one.\n\n235\n00:11:54.587 --> 00:11:55.202\n&gt;&gt; Bacon.\n\n236\n00:11:55.202 --> 00:11:57.192\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like it.\n\n237\n00:11:57.192 --> 00:12:00.958\nAll right, so you can see I've got our\ndifferent departments that we have.\n\n238\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.050\nI could go ahead, you know what?\n\n239\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.610\nBacon needs to be put up to the top.\n\n240\n00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.760\nSo you can change the order of\nthem with your bumpy buttons.\n\n241\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.790\nOr maybe I'm not supposed\nto have bunnies in there.\n\n242\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.890\nI could click the minus sign.\n\n243\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.390\nWe have to have bunnies in there.\n\n244\n00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.870\nSo we're gonna change that.\n\n245\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.510\nSo you just go ahead and\nadd all your items, and we will click OK.\n\n246\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.399\nLooks good,\nstill doesn't look like a drop down.\n\n247\n00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:22.100\nBut, again,\nwe're still in the designing phase.\n\n248\n00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.440\nAnd then we can keep on moving,\nI can put in a text box here, and\n\n249\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.260\nI can put a text box here.\n\n250\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.289\nMaybe go ahead and make this\nproperties a number, because why not.\n\n251\n00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:33.490\nThat would be fun.\n\n252\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.720\nAnd we click OK, great.\n\n253\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.740\nSo go through and you make your fields,\nyou go ahead and design your form,\n\n254\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.000\nlooking good,\nyou gotta go ahead and protect it.\n\n255\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.120\nNow before we get to far, I'm gonna do\na save as cuz I wanna keep moving forward,\n\n256\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.820\nbut I don't wanna mess up this file for\nyou guys.\n\n257\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.240\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and say show.\n\n258\n00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.610\nAnd I'm gonna put this on my regular\ndesktop so I can delete it afterwards.\n\n259\n00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.130\nSo now I'm good, I'm ready to go.\n\n260\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.900\nWhat do I want to do?\n\n261\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.835\nI need to protect it.\n\n262\n00:13:06.835 --> 00:13:10.310\nSo when I click this protection, click OK.\n\n263\n00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.630\nWhat did it do?\n\n264\n00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.046\nIt protected it, okay?\n\n265\n00:13:13.046 --> 00:13:17.425\n[LAUGH] So now for the biggest one like\nnotice the bacon you see that little drop\n\n266\n00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:20.173\ndown button now,\nyou go ahead and choose this.\n\n267\n00:13:20.173 --> 00:13:20.951\nWell, you're gonna go ahead.\n\n268\n00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:21.822\nThere you go.\n\n269\n00:13:21.822 --> 00:13:25.790\nWe're going to choose this drop down and\nthen we are gonna click on Cats.\n\n270\n00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:31.860\nAnd if I check this box off and I check\nthat box off, I can also turn them off.\n\n271\n00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.980\nSo just a quick little way that we can\ndo our forms notice I can go ahead and\n\n272\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.010\nI can still put text in\nthat number of items.\n\n273\n00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.950\nBut it doesn't actually accept the text.\n\n274\n00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.960\nSo you do need to say,\nno this is going to be.\n\n275\n00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.050\nOkay, there we go.\n\n276\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.829\nSo now I can go ahead and\nput in numbers here.\n\n277\n00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:59.911\nI could just go ahead and\nsay Fluffy Bunny.\n\n278\n00:13:59.911 --> 00:14:01.510\nCuz that's a type of customer.\n\n279\n00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.376\nWe're just making it up.\n\n280\n00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:05.320\n[LAUGH] So\nnice to see that we can do this.\n\n281\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.930\nThe shading that's on, notice,\nthat's where the gray is on and off.\n\n282\n00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.623\nAnd so then we can go ahead and\nfill in your form.\n\n283\n00:14:14.623 --> 00:14:15.460\nAnd that's it.\n\n284\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.334\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, I do have a quick question.\n\n285\n00:14:17.334 --> 00:14:18.670\nI think I missed it.\n\n286\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.330\nThe number of items,\nthat was a number type field.\n\n287\n00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.780\nYou said I could type text in there.\n\n288\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.542\nBut does it provide\nvalidation based on a number?\n\n289\n00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:29.292\nDid I miss something there?\n\n290\n00:14:29.292 --> 00:14:32.246\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I know where you're talking about,\nthe validation rules of forms and\n\n291\n00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:33.112\nanything like that.\n\n292\n00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:34.550\nBut it just stopped.\n\n293\n00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:39.200\nIt just said if I came in here and\ntyped in Justin, right?\n\n294\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.851\nAnd I come back over here,\ndo you notice I just It says, nope,\n\n295\n00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:46.440\nI can only accept numbers,\nand so it went to zero.\n\n296\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.620\nSo it just doesn't compute that way,\n\n297\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.540\nbecause I limited it to only being\nnumbers, so you have to have a number.\n\n298\n00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.140\n&gt;&gt; So\nto some extent it's enforcing the type.\n\n299\n00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.916\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n300\n00:14:57.916 --> 00:15:00.670\n&gt;&gt; But it's not providing a great\ndeal of feedback of what's going on.\n\n301\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.090\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n302\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:06.546\n&gt;&gt; Furthermore that field being outlined\nbut only taking up only part of that box,\n\n303\n00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:09.750\nis there anyway we can change that,\nor is that like form?\n\n304\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:15.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] it just kind of,\nthat's just what we've got basically.\n\n305\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:21.096\nIt's one of those weird things, come\non I'm trying to select you, that you.\n\n306\n00:15:21.096 --> 00:15:24.400\nIt's cuz I've turned on\nthe protection that's why.\n\n307\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:30.380\nSo notice that I don't really have an\noption to change the length of everything.\n\n308\n00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:36.668\nYeah, again, a little strange\nthat this is what it does.\n\n309\n00:15:36.668 --> 00:15:42.624\nFrom what I know of, I don't know of\nany other way to make that bigger.\n\n310\n00:15:42.624 --> 00:15:44.776\nSo, yeah, a little weird.\n\n311\n00:15:44.776 --> 00:15:50.057\nLike I said, is this the best solution for\nyou to create a form?\n\n312\n00:15:50.057 --> 00:15:51.376\nIt just depends on where you're at.\n\n313\n00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:56.932\nBut if it can help you be more efficient\nfor yourself That could be kind of cool.\n\n314\n00:15:56.932 --> 00:16:04.881\nSo that's, yeah it does have some\nsignificant limitations to what it does.\n\n315\n00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:09.628\nAnd because you also kind\nof work in forms this is\n\n316\n00:16:09.628 --> 00:16:14.860\nprobably like, nope,\nthis isn't working for me.\n\n317\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:19.214\nSo I hear you, I feel you and\nI know what's up,\n\n318\n00:16:19.214 --> 00:16:22.582\n[LAUGH] but that's how it is in Word.\n\n319\n00:16:22.582 --> 00:16:27.178\nSo a few more things,\nwhat I wanted to do was\n\n320\n00:16:27.178 --> 00:16:31.790\nprotect the form again, fill it back out.\n\n321\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.686\nSo I could delete all the content of it.\n\n322\n00:16:34.686 --> 00:16:38.830\nLet's come back in here,\nI'm gonna turn the protection off.\n\n323\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.330\nI know the protection is off\nbecause I can see all the buttons.\n\n324\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.434\nI'll put the shading on just for fun.\n\n325\n00:16:44.434 --> 00:16:49.614\nNow, the thing is like this is like,\nokay, great I have this, this form.\n\n326\n00:16:49.614 --> 00:16:53.524\nThis whole restricting the editing,\nbecause if I sent this to you,\n\n327\n00:16:53.524 --> 00:16:58.187\ncuz another part of this is I don't really\nwant you as the form fill outer to be able\n\n328\n00:16:58.187 --> 00:16:59.441\nto change this text.\n\n329\n00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:02.350\nSo number or whatever.\n\n330\n00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.832\nNo, I don't want you to do that.\n\n331\n00:17:03.832 --> 00:17:07.053\nSo when you're protecting the form, yes,\n\n332\n00:17:07.053 --> 00:17:12.024\nyou can fill it out and two,\nyou can't change any of the other text.\n\n333\n00:17:12.024 --> 00:17:16.420\nWell, if I just sent this to you with\nthe protection on guess what you could do?\n\n334\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.800\nOpen it up and turn it off.\n\n335\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.405\n&gt;&gt; Turn the protection off.\n\n336\n00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.046\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n337\n00:17:20.046 --> 00:17:23.121\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I would call that\nprotection, so much as an annoyance.\n\n338\n00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:27.387\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now this is where you can actually\nmake it to where you can't turn this off.\n\n339\n00:17:27.387 --> 00:17:30.180\nAnd we talked about this in\nthe document security episodes.\n\n340\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.290\nSo this ties all in together.\n\n341\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.960\nYeah, you click this, but\nit's very easily turned off.\n\n342\n00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.010\nWhen you really want to protect this\nform and had it password protected.\n\n343\n00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.004\nSo that way, when I do send it to you,\nyou try to turn it off.\n\n344\n00:17:44.004 --> 00:17:46.505\nIt's going to be like, tell me what the\npassword is before you can turn it off.\n\n345\n00:17:46.505 --> 00:17:48.926\nWould that be a little bit better for you?\n\n346\n00:17:48.926 --> 00:17:52.631\n&gt;&gt; I think if you're gonna use something\nlike this, and there are valid use case,\n\n347\n00:17:52.631 --> 00:17:53.857\nmaybe you only have Word.\n\n348\n00:17:53.857 --> 00:17:57.692\nThen you want to keep that because\notherwise people may mess with you,\n\n349\n00:17:57.692 --> 00:18:02.126\nhijack certain form fields and\nyou're like number, number of customers?\n\n350\n00:18:02.126 --> 00:18:05.013\nWell, okay,\nI guess we have seven customers.\n\n351\n00:18:05.013 --> 00:18:06.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n352\n00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.178\n&gt;&gt; Which could cause some issues as far as\nthe reliability of the data you collected.\n\n353\n00:18:10.178 --> 00:18:14.854\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so the real protection\nis gonna be on the Review tab and\n\n354\n00:18:14.854 --> 00:18:16.910\nthe Protect Document.\n\n355\n00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:22.037\nAgain, more of that document security,\nit's right here Protect document for.\n\n356\n00:18:22.037 --> 00:18:27.960\nAnd you only want them to be able to do\nthe forms and then you put on a password.\n\n357\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.452\nI type in apple.\n\n358\n00:18:29.452 --> 00:18:31.540\nThat's always my password for everything.\n\n359\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.970\nAnd I click OK, oops gotta do it again.\n\n360\n00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:36.737\nThere we go.\n\n361\n00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:42.700\nNow, if I'm here, notice that I don't,\nit actually protects all the document.\n\n362\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.407\nI can't do this.\n\n363\n00:18:43.407 --> 00:18:48.117\nIf I try to select this text and\nno, no, come here and then,\n\n364\n00:18:48.117 --> 00:18:50.820\nsee, it's not gonna let me.\n\n365\n00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.950\nSo it's protecting everything.\n\n366\n00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.879\nAnd then I can come in here,\nand type in my name.\n\n367\n00:18:56.879 --> 00:19:01.200\nI'm a repeating customer,\nI like Bunnies, and this is my item.\n\n368\n00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.520\nIt's gonna be Fluffy, and\nthe number of items is 4, okay.\n\n369\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.340\nSo you can see how this could be\nif you're doing this all day long,\n\n370\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.100\nyou make something like this and\nboom, boom, boom.\n\n371\n00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.690\nIt's great.\n\n372\n00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.781\nI send it to you.\n\n373\n00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:15.481\nYou use it, because that's where and\nthen, you save it and store it and\n\n374\n00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:16.381\neverything like that.\n\n375\n00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:20.635\nBut if you try to click this, I want,\nwell if you don't have the password,\n\n376\n00:19:20.635 --> 00:19:22.250\nyou're not getting in.\n\n377\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.601\nSo that really does do\nyour full protection.\n\n378\n00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:29.227\nThe other thing is that whole,\nhey, you do this everyday and\n\n379\n00:19:29.227 --> 00:19:30.369\nyou need to fill this out.\n\n380\n00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:35.017\nThink about you fill them out when\nyou're doing invoices or what have you.\n\n381\n00:19:35.017 --> 00:19:39.494\nNow, you just have a digital version\nof it, which could be pretty cool.\n\n382\n00:19:39.494 --> 00:19:42.869\nWell, the other thing you\nwould want to do with this,\n\n383\n00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:47.228\nyou'd probably wanna be able to have\na clean copy every single time.\n\n384\n00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.990\nSo you could go ahead and\nchange this when you need it.\n\n385\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.160\nWell, then that gets into\nmaking this a template.\n\n386\n00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.800\nSo I would save this as a template with\nnone of the information filled out.\n\n387\n00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.760\nAnd that was just a File\n&gt; Save As Template,\n\n388\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.440\nwe have other episodes about that.\n\n389\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.116\nThen it goes into,\nwhen you do a new document from template?\n\n390\n00:20:07.116 --> 00:20:11.776\nIt's like, here's a brand new form\nin a DOCX, your regular file.\n\n391\n00:20:11.776 --> 00:20:14.941\nYou fill it on out, you do a File &gt; Save,\nmaybe just do a File &gt; Print,\n\n392\n00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:17.911\ncuz that's what you need to do for\nyour records and what have you.\n\n393\n00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:18.550\nFile it away.\n\n394\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:24.580\nNext day, or that afternoon, new document\nfrom template, start from scratch.\n\n395\n00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.840\nSo it pulls in a couple different\nthings that we've learned throughout\n\n396\n00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.400\nthese different episodes\nin all of these series.\n\n397\n00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.131\nThe document protection,\nputting a password on it for the forms.\n\n398\n00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:39.434\nThe making it a template.\n\n399\n00:20:39.434 --> 00:20:45.804\nFinding the developer tab on the ribbon,\nbeing able to put this form fields,\n\n400\n00:20:45.804 --> 00:20:50.890\nand yeah it's not the most\nrobust form creator tool.\n\n401\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.017\nThat's why I said is\nWord the best product?\n\n402\n00:20:53.017 --> 00:20:54.600\nIt depends on your needs.\n\n403\n00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.390\nThis could be great.\n\n404\n00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.893\nOr maybe like a basic Office.\n\n405\n00:20:57.893 --> 00:21:02.689\nThis is something you're trying to get\naway from doing your invoice books and\n\n406\n00:21:02.689 --> 00:21:04.910\nhanding it to your customer.\n\n407\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.440\nYou have it on your computer,\nyou type it on out, you print it, and\n\n408\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.570\nthen give it to your customer\nright there on the desk.\n\n409\n00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:16.502\nSo there's very many reasons and scenarios\nwhy this could be very handy for you.\n\n410\n00:21:16.502 --> 00:21:21.346\nIt's just Mac version of\nOffice you don't have as many\n\n411\n00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:24.203\nform fields to go ahead and add.\n\n412\n00:21:24.203 --> 00:21:26.322\nCollecting data, can't do that.\n\n413\n00:21:26.322 --> 00:21:30.334\nSo as long as you know the limitations and\nyou're okay with that, fantastic.\n\n414\n00:21:30.334 --> 00:21:31.756\nIt's great, wonderful.\n\n415\n00:21:31.756 --> 00:21:37.272\nSo one last thing I do wanna point out is\nthat I do have a form that was created.\n\n416\n00:21:37.272 --> 00:21:38.215\nI'm gonna close this file.\n\n417\n00:21:38.215 --> 00:21:40.449\nI'll save the changes, sure, why not?\n\n418\n00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:41.709\nCuz I didn't save it as a template.\n\n419\n00:21:41.709 --> 00:21:44.777\nI just told you that\nwas what you would do.\n\n420\n00:21:44.777 --> 00:21:48.140\nFile &gt; Save as template, put it in your\nTemplates folder, and then you move on.\n\n421\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.640\nThere is one that I have,\nthat purchased order complete.\n\n422\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.917\nNow, this was done from one on a PC.\n\n423\n00:21:53.917 --> 00:21:58.630\nAnd you will be able to notice it has,\nthis cute little date pic.\n\n424\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.230\nSo I can still use it as an end user.\n\n425\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:08.267\nIn Office for Mac I could choose,\nlet's say today's the second of the 21st.\n\n426\n00:22:08.267 --> 00:22:12.222\nAnd then there's that click or\ntype and then I can type here.\n\n427\n00:22:12.222 --> 00:22:17.276\nLook, notice their little check boxes,\nI changed it to be a cat.\n\n428\n00:22:17.276 --> 00:22:18.732\nInstead of like a little x.\n\n429\n00:22:18.732 --> 00:22:20.277\nHe's like that's what that thing is.\n\n430\n00:22:20.277 --> 00:22:24.969\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so notice that I can\ngo ahead and turn these on and off.\n\n431\n00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:26.426\nThey're all fields.\n\n432\n00:22:26.426 --> 00:22:29.710\nI do have a drop down list.\n\n433\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.031\nSo you can still go ahead and\nnotice over here it's very small.\n\n434\n00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:37.377\nYou see that little plus sign,\nthat repeating region.\n\n435\n00:22:37.377 --> 00:22:44.184\nSo I can use a PC Word created form,\nand I can do the same things.\n\n436\n00:22:44.184 --> 00:22:48.004\nYou can even put a picture field in,\nand then pick a picture.\n\n437\n00:22:48.004 --> 00:22:50.475\nSo there are some unique\nthings that it can do.\n\n438\n00:22:50.475 --> 00:22:55.282\nBut I can't choose a building block\nbecause I don't have building blocks in\n\n439\n00:22:55.282 --> 00:22:57.391\nOffice for MAC, or Word for MAC.\n\n440\n00:22:57.391 --> 00:23:02.377\nBut just saying, if you do have\npeople that are making PC Word form,\n\n441\n00:23:02.377 --> 00:23:05.362\nyou can still use them for the most part.\n\n442\n00:23:05.362 --> 00:23:07.268\nThe functionality is there,\n\n443\n00:23:07.268 --> 00:23:11.853\nyou just can't build them the same\nway that Word for PC can build forms.\n\n444\n00:23:11.853 --> 00:23:15.547\nSo do you have any questions there,\nJustin?\n\n445\n00:23:15.547 --> 00:23:19.097\n&gt;&gt; I'm still trying to\nfigure out how that works,\n\n446\n00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:25.065\nhow those things exist on Word for Mac\nthat came from PC, why can't I use those?\n\n447\n00:23:25.065 --> 00:23:26.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And well, we're not Microsoft so\n\n448\n00:23:26.812 --> 00:23:29.752\nwe don't have the answers to those\nquestions, that's just the way it is.\n\n449\n00:23:29.752 --> 00:23:34.922\nAnd I will say even though maybe it's\nnot the most aesthetically pleasing or\n\n450\n00:23:34.922 --> 00:23:38.821\nthe most excellent,\nin the famous words of Bill and Ted.\n\n451\n00:23:38.821 --> 00:23:40.427\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There are times where\n\n452\n00:23:40.427 --> 00:23:42.130\nI can see this kinda\nincrease productivity.\n\n453\n00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.259\nThis could help make sure\nyou don't make errors,\n\n454\n00:23:44.259 --> 00:23:46.393\nthat you're like I have\nthese things filled out.\n\n455\n00:23:46.393 --> 00:23:47.497\nJust as quick reminders.\n\n456\n00:23:47.497 --> 00:23:50.185\nSo maybe this is not the best solution,\nbut\n\n457\n00:23:50.185 --> 00:23:54.165\nmaybe it's a pretty good solution for\nyour expected use case.\n\n458\n00:23:54.165 --> 00:23:57.024\n&gt;&gt; It might be the best solution for\nyour situation.\n\n459\n00:23:57.024 --> 00:24:01.910\nAnd especially, I like the reducing\nerrors or input errors.\n\n460\n00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.141\nMaybe everything's drop downs.\n\n461\n00:24:05.141 --> 00:24:08.417\nI'm always gonna fill out\nthe same information, or\n\n462\n00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:11.550\nthe same five options in\nthese different fields.\n\n463\n00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.653\nSo make them all drop downs.\n\n464\n00:24:12.653 --> 00:24:15.888\nSo it's just click, click, click, click,\nclick, click and you don't have to type.\n\n465\n00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:18.365\nAnd so that can be kind of cool,\ncheck boxes,\n\n466\n00:24:18.365 --> 00:24:21.246\nwhether you were writing\ndown the type of customer.\n\n467\n00:24:21.246 --> 00:24:23.074\nYou only have three types of customers.\n\n468\n00:24:23.074 --> 00:24:24.642\nMake them check boxes.\n\n469\n00:24:24.642 --> 00:24:28.747\nSo you might have to get\na little creative, but it's cool.\n\n470\n00:24:28.747 --> 00:24:31.626\nMaybe I want to calculate this plus this.\n\n471\n00:24:31.626 --> 00:24:32.360\nGo for it.\n\n472\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.088\nWhy not?\n\n473\n00:24:33.088 --> 00:24:34.185\nTry it out.\n\n474\n00:24:34.185 --> 00:24:35.170\nSee if it works for you.\n\n475\n00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.819\nIf it doesn't, just with anything\nin all of the computer land,\n\n476\n00:24:38.819 --> 00:24:42.888\nif you don't need it then that's fine,\nbut if you do, it might be fun.\n\n477\n00:24:42.888 --> 00:24:44.332\nSo go for it, have fun.\n\n478\n00:24:44.332 --> 00:24:46.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right well, Vonne,\n\n479\n00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.883\nyou've definitely exposed us to a new\nset of tools that may be helpful to us.\n\n480\n00:24:49.883 --> 00:24:53.072\nAnd well, if you wanna learn\nmore about some more tools,\n\n481\n00:24:53.072 -->
