Word\n2016 Mail Merge series.\n\n4\n00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.749\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n5\n00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.366\nAnd in this course overview,\n\n6\n00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:18.690\nwe're gonna be going over exactly\nwhat is in this particular series.\n\n7\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.450\nWhat is the target audience, or I guess I\nshould say who is the target audience for\n\n8\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.150\nthis show?\n\n9\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.950\nAny prerequisites that we\nneed to know about and\n\n10\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.544\nany extra tidbits that I might have for\nyou.\n\n11\n00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:33.310\nSo in this particular show,\nwe're going to be covering mail merge.\n\n12\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.793\nThis is a deep dive into\nthis particular concept and\n\n13\n00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:42.139\nfunction inward that is very popular and\nvery powerful to be able to automate,\n\n14\n00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:46.759\ncreating things like letters and\nlabels and envelopes and emails.\n\n15\n00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.965\nSo we're going to spend some time and\n\n16\n00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.965\nreally get into\nthe nitty-gritty of mail merge.\n\n17\n00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:58.640\nThese are episodes that are present\nin the Word 2016 advanced series.\n\n18\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.550\nSo if you're like, hm,\nI've seen these before, you are correct.\n\n19\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.170\nBut this is where we really\nexplain our data sources,\n\n20\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.583\nlike getting into our file types and\n\n21\n00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:13.500\nunderstanding those data connections\nin a really very specific sense.\n\n22\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.920\nSo you have a very good understanding, and\n\n23\n00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.800\nyou will be very confident in\nhow to perform mail merges.\n\n24\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.400\nBut we do start as an introduction,\nkinda going down the list and up and\n\n25\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.100\nback around.\n\n26\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.616\nBut really there's only one topic,\nit's mail merge, and\n\n27\n00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:31.062\nwe're gonna be covering all\nthe different facets of itm,\n\n28\n00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:35.443\nincluding some kind of fun stuff that\nyou can do with some rules at the end.\n\n29\n00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:38.022\nSo who should be watching this series?\n\n30\n00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:42.480\nAnybody that wants to understand\nmail merge and its entirety,\n\n31\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.853\nso I would say Word and Office users,\nOffice with a capital O,\n\n32\n00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:49.559\nmeaning that it is for Office 365.\n\n33\n00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:54.696\nWe will be working within that\nparticular account, so you will need to\n\n34\n00:01:54.696 --> 00:02:00.196\nhave access to other products within\nthis suite such as Excel and Outlook.\n\n35\n00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:01.106\nAnd like I said,\n\n36\n00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:05.710\nthis will be a deep dive into this\nparticular functionality of Word.\n\n37\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.590\nAnd talking about those other software\ncomponents that you're going to need,\n\n38\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.690\nyou will need to have a foundational\nknowledge of Word 2016 and\n\n39\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.610\nExcel and Outlook,\n\n40\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.100\nbecause we’re going to be using those\nparticular programs within this series.\n\n41\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.437\nAnd I just realized I have a big\ntypo here in this particular slide,\n\n42\n00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:28.830\nis that I have a Mac OS basics.\n\n43\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.380\nLet's go ahead and clarify this.\n\n44\n00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.630\nThis is PC, this is for\nWindows operating system.\n\n45\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.850\nThis is not for a Mac operating system.\n\n46\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.650\nSo I do apologize about that.\n\n47\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.470\nYou can tell I do it for both platforms,\nand I forgot to go ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.801\nproofread my slides.\n\n49\n00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:43.900\nSo, hey, you know what?\n\n50\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.185\nWe'll turn this into a teachable\nmoment to always look at those things.\n\n51\n00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:50.505\nDouble-check your work before\nyou record a video on it.\n\n52\n00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:53.928\nBut we will need to understand\nhow to format text,\n\n53\n00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:58.982\na little bit of information about\ngraphical elements, page layouts, so\n\n54\n00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:04.635\nthose things, it is going to have\nsome assumed knowledge in this show.\n\n55\n00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:07.218\nYou also gonna need a little bit\nof experience working with Excel,\n\n56\n00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:09.080\nlike how to enter in data?\n\n57\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.630\nUnderstandings and file formats, which we\ndo talk about in our data sources like our\n\n58\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.870\nCSV file format and our text delimited or\ntab delimited text files that you\n\n59\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.930\ncan use as export file formats\nfrom an Excel starting point.\n\n60\n00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.980\nAlso some very fundamental concepts about\nusing database programs such as Access,\n\n61\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.620\nwe won't get very deep into it but\nwe will explain it.\n\n62\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.470\nThen understanding how to use Outlook.\n\n63\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.270\nThat there are things\ncalled contacts in Outlook,\n\n64\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.430\nthat you understand some basic\nemailing concepts of your inbox and\n\n65\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.870\nyour sent mail and\nmaybe a little bit about servers.\n\n66\n00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.169\nWe of course have shows on all\nof these particular pieces of\n\n67\n00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.197\nsoftware in its entirety.\n\n68\n00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:54.137\nSo definitely check out our library and\n\n69\n00:03:54.137 --> 00:03:58.212\nsee about working with those particular\nprograms before you get into mail merge.\n\n70\n00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:02.973\nSo a little bit of foundational\nassumed knowledge going on there.\n\n71\n00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:04.684\nWe do have exercise files and\n\n72\n00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:09.820\nepisode notes associated with every single\nepisode within this particular series,\n\n73\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.256\nthey are attached to them,\nso definitely look for that.\n\n74\n00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:15.917\nAll of the files are available\nin one folder or\n\n75\n00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:20.500\none zip folder here in this overview,\nso definitely check that out.\n\n76\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.900\nAnd if anything's missing or something\nnot right, just contact us, let us know.\n\n77\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.400\nI need to make sure that I've got\nthe right files associated with the right\n\n78\n00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.230\nepisodes, so let us know if you\nfind anything slightly awry.\n\n79\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.281\nOn that same note with\nthis particular series,\n\n80\n00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:40.631\nin the exercise files, you're going\nto get warnings on pretty much\n\n81\n00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:45.363\nall of the files that are associated\nwith this particular show because I am\n\n82\n00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:49.523\nmaking database connections to\nfiles as like a starting point.\n\n83\n00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:54.218\nSo you’re going to get a warning that’s\nsaying that the link is broken because\n\n84\n00:04:54.218 --> 00:04:59.110\nthat link is still trying to find it\non my desktop here on my computer.\n\n85\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.500\nWhen you open it up, it can't find that,\nso it's going to give you those warnings.\n\n86\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.630\nAnd it'll probably say something about\nenable editing because it's going to\n\n87\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.070\nthe Internet, and that's really with all\nof our exercise files for the most part.\n\n88\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.040\nSo I wanted to put this into the overview\nto let you know that this will happen.\n\n89\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.230\nSo you will need to relink the data source\nconnection to that particular file,\n\n90\n00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.890\nlike I don't know what\nyou're talking about.\n\n91\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.730\nDefinitely checkout our episode\nthat is called Data Sources,\n\n92\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.320\nand the one episode is the Existing Lists.\n\n93\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.210\nAnd there's two other\nepisodes that are for\n\n94\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.260\ntroubleshooting where we talked\nspecifically about missing data sources\n\n95\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.530\nand how to reestablish\nthat data connection.\n\n96\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.590\nSo check those out if\nyou need a little bit\n\n97\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.080\nmore information about it\nbefore getting started.\n\n98\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.600\nAnd then lastly,\nlike I said before, go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.158\nreview our other courses in our\nlibrary on Excel and Word and Outlook.\n\n100\n00:05:53.158 --> 00:05:56.710\nCheck them out, check all of\nthem out while you're there, and\n\n101\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.355\njust go ahead and update yourself\non some of those basic concepts,\n\n102\n00:06:00.355 --> 00:06:04.820\n[LAUGH]\nthere's always other options.\n\n103\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.151\nOkay, I present one way.\n\n104\n00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:09.029\nIn mail merge it's maybe\na little bit more limited, but\n\n105\n00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:13.730\nthere's always another way that you can\ndo things in any Microsoft products.\n\n106\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.985\nUpdates do happen.\n\n107\n00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:19.586\nSo if you are watching a version of Word\nthat might have like an extra button that\n\n108\n00:06:19.586 --> 00:06:22.305\nmy Word in this particular\nshow does not have,\n\n109\n00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:25.721\nit could be because there was\na Office 365 updates, and\n\n110\n00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:31.570\nthey're always going ahead and adding on\nthose features and incremental updates.\n\n111\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.460\nYou can also go into your help menu and\n\n112\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.230\ncheck for updates to see if you\nhave any updates available for you.\n\n113\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.920\nSearching for the answers, right?\n\n114\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.241\nThe Internet is a great treasure\ntrove of information, so\n\n115\n00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.767\nthere's probably other ways to do things.\n\n116\n00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:49.016\nSo I definitely encourage\nyou to go out and search for\n\n117\n00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:51.900\nanswers that you might have\nabout particular topics.\n\n118\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.100\nEverybody has different reasons of\nwhy they use different products, so\n\n119\n00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.300\nthe examples that I'm giving\nare my own personal experience.\n\n120\n00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.831\nAnd hopefully you can be able to correlate\nthat into the way that you need to use\n\n121\n00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:06.805\nthis product, or maybe not use this\nparticular function because it\n\n122\n00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:10.451\nmaybe is not applicable to how\nyou do things in your workflow.\n\n123\n00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:12.925\nSo, biggest thing, have fun.\n\n124\n00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.277\nI like to have fun.\n\n125\n00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:15.385\nWe like to joke.\n\n126\n00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:19.647\nAnd just try to make learning about\nthis information fun because if you can\n\n127\n00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.703\nunderstand and learn the concepts,\nhopefully it'll make it a little\n\n128\n00:07:23.703 --> 00:07:27.710\nbit more fun in your daily life and\nit won't seem so daunting.\n\n129\n00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.670\nSo, I look forward to seeing\nyou in future episodes.\n\n130\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.295\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:01:18.275\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n30\n00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:22.282\nespecially when we get to geek out about\nlike file formats and things like that.\n\n31\n00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.530\nYes [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.590\n&gt;&gt; Threaten me with a good time [LAUGH].\n\n33\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.840\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know,\nit's coming around the corner.\n\n34\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.283\nBut this is our introduction episode,\nto where like, what is a mail merge?\n\n35\n00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:35.010\nWhy don't we go ahead and start there?\n\n36\n00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.050\nAnd it's another little preface that,\nif you've seen this particular show,\n\n37\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.290\nyou're just like, well there's\nepisodes in the Word Advance series.\n\n38\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.330\nYeah, you're correct.\n\n39\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.218\nActually, I think you might\nhave been in on them.\n\n40\n00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:45.539\n&gt;&gt; I did, yes, I did.\n\n41\n00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you're like this\n&gt;&gt; Advanced for\n\n42\n00:01:47.138 --> 00:01:48.405\nMac I think we did that one.\n\n43\n00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:49.340\n&gt;&gt; We did Mac and PC.\n\n44\n00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.903\n&gt;&gt; Did I do PC with you?\n&gt;&gt; I think you were in both of them.\n\n45\n00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:53.570\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember now,\nI'm on so many shows.\n\n46\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.324\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, he's very\n&gt;&gt; Just can't,\n\n47\n00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:55.364\nit's hard to keep track of them.\n\n48\n00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:56.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know we've\ntalked about mail merge.\n\n49\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.534\n&gt;&gt; We have definitely talked\nabout this before, yeah.\n\n50\n00:01:58.534 --> 00:02:01.320\n&gt;&gt; Whether it was PC or Mac,\nwe've definitely gone there.\n\n51\n00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.500\nAnd so you might have seen it.\n\n52\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.060\nIt was really just kind of like,\nget you started, get you going.\n\n53\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.482\nAnd we did kind of preface or at least\ngive a little, I want to say insinuate.\n\n54\n00:02:11.482 --> 00:02:13.534\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We gave a shout out to this\n\n55\n00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:15.047\nshow in that series.\n\n56\n00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:15.890\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yes we did.\n\n57\n00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and say hey,\ncome on over and look at this.\n\n58\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.820\nSo here we are, hope you're ready to go.\n\n59\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.905\nSo why don't we do this,\nwhy don't we just jump\n\n60\n00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:23.677\n&gt;&gt; #mailmerge [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:24.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hashtag.\n\n62\n00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:25.537\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n63\n00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:26.907\n&gt;&gt; Definitely [LAUGH].\n\n64\n00:02:26.907 --> 00:02:29.052\nSorry, now I'm thinking\nof that whole S&amp;L skit.\n\n65\n00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:30.716\n&gt;&gt; Move on, move on, mail merge.\n\n66\n00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:31.383\n&gt;&gt; It was with JT.\n\n67\n00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.360\n&gt;&gt; Pixie dust, come back to me,\ncome back to me.\n\n68\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but here we are,\nwe're down in the computer.\n\n69\n00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.030\nWe're actually using Joey's account,\nby the way.\n\n70\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.270\nJT's computer was acting up.\n\n71\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.337\nI don't know-\n&gt;&gt; He's got malware or something.\n\n72\n00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:44.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't really know\nwhat's wrong with that person.\n\n73\n00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.961\n&gt;&gt; He clicked on the wrong link.\n\n74\n00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:48.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know, it's possible.\n\n75\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.150\nI don't know what's going\non with that account.\n\n76\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.895\n&gt;&gt; No, I can tell you,\ncuz I sent it to him.\n\n77\n00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:53.888\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n78\n00:02:53.888 --> 00:02:55.990\nwe are using Joey's computer.\n\n79\n00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.929\nAnd I wanted to start\nwith the White Papers,\n\n80\n00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:03.949\nthe help files from Microsoft, of what\nare we going to do with a mail merge?\n\n81\n00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.281\nAnd you can see that,\n\n82\n00:03:05.281 --> 00:03:09.870\ndifferent ways of communicating in your\nday to day operations and [SOUND].\n\n83\n00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.975\nBut I like the one right here.\n\n84\n00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:14.938\nWith a mail merge process,\nyour organization can create a batch of\n\n85\n00:03:14.938 --> 00:03:19.810\npersonalized letters or emails to\nsend to your professional contacts.\n\n86\n00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.570\nOkay, great!\n\n87\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.468\nSo batch processing, automation,\n\n88\n00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:28.518\ncuz that was actually the topic\nthat it was in in the Word series.\n\n89\n00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:32.980\nBut the best part about the mail merge\nis that you are personalizing it.\n\n90\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.060\nSo you're going to be using what I call\nvariable data, mixed in with static data,\n\n91\n00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.228\nand be able to produce all\nsorts of cool results.\n\n92\n00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:41.739\nLike?\n\n93\n00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.089\nOkay [LAUGH] so anyways,\nI'll show you the examples,\n\n94\n00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.660\ncuz that's what we're doing\nhere in this introduction.\n\n95\n00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.924\nJust getting you familiar to the process.\n\n96\n00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:53.792\nHear the terminology that they use,\nand I use, you know me [LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:55.489\nI like to mix it up a little bit.\n\n98\n00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.120\n&gt;&gt; Bonglish?\n\n99\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.696\nIs that what you call it, Bonglish?\n\n100\n00:03:56.696 --> 00:03:57.758\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Bonglish.\n\n101\n00:03:57.758 --> 00:03:58.951\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] so\n\n102\n00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:03.860\nyou can see down here it's saying you have\nyour process, which we'll talk about.\n\n103\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.660\nWhat you can be creating\nwith a mail merge.\n\n104\n00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.946\nYou can create personalized letters.\n\n105\n00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:13.622\nI'm going to be printing out\nphysical paper that I'm going\n\n106\n00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:15.900\nto then stuff into envelopes.\n\n107\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.720\nAnd then maybe put some\nmailing labels on it.\n\n108\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.880\nOr maybe I wanna go ahead and\ndo this all digitally.\n\n109\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.664\nLet's go ahead send it in email.\n\n110\n00:04:22.664 --> 00:04:25.728\nNow of course your letters\ncould be digital, too.\n\n111\n00:04:25.728 --> 00:04:29.239\nMaybe you're just sending it,\nwell, somewhere.\n\n112\n00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:31.390\n[LAUGH] I'm like\n&gt;&gt; To that person you\n\n113\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.320\nsend mail to [LAUGH].\n\n114\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is gonna be printed,\ncuz mail goes through the mail.\n\n115\n00:04:36.055 --> 00:04:37.299\n&gt;&gt; It does do that.\n\n116\n00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] so most of this is gonna\nbe printed, but we have the email.\n\n117\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.830\nAnd then it talks about your mailing list,\ncuz that whole idea about,\n\n118\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.000\nyou need to make personalized letters,\nenvelopes, labels.\n\n119\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.350\nWell okay that variable data that\nwe're talking about you're gonna need\n\n120\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.490\nwhat I'm going to call a data source.\n\n121\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.910\nI need a source where my data is.\n\n122\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.670\nNow they will refer to\nit as your mailing list.\n\n123\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.891\n&gt;&gt; Sounds interesting Vonne,\ntell us more about that thing you said.\n\n124\n00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:04.686\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:06.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that thing.\n\n126\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.010\nBut, yeah, so we're going to have\na data source, mailing list,\n\n127\n00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.420\nselect recipients is actually what they\ncall it in the mail merge process.\n\n128\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.160\nOkay, but it's where we're going to\nthen get that personal information and\n\n129\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.630\nbe able to merge it into my static data.\n\n130\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.908\nOkay, maybe you're like, tell me more.\n\n131\n00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.536\nI'm still totally not getting it.\n\n132\n00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:28.780\nSo I've got this.\n\n133\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.850\nI've got a little example,\na little diagram.\n\n134\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.090\nYou know us,\nwe like to make diagrams about everything.\n\n135\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.230\n&gt;&gt; Pictures help.\n\n136\n00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.282\n&gt;&gt; They really do, yeah.\n\n137\n00:05:36.282 --> 00:05:37.701\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, the words are big and\nhard to understand [LAUGH].\n\n138\n00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:42.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's funny, as instructors\n&gt;&gt; Not really joking [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.467\n&gt;&gt; If we're in a room, like when\nwe're back in a physical classroom.\n\n140\n00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:45.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.800\n&gt;&gt; We would start talking to each other,\nand it's just like, you just get up and\n\n142\n00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.580\ngo to the board.\n\n143\n00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.132\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And just start drawing it out.\n\n144\n00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:50.270\n&gt;&gt; And start drawing diagrams.\n\n145\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.890\n&gt;&gt; Even if we're just\ntalking to each other.\n\n146\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.998\nIt was just this innate thing of like,\nlet me draw this, so.\n\n147\n00:05:54.998 --> 00:05:56.773\n&gt;&gt; By the way, Vonne and\nI used to work together as instructors.\n\n148\n00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.532\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, many moons ago.\n\n149\n00:05:58.532 --> 00:05:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Many moons ago, many moons ago.\n\n150\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.642\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, lots of time has past.\n\n151\n00:06:01.642 --> 00:06:02.641\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good times.\n\n152\n00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:03.183\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was.\n\n153\n00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:03.860\n&gt;&gt; Good times.\n\n154\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Little Daniel.\n\n155\n00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; He was such a young little buck.\n\n156\n00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:07.970\n[LAUGH] Now you're old.\n\n157\n00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.135\n&gt;&gt; He's always so angry.\n\n158\n00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:11.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, that makes me much older, too.\n\n159\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.143\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's stop while you're ahead.\n\n160\n00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:12.885\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back to mail merge.\n\n161\n00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:14.095\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, mail merge.\n\n162\n00:06:14.095 --> 00:06:19.845\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can see that we have\na letter that we're going to write.\n\n163\n00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:23.730\nAnd we use the example in the other shows,\nof like junk mail.\n\n164\n00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.282\nYou get mail in, mail in the mail [LAUGH].\n\n165\n00:06:28.282 --> 00:06:31.887\nAnd it actually has letters,\nwhere you're seeing, okay I know that,\n\n166\n00:06:31.887 --> 00:06:36.170\nthat's some type of program that's just\ninserting my name here, and my city here.\n\n167\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.297\nAnd like everybody in the world\nprobably got one of these.\n\n168\n00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:42.357\n&gt;&gt; It's very obvious that it's contrived,\nthat it's put in there,\n\n169\n00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:45.970\nthat it's automated,\nsomething's doing it for it.\n\n170\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:46.730\nAnd sending this stuff out.\n\n171\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.267\nYou get mailers in the mail all the time.\n\n172\n00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:49.015\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n173\n00:06:49.015 --> 00:06:52.950\n&gt;&gt; And that exact format is happening, cuz\nthe font's a little different or bolded or\n\n174\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.790\nwhatever.\n\n175\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.708\nAnd you could tell, ugh.\n\n176\n00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:55.852\n&gt;&gt; It's raised up a little bit sometimes.\n\n177\n00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:59.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] they downloaded\nthe database of names from wherever, and\n\n178\n00:06:59.573 --> 00:07:01.735\njust chucked it in and let it happen.\n\n179\n00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:03.972\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much\n&gt;&gt; Which is the data source, right?\n\n180\n00:07:03.972 --> 00:07:05.033\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; That would be the data source?\n\n181\n00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:06.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that variable informaiton.\n\n182\n00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:11.029\nAnd it's funny, because now since\nI know about this, over the years,\n\n183\n00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:15.263\nlooking at some of these different\nmail pieces that are just like wow,\n\n184\n00:07:15.263 --> 00:07:17.945\nyou guys are getting really over and\nabove.\n\n185\n00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:20.083\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This actually makes me think\n\n186\n00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:21.352\n&gt;&gt; You're trying to fool me, yeah.\n\n187\n00:07:21.352 --> 00:07:25.205\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this really makes me think\nthat you only addressed this to me.\n\n188\n00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:27.154\n&gt;&gt; Is this a handwritten letter,\nwhat is it?\n\n189\n00:07:27.154 --> 00:07:28.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's pretty good.\n\n190\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.724\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty good.\n&gt;&gt; They've gotten really advanced.\n\n191\n00:07:30.724 --> 00:07:34.754\nBut the whole idea here is that you would\nhave some type of letter that you wanna\n\n192\n00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:35.322\ncompose.\n\n193\n00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:38.260\nAnd you're going to be putting in\nthose fields like first and last.\n\n194\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.240\nAnd so right here, we have an example\nof what the merge fields look like.\n\n195\n00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.700\nAnd notice that they have these\nlittle double angled brackets, right?\n\n196\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.440\nAt least that's what I would call them,\nright?\n\n197\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.388\nThese little\n&gt;&gt; Greater than, less than signs?\n\n198\n00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.221\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the little gator mouth,\nas we can also call them?\n\n199\n00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n200\n00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.630\n&gt;&gt; Do you know that this has a real name,\ntoo?\n\n201\n00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.009\nI know they all do.\n\n202\n00:07:58.009 --> 00:07:59.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just call them gator mouths.\n\n203\n00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:02.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is Guillemet.\n\n204\n00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:04.112\n&gt;&gt; Guillemet.\n&gt;&gt; Guillemet.\n\n205\n00:08:04.112 --> 00:08:06.050\n&gt;&gt; Guillemet.\n\n206\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.999\n&gt;&gt; I had to do the pronunciation a couple\ntimes, but I'm still not getting it.\n\n207\n00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:10.043\nIt's French, but guess what?\n\n208\n00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:11.010\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; It is right here.\n\n209\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.520\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n210\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n211\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.855\nIt is an angle quotes.\n\n212\n00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:15.745\n&gt;&gt; Guillemet.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we're looking at.\n\n213\n00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:16.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cool.\n\n214\n00:08:16.302 --> 00:08:18.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I was like,\nit has a real name.\n\n215\n00:08:18.712 --> 00:08:20.597\n&gt;&gt; Well, I just learned something new.\n\n216\n00:08:20.597 --> 00:08:22.072\nI did not know that.\n&gt;&gt; I did too.\n\n217\n00:08:22.072 --> 00:08:23.560\n&gt;&gt; And I love little stuff like that.\n\n218\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.785\n&gt;&gt; Another one that's a big one.\n\n219\n00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:26.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Remember this one that we use\n\n220\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.710\nall the time in Word,\nmy show high characters?\n\n221\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.010\nThe paragraph mark.\n\n222\n00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.750\n&gt;&gt; Pilcrow.\n\n223\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.030\n&gt;&gt; It's a pilcrow.\n\n224\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.740\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n225\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.305\n&gt;&gt; The backwards P paragraph\nsign is a pilcrow.\n\n226\n00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:38.292\n&gt;&gt; I will never forget that now.\n\n227\n00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:39.728\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why,\n\n228\n00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.340\nbut that is now permanently\nemblazoned into my brain.\n\n229\n00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.008\n&gt;&gt; You know how long I've been\nteaching Word, and I do the show-\n\n230\n00:08:44.008 --> 00:08:45.664\n&gt;&gt; You have not known that's a pilcrow?\n\n231\n00:08:45.664 --> 00:08:48.500\n&gt;&gt; No, and I'm just like,\nthat's its real name.\n\n232\n00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.962\n&gt;&gt; I should have looked this up years ago.\n\n233\n00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:51.932\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just always say the backwards P or\n\n234\n00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:52.880\nthe paragraph sign.\n\n235\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe paragraph sign is what I call it.\n\n236\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:55.730\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n237\n00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.466\nTrivia for the day.\n\n238\n00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:57.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pilcrow.\n\n239\n00:08:57.714 --> 00:08:59.123\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, interesting.\n\n240\n00:08:59.123 --> 00:09:02.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways back to here, we have our\n\n241\n00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:06.730\npilcrow and our fields that are saying,\nokay, I want you to then go ahead and\n\n242\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.770\ntake this merged document, or\nthis place where I'm putting this fields.\n\n243\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.120\nNow this fields directly\ncorrespond to how I am\n\n244\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.170\nmarrying the Word document\nwith the data source.\n\n245\n00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:27.010\nThis data source is where you're going\nto have a tabular format of information.\n\n246\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.860\nYou need to have rows and columns.\n\n247\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.560\nEach column is going to be called a field.\n\n248\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.240\nEach row is going to be called a record.\n\n249\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.462\nSo it is pulling the data source's\nfirst row as the column headers,\n\n250\n00:09:43.462 --> 00:09:47.076\nand those are the names of your fields.\n\n251\n00:09:47.076 --> 00:09:49.891\nOkay, so once you have your\nfield name up at the top, so\n\n252\n00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:52.182\nthat's going to be a very important thing.\n\n253\n00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:53.241\nYou gotta have header rows.\n\n254\n00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:56.664\nIf you don't have header rows your data\nsource, or really any data source,\n\n255\n00:09:56.664 --> 00:09:58.968\nyou're not gonna understand what that is,\nokay?\n\n256\n00:09:58.968 --> 00:10:00.380\nThis is the first name column.\n\n257\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.650\nThis is the last name column.\n\n258\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.880\nThis is the address.\n\n259\n00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.410\nOkay, so you have to label them.\n\n260\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.790\nAnd that data source connected to that\nWord document will be able to pull that\n\n261\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:15.110\nfirst row, and then you will insert\nthose fields to write your letter.\n\n262\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.670\nAnd then the result is going to be,\n\n263\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.460\nas you can see down here, here are the\ndifferent records for every record.\n\n264\n00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.820\nIt's going to pull those fields and put\nin the first and last name of record one,\n\n265\n00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.386\nfirst and last name of record two,\nfirst and last for record three.\n\n266\n00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:34.419\nGet the idea here.\n\n267\n00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:36.234\nAnd then it goes all the way down for\n\n268\n00:10:36.234 --> 00:10:40.940\nas many records as you have in the data\nsource, or you specify in the mail merge.\n\n269\n00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.890\nYou're going to get the finished\nresult of these particular documents.\n\n270\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:47.960\nI will say one thing.\n\n271\n00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.800\nYou're not going to be producing\nindividual files, okay?\n\n272\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.630\nThis is a single file.\n\n273\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:11:00.550\nYour finished results file is one file\nwith however many records you have,\n\n274\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.108\nthat's how many pages you're\ngoing to create, okay?\n\n275\n00:11:03.108 --> 00:11:08.797\nSo let's kinda wrap our brains around,\nokay, so then what files do we need?\n\n276\n00:11:08.797 --> 00:11:13.494\nIt looks like we have like a start\ndocument, somewhere we wrote the static\n\n277\n00:11:13.494 --> 00:11:18.600\ninformation and knowing the placeholders\nof where I'm going to put things in.\n\n278\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.383\nThen you're gonna have to have it\ncomposed or selected to data source.\n\n279\n00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:25.705\nAnd then you're gonna\nhave your merge fields.\n\n280\n00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:27.470\nAnd then you're going\nto have your resulting.\n\n281\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.338\nSo to me, you end up with three files.\n\n282\n00:11:31.338 --> 00:11:36.940\nAnd they kinda talk about it here in\nthe directions of, all right, well,\n\n283\n00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:42.230\nyou're going to have to have your main\ndocument, the one that you start with,\n\n284\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.250\nyour mailing list, your data source,\nand then your merge document.\n\n285\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.320\nBut this is where I feel they need\nto do a fourth bullet and say,\n\n286\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.400\nyour finished document.\n\n287\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.880\nThat's the step that every single person,\n\n288\n00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.910\nat least from my experience,\nalways misses.\n\n289\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.378\nSo lets look at some examples.\n\n290\n00:11:59.378 --> 00:12:01.870\nAll right, I have our files.\n\n291\n00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.740\nLet's go with the mail merge start.\n\n292\n00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.860\nNow, I'm going with the letter example\nbecause that's just the easiest\n\n293\n00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.320\none to kind of show off at first.\n\n294\n00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.510\nSo you can see that this is just a regular\nWord file, nothing fancy about it.\n\n295\n00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:18.469\nI've written out my letter that I'm\ngoing to want everybody to have,\n\n296\n00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:21.844\nthe junk mail body template,\nif you wanna say.\n\n297\n00:12:21.844 --> 00:12:23.713\nWell, maybe we should\nstop using junk mail.\n\n298\n00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:25.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It has such a bad connotation.\n\n299\n00:12:25.175 --> 00:12:27.457\n[LAUGH] So I said, dear somebody.\n\n300\n00:12:27.457 --> 00:12:29.191\n[SOUND] Here is your city.\n\n301\n00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:30.137\nAll right, that's great.\n\n302\n00:12:30.137 --> 00:12:33.610\nAnd that's where I want those\nvariable pieces of information.\n\n303\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.280\nWell, my data source, and we'll talk\na lot about different data sources and\n\n304\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.360\nwhat type of file formats you can have.\n\n305\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.400\nThis is an Excel file.\n\n306\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.400\nSo this is probably, I'd say, maybe the\ncommon, most common type of data source.\n\n307\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.720\nAnd we have, within an Excel file,\nwe have columns and rows.\n\n308\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.390\nNotice my header row up here,\nwhich is very important.\n\n309\n00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.840\nI can have multiple worksheets\nwithin in a workbook.\n\n310\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.940\nSo you're going to need to specify what\nworksheet you're going to be pulling\n\n311\n00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.370\nfrom when you tell it to\nconnect to that source.\n\n312\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.570\nSo the way that I like it is, where's my\nstart document, my static information?\n\n313\n00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.630\nThen I do the merge document.\n\n314\n00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.930\nNow, I'm gonna open this up.\n\n315\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.230\nNotice, it says mail, merge, merge, merge.\n\n316\n00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.590\nThis little warning is\nalways gonna come up, and\n\n317\n00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.910\nI'll tell you why once we\nget into some data sources.\n\n318\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.855\nBut it is making that connection.\n\n319\n00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:26.006\nAnytime you make connections\nfrom a file to a data source,\n\n320\n00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:29.754\nit is writing some scripting,\nif you wanna say, in the background.\n\n321\n00:13:29.754 --> 00:13:32.910\nAnd you know from some of our other\nepisodes, any time there's scripting,\n\n322\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.257\nthere's security potential.\n\n323\n00:13:34.257 --> 00:13:35.580\n&gt;&gt; That's right, danger, danger.\n\n324\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.315\nHere's our obligatory warning.\n\n325\n00:13:37.315 --> 00:13:40.666\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Don't accept anything from sources you\n\n326\n00:13:40.666 --> 00:13:41.675\ndon't know.\n\n327\n00:13:41.675 --> 00:13:43.623\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And even if you do know them,\n\n328\n00:13:43.623 --> 00:13:47.250\nit's not you,\nlook at it with a jaundiced eye.\n\n329\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.558\nTrust but verify kind of thing.\n\n330\n00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:51.622\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and we're doing everything like\nwe're creating all of our documents.\n\n331\n00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:54.230\nBut you could be taking over\nmail merges from other people.\n\n332\n00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.090\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And other data sources.\n\n333\n00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.005\nAnd especially if Daniel made it,\nthat's really bad.\n\n334\n00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:00.341\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So all those types of things.\n\n335\n00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:03.131\nSo notice right here I\nhave my merge document.\n\n336\n00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:06.220\nAnd I have my fields in here.\n\n337\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.210\nAnd we're gonna go right on\nover here to our mailings tab,\n\n338\n00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.870\nbecause where do you actually\nperform mail merges in Word?\n\n339\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.340\nYep, you got a whole tab on the ribbon for\nmailings.\n\n340\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.607\nSo you can see that I\nconnected my data source.\n\n341\n00:14:22.607 --> 00:14:23.725\nThat was that warning.\n\n342\n00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:25.258\nYou do that from here.\n\n343\n00:14:25.258 --> 00:14:28.427\nThen you insert your fields,\nthat's from here.\n\n344\n00:14:28.427 --> 00:14:29.786\nRemember, see all those.\n\n345\n00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.310\nThose look familiar.\n\n346\n00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.260\nThat's the first row of that data source.\n\n347\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.655\nAll right, cool.\n\n348\n00:14:34.655 --> 00:14:38.219\nWell, then you finish this.\n\n349\n00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:40.762\nAnd notice right here,\nlet's point something out here.\n\n350\n00:14:40.762 --> 00:14:41.923\nOne page, all right?\n\n351\n00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:45.116\nOne single page going on this document.\n\n352\n00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:50.214\nWhen I go over to this document and\ndo the finished file,\n\n353\n00:14:50.214 --> 00:14:53.587\nnotice, once it shows me down here.\n\n354\n00:14:53.587 --> 00:14:54.589\nOkay, I was hoping.\n\n355\n00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:55.774\nThere it is.\n\n356\n00:14:55.774 --> 00:14:59.767\nIt's kinda hard to see down there, but\ndown on that status bar there's 19 pages.\n\n357\n00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:01.880\nSee there's Bishop Timothy.\n\n358\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.630\nAnd then the next one is.\n\n359\n00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.216\nAnd if I look over at my data source,\nyeah there's Bishop Timothy and there's.\n\n360\n00:15:10.216 --> 00:15:11.029\nThose are the cities.\n\n361\n00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:11.968\nOkay, cool.\n\n362\n00:15:11.968 --> 00:15:15.875\nSo now you can see that this is\ngoing to be the finished result.\n\n363\n00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:16.900\nWhoops, let's go back over here.\n\n364\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:18.910\nLet's go to,\n\n365\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.900\nman I should, really long [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n366\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.110\n&gt;&gt; Christmas cats.\n\n367\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.160\n&gt;&gt; Christmas cats, and\n\n368\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.990\nthen like I could have probably like\nshortened that file name, but you know?\n\n369\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whatever.\n\n370\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.080\n&gt;&gt; But notice that this is\nmy finished document and\n\n371\n00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.009\nthese are my individual\nletters that I have.\n\n372\n00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:37.178\n19 pages based off my 19 records.\n\n373\n00:15:37.178 --> 00:15:39.550\nThere's no data source in this one.\n\n374\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.440\nThe merged file is the one\nwith the data source.\n\n375\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.990\nAnd then the start one was just\nmy regular start document.\n\n376\n00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.672\n&gt;&gt; The generic document.\n\n377\n00:15:46.672 --> 00:15:49.596\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that I just typed up,\nand I wanted to go with.\n\n378\n00:15:49.596 --> 00:15:54.089\nSo those are your main things\nthat you're going to need to do.\n\n379\n00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:55.536\nYou're gonna have to start.\n\n380\n00:15:55.536 --> 00:15:56.784\nYou're gonna connect to a data source.\n\n381\n00:15:56.784 --> 00:15:59.895\nYou're gonna write your merge,\nor write your letter, And\n\n382\n00:15:59.895 --> 00:16:01.900\nthen you're gonna finish and merge.\n\n383\n00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.750\nBig one, right there.\n\n384\n00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.045\nSo those are some very\noverarching processes that\n\n385\n00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:13.143\nyou're going to need to do for\nall mail merges.\n\n386\n00:16:13.143 --> 00:16:17.818\nNow I wanted to go ahead and give you\njust some previews as to what some\n\n387\n00:16:17.818 --> 00:16:20.536\nof our end results from our mail merge.\n\n388\n00:16:20.536 --> 00:16:23.945\nAs I'm doing a lot of minimizing\nof some documents right here.\n\n389\n00:16:23.945 --> 00:16:26.510\n[LAUGH] So\nthese are the finished versions, okay?\n\n390\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.680\nAgain, these are mine,\nI like to have a start,\n\n391\n00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.320\nmerge, finish; notice the names\nof my file naming conventions.\n\n392\n00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.038\nNow you make whatever naming convention\nthat makes the most sense to you.\n\n393\n00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:42.250\nMerged and\nfinished makes the most sense to me.\n\n394\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.130\nSo I have, let's look at some labels.\n\n395\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.280\nSo we have labels, merged, finished.\n\n396\n00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.430\nSo I know that there's\nno data source in here.\n\n397\n00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.370\nThese are my mailing labels.\n\n398\n00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.110\nOkay, cool.\n\n399\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.017\nSo those templates that you can buy,\nthose Avery labels or\n\n400\n00:16:57.017 --> 00:17:00.458\nwhatever company makes\nthose different layouts.\n\n401\n00:17:00.458 --> 00:17:04.189\n&gt;&gt; Go to your local office supply store\nand grab a box of mailing labels, and you\n\n402\n00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:08.175\nfeed them in your printer, and you print\nthem on the wrong side, and do it again.\n\n403\n00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:11.946\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know that one.\n\n404\n00:17:11.946 --> 00:17:15.390\nAnd you also have things along that\nsame idea, name badges, right?\n\n405\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.510\nSo it doesn't always have to\nbe like labels for mailing.\n\n406\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.280\nIt could be file folder names.\n\n407\n00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.185\nIt could be name badges that I wanna go\nahead and pull all that information from,\n\n408\n00:17:25.185 --> 00:17:26.290\nbecause we're having a conference.\n\n409\n00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.330\nSo I wanna print all these out.\n\n410\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:33.480\nThat whole warning is because\nI did the mail merge for\n\n411\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.815\nMac series first, so\nthese are all my same files.\n\n412\n00:17:35.815 --> 00:17:37.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I put it in the Dropbox, and\n\n413\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.120\nthen pull it back down.\n\n414\n00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.040\nSo that's why it's like, why is she\ngetting more warnings about these files?\n\n415\n00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.111\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just the way I do it.\n\n416\n00:17:43.111 --> 00:17:44.826\nAnd then of course, here, these,\n\n417\n00:17:44.826 --> 00:17:48.113\nyou see that there's these\nborders around everything?\n\n418\n00:17:48.113 --> 00:17:51.240\nThis is just for, I put this on for\nyou to be able to see this,\n\n419\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.965\nyou wouldn't wanna print\nthem with the borders.\n\n420\n00:17:52.965 --> 00:17:57.540\nBecause that's really just where\nthe perforation of pages are from\n\n421\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.960\nthose Avery name badges that you buy that\nyou can break up and everything, so.\n\n422\n00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm just showing you where\n\n423\n00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:04.610\nthey're at.\n\n424\n00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.880\nSo we can do anything that has a number\n\n425\n00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.630\npaper from whatever vendor that sells\nyou the stuff, you can create it.\n\n426\n00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.430\nSo name badges, mailing labels,\nlet's look at some envelopes.\n\n427\n00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:21.000\nAll right, we'll be taking a look at\nsome envelopes, give it a second,\n\n428\n00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.892\nthere we go see yep, I know it's fine.\n\n429\n00:18:22.892 --> 00:18:23.600\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n[LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.586\n&gt;&gt; There's no viruses in this file.\n\n431\n00:18:25.586 --> 00:18:27.616\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're mine it's just the whole\n\n432\n00:18:27.616 --> 00:18:31.370\nmoving things around from one\naccount to another through Dropbox.\n\n433\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.870\nLook at this.\n\n434\n00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.840\nLook at that, Christmas-y.\n\n435\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.100\nRight? Okay. &gt;&gt; It's very Christmasy.\n\n436\n00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.010\n&gt;&gt; Got to have a picture of Bishop,\nyou know,\n\n437\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.540\nI can't get away without putting things,\na picture of my cat on everything.\n\n438\n00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.700\nSo we've got our envelopes, nice,\nwe've got all of these down in here,\n\n439\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.430\nso feeding those envelopes\ninto the printer.\n\n440\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.555\nThat's a fun one.\n\n441\n00:18:48.555 --> 00:18:50.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Envelopes, printers?\n\n442\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.120\nOoh.\n\n443\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.850\n&gt;&gt; They love each other.\n\n444\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.090\n&gt;&gt; I, that's gonna be a fun day, isn't it?\n\n445\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:54.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n446\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.730\nNo.\n[LAUGH] Goodness, yeah.\n\n447\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.010\nWe'll talk all about that.\n\n448\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.200\nSo you can see some different options that\nyou have here of what you can create.\n\n449\n00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.230\nI didn't have an example of the mail\nmerge for emails ready to go,\n\n450\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.500\nbut we'll get to those different episodes.\n\n451\n00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.010\nSo this is the introduction, like we said.\n\n452\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:17.430\nHopefully, that gives you a little bit of\na background into all right, the process,\n\n453\n00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.320\nwe will be referring to this process\nas we go through these different ones.\n\n454\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.820\nBut once we into the episodes, it's gonna\nbe like all right, so click, click, click.\n\n455\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.100\nOkay, see, we're done.\n\n456\n00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.690\nBecause we've kinda already\nexplained it here and\n\n457\n00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.550\nwe'll get into more specifics\nwith your data sources and\n\n458\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.230\nhow to make sure you have your data\nsources ready for your mail merge.\n\n459\n00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.453\nBut hopefully that gives you a little bit\nof an overview, gives you some references\n\n460\n00:19:40.453 --> 00:19:43.900\nto look for with different URL's\nto help you with the steps.\n\n461\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.470\nBut you know what?\n\n462\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:48.834\n&gt;&gt; I am going to help you with the steps\nbecause I think they miss a few things.\n\n463\n00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:51.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well Vonne we can't wait to\nlean on your expertise on this topic\n\n464\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.410\nbecause this is something that a lot\nof people struggle with, or they\n\n465\n00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:59.300\nthink they understand it, and they really\ndon't see the extended capabilities,\n\n466\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.980\nthat they're really not taking\nadvantage of it to its full capability.\n\n467\n00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.430\nSo that's what we look forward\nto doing inside of this series.\n\n468\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.770\nHopefully you guys are getting\na lot out of this, and\n\n469\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.520\nif you've never seen Mail Merge before\nthis will also be a great introduction\n\n470\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.760\nas well as a deep dive as well.\n\n471\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.930\nSo, just keep that in\nmind as we move along.\n\n472\n00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.710\nVonne, thanks for joining us today, and\n\n473\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.390\nwe do thank you good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n474\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.680\nBut, time to sign off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n475\n00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n476\n00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.993\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n477\n00:20:21.993 --> 00:20:28.219\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Okay.\n\n35\n00:01:38.268 --> 00:01:38.898\nSounds great.\n\n36\n00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.028\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhy don't we go ahead and jump on down.\n\n37\n00:01:41.028 --> 00:01:46.258\nAnd I have just started Word with a blank\ndocument because we're gonna use this\n\n38\n00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:52.019\nas the document that we're going to\nbe connecting into a data source.\n\n39\n00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.110\nNow like I said in the introduction,\nI'm going to call it a data source.\n\n40\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.570\nThey might call it a mailing list.\n\n41\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.610\nBut where you actually\ndo it in the mail merge\n\n42\n00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.221\nprocess is they call it select recipients,\nokay.\n\n43\n00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n44\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.200\n&gt;&gt; If you think about, what are the\nrecipients that I'm going to be using for\n\n45\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.100\nthis particular merging of variable\ninformation and static information.\n\n46\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.450\nSo that makes sense.\n\n47\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.780\nSo this is where we're going to\nconcentrate right now on this\n\n48\n00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.650\nparticular part.\n\n49\n00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.880\nNotice that we have three overall options.\n\n50\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.060\nYou could do a new list,\ndo an existing list, or Outlook contacts.\n\n51\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.220\nWell, each episode we're\ngonna cover these.\n\n52\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.180\nI'm gonna start with\nusing an existing list.\n\n53\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.760\nSo this is where, all right.\n\n54\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.990\nI have my data source\nsomewhere else than word.\n\n55\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.772\nWell of course it's not gonna be in Word.\n\n56\n00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:42.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.570\n&gt;&gt; So wow, that, I started going down,\n\n58\n00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.545\nlike where are you going, Vonne?\n\n59\n00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:48.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now could it be in Word?\n\n60\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.620\nIt could be a Word document though, right?\n\n61\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.160\n&gt;&gt; It could, yeah.\n\n62\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.180\nSo, so yeah.\n\n63\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.410\nThat’s where I started kind of following.\n\n64\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.740\nI was like, yeah,\nof course it’s gonna be a separate file.\n\n65\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You know, it has to be.\n\n66\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.730\n&gt;&gt; It’s just not baked into the file\nthat we’re currently working, right?\n\n67\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.880\n&gt;&gt; And it’s not your Outlook contest,\nand you’re not gonna make it on the fly.\n\n68\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.392\nSo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n69\n00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:05.104\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n70\n00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:08.720\nSo, [LAUGH] We’re gonna concentrate\non that particular option now.\n\n71\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.930\nAnd like, so what is the What are the\ndifferent types of files that we can do?\n\n72\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.380\nWhy don’t we start with,\ngoing to this particular option, and\n\n73\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.540\nI wanted to point out that, when we go\nhere it always starts on this data source.\n\n74\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.010\nOkay so where are we going,\n\n75\n00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.130\nthis is one of those folders\nthat Microsoft makes on the fly.\n\n76\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.730\nIt's kinda like you have a My Documents\nfolder, and you have a Pictures folder,\n\n77\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.900\nand a Videos Folder,\nit's just something that they make.\n\n78\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.585\nAnd sometimes when you install certain\nproducts, you'll always get other folders.\n\n79\n00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:43.905\nLike a templates folder or something that\nyou're like, where did that come from?\n\n80\n00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.645\n&gt;&gt; It creates a folder structure\nwhen you hit the install button and\n\n81\n00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:49.505\nit starts doing a thing just see\nthe green bar move across the screen,\n\n82\n00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:52.145\nall the stuff that it's doing is create\nthis folder, create folders we're\n\n83\n00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:55.010\ngonna need that folder, and\nput these things inside of these folders.\n\n84\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.300\nThat's where these things come from,\nso if you're like,\n\n85\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.230\nI didn't make this folder, now you kind\nof get the idea of where it came from.\n\n86\n00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like if you install\nPremier Pro, it's another Adobe product,\n\n87\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.700\nlike you're gonna get a my premier pro\nfile, I can't remember what the name is,\n\n88\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.130\nbut yeah, exactly what you said.\n\n89\n00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.670\nSo this is something that happens when,\n\n90\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.470\nI believe it's when you do your\noffice products, fire wood.\n\n91\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.430\n&gt;&gt; Don’t quote me on that one.\n\n92\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.060\nI just know it’s there.\n\n93\n00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.075\n&gt;&gt; I will assume that’s what it is.\n\n94\n00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:20.450\nIt’s like, when you install Office, it’s\nprobably, that’s when it creates this.\n\n95\n00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.957\n&gt;&gt; We’ll go with that.\n\n96\n00:04:20.957 --> 00:04:21.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n97\n00:04:21.578 --> 00:04:22.415\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:22.925\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n100\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.952\nThat’s what I’m like,\nsounds totally plausible.\n\n101\n00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:28.980\n&gt;&gt; Legit. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So\nthat’s where it starts, when we’re saying,\n\n102\n00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.410\nlet’s go ahead and select recipients,\nbecause we are connecting a data source,\n\n103\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.880\nand so\nthere’s going to be like a command and\n\n104\n00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.450\ncode if you wanna say, that's written\ninto this particular word document.\n\n105\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.020\nSays, hey guess what?\n\n106\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.540\nThere's a connection to an outside source\nso I'm gonna like write this in like\n\n107\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.870\nthe belly of the file so\nyou know where it's going.\n\n108\n00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.310\nAnd so that's where it's going into this\nMy Data Sources of where you can connect\n\n109\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.630\nto a particular Data Source.\n\n110\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.400\nSo, it all makes sense.\n\n111\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.270\nDown here in the bottom, where we have\nwhat type of files can we choose from?\n\n112\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.330\nIt says, All Data Sources.\n\n113\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.320\nAnd when I drop this down, which actually\ndrops up, you can see it has things like\n\n114\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.310\nan Access Database, Excel File, and then\nit gets into Word Documents, Text Files.\n\n115\n00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.370\nWe'll talk about those.\n\n116\n00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.720\nBecause we've talked about that your data\nsource has to be an a tabular format.\n\n117\n00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.460\nWe've talked about pros and cons, so\nit's gotta be in that particular format.\n\n118\n00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.180\nAnd so it saying,\n\n119\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.890\nhey these are particular file format\nthat I know are structured like that.\n\n120\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.310\nSo it's giving you these options, so\n\n121\n00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.020\nif I come in to say like my,\nlet's go over here to My Documents.\n\n122\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.020\nAnd I go to this Access Folder,\njust for example.\n\n123\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.880\nNotice that it's only gonna\nshow me access and Excel files.\n\n124\n00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.640\nI know that in this folder there is PDFs,\nthere might be a PowerPoint in there.\n\n125\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.310\nBut it's not showing me\nthat because you can't\n\n126\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.670\nconnect to a PDF as your data source, so\nit's not going to give you options for\n\n127\n00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.510\nfiles that aren’t viable\nwithin a mail merge.\n\n128\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.190\nSo, that's kinda nice to know.\n\n129\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.740\nNow if you change this to All Files, yeah,\n\n130\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.130\nyou'll see there's the PDFs,\nbut it's not gonna work.\n\n131\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.210\nSo, that's the default there.\n\n132\n00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.990\nIn case you know you have this file in\nthis folder, but why isn't it showing?\n\n133\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.830\n&gt;&gt; Because,\nit's not a legitimate data source.\n\n134\n00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.970\nThat's why it's not showing up.\n\n135\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.870\nBecause the default is to\nshow only data sources.\n\n136\n00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.760\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so I wanted to take\nthat starting point to point that out.\n\n137\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.380\nLike okay, cool, that sounds good.\n\n138\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.690\nI'm gonna cancel this for now.\n\n139\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.970\nAnd I'm gonna pull up this particular\nfile that I have to help us down the road\n\n140\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.120\nof the different types of list options\nthat we can go with in a mail merge.\n\n141\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.880\nWe already said,\ngotta be in a tabular format and\n\n142\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.020\nyou really have to have a header row,\nyou gotta have that very first row to\n\n143\n00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.640\ndesignate that these are the fields, this\nis the last name, this is the first name,\n\n144\n00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.730\nthis is the address or\nwhatever your fields are going to be.\n\n145\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.270\nIf you don't have a header row It\n&gt;&gt; It's not bueno [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.642\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's just not the play so\n\n147\n00:06:58.642 --> 00:07:00.820\n[LAUGH] We need to make sure we have that.\n\n148\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.540\nLet's go on down.\n\n149\n00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.540\nLet's start with Access.\n\n150\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.410\nI figure we'll start with a.\n\n151\n00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.240\nIt's not in alphabetical order.\n\n152\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just went ahead.\n\n153\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.540\n&gt;&gt; It just happens to be what we\ncan see is in alphabetical order.\n\n154\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n155\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.940\nwhen you have an Access file, an accdb.\n\n156\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.320\nThat's a long five letter extensions\nright there, interesting.\n\n157\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.500\nSo this is where an access\ndatabase is one file, but\n\n158\n00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.290\nyou're going to have multiple tables or\nqueries that you can use.\n\n159\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.160\nBut they are in that tabular format.\n\n160\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.510\nSo I have an example of one of our.\n\n161\n00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.050\nAccess shows that I did with Ronnie,\nDancing Dogs.\n\n162\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Dancing Dogs, no cats.\n\n163\n00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.120\n&gt;&gt; Christmas Cats, well I figured\nsince it was with Ronnie, I'd.\n\n164\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.860\n&gt;&gt; He's more of a dog person?\n\n165\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I.\n\n166\n00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.140\n&gt;&gt; Smart move.\n\n167\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.559\n&gt;&gt; I thought I'd throw that in there for\nhim.\n\n168\n00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:53.610\nSo you can see in this particular\nAccess Database, I have tables, and\n\n169\n00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.579\nI have queries.\n\n170\n00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:55.879\nBut queries are tables.\n\n171\n00:07:55.879 --> 00:08:00.713\nSo this gets into Access, where we're just\ngonna kind of graze the surface right now.\n\n172\n00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:04.824\nSo if you have multiple tables, when you\nselect this as your data source and merge,\n\n173\n00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:08.758\nyou're gonna need to know, well,\ndo I wanna pull from the customer's table,\n\n174\n00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:10.950\ndo I want to pull from the employees?\n\n175\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.140\nSo you need to know your data source.\n\n176\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.190\nYou've gotta understand like\nwhat's going on in this file and\n\n177\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.820\nwhich one we want to use.\n\n178\n00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.060\nBecause you can use the same\nfile in multiple mail merges,\n\n179\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.810\nmaybe you have six different mail merges,\nand\n\n180\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.350\nfiles won't, each one can be a different\ntable, but going back to the same file.\n\n181\n00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.398\nSo just kinda know that that's what's\ngonna need to happen when you choose\n\n182\n00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:33.950\nAccess as your data source.\n\n183\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.290\nSo, like I said,\nlet's do this as an example.\n\n184\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.553\nWe will select the recipients\nhere in our Word mail merge and\n\n185\n00:08:42.553 --> 00:08:46.217\nI will go over here,\nwe'll go over to our desktop,\n\n186\n00:08:46.217 --> 00:08:50.067\nwe will go to our folder and\npick the Access database.\n\n187\n00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:55.711\nRight there you could see that says hey\nwhich one do you want, queries or tables?\n\n188\n00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:58.636\n&gt;&gt; Pull in that information,\nif that's the one you want, and\n\n189\n00:08:58.636 --> 00:09:02.230\nwe'll just choose a customer's table for\nan example.\n\n190\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.010\nNothing really happens, and that's okay.\n\n191\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.015\nIt doesn't give you like, yes, you did it!\n\n192\n00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:10.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You're all right.\n\n193\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.572\nIf you don't get any warnings,\nyou know you're good.\n\n194\n00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:15.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, warnings let you\nknow things have gone wrong.\n\n195\n00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.470\nNothing is like, okay.\n\n196\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.200\nI'm good with that.\n\n197\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] the thing how you\ncan check if this is working in\n\n198\n00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.788\nthe insert merged field,\n\n199\n00:09:23.788 --> 00:09:28.461\nif you're drop down is showing that\nheader row, of that information?\n\n200\n00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:33.116\nThen you know that you've made that\nconnection, and that's where you would\n\n201\n00:09:33.116 --> 00:09:37.555\ngo ahead and then insert the fields\ninto your letter or envelopes or mail or\n\n202\n00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:41.990\nthe other things that you can make\na mail merge where you need to go.\n\n203\n00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.590\nThis episode we are not\ngonna concentrate on that,\n\n204\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.720\nwe're just doing our data sources.\n\n205\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.780\nSounds lovely.\n\n206\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.364\nSo let's switch back over here and\nkeep on going.\n\n207\n00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:52.915\nI wanted to go ahead and\nthrow this in because when we have Access,\n\n208\n00:09:52.915 --> 00:09:56.430\nOkay, it's almost like,\nokay, we have Excel, right?\n\n209\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's right down there.\n\n210\n00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.790\nI would say it's a very popular option but\nthat's a spreadsheet application.\n\n211\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I think people kinda confuse it with\n\n212\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.340\na database even though\nyou can hold data in it.\n\n213\n00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.740\n&gt;&gt; It works very similarly to a database,\nalthough it is not a database proper.\n\n214\n00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n215\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.300\nAnd just how it works and everything but\nit's gonna store things in rows and\n\n216\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.820\ncolumns so,\nI would say that there is Excel, right.\n\n217\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.130\n&gt;&gt; Then you can go up to the next level,\nI was gonna say.\n\n218\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.655\n&gt;&gt; Excel is your gateway drug.\n\n219\n00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:23.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You move into the hardcore\n\n220\n00:10:23.482 --> 00:10:25.330\nAccess right, a real database.\n\n221\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.582\n&gt;&gt; Man, and when you get to SQL.\n\n222\n00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:28.895\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Don't even get started on Oracle.\n\n223\n00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:32.648\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, we're such dorks.\n\n224\n00:10:32.648 --> 00:10:35.424\nSo yeah, so you have Excel and\nthen Access,\n\n225\n00:10:35.424 --> 00:10:38.400\nnext level up as a true database program.\n\n226\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.070\nThen you got SQL, and SQL stands for?\n\n227\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.325\n&gt;&gt; SQL, it stands for\nStructured Query Language.\n\n228\n00:10:44.325 --> 00:10:45.270\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n229\n00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.110\n&gt;&gt; Now Microsoft,\nhere's a little geek-out for you,\n\n230\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:54.880\nMicrosoft calls their product SQL, S-Q-L,\nSQL Server or Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n231\n00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.340\n&gt;&gt; The langauge that it uses\nis SQL is pronounced SQL,\n\n232\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.130\nwhich is Structured Query Langauge.\n\n233\n00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.275\nJust FYI in case you ever run into\none of those geeky type people.\n\n234\n00:11:05.275 --> 00:11:07.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's weird.\n\n235\n00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.470\nMicrosoft loves to do that.\n\n236\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.982\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is a platform,\n\n237\n00:11:10.982 --> 00:11:15.310\nnon-specific language that anybody.\n\n238\n00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.215\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna put our name on it.\n\n239\n00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:17.867\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n240\n00:11:17.867 --> 00:11:21.920\nit's like any type of device [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And whats funny is everybody now calls\n\n241\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.470\nit sequel because it just rolls\noff the tongue, instead of SQL.\n\n242\n00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nthey are two seperate entities.\n\n243\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.740\nBut it is like the next level of database,\nif you want to say.\n\n244\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.470\nAnd like you said,\nit uses that SQL language, and so\n\n245\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.750\nyou could have your information there.\n\n246\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.720\nNow, if you are an organization\nthat does something like that,\n\n247\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.970\nthen you can use that as your data source.\n\n248\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.813\nYou even mentioned like Oracle,\nOracle is a non-Microsoft product but\n\n249\n00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:50.026\nit's also a database and\nthen you've got all- databases,\n\n250\n00:11:50.026 --> 00:11:53.810\nwhen you get in to that world,\nI mean you get in to propriety databases.\n\n251\n00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:58.635\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no SQL and Mango and this,\nand that, and- don't get going.\n\n252\n00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:02.220\n[LAUGH] Keep it down in the kid league and\nyou'll be just fine.\n\n253\n00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.890\n&gt;&gt; But you might have that as an option.\n\n254\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.880\n&gt;&gt; You might, you might.\n\n255\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.540\nBut it's cool that it supports it.\n\n256\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.220\nThat you can do a mail\nmerge from a SQL database.\n\n257\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.340\nThat's kind of impressive,\nto be honest with you.\n\n258\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.520\n&gt;&gt; So\nI wanted to show you the steps on that.\n\n259\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.350\nSo if I come here to use an existing list.\n\n260\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.809\nWith that,\nyou're gonna go to this new source button.\n\n261\n00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:24.231\nIt's a server that you're going to\nhave to find like the pathway, and\n\n262\n00:12:24.231 --> 00:12:25.747\nyou gotta know where it's at.\n\n263\n00:12:25.747 --> 00:12:28.600\nSo let's go and look at it, and\nnotice that we have this little Wizard.\n\n264\n00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.485\nSo I've never connected to a SQL server,\nI'll just to tell you that right now, but\n\n265\n00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:33.220\nI do know that.\n\n266\n00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.255\n&gt;&gt; It does happen [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get the idea, the concept.\n\n268\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.560\nLike okay, am I doing this,\nam I using some type of ODBC.\n\n269\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.940\nOpen DataBase Connection.\n\n270\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.360\n&gt;&gt; No no no.\n\n271\n00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.120\nJust don't.\n\n272\n00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Yea, I know I know.\n\n273\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.560\nWe always talk about this.\n\n274\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.920\nI always think of it [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt;

So\n\n63\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.332\nwhy don't we just talk about those three\nfirst and what could be a problem.\n\n64\n00:02:23.332 --> 00:02:26.550\nWell, in Excel and\nAccess it could be that, hey,\n\n65\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.690\nyou go ahead and select the recipients and\nthere's this Excel file and it says, nope.\n\n66\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.286\nIt could be the file's corrupted.\n\n67\n00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:32.790\nIt does happen, right?\n\n68\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.482\n&gt;&gt; It does happen.\n\n69\n00:02:33.482 --> 00:02:36.874\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI mean, it could be that somewhere along\n\n70\n00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:41.690\nthe way some little byte of information\ngot itself all in a tizzy and\n\n71\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.010\ndecided to just come\ncrash the whole thing.\n\n72\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, there's nothing you can do.\n\n73\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.599\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to life.\n\n74\n00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's just the gremlins,\n\n75\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.416\nas I call it.\n\n76\n00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:52.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The ghost in the machine.\n\n77\n00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.850\nWe don't have any explanation for it.\n\n78\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.080\nSo if somebody send you a file\nthat is messed up, hopefully,\n\n79\n00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.910\nyou can ask them to send it to you again.\n\n80\n00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.180\nMaybe try to save it out in a different\nfile format on their end, not\n\n81\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.490\nnecessarily in your end, because once it's\ncorrupt, you can't do anything with it.\n\n82\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.920\nSo that could be an issue,\nfor fairly any file I guess.\n\n83\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.760\nI shouldn't just limit it to Access or\nExcel, and then a SQL one.\n\n84\n00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.004\nWe had a fun time,\ngeeking out about a SQL over there.\n\n85\n00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:24.060\nIs well,\nmaybe they changed their credentials.\n\n86\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.051\nBecause that's something that you,\nas an end user,\n\n87\n00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:30.384\nwould need to know how to get\nto that particular SQL server.\n\n88\n00:03:30.384 --> 00:03:34.520\nAnd then the user name and\npassword to go ahead and get in.\n\n89\n00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.410\nAnd maybe somebody in your\nIT department changed it.\n\n90\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And didn't tell you.\n\n91\n00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:41.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThose happen as well.\n\n92\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.494\n&gt;&gt; Those are always the fun ones.\n\n93\n00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:45.290\n&gt;&gt; I've been there,\nwhy can I not log into this?\n\n94\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.612\nYou go super slow typing in your password.\n\n95\n00:03:47.612 --> 00:03:48.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you didn't work.\n\n96\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.280\nOkay, I hate this thing.\n\n97\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.971\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That actually happened with\n\n98\n00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:55.240\nme and Ronnie, because we both\nshare these OfficePro accounts.\n\n99\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.630\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n100\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nhe was doing an Office365, a show.\n\n101\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.415\nAnd I went in to log in and\nit's showing, I'm like, what's going on?\n\n102\n00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:06.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he was in the middle of a show,\n\n103\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.570\nand he comes out and he's like, just to\nlet you know, I changed Joey's password\n\n104\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.942\none character, and I was like,\nwell, that totally explains it.\n\n105\n00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:15.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I mean,\n\n106\n00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:15.965\nthat can happen\n&gt;&gt; It does happen.\n\n107\n00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:16.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n108\n00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.620\nSo if you're talking about SQL servers and\nhow to make that connection, and\n\n109\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.860\nsometimes the connections just get\nall wonky and you have to redo them.\n\n110\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.580\nSo all of those could be issues.\n\n111\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.560\nAnd I don't really have any\ndemonstrations of that.\n\n112\n00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.470\nSo just crop files and\nchanging credentials.\n\n113\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.416\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Fully pause.\n\n114\n00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:34.916\n&gt;&gt; You do a crop file and\nit just says, cannot open file\n\n115\n00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:35.518\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n116\n00:04:35.518 --> 00:04:36.478\n&gt;&gt; Please try another.\n\n117\n00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:37.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is one of\n\n118\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.040\nthe importance of back ups.\n\n119\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] backup, backup, backup.\n\n120\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, backup everything.\n\n121\n00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.165\nThat's important.\n\n122\n00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:47.217\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my iPhone keeps giving me that\nlike, you haven't backed up in 52 weeks.\n\n123\n00:04:47.217 --> 00:04:47.784\nI'm like, whoops.\n\n124\n00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:48.622\n&gt;&gt; Whoa.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n125\n00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.275\nI should probably do that.\n\n126\n00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:50.951\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n127\n00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:54.893\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nI'm not listening to our own rules.\n\n128\n00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:58.155\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not, and\nVonne is gonna experience a very bad day.\n\n129\n00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:00.346\n&gt;&gt; I should do that as soon as it's\n[CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; There is a reckoning.\n\n130\n00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:01.705\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I need to knock on wood or\n\n131\n00:05:01.705 --> 00:05:03.435\nsomething but I don't wanna hurt tails for\nyears [LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:04.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so\n\n133\n00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:08.731\nyes definitely back up all your files,\nhave different alternatives for\n\n134\n00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:09.825\nthings to happen.\n\n135\n00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:13.977\nNow one of the ones that I can show you,\nguys.\n\n136\n00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:16.280\nIs with the CSV file format.\n\n137\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.980\nNow, CSV, Common Separated Value.\n\n138\n00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.070\nWe explained it as,\n\n139\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.990\nthis is a platform agnostic,\ncan go from all different places.\n\n140\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.275\nIt's this wonderful language,\nit's like a transport language.\n\n141\n00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:31.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's how you get from\n\n142\n00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.970\none place to another.\n\n143\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.630\nWell, it doesn't always work that way.\n\n144\n00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.540\nSo let's go ahead and\njump down into our computer, and\n\n145\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.515\nlet me take you down this path\nthat has frustrated me to no end.\n\n146\n00:05:43.515 --> 00:05:46.485\nAnd I don't know what's going on.\n\n147\n00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:47.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because we saw like we've\n\n148\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.990\nconnected to a CSV file.\n\n149\n00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.230\nI think it was the department and\naddress file.\n\n150\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.840\n&gt;&gt; I believe so.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n151\n00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.290\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; It worked perfect, right?\n\n152\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.240\nSo this one is a department\nI just order into CSV file,\n\n153\n00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.080\nnow I made this on my Macintosh, right.\n\n154\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.715\nOkay, the original Excel file,\nthe department address is, I made them\n\n155\n00:06:06.715 --> 00:06:12.045\non this PC from like on my Excel show\na while ago, or some show, I don't know.\n\n156\n00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:15.445\nThen I did the Mac version, okay,\nbecause I use the same files a lot,\n\n157\n00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:18.275\nI just kind of put it up in Dropbox then\nput it back down and move it around and\n\n158\n00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:19.355\neverything like that.\n\n159\n00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:23.955\nSo I made this particular\nfile off of the Excel file,\n\n160\n00:06:23.955 --> 00:06:28.610\nsaved it as a CSV file, did some\nchanges and everything's fine, right?\n\n161\n00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.730\nWell, it doesn't work.\n\n162\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.490\nLet me just show you, okay?\n\n163\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.880\nLet me walk you through\nthe steps [LAUGH] and\n\n164\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.982\nI can like, insert,\npull out your hair at this point.\n\n165\n00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:43.560\n[LAUGH] So if I come over here to\nmailings and I select my recipients and\n\n166\n00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.960\nwe use an existing list.\n\n167\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.000\nJust like last time, we'll find that\nparticular CSV file, and there it is.\n\n168\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.760\nAnd the only thing with this particular\nfile, it's different than the other\n\n169\n00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.170\ndepartment and address, is I added\nan extra column with the record number.\n\n170\n00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.470\nI put one, two, three, four,\nfive, six in the data source.\n\n171\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.270\nCuz I was demonstrating a specific\nreason why you might want to have that.\n\n172\n00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.150\nWatch, come into here and\nthen you're like, okay, well,\n\n173\n00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.500\nwe saw this one before, we're good.\n\n174\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.810\nAnd what did I tell everybody,\nI just said, just click OK, right?\n\n175\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.880\nJust whatever the encoding says,\ngo for it.\n\n176\n00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.180\n&gt;&gt; Click your way through it.\n\n177\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.100\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you click OK\n&gt;&gt; And then you're like,\n\n178\n00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.230\nwait, what's going on here?\n\n179\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.060\nOkay, well, this is kind of an odd one.\n\n180\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.950\nThis is a CSV file, right?\n\n181\n00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.619\nYou saw the extension.\n\n182\n00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:29.890\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n183\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.570\n&gt;&gt; What are those things right here,\nDaniel?\n\n184\n00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.792\nI don't know if you can see those.\n\n185\n00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:34.700\n&gt;&gt; They look like the little tab arrows.\n\n186\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.328\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, weird.\n\n187\n00:07:36.328 --> 00:07:36.887\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n188\n00:07:36.887 --> 00:07:39.680\nI thought this was a CSV file.\n\n189\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.485\nWhy does it have, okay, so\nthat's my first indication of like,\n\n190\n00:07:42.485 --> 00:07:43.867\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n191\n00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:49.200\nBut I'm gonna keep going, well, it says\nthat it's a comma, so I'm gonna click it.\n\n192\n00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.083\nAnd then it's gonna go, nope,\nI have no idea what's going on here,\n\n193\n00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.204\nthe data records were empty.\n\n194\n00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:57.709\nWhat's going on?\n\n195\n00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:00.719\nOkay, so you come over to the file.\n\n196\n00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:02.463\nAnd you open it.\n\n197\n00:08:02.463 --> 00:08:06.556\nWe've talked that you can open it in Excel\nby default or you could right-click and\n\n198\n00:08:06.556 --> 00:08:07.520\nsee it in Notepad.\n\n199\n00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.498\nSo let's open this, double-click it.\n\n200\n00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:12.172\nIt opens up in Excel, so\nI'm thinking okay, everything's fine.\n\n201\n00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:16.770\nThis is a big indication to me\nthat something has gone wrong.\n\n202\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.910\nIf I select this and\njust try to do an auto fit.\n\n203\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.470\nThis isn't in columns is it?\n\n204\n00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.260\nEverything is in column A.\n\n205\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.724\nSo, the first last apartment\nall of that is not,\n\n206\n00:08:29.724 --> 00:08:32.670\nthere's no separators.\n\n207\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.225\n[LAUGH] Okay, what's going on?\n\n208\n00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:39.457\nYes, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n209\n00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:40.290\n&gt;&gt; Very strange.\n\n210\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Mine is more like this.\n\n211\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.280\nI start doing this, but\nI start like flipping my hair.\n\n212\n00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.120\nGosh now I'm getting my hair stuck,\nmy hands on my hair, I was like, what?\n\n213\n00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.486\nBecause I'm not gonna save my changes,\nso then I open this and\n\n214\n00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:53.763\nthis is happening to\nme on my Mac site too.\n\n215\n00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:54.945\nI was like okay,\n\n216\n00:08:54.945 --> 00:09:00.260\nI don't understand somehow if I open\nthis up there is no commas in here.\n\n217\n00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:06.620\nBut it started as Excel and I saved as\na CSV, but then I turned it to tabs.\n\n218\n00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.890\nI don't know, I have no clue.\n\n219\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.930\n&gt;&gt; Hit with a transmogrifying ray or\nI don't know.\n\n220\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:17.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it's just like, this is\nthe whole concept of a CSV file, right?\n\n221\n00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.510\nIs that you could go ahead and-\n&gt;&gt; It goes anywhere,\n\n222\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.170\neverybody understands\ncommon separated value.\n\n223\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and so if I'm make it on\nmy Mac and I give it to you on your PC,\n\n224\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.530\nyou should be able to open it just fine,\neverything should work.\n\n225\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.783\n&gt;&gt; Apparently, that is not the case.\n\n226\n00:09:30.783 --> 00:09:32.150\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I don't know.\n\n227\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.140\nI have no clue why it did this.\n\n228\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.120\nSo it really was making me very upset.\n\n229\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.918\nAnd then I'm like-\n&gt;&gt; Three computers\n\n230\n00:09:38.918 --> 00:09:39.590\nlater-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n231\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:40.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n233\n00:09:41.242 --> 00:09:43.550\nexactly.\nSo yeah,\n\n234\n00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.960\nI'm glad we got AppleCare on this\ncuz I've destroyed it, yeah.\n\n235\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.520\nSo don't know why, but can I fix it?\n\n236\n00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.440\n&gt;&gt; That's the question.\n\n237\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.870\n&gt;&gt; This is how you can do it.\n\n238\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.485\nThere are separators in there,\nit's not a comma but there's-\n\n239\n00:09:59.485 --> 00:10:00.890\n&gt;&gt; For whatever reason.\n\n240\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:01.527\n&gt;&gt; For whatever reason.\n\n241\n00:10:01.527 --> 00:10:02.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n242\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.380\n&gt;&gt; But there is a tab, so\nthis is what I would do.\n\n243\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:10.850\nI would open this particular\nfile with Notepad, not Excel.\n\n244\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.370\nI will do a Ctrl+A for select all.\n\n245\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.100\nI will copy this.\n\n246\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.370\nCtrl+C or I'll right-click to copy this.\n\n247\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.950\nThere is a delimiter in there.\n\n248\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.460\nI'm just using my search to\nstart Excel up right here.\n\n249\n00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:32.050\nAs long as there is a separator,\nif you open up a new Excel file and\n\n250\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.030\nthen, in the first cell just paste it,\nit comes in just fine, see?\n\n251\n00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.940\nThere's the column.\n\n252\n00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.700\nEverybody's in this columns again,\neverybody's back to being okay.\n\n253\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.920\nAll right, cool.\n\n254\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.743\n&gt;&gt; See Von this is why we'll be fighting\nthe machines in the near future\n\n255\n00:10:49.743 --> 00:10:51.021\ncuz they hate us.\n\n256\n00:10:51.021 --> 00:10:53.850\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH], yeah and\nthese are those gremlins that happen.\n\n257\n00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.294\nI don't know why they do this,\nbut somehow something went weird.\n\n258\n00:10:58.294 --> 00:11:03.415\nBut this is the key though, as long as\nthe data has consistent delimiters,\n\n259\n00:11:03.415 --> 00:11:08.538\nwhether it's a tab or it's comma,\nwell really it's the tab that are gonna\n\n260\n00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:13.042\nwork for this particular trick,\nthe commas gets a little weird.\n\n261\n00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:17.930\nYou would have to use an import cuz\nyou could do a new worksheet or\n\n262\n00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.050\nnew Excel file coming to Data and\nthen Import The data,\n\n263\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.010\nI think it's just easier to copy and\npaste.\n\n264\n00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:25.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Honestly.\n\n265\n00:11:25.535 --> 00:11:28.479\nAnd if I had a CSV file that was getting\n\n266\n00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:32.480\nall weird, I'd go ahead and\nopen it in Word.\n\n267\n00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.230\nI would do a find and replace, maybe.\n\n268\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n269\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.480\n&gt;&gt; Or try to convert that to a Word table.\n\n270\n00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.760\nLike, go ahead and\ndo the convert text table.\n\n271\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.934\nThen, from the table selected copy and\npaste it into Excel, or take,\n\n272\n00:11:44.934 --> 00:11:48.141\nokay everywhere you find a comma,\nchange it to a tab and\n\n273\n00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:52.432\nthen copy it from Word and then paste\nit into Excel, then save it as a CSV.\n\n274\n00:11:52.432 --> 00:11:58.876\nDid you see that kind of weird, I see\nyou kind of glazed over for a second.\n\n275\n00:11:58.876 --> 00:11:59.832\n&gt;&gt; She said words.\n\n276\n00:11:59.832 --> 00:12:02.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n277\n00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:05.419\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.dont It's again,\n\n278\n00:12:05.419 --> 00:12:08.389\nif you have the consistent delimiter,\n\n279\n00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:13.339\nif you can get the text out of it,\nput it into Word and or Excel, and\n\n280\n00:12:13.339 --> 00:12:19.369\ndo those kind of tricks to get it into a\ntabular format and then get it into Excel,\n\n281\n00:12:19.369 --> 00:12:24.830\nsave it out as its own CSV or\nExcel file from there, and you'll be fine.\n\n282\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.720\nI think, I don't know, but maybe something\n\n283\n00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.720\nthat goes from Mac to PC, or PC to Mac,\nsometimes they just don't play very well.\n\n284\n00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.570\n&gt;&gt; I 'm guessing it has to do with\nwhatever encoding mechanism that\n\n285\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.160\neach one of those uses is just\nslightly different than the other,\n\n286\n00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.130\nand therefore you get some inconsistencies\nwhen bouncing back and forth.\n\n287\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where you have that\nwarning that we saw in our Mail Merge,\n\n288\n00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.510\nlike what encoding?\n\n289\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.190\nAnd I just said to give your default.\n\n290\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.620\nI did an experiment, I tried all sorts\nof different ones, still didn't work.\n\n291\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.759\nBut again it's because there wasn't\nany commas in there, there was tabs.\n\n292\n00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.730\nAnyways, try these workarounds.\n\n293\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.383\nIf you can get it, get it into Excel,\n\n294\n00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:07.332\nsave it out into its PC version\nof an Excel file or a CSV.\n\n295\n00:13:07.332 --> 00:13:10.540\nAnd then use that data source.\n\n296\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.710\nOkay, cool, so\n\n297\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.190\nworkarounds, if you're not very familiar\nwith doing converting text to tables, or\n\n298\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.550\nabout find and replace, we do have all\nof those episodes in other Word series.\n\n299\n00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.810\nSo definitely check those out.\n\n300\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.610\nDo a little search within our library and\nyou can find them.\n\n301\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.660\nSo if I'm talking a little Greek, and this\nis again, since I was like, you do this,\n\n302\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.776\ndo this,\ncuz I've had to do it a couple times.\n\n303\n00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:31.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:36.150\n&gt;&gt; So watch it, that can be an issue, and\n\n305\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.620\na little bit of a work run.\n\n306\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.232\nSo I'm gonna close this,\nI'm not gonna save the changes.\n\n307\n00:13:40.232 --> 00:13:41.475\nLet's go ahead and\n\n308\n00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:45.990\nclose the Notepad and back to Word,\nand this is our source document.\n\n309\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.600\nOkay, cool, staying on that whole CSV,\n\n310\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.120\nwhat if you have the CSV\nitself gets a little weird.\n\n311\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.610\nLet me give you an example.\n\n312\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.630\nWhen you have extra or missing characters,\nI'm going to open up, and I'm looking\n\n313\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:08.070\nat my notes to make sure I get the right\nfile, The Department and Team Color CSV.\n\n314\n00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.630\nI'm gonna open this up in Notepad,\nnot in Excel, to show you.\n\n315\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.910\nSo I think you'll be\nable to see it in here.\n\n316\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.590\nSo, do you see the second and third line?\n\n317\n00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.850\nDo you see that Daniel?\n\n318\n00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:22.714\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; You see that,\n\n319\n00:14:22.714 --> 00:14:26.318\nwe've got a kind of a little issue\ngoing on right here, you see that?\n\n320\n00:14:26.318 --> 00:14:27.308\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking.\n\n321\n00:14:27.308 --> 00:14:28.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n322\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.200\nthere is a missing field, or whatever.\n\n323\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.660\nThere's two commas.\n\n324\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.544\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's an extra comma, because if\nwe have comma, comma, comma, chameleon.\n\n325\n00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, I couldn't help it.\n\n326\n00:14:39.528 --> 00:14:42.100\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't help yourself.\n\n327\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.680\nLife only just throws you a ball\nstraight down the line every so often.\n\n328\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.077\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm just like I\ncouldn't help it, I'm sorry.\n\n329\n00:14:48.077 --> 00:14:53.120\nBut yes, there is an extra comma in\nthere that's one two, three, four.\n\n330\n00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.940\nThere's only one, two, three.\n\n331\n00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.775\nSo there's an extra.\n\n332\n00:14:55.775 --> 00:14:58.388\nIn here there's only one,\ntwo, there's a missing one.\n\n333\n00:14:58.388 --> 00:15:01.450\nNow, I purposely did this, okay?\n\n334\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.586\nSo you could see that something\nis just not going right.\n\n335\n00:15:05.586 --> 00:15:08.340\nThey've missed something,\nthere's a blank field.\n\n336\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.130\nSo let's try to connect that as\nour data source here in Word.\n\n337\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.320\nSo we'll go to select Recipients,\nwe'll choose an existing list,\n\n338\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.860\nwe'll go over to our folder.\n\n339\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.530\nAnd we will find the team color,\nthere it is.\n\n340\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.780\nSame thing, should be fine,\nclick okay, okay but\n\n341\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.190\nI know that there's a comma, so we're\ngonna click the comma is the deliminator,\n\n342\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:36.320\nrecord delimiter meaning\nthe paragraph is enter, click Okay.\n\n343\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.690\nAnd then it's like, record one became\ntoo many data fields, and we said that.\n\n344\n00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.067\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we did.\n\n345\n00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:44.630\n&gt;&gt; And then record too few.\n\n346\n00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] so hey, it sees that.\n\n347\n00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.620\nSo you're gonna get these,\nno, okay, I don't understand.\n\n348\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.803\nIt'll still connect.\n\n349\n00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:58.203\nIt'll still give this to you, but\nif you are using like first and last And\n\n350\n00:15:58.203 --> 00:16:02.618\nthen I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo this really quickly to show you here.\n\n351\n00:16:02.618 --> 00:16:04.210\nAnd there we go.\n\n352\n00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.930\nAnd let's zoom in just a little bit.\n\n353\n00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.280\nWhen we preview this, it's saying,\nokay, well there's, it's missing.\n\n354\n00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.760\nBecause that one wasn't there,\nand this one, no it's too few.\n\n355\n00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.700\nI don't understand.\n\n356\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.590\nBut the rest of them will be okay.\n\n357\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.640\nSo it's not a make or break.\n\n358\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.490\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n394\n00:17:46.948 --> 00:17:48.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But now you can see it, right?\n\n395\n00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.890\nOne, two, three, four, five, six,\nyeah, everybody, we have a comma, no,\n\n396\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:53.580\nthat's not a comma.\n\n397\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:59.400\nThat's a tab in each one of our columns,\nthe way that they're supposed to be.\n\n398\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.240\nSo nothing wrong with this file.\n\n399\n00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.145\nHa ha.\nYeah right.\n\n400\n00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:07.970\n[LAUGH] So I come into here,\n\n401\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:13.350\nI try to connect to the tabs, okay?\n\n402\n00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.300\nOkay, yep.\nTab is my delimiter, record.\n\n403\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.150\nNo, [LAUGH] it's saying it's empty,\nbut, wait, you saw it.\n\n404\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.130\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't empty.\n\n405\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.030\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't empty.\n\n406\n00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.060\n&gt;&gt; It even showed it not being empty.\n\n407\n00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit wasn't that weird comma to tab thing.\n\n408\n00:18:29.001 --> 00:18:30.060\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea.\n\n409\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.700\nI don't know.\n\n410\n00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Again, when the war against\nthe machines breaks out,\n\n411\n00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.700\nwe'll know why that they hate us.\n\n412\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:43.050\n&gt;&gt; So the only thing I'm thinking\nis the whole Mac to PC thing again.\n\n413\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:47.030\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nsomething in that whole encoding process\n\n414\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.960\nfrom one to the other is\njust somehow different.\n\n415\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.480\n&gt;&gt; But it's a text file.\n\n416\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.675\nIt's a txt-\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it probably would.\n\n431\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.920\n&gt;&gt; So what I did,\nis I took this tabs file,\n\n432\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.230\nI opened it in Notepad because\nnotice I have one that says tabs PC?\n\n433\n00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:38.880\nSo all I did is, I open it in notepad and\nthen I just change one character.\n\n434\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.370\nI did something, and\nI'll just show you really quickly.\n\n435\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.180\nI took this, I deleted the N and\ntyped the N in.\n\n436\n00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.000\nDid a File, Save As.\n\n437\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.920\nSaved it as a new file\nformat in the PC world.\n\n438\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.710\n&gt;&gt; And badabing.\n\n439\n00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:54.920\n&gt;&gt; And it was fine.\n\n440\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.270\nOkay, so,\nI'm not gonna save this particular one.\n\n441\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.310\nBut that was my work around for\nthat particular one.\n\n442\n00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.130\nOkay cool.\n\n443\n00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.110\nAs long as I kind of got\nit back into PC language,\n\n444\n00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.070\nit seemed to not have any problems.\n\n445\n00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.380\nAnd that's why I demonstrated that\nconnection in the previous episode as\n\n446\n00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.570\nthe let's use our txt PC file.\n\n447\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.277\nYeah so it worked right out.\n\n448\n00:20:18.277 --> 00:20:22.210\n[LAUGH] So I can at least show\nyou how it's supposed to run.\n\n449\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:29.390\nAll right, wonderful And then the last\none with the Word document Azure table.\n\n450\n00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.675\nI have Word table two,\nbecause look at what happens,\n\n451\n00:20:32.675 --> 00:20:36.917\nwe've got extra text in here,\ngot a title, use this for mail merge.\n\n452\n00:20:36.917 --> 00:20:37.837\n&gt;&gt;

Thank you, it's going wonderful, and\nthere's so much trouble, we had to do two.\n\n11\n00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:34.881\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:38.040\n&gt;&gt; Just when we thought it was\nsafe to open a mail merge back up.\n\n13\n00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.070\nYeah, no.\n\n14\n00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.830\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n15\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.590\n&gt;&gt; But again,\n\n16\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.470\nsince I want to take the time to really\nexplain all these little pieces.\n\n17\n00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.760\nThat's why we did make a part\ntwo because I had more to say.\n\n18\n00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.270\nOkay, more about our files.\n\n19\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.530\nSpecifically we're going to talk\na little more about some Excel tips and\n\n20\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.370\ntricks and\nsomething about cell formatting.\n\n21\n00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.990\nWe're also gonna get into switching\nyour files, and how that all works.\n\n22\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.300\nTrying to give you the gamut of\nproblems with your data source.\n\n23\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.930\nAnd again we are concentrating on that\nparticular area not like writing a letter\n\n24\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.420\nand all that kind of stuff because your\ndata source has to be connected properly\n\n25\n00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.110\nfor any of this to work, so\nthat's why it's such an important concept.\n\n26\n00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.510\nAnd why there's a part\ntwo of troubleshooting.\n\n27\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.462\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:27.690\n&gt;&gt; So, let's start off with some Excel and\n\n29\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.480\nDatasource tips.\n\n30\n00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.560\nWon't we jump down into here.\n\n31\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.830\nWe've seen the department and\naddress file,\n\n32\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.020\nthe XLSX file, a couple times\nthroughout these episodes so far.\n\n33\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.580\nI wanted to point some things out in\nthis one that you should be aware of.\n\n34\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.978\nAnd then I'll show you, I'm gonna tell\nyou don't do this and then I'm gonna open\n\n35\n00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:52.637\nthe file and then it's going to be like,\nwell didn't do it anyway.\n\n36\n00:01:52.637 --> 00:01:54.526\nSo why are you telling me?\n\n37\n00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:56.061\nIt's just gonna fix itself.\n\n38\n00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:57.890\nYeah, but you never know.\n\n39\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n40\n00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.690\nSo just be very careful.\n\n41\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.130\nEspecially when I was doing the Mac series\n\n42\n00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.661\non this one, the Mac is way less forgiving\nwhen it comes to mail merge with this\n\n43\n00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:08.160\nparticular issue.\nWell,\n\n44\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.750\nthen tell us what the issue is Vonne.\n\n45\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.700\nWhite space, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.910\nWhen we connected this particular\ndata source into our Word document,\n\n47\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.750\nand I'll show you that in a second.\n\n48\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.850\nThe fields came up and I think we\ntalked about the underscore, I can't,\n\n49\n00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.790\ndid we do that-\n&gt;&gt; I think we did, it sounds familiar.\n\n50\n00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.020\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we might have.\n\n51\n00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.370\n&gt;&gt; We may have done it\nin the other series.\n\n52\n00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.100\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n&gt;&gt; But I don't think we tackled it yet.\n\n53\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.710\nLet's go ahead and do it now,\njust in case we haven't.\n\n54\n00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.290\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nSo, in this particular,\n\n55\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.450\nlike up here phone number,\nthere is a space between phone and number,\n\n56\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.100\nwhich it should have that because that's-\n&gt;&gt; That's proper English\n\n57\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n58\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.460\nAnd in the address,\n555 space Christmas space lane.\n\n59\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.700\nBut you wanna avoid the white\nspace after the data information.\n\n60\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.786\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz you can get super used to or\n\n61\n00:02:57.786 --> 00:03:00.700\nit becomes a habit to where you're typing\nalong and you're used to hitting space\n\n62\n00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.540\nafter every word because typically\nyou're having another word following it.\n\n63\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.280\nSo this can happen.\n\n64\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.880\nI've done this myself.\n\n65\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.880\nIt can plague you.\n\n66\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.460\nYou're going, why isn't,\nwell, I write scripts.\n\n67\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.220\nI write programs from time to time.\n\n68\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.770\nAnd white space will plague me,\nbecause I'll do that very thing.\n\n69\n00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd this is in the data source.\n\n70\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.520\nAnd if you're thinking, if I'm going to\ngo ahead and take someone's first name,\n\n71\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.030\nspace, last name,\nthen I only want one space in there.\n\n72\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.240\nWell, in your data source,\nif there's an extra space-\n\n73\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.480\n&gt;&gt; So if it's first name, space,\n\n74\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.095\nlast name, space,\nyou don't see the space, but it's there\n\n75\n00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n76\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.170\nYes, or\nwhat if it's the space on the first name.\n\n77\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.480\nYes, so then I would have something like,\nSasha space space Cat.\n\n78\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because it's in here.\n\n79\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.160\nAnd I'm gonna really zoom in on this one,\nand\n\n80\n00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.360\nI'm doing my Ctrl scroll wheel,\nlovely shortcut.\n\n81\n00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.490\nSo in Sasha, Sasha Cat, right.\n\n82\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.730\nSo Sasha, if I double click in here,\nsee the flashing cursor right there?\n\n83\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.990\nI'm gonna use my right arrow key.\n\n84\n00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.160\nAnd you see how it is moving, the I beam,\n\n85\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.360\nbecause there is actually\ntwo spaces in there.\n\n86\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.350\nIf I come come to Pooma,\nand I come all the way,\n\n87\n00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.870\nno see,\nthere's no white space out after that.\n\n88\n00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're pushing your arrow over\nbut's it's not moving over because there's\n\n89\n00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.050\nno space to arrow over to.\n\n90\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Correct, so that's one of those things\nyou gotta be very careful about is in\n\n91\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.150\nthe data source if you were writing\na letter of first name last name,\n\n92\n00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.810\nyou don't want extra spaces in there.\n\n93\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.620\nAnd then cuz then it's gonna\nlook a little wonky, okay.\n\n94\n00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.020\nSo good, we need to know about that.\n\n95\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.250\nAnd the reason why I was\ntalking about the field,\n\n96\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.110\nis like well that's a space,\nI need a space there.\n\n97\n00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.080\nThat's okay, there's nothing wrong with\nputting a space in your header row,\n\n98\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.300\nbecause it needs to have it.\n\n99\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.600\nIt makes sense to you.\n\n100\n00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.460\nWell let's close this file,\nI'm not gonna save any of the changes, but\n\n101\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.400\nremember it does have\nthose spaces in there.\n\n102\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.580\nNow, this particular file,\nthe merge merge, right?\n\n103\n00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.280\nThe one we've been using as an example?\n\n104\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.320\nIt does have a data connection to that\nparticular Excel file, I know it is,\n\n105\n00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.500\nbecause I made it.\n\n106\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.590\nSo, I know that that's where it's going.\n\n107\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.110\nSo, yes,\nwe definitely want to go ahead and\n\n108\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.650\naccept this,\nwe talked about that in the last episode.\n\n109\n00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.860\nOr, two episodes.\n\n110\n00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.540\nSomewhere in there,\n\n111\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.480\nyou're always gonna get a warning\nwhen you open up a file that has it.\n\n112\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.750\nIn the Mailings Insert field,\nthat's what I was talking about.\n\n113\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.550\nRight here.\n\n114\n00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.680\nSee, it says Phone_Number.\n\n115\n00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.190\nIt's like, I didn't put an underscore.\n\n116\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.060\nWhen it's translating the top row fields,\n\n117\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.100\nit's not that you can't have white space,\nor you can't have spaces,\n\n118\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.890\nit's just going to translate it into,\nwell, I have to see it in my brain.\n\n119\n00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.130\nYou talked about writing scripts?\n\n120\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's writing that kind of script in\n\n121\n00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.010\nthe background.\n\n122\n00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.360\nIt doesn't allow its internal brain for\nspaces, so it's going to put underscores.\n\n123\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.320\n&gt;&gt; So,\nit interprets white spaces as underscores.\n\n124\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.200\nSo, if you're seeing underscores, and\nyou're like, why is that underscore there?\n\n125\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.380\nThat's because you probably accidentally\nhave a white space after or\n\n126\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.300\nbefore or whatever.\n\n127\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.040\n&gt;&gt; And it will be in your headers,\nthe header row.\n\n128\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.290\nIt will only be in the field that\nyou can choose to write your merge.\n\n129\n00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.860\nBut, the data, let's scroll out here.\n\n130\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.900\nRemember that we did see that Sasha had\ntwo spaces in its data source, right?\n\n131\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.020\nSo if I'm gonna preview this,\nlet's look it here,\n\n132\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.440\nand let's turn on the show\nhigh characters so we can see.\n\n133\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.960\nYep, there is a space because\nI wrote that in the merge,\n\n134\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.090\nlet me turn off the preview,\nsee I've got it right there.\n\n135\n00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.550\nAnd we will zoom,\nwhoops that's the wrong one.\n\n136\n00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.024\nThis is the one I wanted to go with, okay?\n\n137\n00:06:27.024 --> 00:06:32.820\nWe'll preview, everything is looking fine,\nand this is where it totally\n\n138\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.210\ndefies me of what it should do Dear Sasha,\nspace, space, space Cat.\n\n139\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.850\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n140\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Because there was two extra-\n&gt;&gt; Because there's two spaces in there.\n\n141\n00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.300\n&gt;&gt; In the data source, right?\n\n142\n00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But I didn't do it.\n\n143\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.450\nSo, I don't know if this is kind\nof like a word doing an internal\n\n144\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.120\ncorrection of itself.\n\n145\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.930\nYeah, strange.\n\n146\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.520\n&gt;&gt; Because, if this was-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's because there's two spaces.\n\n147\n00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.760\nWhat if you only had one space?\n\n148\n00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.350\n&gt;&gt; I tried it.\n&gt;&gt; And it did the same thing?\n\n149\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.180\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah.\n\n150\n00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.020\nI don't know what-\n&gt;&gt; I could see it going, and\n\n151\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.210\nthere's two spaces, weird, you probably\nreally meant none, or one, or whatever.\n\n152\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this,\nin the Mail Merge Max series,\n\n153\n00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.020\nthis was a big, you saw it everywhere,\nit was very unforgiving.\n\n154\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.850\nSo I'm gonna throw a hm on this one,\n\n155\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.740\ncuz technically it should be doing this.\n\n156\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.880\nSo let's just go with don't rely on it,\nknow it could happen and\n\n157\n00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.720\nthat could be the issue.\n\n158\n00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.230\nAnd so if you do see this,\ndoing the spaces and\n\n159\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.580\neverything, check your data source and\nmake sure that that's not happening.\n\n160\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.510\nAnd there is like a formula you\n\n161\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.070\ncould do in Word-\n&gt;&gt; Excel.\n\n162\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Excel that can remove extra white\nspaces that don't need to be there,\n\n163\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.770\ndah dah dah, we're not gonna go into\nthat but just know it does exist.\n\n164\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.682\nIt's not demonstrating-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n165\n00:07:48.682 --> 00:07:51.759\n&gt;&gt; The rule I told you-\n&gt;&gt; But just because it's not happening now\n\n166\n00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:54.793\ndoesn't mean that it won't\nhappen especially if you start\n\n167\n00:07:54.793 --> 00:07:58.692\ncross-pollinating From Lenox, or\nLinux, Mac to Windows and vice versa.\n\n168\n00:07:58.692 --> 00:07:59.906\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They probably see that\n\n169\n00:07:59.906 --> 00:08:00.910\na whole lot more.\n\n170\n00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI would be amiss if I did not tell you.\n\n171\n00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:08.630\nThat this is a possibility,\nwe are talking about troubleshooting, so\n\n172\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.430\njust make sure that that is a,\nit's gonna happen one way or\n\n173\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.574\nanother some time in\nyour mail merging life.\n\n174\n00:08:15.574 --> 00:08:16.957\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So just know,\n\n175\n00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:19.830\nand say, I remember,\nVonne told me this could happen.\n\n176\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.900\nSo, okay, good thing.\n\n177\n00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.830\nLet's stay on this whole Excel thing for\njust a little bit.\n\n178\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.870\nI'm gonna close this file,\n\n179\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.480\nI'm not gonna save the changes\nbecause I didn't really do anything.\n\n180\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.403\nSo in Excel let's go back\nover to another file,\n\n181\n00:08:33.403 --> 00:08:37.381\nwe're gonna do the data source\ncell formatting, this is Excel.\n\n182\n00:08:37.381 --> 00:08:44.520\nNow in Excel you can have self formatting,\nalso known as number formats.\n\n183\n00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.560\nFor example in here notice that\nthat's a little too far okay.\n\n184\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.770\nI have donations and\nI have it displaying as currency.\n\n185\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.710\nI actually have this as accounting, and\n\n186\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.120\nI know that this is the accounting number\nformat, because it's up right here, okay?\n\n187\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.566\nAnd I get this is not a series on Excel,\nbut I wanted to point this out,\n\n188\n00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:06.791\nas I can format this as accounting,\nI can format it as currency.\n\n189\n00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:09.580\nDepends on where your dollar sign is.\n\n190\n00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.230\nBut it's a big thing in Excel about\nwhat you want your number formats to be.\n\n191\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.610\nSame thing with here.\n\n192\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.230\nI typed in 20, and\nit gave me a percentage.\n\n193\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.744\nI wanted to show that particular\ncharacter after this value.\n\n194\n00:09:21.744 --> 00:09:28.070\nAnd then zip codes, in Excel there's\nsomething about preceding zeros.\n\n195\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.630\nLike if I click over here, and\nI just typed in 00032, and then hit Enter.\n\n196\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.170\nSee, it drops those.\n\n197\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:34.827\nIt's kinda annoying.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n198\n00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:37.440\ncuz it sees it as a decimal integer,\nright?\n\n199\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.448\nYeah, it's just as like,\nthere's no zeros in it,\n\n200\n00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:44.850\nI'm only gonna display this without it,\nbut it's a valid number, right?\n\n201\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.360\n&gt;&gt; It is, and a I will evetually\nguess that it is seeing,\n\n202\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.760\nwhen you type in numbers, it says,\nthat's an integer value, right and\n\n203\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.560\nit's looking at that, so you have 0032.\n\n204\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.570\nWell zero zero, is not an integer, it's\na nothing value so, I don't even need it,\n\n205\n00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.020\nso drops it off.\n\n206\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.120\nBut if you want it to be a string\nof numbers, like a Zip Code,\n\n207\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.440\nwhich has no value other\nthan this is a Zip Code,\n\n208\n00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.860\nsomething interpreted us by humans,\nthen you're gonna have trouble with this.\n\n209\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.970\nYou need to tell it this is a string and\nnot an integer.\n\n210\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.500\n&gt;&gt; You couldn't have said that better.\n\n211\n00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.124\nThat was exactly, and half way\nthrough I'm like, you're geek talking,\n\n212\n00:10:23.124 --> 00:10:26.772\nthe integer thing, that math thing that\nyou and Justin know to talk about.\n\n213\n00:10:26.772 --> 00:10:27.730\n&gt;&gt; It's numbers.\n\n214\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.372\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Numbers and\n\n215\n00:10:28.372 --> 00:10:32.880\nstrings are different things even thouh\nyou can use the same characters for both.\n\n216\n00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; There's your problem.\n\n217\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.730\n&gt;&gt; My gosh you're so smart [LAUGH]\nthat was such a good explanation.\n\n218\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.518\nI just, I wanted to hit record [LAUGH]\nI wanted to record it right now.\n\n219\n00:10:41.518 --> 00:10:44.926\nI'm gonna take this as an excerpt and\nbe like just listen to Daniel.\n\n220\n00:10:44.926 --> 00:10:50.215\n[LAUGH] You're exactly correct, and\nthat's why this particular field,\n\n221\n00:10:50.215 --> 00:10:54.570\nI formatted this as a string,\nI said format this as text.\n\n222\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.600\nIt's the easiest way that you can\nmake Excel accept preceding zeros for\n\n223\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.070\nsomething just like Zip Codes,\nor phone numbers.\n\n224\n00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.290\nOr I guess phone numbers you\ncan't start with a zero, can you?\n\n225\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.010\n&gt;&gt; Like a real phone number?\n\n226\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think if it's like\n\n227\n00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.580\nan international call.\n\n228\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.934\n&gt;&gt; You might have a zero.\n\n229\n00:11:11.934 --> 00:11:13.210\n&gt;&gt; Like 01 is our country code?\n\n230\n00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n231\n00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sorry it's one of those,\ncan we do that?\n\n232\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.567\nI don't know.\n\n233\n00:11:17.567 --> 00:11:20.471\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\nSo you can see that I wanted this\n\n234\n00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:25.340\nparticular value as a string of text,\nand so I did that.\n\n235\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.020\nCool, so that's just a very\ncommon thing for an Excel tip.\n\n236\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.020\nThat's why you also have those\nlittle green arrows in there, or\n\n237\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.830\ntriangles in there, it's trying to tell\nyou that there's an error going on here.\n\n238\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.140\nSo it sees it as a number,\nbut, you format it as text.\n\n239\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.970\nCool, then I close this file\nto show you what happens,\n\n240\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.940\nsometimes what this does when\nyou're using mail merge.\n\n241\n00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.110\nMm, I already have this\nparticular Word document.\n\n242\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.677\nSo for my connected to that exact Excel\nfile that I was just showing you, and\n\n243\n00:11:53.677 --> 00:11:55.573\nI'm gonna say yes it's fine.\n\n244\n00:11:55.573 --> 00:12:00.570\nI already went ahead and\nwrote the fields out, or wrote the letter.\n\n245\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.070\nI inserted the different merge fields,\nI'm gonna preview this, get ready.\n\n246\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.990\nThat's not right.\n\n247\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.895\n&gt;&gt; That's special.\n\n248\n00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:09.953\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that, we should keep it.\n\n249\n00:12:09.953 --> 00:12:11.835\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, and it's like,\n\n250\n00:12:11.835 --> 00:12:12.786\nwell wait a second.\n\n251\n00:12:12.786 --> 00:12:18.610\nI had in the data source that it had\na dollar sign and two decimal places.\n\n252\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.620\nAnd this one was a percentage sign.\n\n253\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.826\nIt didn't like that, okay?\n\n254\n00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:24.210\nThat's not good.\n\n255\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.430\nSo, specifically these two\nare the biggest examples.\n\n256\n00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.620\nAnd they are the ones that will come\nup in the help files that will say hey,\n\n257\n00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.950\nyou gotta be careful of these things,\ncurrency doesn't come over.\n\n258\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.840\nAnd the percentage?\n\n259\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.516\nIt converts it.\n\n260\n00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:41.994\nBecause 20% is 0.2.\n\n261\n00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:42.540\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\n\n262\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd, I always say decimal.\n\n263\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.970\nIt's a number.\n\n264\n00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:48.820\n&gt;&gt; It's a number.\n\n265\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.860\nIt's an integer.\n\n266\n00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n267\n00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.200\nThe integer thing is back again.\n\n268\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.550\n&gt;&gt; It's here again.\n\n269\n00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.360\n&gt;&gt; So that could be a little wonky, right?\n\n270\n00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.490\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; What was it, hinky?\n\n271\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.669\n&gt;&gt; Hinky.\n&gt;&gt; That's a little hinky over there.\n\n272\n00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:02.308\n&gt;&gt; Weird.\n\n273\n00:13:02.308 --> 00:13:06.250\n&gt;&gt; So okay, well then you're gonna have\nto if you really need it to be 20,\n\n274\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.720\nand then percent.\n\n275\n00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.150\nOne, you're gonna need to make\nsure you don't format it in Excel\n\n276\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.285\nwith the percentage number formatting,\nso you would just put in 20 and\n\n277\n00:13:17.285 --> 00:13:19.450\nthen that would be your field value.\n\n278\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.250\nAnd then in your mail merged,\nI'm gonna turn this preview off, and\n\n279\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.880\nI can do this on the donation one.\n\n280\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.740\nI can't do it here because with\nthe whole decimal places and everything.\n\n281\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.690\nBut you would then have to come in here\nand like put in a $, then the donation,\n\n282\n00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.220\nthat's the value.\n\n283\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:41.151\nThen after it,\nI would put in whoops too far, a .00.\n\n284\n00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:46.070\nAnd now if I preview it, that's like $50.\n\n285\n00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.320\nSo there's parts that you have\nto do in the Word Mail merge.\n\n286\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.500\nAnd the same would be if I had in my data\nsource, I left it as 20, you would then\n\n287\n00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.440\nput in the percent as a character\nin Word as the static information.\n\n288\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.020\nAnd then the variable\ninformation would go from there.\n\n289\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:07.400\nSo you can see $100, $200, all that kind\nof stuff, for your different donations.\n\n290\n00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.380\nLittle things to know about\nwhen you're working with Excel\n\n291\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.580\nas your data source coming into Word.\n\n292\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.670\nGood to know.\n\n293\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.560\nWe will not save our changes.\n\n294\n00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.490\nAnd let's move on to another one-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.630\n&gt;&gt; That really rocked me\n\n296\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.350\na couple of times.\n\n297\n00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.080\nYou actually saw me do it.\n\n298\n00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.900\nIn the other episode that I was like,\nI wasn't ready to show you this cuz I was\n\n299\n00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.770\ntrying to show you everything\nlike working perfectly.\n\n300\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.160\n&gt;&gt; Perfectly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n301\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.550\nSo, back over here to that mail\nmerged document, right, or Word file.\n\n302\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:42.380\nWe know that is connected to that\ndepartment and addresses' Excel file.\n\n303\n00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.750\nIf you have a Word document that has\na connection to a specific data source,\n\n304\n00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.430\nyou can't open that data source.\n\n305\n00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.550\nIt's almost like an active session, right?\n\n306\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.370\nWe're talking to each other, we have\nour lines of communication going, so\n\n307\n00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.900\nI don't want anybody coming in and\ninterrupting me.\n\n308\n00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.800\nSo don't open this file and\ntry to edit it.\n\n309\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.880\nOkay, so if I come over to the Excel\nfile that it is attached to,\n\n310\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.630\nand I open it, there,\nthat's what happened.\n\n311\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:16.098\nAnd this was the weird\none because I thought,\n\n312\n00:15:16.098 --> 00:15:20.850\nin the other episode that we did\nwith existing lists episode.\n\n313\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.927\nI thought I was opening up the Excel S,\nI don't know.\n\n314\n00:15:24.927 --> 00:15:26.826\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I clicked the file.\n\n315\n00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:29.950\nBasically I was, well that was not\nsupposed to happen right now, but\n\n316\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.445\nnow you guys can see it, so\nit's coming aback again.\n\n317\n00:15:32.445 --> 00:15:34.334\n[LAUGH] Just rear it's ugly head.\n\n318\n00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.832\n[LAUGH] I was like why\ncan't I add it to it?\n\n319\n00:15:36.832 --> 00:15:39.802\nAnd then you're like,\nthis is another one would throw you off,\n\n320\n00:15:39.802 --> 00:15:42.454\nit's like it's opened by another user,\nit's like me.\n\n321\n00:15:42.454 --> 00:15:47.008\nI mean this is things you see\nwhen you have a shared workbooks\n\n322\n00:15:47.008 --> 00:15:49.843\nacross the networks if you get this.\n\n323\n00:15:49.843 --> 00:15:52.786\nI'm like, I didn't share it,\nthere is no other user,\n\n324\n00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.820\nI'm the only one on this computer.\n\n325\n00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.293\nI don't understand that kind of stuff.\n\n326\n00:15:57.293 --> 00:16:03.131\nSo it gives, to me, a weird warning\nthat I would not be expecting.\n\n327\n00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:08.901\nSo all right, it's open in Word and\nthat's data source if I close this.\n\n328\n00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.878\nSorry, I'm kind of clicking\naround really fast.\n\n329\n00:16:10.878 --> 00:16:13.954\nBut now I notice if I close the Word\ndocument, that opens just fine.\n\n330\n00:16:13.954 --> 00:16:17.740\n&gt;&gt; So because the Word document\nwas accessing it in a way,\n\n331\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.625\nit was seeing it as another\nuser is accessing this file.\n\n332\n00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:23.924\nIt’s locked out, sorry try again later.\n\n333\n00:16:23.924 --> 00:16:28.661\n&gt;&gt;

It seems like it would be\n\n28\n00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.240\npretty straightforward, though, because\nyou're saying, these are my mail contacts,\n\n29\n00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.870\nI deal with those usually\non a daily basis, right?\n\n30\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.260\nI'm looking at my contact list and saying\nwell I need to email that person, or\n\n31\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.220\nI'm making a group out of it or\ndo whatever.\n\n32\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.795\nSo I can see how that would work\nout as a data source, right?\n\n33\n00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.170\nThere's already a first name,\nthere's already a last name,\n\n34\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.790\nthere's an email address field and I'm\njust gonna be kinda working my way through\n\n35\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.300\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n36\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.460\ncuz we've talked about the data source\nneeds to be in some tabular format.\n\n37\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.950\nBut I'm glad you pointed that out because\nyou're like, well, your contacts,\n\n38\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.080\nthat's not in a table.\n\n39\n00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.470\nBut on the backend, where it's all stored,\n\n40\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.520\nthat is a database in itself, so-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if you think about creating\n\n41\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.750\na new contact, what's it do?\n\n42\n00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.150\nIt asks you what's the first name?\n\n43\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.000\nWhat's the last name?\n\n44\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.420\nWhat's the email address, phone numbers,\n\n45\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.710\nthings of that nature.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now I don't know about you, but\n\n46\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.030\nI tend to not be very thorough with\nfilling out my contacts in Outlook.\n\n47\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.370\n&gt;&gt; I have all the information,\n\n48\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.910\nI'm like the CIA when it comes to\ngathering information about people.\n\n49\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Do you like fill them all out.\n\n50\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.080\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; See, and there's-\n\n51\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.360\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I hate going through the thing and\n\n52\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.636\ngoing who's Bill?\n\n53\n00:02:31.636 --> 00:02:34.080\n[LAUGH] Do I know a Bill?\n\n54\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.695\nI don't know a Bill.\n\n55\n00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:38.775\n[LAUGH] Obviously I do\ncuz I put Bill in here.\n\n56\n00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I do things like,\n\n57\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.810\nwell in my phone contacts, not necessarily\nin my professional contacts, my business.\n\n58\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.448\nBut I have ones that I say David and\nthen the last name is my sister's friend.\n\n59\n00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:51.112\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n60\n00:02:51.112 --> 00:02:55.770\n[LAUGH] Descriptive.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know his last name but\n\n61\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.800\nI know he's my sister's good friend.\n\n62\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.620\nSo that's kind of like, that guy.\n&gt;&gt; Owes me money.\n\n63\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, so but I mean,\n\n65\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.040\nin a profession sense,\n\n66\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.250\nyeah, you might go ahead and use your\nOutlook contacts very thoroughly and\n\n67\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.900\nhave all of the information, and\nI know a lot of people that do.\n\n68\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.002\nI personally don't, so\nmaybe having this as a data source for\n\n69\n00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:17.380\nme might not be the best option.\n\n70\n00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.860\nOkay, but if you do it,\nlike you said,everything is in there,\n\n71\n00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.150\nthis how I organize my life, and\n\n72\n00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.220\nthis is going to be a great way\nto say I wanna mail these people.\n\n73\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.540\nAnd that's what we're going to use.\n\n74\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.800\nNow, this is a data source, so I don't\nwant you to think that this data source\n\n75\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.060\nthat we're describing in this episode\ncan only be used in email mail merge.\n\n76\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.600\nNo, it's just a source.\n\n77\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.440\nIt just happens to be through\nyour contacts in your Outlook,\n\n78\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.590\nyour address book.\n\n79\n00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.240\nSo you could still be doing printed\nletters and printed envelopes and\n\n80\n00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.240\neverything like that, but\n\n81\n00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.340\nyou can only use your Outlook contacts if\nyou're going to be doing email mail merge.\n\n82\n00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.769\nNo, that's not the case.\n\n83\n00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.451\nIt's just another type of source of\nyour information, so that's what it is.\n\n84\n00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:04.185\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n85\n00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:06.681\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so why don't we go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:07.622\nget started.\n\n87\n00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:10.304\nWe have a, no this is not Justin,\nthis is Joey.\n\n88\n00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:13.410\nSee the landscape, Joey,\nkangaroos, Outlook, Outback.\n\n89\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.184\n&gt;&gt; Outback.\n\n90\n00:04:14.184 --> 00:04:17.150\nOutlook, Outback.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.792\n&gt;&gt; Outlook, Outback, right.\n\n92\n00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:21.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That'd be funny.\n\n93\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.110\nNow I want you to keep doing that, but I'm\nsure that might start to be like, my God,\n\n94\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.310\nwhat's wrong with me.\n\n95\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.000\nAll right.\n\n96\n00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.240\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nstart by going to Outlook and\n\n97\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.820\njust taking a look at this, just to kinda\nget ourselves familiar with our contacts,\n\n98\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.270\nand specifically what Joey's\ncontacts look like in Outlook.\n\n99\n00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.830\nJust so you know, and\nI do start here in the mail.\n\n100\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.530\nEverything's great but we are going\nto come over into our contacts and\n\n101\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.350\nfocus on that.\n\n102\n00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.850\nNow this is not an Outlook series show so\nwe're not going to get too deep into this.\n\n103\n00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.760\nIf you don't know anything about\nOutlook and contacts and organizing,\n\n104\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.860\ndefinitely check out\nthat particular series.\n\n105\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.780\nIt's pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n106\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.490\nI guess we would have to assume\nsome knowledge at this point\n\n107\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.460\nbecause we're using Outlook contacts.\n\n108\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.840\nSo we assume you know how\nto use Outlook contacts.\n\n109\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.690\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n110\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.330\nAnd specifically over here,\nthat you can go ahead and\n\n111\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.620\norganize your contacts into\ndifferent folders, right?\n\n112\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.570\nAnd I tend to do that.\n\n113\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.950\nOkay, here these are my just regular\ncontacts, contacts, contacts and\n\n114\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.580\nthen I have my personal contacts and\nthis is where we have Fuego and Bishop.\n\n115\n00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.640\nSo that way I know that these\naren't necessarily my direct\n\n116\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.270\nwork people that I need to be associated\nwith, but they are my personal people.\n\n117\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.682\nThese are also folders that\ncome in through Outlook.\n\n118\n00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:39.893\nAnd then I made a couple others.\n\n119\n00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:42.236\nI made a Super Team folder, all right?\n\n120\n00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:47.831\nAnd then I made OPDC, that's\nOffice Pro Demo Co, just so you know.\n\n121\n00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:48.352\nYou're in there.\n\n122\n00:05:48.352 --> 00:05:49.492\nLook at you.\n&gt;&gt; Look at me.\n\n123\n00:05:49.492 --> 00:05:50.224\n&gt;&gt; Look at me.\n\n124\n00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:51.647\n&gt;&gt; Look I made it.\n\n125\n00:05:51.647 --> 00:05:55.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And your number is 5551234.\n\n126\n00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You should be calling me man.\n\n127\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Actually that was Lance's,\n\n128\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.940\nnevermind.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, I don't even know my own\n\n129\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.200\nnumber apparently.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n130\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.915\nI do have your note as a,\nhe's pretty okay, yes.\n\n131\n00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:09.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've stepped up in the world.\n\n132\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.145\nBefore it was he's pretty.\n\n133\n00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:13.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n134\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.720\nSo you're doing all right and you're part\nof this group with Lance and Justin.\n\n135\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.570\nAnd this is, again, for me as Joey, of how\nhe can go ahead and organize his contacts.\n\n136\n00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.160\nNotice that a couple of them have\nphone numbers, a couple of them don't.\n\n137\n00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.360\nSome of them have notes in there.\n\n138\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.760\nBecause when you make a new contact,\nnow, like you said,\n\n139\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.770\nthere's all of these different\nthings that you can fill out.\n\n140\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.060\nDifferent business numbers,\nmy goodness, okay,\n\n141\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.445\nyour radio number?\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Sorry, I dropped that on my,\n\n145\n00:06:41.924 --> 00:06:44.348\nI don't think I've ever seen that option.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:06:44.348 --> 00:06:45.122\n&gt;&gt; So it kinda threw me off for a minute.\n\n147\n00:06:45.122 --> 00:06:46.926\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah quite a few.\n\n180\n00:08:18.608 --> 00:08:19.929\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but I organize them\n\n181\n00:08:19.929 --> 00:08:23.000\na specific way, but\nthey're all part of my contacts.\n\n182\n00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.070\nSee this is the kicker, when you're going\nto be choosing context as your data source\n\n183\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.070\nin Word, it's only going to\nallow you to choose one folder,\n\n184\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.200\nand if you have the organizer,\nyou can't choose multiple folders.\n\n185\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.410\nAnd the other thing is I'm not even\nseeing that super teens, that OPVC.\n\n186\n00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:41.968\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n187\n00:08:41.968 --> 00:08:44.020\n&gt;&gt; Why is it not choosing this?\n\n188\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.340\nCuz maybe you only want to email or\nuse the mail-\n\n189\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.160\n&gt;&gt; OPVC people, yeah.\n\n190\n00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so\n\n191\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.660\nthat would be kinda cool.\n\n192\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.210\nSo this is kind of like a plus and\na minus.\n\n193\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:56.450\nWell, I really do only wanna\ntarget that particular folder and\n\n194\n00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.540\norganization or how I organize it.\n\n195\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.590\nI only want those.\n\n196\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.600\nOkay, cool, but then the back is\nlike well no, I need all of them.\n\n197\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.460\nI need them for my contacts, and\nthe super team, and the OPVC.\n\n198\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.495\nSo I can't.\n&gt;&gt; Bond seems like a big fail.\n\n199\n00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:16.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It depends on how you define fail,\n\n200\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.830\nright?\n\n201\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.020\nAnd that's the thing.\n\n202\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.170\nIf I needed all of them,\nyou're not gonna be able to get\n\n203\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.460\nthem this way.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n204\n00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.980\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n205\n00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.490\nSo you'd have to kind of think about,\nyou need to think of how,\n\n206\n00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.290\nwhat context you need and\nhow you're going to be able to do it.\n\n207\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.160\nThis might not be the best way and\n\n208\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.410\nyou'd have to export it out.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n209\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.300\n&gt;&gt; And so on, and so forth.\n\n210\n00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.929\nSo that's one thing of like,\n[SOUND] I need everything.\n\n211\n00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:43.560\nYou're going to have to get those\ncontacts out, put it into a .csv file,\n\n212\n00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.940\nbecause I think that's\nhow they export out.\n\n213\n00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.030\nI can't remember if you can export\ndirectly out to an Excel file.\n\n214\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.090\nRegardless, we know that a .csv file can\nopen up in Excel and go like that, and so\n\n215\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:54.610\non and so forth.\n\n216\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.410\nSo you go on your merry way,\nand it's like a static source.\n\n217\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.070\nOkay, so that's one option if\nyou're like I can't do this, but\n\n218\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.180\nthe other option I was like\nI really want super team.\n\n219\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.270\nI need to focus on that,\nwhy don't I see this?\n\n220\n00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.640\nThis is that weird thing that they don't\nreally tell you about in the help files\n\n221\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.330\nis how to get this to show up.\n\n222\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.900\nThis is really more of an Outlook thing,\ncuz this is not a Word thing.\n\n223\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.077\nLet's just close this,\nwe're not gonna choose it for now.\n\n224\n00:10:23.077 --> 00:10:25.410\nI'm just gonna minimize this file for\nright now.\n\n225\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.320\nIn here, the properties of your folders,\n\n226\n00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.870\nlike viewing properties,\nwho could do sharing and\n\n227\n00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.920\nwho can see my folders, you can right\nclick on any of these folders in Outlook,\n\n228\n00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.550\nand notice you have properties.\n\n229\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.320\nWhen I go here, there's the general, and\n\n230\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.350\nyou can see that this is what I was\ntalking about, the permissions.\n\n231\n00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.270\nNormally we talk about, when we're\nsharing out folders with other users,\n\n232\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.650\nwe have to come in here and say like, who\ncan edit, who can not edit, who can see.\n\n233\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.140\nAll of those different things,\nbut there's this tab\n\n234\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:04.100\nhere in the properties in Outlook cuz\nyou have an Outlook address book.\n\n235\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.340\nNotice that super team\ndoes not have a check box.\n\n236\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.942\nThere's a connection.\n\n237\n00:11:10.942 --> 00:11:16.000\nAll right, let's cancel this, because if I\ncome over here to my regular contacts and\n\n238\n00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.180\nright click, go to the properties.\n\n239\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.240\nAnd look at this address tab.\n\n240\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.630\nWell, it's greyed out\nbecause that's by default.\n\n241\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.500\nBut notice,\nit does say this is checked on.\n\n242\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.590\nAnd that's why we can see\nthe contacts folder and\n\n243\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:37.410\nthe personal folder as choices in\nmy data source for my mail merge.\n\n244\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:44.091\nOkay, so if you did want this to show up,\nyou would have to tell it in Outlook.\n\n245\n00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:48.240\nYou have to change the properties of\nthat folder and check this box on.\n\n246\n00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.630\nAs soon as I check this\nbox on to say yeah,\n\n247\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.800\nyou are going to be seeing, I want to show\nthis folder, I don't even have to restart.\n\n248\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.372\nWell, we're going to cross our fingers\ncuz anytime I've tried this before,\n\n249\n00:12:00.372 --> 00:12:01.570\nI don't have to restart.\n\n250\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.517\nBut let's come over here,\nwe're back in Word,\n\n251\n00:12:03.517 --> 00:12:05.370\nwe're going to choose\nour Outlook contacts.\n\n252\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:10.590\nGoing to let the donut spin for\na little bit, but it will show up.\n\n253\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.439\nAnd if everything goes the wayit's\nsupposed to, we will now see three folders\n\n254\n00:12:15.439 --> 00:12:19.847\nthat I can choose from in my contacts,\nit'd be contacts, personal and\n\n255\n00:12:19.847 --> 00:12:23.540\nthe super team,\nbecause that's the one I just checked on.\n\n256\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.240\nAnd there it goes.\n\n257\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.343\nThank you, then I crashed.\n\n258\n00:12:27.343 --> 00:12:28.271\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

So once I have that selected,\n\n407\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.680\nI click this button.\n\n408\n00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.870\nNow it's like, only selected contact.\n\n409\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.868\nSo that's kind of a neat option of just\nthese few and then go ahead and bring\n\n410\n00:19:32.868 --> 00:19:37.210\nit into the new document, and then I'll go\nahead and perform the merge from there.\n\n411\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:42.760\nSo kind of neat, just some options\nthat you have in Outlook specifically.\n\n412\n00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.855\nContinuing talking about Outlook [LAUGH].\n\n413\n00:19:44.855 --> 00:19:49.772\nA G-A-L, a GAL.\n&gt;&gt; The Global Address\n\n414\n00:19:49.772 --> 00:19:50.650\nList.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n415\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.640\n&gt;&gt; Fun stuff.\n\n416\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right?\n\n417\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:58.190\nSo now if you have a large organization\nsuch as the University of Florida,\n\n418\n00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.190\nright, their Global Address List,\nhundreds, I'm just gonna go with\n\n419\n00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.400\nhundreds of thousands of addresses.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n420\n00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz there's a lot of people,\n\n421\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.970\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Hundreds of thousands of them.\n\n422\n00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:09.840\n&gt;&gt; That might be close.\n\n423\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.290\n&gt;&gt; That might be a hyperbole.\n\n424\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.450\n&gt;&gt; How about\n\n425\n00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.830\ntens of thousands?\n\n426\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.375\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n427\n00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:15.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's probably more like it.\n\n428\n00:20:15.875 --> 00:20:17.680\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot of employees at\n\n429\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.710\nthe University of Florida, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n430\n00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.750\n&gt;&gt; So their global address list is\n\n431\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.213\nmassive, right.\n&gt;&gt; Real large.\n\n432\n00:20:22.213 --> 00:20:24.872\n&gt;&gt; Well the thing is when you're talking\n\n433\n00:20:24.872 --> 00:20:28.650\nabout Global Address List\nin Outlook that's great.\n\n434\n00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.010\nBut when you talk about Global Address\nList and how it relates to mail merge,\n\n435\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.000\nyou cannot use your Global Address List\nas your data source.\n\n436\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.922\nIt just doesn't work.\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n437\n00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:39.846\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right,\n\n438\n00:20:39.846 --> 00:20:44.710\nit's only gonna pull from your contacts,\nwhat I call the local contacts.\n\n439\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:51.230\nThe ones that you have saved to your\nOutlook profile of these are my contacts.\n\n440\n00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:56.340\nThat Global Address List, it's almost like\nin this other sphere, if you wanna say,\n\n441\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:01.960\nthat is not connected to your specific\ncontact that you have within your account.\n\n442\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.690\n&gt;&gt; Which is true,\n\n443\n00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.818\nright, because\nthe Global Address List comes from,\n\n444\n00:21:04.818 --> 00:21:09.460\nusually Exchange service, Microsoft's\nemail system that they work with.\n\n445\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.086\nSo maybe because you're trying to make\nthat network type of connection through\n\n446\n00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:15.789\nthere they're like,\n[SOUND] we want to stay away from that,\n\n447\n00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:19.060\ncuz you never know what kind of hankey\nthis could come around from that.\n\n448\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.636\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n449\n00:21:19.636 --> 00:21:23.304\nso they're two separate things.\n&gt;&gt; Plus it's not contacts you own,\n\n450\n00:21:23.304 --> 00:21:26.410\nyou are not the data owner\nof those contacts as well.\n\n451\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.520\n&gt;&gt; I think that's the best way to say it\n\n452\n00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.120\nright there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n453\n00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.780\n&gt;&gt; That you're not\n\n454\n00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.900\nthe owner.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n455\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.120\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, and cuz in other words,\n\n456\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.380\nlike Active Directory-\n&gt;&gt; You could be, but\n\n457\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.375\nprobably not.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so\n\n458\n00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:39.127\nthat's controlled by your company, your\nnetwork, your admins and, but yeah, that's\n\n459\n00:21:39.127 --> 00:21:42.710\nwhy it's in that other level as I call it.\n&gt;&gt; I can see some C level people going,\n\n460\n00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.558\nwhy can't I do this?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n461\n00:21:44.558 --> 00:21:45.560\n&gt;&gt; Make it happen.\n\n462\n00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.343\nThen I'm like, [SOUND].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n463\n00:21:48.343 --> 00:21:49.529\n&gt;&gt; That's not how this works,\n\n464\n00:21:49.529 --> 00:21:51.505\nit works like right now\ncuz I write your check and\n\n465\n00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:52.259\nyou do what I say.\n\n466\n00:21:52.259 --> 00:21:53.432\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n467\n00:21:53.432 --> 00:21:54.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n468\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.919\nwell let me start-\n&gt;&gt; Heard those conversations\n\n469\n00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:58.849\nbefore.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n470\n00:21:58.849 --> 00:22:04.710\nyou can take from your Global Address List\nand you can copy down into your contacts.\n\n471\n00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:09.160\nAnd that's where,\nif I go into my address book right here,\n\n472\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.809\njust to show you I have my\nGlobal Address List, so\n\n473\n00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:17.490\nI was already on it so\nI don't know why I chose that again.\n\n474\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.060\nBut notice if I wanted\nto take this Lance Bass,\n\n475\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.950\nI know I already have him in my contacts.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n476\n00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.599\n&gt;&gt; Just pretend it's somebody else.\n\n477\n00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:25.603\n&gt;&gt; It's Lance Grass.\n\n478\n00:22:25.603 --> 00:22:29.308\n&gt;&gt; How about [LAUGH] what is right?\n\n479\n00:22:29.308 --> 00:22:32.260\nWe'll go with this one,\nI think that's a person, yes.\n\n480\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.780\nSo notice I can add to my contacts.\n\n481\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.631\nSo you could take this and\nShift click a bunch of people-\n\n482\n00:22:38.631 --> 00:22:41.146\n&gt;&gt; 10.000 email addresses [LAUGH] imported\n\n483\n00:22:41.146 --> 00:22:45.440\nin, which is usually frowned upon.\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna take a long time and\n\n484\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.740\nyou'll probably crash too.\n\n485\n00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then someones gonna come by\n\n486\n00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.855\nyour office and go what's with all this?\n\n487\n00:22:49.855 --> 00:22:52.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it is possible for\n\n488\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.820\nyou to get things down from your Global\nAddress List into your local contacts but\n\n489\n00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.150\nit will take some time.\n\n490\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.950\nI do have this website, it's in\nthe episode notes, where it's just saying,\n\n491\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.590\nhey, I can't export it,\nI need to bring this out, and\n\n492\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.620\nit's like you cannot export directly.\n\n493\n00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.840\nThere's also this kind of weird,\nit's talking about the right click add,\n\n494\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.580\nI just showed you that.\n\n495\n00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:20.330\nBut there's this other way that you can\nget down into putting it into Access and\n\n496\n00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.030\nstuff like that.\n\n497\n00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:25.532\nSo I'm not saying it's-\n&gt;&gt; Impossible, they don't make it for\n\n498\n00:23:25.532 --> 00:23:28.190\neasy goings.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n499\n00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.890\nthat's where I would be\na little careful about that.\n\n500\n00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:30.410\nAnd like you said,\n\n501\n00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.670\nyour network administrators might not be\nhappy with you doing some of this stuff.\n\n502\n00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.200\nAnd then maybe the recipients are like,\nwhere did you get my information?\n\n503\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.910\n&gt;&gt; It's funny because I've dealt with\n\n504\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.160\ncorporate America.\n\n505\n00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.570\nThis very thing, people dealing\nwith Global Address List and\n\n506\n00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.070\ntheir personal contacts.\n\n507\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:52.221\nAnd they'll create a contact that already\nexists in the Global Address List,\n\n508\n00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:55.680\nand then wonder why things look different.\n\n509\n00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.800\nCuz they don't realize\nthere's two different ones.\n\n510\n00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.803\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and again,\n\n511\n00:23:58.803 --> 00:24:00.370\nthis is not an Outlook show but\n\n512\n00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.897\nthey are different things.\n&gt;&gt; Right, there are two\n\n513\n00:24:02.897 --> 00:24:05.060\ndifferent areas for contacts.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n514\n00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.760\nyou can't use that in your mail merge.\n\n515\n00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.031\nIt is just not going to be possible,\ndirectly.\n\n516\n00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:09.935\n&gt;&gt; It's good to know, it's good to know.\n\n517\n00:24:09.935 --> 00:24:10.530\n&gt;&gt; Directly, so.\n\n518\n00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.626\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's always a work around,\n\n519\n00:24:12.626 --> 00:24:14.067\nbut.\n&gt;&gt; There always is, right.\n\n520\n00:24:14.067 --> 00:24:17.560\n[LAUGH] And we try to show you those.\n\n521\n00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.916\nJust like with the permissions.\n\n522\n00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:21.650\nThe folder permissions are showing\nup as an address book of\n\n523\n00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.060\nwhere you want that to show up in,\nWord, Mail Merge and everything.\n\n524\n00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:25.779\nSo that's something good.\n\n525\n00:24:25.779 --> 00:24:30.756\nSo yeah, exporting your contacts out might\nbe a good way to just have that static\n\n526\n00:24:30.756 --> 00:24:33.150\nfile and that way I can kinda control.\n\n527\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.950\nI can delete all of those\nother columns I don't need.\n\n528\n00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.340\nIt's not gonna hurt anything by\nkeeping them in there cuz you\n\n529\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.020\ndon't have to put those fields into\nyour letter if you don't use them.\n\n530\n00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.110\nSo it's okay for them to be there,\n\n531\n00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:49.380\nit just might be a little more,\nmaybe it's more annoying.\n\n532\n00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.780\nReduce the clutter.\n&gt;&gt; Reduce the clutter, yeah,\n\n533\n00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.110\nclean the closet out.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n534\n00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:59.110\nthat's how you can use your email\ncontacts from Outlook as your data source\n\n535\n00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:02.010\nin your mail merge.\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, you heard it here first, folks.\n\n536\n00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.270\nNow you know what to do when it\ncomes to using a data source of your\n\n537\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.340\nemail contacts.\n\n538\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.101\nObviously, we've shown you a couple\nof other ways which you can do it,\n\n539\n00:25:09.101 --> 00:25:10.585\nwhich is most likely we'll be using.\n\n540\n00:25:10.585 --> 00:25:14.341\nBut maybe you say hey, my contacts\nis exactly what I wanna go with,\n\n541\n00:25:14.341 --> 00:25:18.633\nnow you know all the pitfalls and caveats\nand things that you'll have to look\n\n542\n00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:22.590\nout for when it comes to using your\nemail contacts as that source.\n\n543\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.550\nWe have Vonne to thank for that.\n\n544\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.470\nVonne, we do thank you.\n\n545\n00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.720\nBut it looks like we've come to\nthe end of another great episode,\n\n546\n00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.810\nhopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\n547\n00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.400\nWe do appreciate your viewership.\n\n548\n00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.810\nSigning off for OfficeProTV I've\nbeen your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n549\n00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:32.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n550\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.869\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n551\n00:25:33.869 --> 00:25:38.733\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To show you all and I'll just say,\n\n262\n00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:38.962\nshow_pants_list.\n\n263\n00:10:38.962 --> 00:10:39.979\nOkay?\n\n264\n00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:42.980\nDo take notice right here.\n\n265\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.220\nIt is making an mdb file format.\n\n266\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.915\nAnd that's the only option you have.\n\n267\n00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:52.110\n[LAUGH] You can not-\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft Office address list.\n\n268\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is kind of\na weird file format, I will say.\n\n269\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.860\n&gt;&gt; This is generic to Office, right?\n\n270\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.830\nThat's interesting.\n\n271\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:04.300\nBut the address list, it really seems\nlike it wants you to do addressing or\n\n272\n00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.070\ncontact type Merging.\n\n273\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I guess it's why they call it mail\n\n274\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.530\nmerge because you're mailing, so\n\n275\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.680\nthere's gonna be an address involved but-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n276\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.870\nI feel like this is kind of like\nalmost like a generic file format\n\n277\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:20.340\nonly in Microsoft LAN that\nworks because it's an mdb.\n\n278\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.530\nI will say, I do not have much\nexperience with this file type.\n\n279\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.060\nNotice how, whoa, sorry, wrong way.\n\n280\n00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.436\nNotice how in the other example,\nlook at that icon,\n\n281\n00:11:30.436 --> 00:11:33.060\nit's associating itself with Access.\n\n282\n00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.050\n&gt;&gt; Access, yeah.\n\n283\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.400\n&gt;&gt; Just like if we had a CSV file,\nwhich is another generic file format,\n\n284\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.000\nExcel goes ahead and\nassociates itself with that file type.\n\n285\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.940\nIt's like,\nI'm gonna go ahead and open you.\n\n286\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nOn the default application for\n\n287\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.670\nthat specific file type.\n\n288\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.920\n&gt;&gt; And so is Access for this MDB.\n\n289\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.870\nMakes sense, it's a database file.\n\n290\n00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\nthat raises a hairy question of,\n\n291\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.090\nwhat if I don't have Access installed?\n\n292\n00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.990\nI'm I gonna have problems or\nit's gonna cause any issues?\n\n293\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.254\n&gt;&gt;

It could happen.\n\n298\n00:12:07.842 --> 00:12:12.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's always an asterisk\non everything we say here.\n\n299\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.520\nSo, we'll tackle that\nquestion in just a second.\n\n300\n00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.010\nLet's go ahead and finish saving this.\n\n301\n00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.200\nAnd again,\n\n302\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.990\nI'm back in my file naming convention\nof no spaces, you don't have to.\n\n303\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.390\nYou can put uppercase,\nlowercase and spaces.\n\n304\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.240\nYou saw that Microsoft is very forgiving.\n\n305\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.280\nBut it's just kind of an innate rule for\nme, for some reason.\n\n306\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.510\nSo let's go ahead and\nclick it and we'll go with that.\n\n307\n00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.690\nAnd then you're like, okay,\n\n308\n00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.600\nremember we were doing this in line if\nyou wanna say of doing my mail merge.\n\n309\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.740\nSo there's my fields.\n\n310\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:50.130\nOkay, so I would go ahead and put in my\nfields and then go ahead and preview it.\n\n311\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.073\nAnd there you go,\nyou can see my two records that I have for\n\n312\n00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:59.150\nthat on-the-fly created database and\nthere we go.\n\n313\n00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.960\nWe're one or at least data source,\nwhich really makes a database.\n\n314\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.675\nOops, sorry, there's my virtual\nmachine coming up, say hi.\n\n315\n00:13:05.675 --> 00:13:08.140\n[LAUGH] Great, so\nI'm gonna just minimize this.\n\n316\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.430\nI could close it because we're not really\ndoing anything with it and there you go,\n\n317\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.800\nyou can see that it is locked right now.\n\n318\n00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.860\nRemember we talked about once\nyou have that file opened,\n\n319\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.560\nyour data source will always be locked?\n\n320\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.908\n&gt;&gt;

There you go.\n\n330\n00:13:43.174 --> 00:13:46.512\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so I could come back in and\nadd more information into this and so\n\n331\n00:13:46.512 --> 00:13:47.450\non and so forth.\n\n332\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:47.950\nGreat.\n\n333\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.810\nBut yes, what if,\nwhat if I've pulled up some websites here.\n\n334\n00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.155\nSo first of all, I just did\na Google search for what is MDB.\n\n335\n00:13:57.155 --> 00:14:02.468\nAnd this whatis.com does seem to come or\nthis whatis.techtarget.com does seem\n\n336\n00:14:02.468 --> 00:14:08.000\nto come up, a fairly amount of times when\nI type in file extensions or anything.\n\n337\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.200\nSo you could see that it is a database,\nsuch as used by Access.\n\n338\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.840\nIt is talking about how it uses that whole\nengine that Access Jet Database Engine.\n\n339\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.554\nYou also see things like XML and HTML.\n\n340\n00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:26.392\nOkay, mdb can be opened by OpenOffice.org,\nSAS Institute,\n\n341\n00:14:26.392 --> 00:14:29.625\nI have no idea what these things are.\n\n342\n00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:31.015\nVisual Studio?\n\n343\n00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:34.565\nBut again-\n&gt;&gt; MIght not have these things\n\n344\n00:14:34.565 --> 00:14:36.785\ninstalled [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n345\n00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:41.690\nSo if you don't have access,\nit's like okay, well, that's great.\n\n346\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.530\nAnd the other thing is, a lot of times\nwhen you have a file and you don't\n\n347\n00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.590\nhave that problem, you can right-click and\nopen it with something else.\n\n348\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.340\n&gt;&gt; Usually, Notepad is the big one.\n\n349\n00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:51.930\n&gt;&gt; Usually?\n\n350\n00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, lots of times.\n\n351\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.775\n&gt;&gt; Well, look at this.\n\n352\n00:14:54.775 --> 00:14:56.821\nThere's no options.\n\n353\n00:14:56.821 --> 00:14:59.280\nCuz usually it's just open and\nthen it flies out with another menu.\n\n354\n00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.885\n&gt;&gt; You need to tell me what\nyou want to open it with.\n\n355\n00:15:01.885 --> 00:15:06.720\n[LAUGH] It's gonna say, well, I need this\nbut maybe you should try to look for\n\n356\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.980\nsome other options somewhere else.\n\n357\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.260\nThat doesn't help me.\n\n358\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.620\nSo it's just kind of one of, well,\nof course it's, [LAUGH] sorry.\n\n359\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.060\nI said okay and it opened it up.\n\n360\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.049\nBut there's some other ones in here and\n\n361\n00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:22.030\nit's that's talking about what is this\ntype of file, again, that XML, HTML.\n\n362\n00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:26.040\nSo, could I open this in,\ndirectly in Excel?\n\n363\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.790\n&gt;&gt; A browser?\n[LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.959\n&gt;&gt; Or a browser.\n\n365\n00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:29.510\nThat could be a good\n&gt;&gt; XML, HTML.\n\n366\n00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nYeah.\n\n367\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.180\nSo it's saying like how you can open it.\n\n368\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.920\nBut notice right here,\nExcel will import an MDB file.\n\n369\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.873\nBut the data will then have to be\nsaved in some other special format.\n\n370\n00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:42.226\nOkay, so just like,\n\n371\n00:15:42.226 --> 00:15:46.370\nokay I bring it into Excel with\nthat import wizard that you can do.\n\n372\n00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.612\nYou go to that tab and say import and\nit's usually all sorts of options.\n\n373\n00:15:49.612 --> 00:15:53.159\nYou bring it in and\nthen you save it as an Excel file.\n\n374\n00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:59.250\nSo, I mean, who knows, maybe this is\na file format that you might encounter.\n\n375\n00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.460\nAnd how people are taking it out from\na proprietary database, but then-\n\n376\n00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Or somebody like, say you created this\n\n377\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.930\nand you made this on the fly and makes the\nfile, I forget the name of it, MDB, right?\n\n378\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.690\nAnd you say,\nI'm gonna send that over to Daniel.\n\n379\n00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.020\nDaniel doesn't have Access installed,\n\n380\n00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.410\nI'm running Open Office,\nI'm not even running Microsoft, right?\n\n381\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.140\nAnd it doesn't open cuz it's not there.\n\n382\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.100\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't,\nOpenOffice.org might open it.\n\n383\n00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.100\nSo on that might example example.\n\n384\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.310\n&gt;&gt; That might actually work, yeah but\nI need to convert it cuz for\n\n385\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.859\nwhatever reason, I've actually\nhad this happen in real life,\n\n386\n00:16:29.859 --> 00:16:34.940\nwhere people only have the big three,\nWord, Excel, and Outlook installed.\n\n387\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.840\nThey don't have the rest\nof the Office suites.\n\n388\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.142\nSo what do I do?\n\n389\n00:16:38.142 --> 00:16:42.550\nObviously, I would have to import it\ninto Excel and let Excel handle it.\n\n390\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd like you said,\n\n391\n00:16:43.775 --> 00:16:48.641\nAccess is definitely one of those\noff-to-the-side Office products that not\n\n392\n00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:53.097\na lot of your end users are going to use,\nlike you said, the big ones.\n\n393\n00:16:53.097 --> 00:16:53.958\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I might through PowerPoint\n\n394\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:54.632\nin there just for fun.\n\n395\n00:16:54.632 --> 00:16:55.752\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, PowerPoint might be one.\n\n396\n00:16:55.752 --> 00:16:57.160\n&gt;&gt; But Outlook, Word, and\n\n397\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.520\nExcel are going to be your big\nones that a lot of people have.\n\n398\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.990\nSo, at least you are familiar\nwith this particular file\n\n399\n00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:09.810\nformat and what it's going to do\nwhen you create a list on the fly.\n\n400\n00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.710\nLike I said, that seemed like, to me,\nwas trying to customize all those fields,\n\n401\n00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.690\njust throw it into an Excel file or\neven a Word table.\n\n402\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.900\nI feel, for me,\nit's a little bit easier and\n\n403\n00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.470\nthen we can use that as my data source.\n\n404\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.750\nBut again, showing your options.\n\n405\n00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.820\nWe're deep diving.\n\n406\n00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:31.590\nSo, got to give you all of it but\n\n407\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.871\nagain, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

great movie.\n\n26\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.570\nActually, I almost\nwatched that last night.\n\n27\n00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.404\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, funny you mention it.\n\n28\n00:00:56.404 --> 00:00:57.290\n&gt;&gt; So good, so.\n\n29\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.370\nBut yes, we are going to be diving\nback into our Mail Merge series and\n\n30\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.785\nwe're at the point where we're going\nto actually perform a mail merge.\n\n31\n00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:10.517\nYeah, we've talked so\nmuch about data sources and so\n\n32\n00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:13.350\nnow I need to actually take those fields.\n\n33\n00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.030\nOnce we connect a data source\nput them in my letter and\n\n34\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.305\nbe able to perform and\ncomplete a mail merge.\n\n35\n00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:24.280\nWell, that's so exciting it's gonna\nbe fantastic and it's lovely.\n\n36\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.520\nSo we're gonna start with letters cuz\n\n37\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.330\nI figure that's a good place to start,\nright?\n\n38\n00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.170\nI have the steps written out here.\n\n39\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.040\nNow I have this in a word document.\n\n40\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.624\nAnd if you're looking for this particular\nfile in the episodes, notes and\n\n41\n00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:43.502\nthe exercise files they're not there\nthey're in the actual show notes episode\n\n42\n00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.775\nnotes what ever we call them, okay?\n\n43\n00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:46.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I just copy and\n\n44\n00:01:46.887 --> 00:01:51.360\npaste them it's on my Mac side and it's on\nmy PC side all that kind of fun stuffs.\n\n45\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.010\nSo, I can have it during the show.\n\n46\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.100\nSo these are the steps that you\nneed to remember when you're going\n\n47\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.830\nto be performing a merge, whether it's\nletters, envelopes, or labels, the steps\n\n48\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.590\nare pretty much the same with a few slight\nvariations in there here and there.\n\n49\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.890\nBut you're going to have a start document.\n\n50\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.910\nYou need something where you're either\ngoing to have a letter written,\n\n51\n00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.190\nlike dear and\nthen you want your placeholder.\n\n52\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.980\nYour placeholder you\ntype in the word name and\n\n53\n00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.220\nthen you live in and\nthen you type in the word city.\n\n54\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.860\nSo there's no fields going on in here.\n\n55\n00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.490\nYou're just doing what you need to do for\nthe letter itself.\n\n56\n00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.560\nThis start document it could be blank,\nand you could be writing it on the fly,\n\n57\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.790\nall right?\n\n58\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.595\nSo either one is fine.\n\n59\n00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:43.395\nYou're gonna grab your data source and\nconnect it,\n\n60\n00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:45.665\nthen you're gonna put the fields in.\n\n61\n00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:49.324\nOkay, where you typed in the word\nname as your placeholder,\n\n62\n00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:53.290\nyou're going to insert that\nparticular field with our gimlets.\n\n63\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.187\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gimlets yeah.\n\n64\n00:02:54.187 --> 00:02:55.253\n&gt;&gt; Where's my mind going?\n\n65\n00:02:55.253 --> 00:02:57.285\n&gt;&gt; Gim-m-m-m something it's weird.\n\n66\n00:02:57.285 --> 00:02:59.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; French, it's hard to say.\n\n67\n00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.398\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly the right pronunciation.\n\n68\n00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:04.548\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nailed it.\n\n69\n00:03:04.548 --> 00:03:08.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nyou're gonna put those fields in.\n\n70\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.000\nI probably should do another step in\nthere, like you format and align and\n\n71\n00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.910\ndo all of those kinds of things.\n\n72\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.070\nYou preview your results.\n\n73\n00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.110\nThen you edit as needed.\n\n74\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n75\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.450\nI kind of threw those back and forth.\n\n76\n00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.850\nMaking sure you turn off the preview.\n\n77\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.760\nAnd then the biggest step, this is the one\nthat a lot of people get to the end and\n\n78\n00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.980\nthey don't do this step.\n\n79\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.690\nThey don't understand why\nthey don't have their 10,000\n\n80\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.760\npages of letters ready to go\ncuz you gotta finish the merge.\n\n81\n00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.550\nWhich creates a separate file that is\ndifferent than your merged document.\n\n82\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.290\nThe cool thing about these steps I\ndon't know if I could remember this?\n\n83\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.760\nIn Windows, it's not Mac okay.\n\n84\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.380\nSo mail merge from Mac you\nhave to remember these steps.\n\n85\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.580\nHere, they actually give you this\nwonderful little step-by-step wizard that\n\n86\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.790\ncomes over on the side and just kind of\nguides you through the whole process.\n\n87\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.290\n&gt;&gt; Holds your little hand.\n\n88\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.250\n&gt;&gt; Which one am I supposed to do next?\n\n89\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.235\n&gt;&gt; Tells you it's gonna be okay.\n\n90\n00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:03.478\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I need that a lot.\n\n91\n00:04:03.478 --> 00:04:04.249\n[LAUGH].\n\n92\n00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:09.680\nSo it's nice that it has it and you can\ngo backwards and forwards from there.\n\n93\n00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.010\nSo that's pretty, pretty cool.\n\n94\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.280\nAnd the files that you should or could end\nup with is you have your start document.\n\n95\n00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.840\nNow I did put this as optional.\n\n96\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.210\nDo you have to have the static\nletter written out?\n\n97\n00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.260\nNot necessarily.\n\n98\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.130\nFor my shows it's a lot easier for me to\nhave something to go with and be like see,\n\n99\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.350\nI have it typed, all ready to go.\n\n100\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.570\nAnd this is where it does not have a data\nconnection, it does not have any field.\n\n101\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.770\nBut then your merged document, this is\nthe one with the data connection and\n\n102\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.640\nthe field inserted it into the place that\nyou want that variable data to go into.\n\n103\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.250\nAnd then you have a finished document,\n\n104\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.190\nthis is the one that has the number\nof pages based on a record\n\n105\n00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.670\nthat are in your data source all merged\ntogether and that's the final one.\n\n106\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.550\nBecause maybe that's the one you're\ngoing to be sending off to a printer or\n\n107\n00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.620\nmaybe a different department that's\ngoing to be printing it out.\n\n108\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.250\nSo, you don't want to send them the merged\ndocument,you just want to send them\n\n109\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.760\nall of the results.\n\n110\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.570\nThe 10,000 records or\nin this case I only have 19 records.\n\n111\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.833\nSo I’m gonna send them the file\nwith 19 pages, not 19 files.\n\n112\n00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:23.983\nIt's one file with as many pages as\nyou have for your records, cool.\n\n113\n00:05:23.983 --> 00:05:30.730\nSo that’s the overview of\nperforming the merge in word.\n\n114\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.750\nAgain, for letters,\nenvelopes, or labels, cool?\n\n115\n00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.360\nLet's close this, cuz we don't\nreally need that file anymore.\n\n116\n00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.610\nWe've seen our data source, and just in\ncase you're jumping into this episode and\n\n117\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.830\nhaven't watched the others I\nhighly suggest you watch them.\n\n118\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.865\nWe have a file called Excel,\nwait it's an Excel file.\n\n119\n00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:51.167\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's called Excel.\n\n120\n00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.201\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's that green one,\n\n121\n00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:54.970\nthere's so many of them.\n\n122\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.270\nYou can see that we have our first\nlast name, we have our cats,\n\n123\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.565\nwe have our department.\n\n124\n00:05:59.565 --> 00:06:02.460\nNotice I do have a departments and\nphone number but\n\n125\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.585\nI don't have to use all my\nfields in my merge, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:08.290\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n127\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.860\nI'm gonna use and pick what I want.\n\n128\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.400\nJust giving you a quick preview on that,\nI do have a start document,\n\n129\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.920\nbut this is that optional\nstart file that I have.\n\n130\n00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.465\nChristmas Cats very big,\nlet's zoom out a little bit.\n\n131\n00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:25.005\nAnd if you've seen some of our\nother shows, you've seen it a lot.\n\n132\n00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:25.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n133\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.830\n&gt;&gt; Yep, gotta have Mr.\n\n134\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.610\nBishop Timothy right there and\nyou can see I've written this out.\n\n135\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.950\nAnd I've got whoops that's\nthe wrong zoom one.\n\n136\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.400\nDear NAME, and\nI physically just typed that word out.\n\n137\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.000\nAnd this is where I'm\ngonna put in the city.\n\n138\n00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.600\nSo this is where I'm going to\nbegin in my mail merge process.\n\n139\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.050\nWe come on over to mailings.\n\n140\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.540\nUp here on the top I know the steps and\nI know them pretty well.\n\n141\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.680\nSo, I can do everything from these\nbuttons up here on the ribbon and\n\n142\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.580\nbe completely fine.\n\n143\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.500\nBut that's a wizard thing like hey I don't\nreally remember what I'm supposed to do.\n\n144\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.400\nSo this start mail merge button up\nat the top kind of gives you well,\n\n145\n00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.410\nleg up on hey what are you going to do,\nall right?\n\n146\n00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.710\nAnd then if you have\nthe different options here.\n\n147\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.100\nBut if you're really unsure,\n\n148\n00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.850\ndefinitely go to the step by step\nwizard down at the bottom, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.136\nEven if you know you're gonna do letters,\nI got that part,\n\n150\n00:07:23.136 --> 00:07:25.000\nstill start at square one.\n\n151\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.828\nStart at the beginning and\nbring up the wizard.\n\n152\n00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:31.220\nSo I'm gonna click on that and notice over\nhere on the right hand side you're gonna\n\n153\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.780\nget this task pane and\nit's going to go through the steps.\n\n154\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.460\nAt the top, hey so\nwhat are you going to be creating?\n\n155\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.130\nLetters, envelopes, labels.\n\n156\n00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.960\nI know I'm doing letter cuz\nof I've got the letter open.\n\n157\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.800\nOkay, cool.\n\n158\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.610\nIt gives you a little overview\nas to what it's going to do.\n\n159\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.223\nIf I chose envelopes so\nyou can print envelopes, you got it.\n\n160\n00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:58.990\nWe'll go with letters and\nthen down the bottom of this task\n\n161\n00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.705\npane you could see that\nwe have steps 1 of 6.\n\n162\n00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:06.625\nCool, I know I have six things\nthat I'm gonna have to do and\n\n163\n00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:09.080\nperform as I go through here.\n\n164\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.790\nAnd it gives me the whole hey,\nnow you're gonna start the document.\n\n165\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.990\nSo I click it, and\nthen I'm onto the next step.\n\n166\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.780\nAnd you can see that these\ndown here turn into next and\n\n167\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.070\nprevious as to what I'm going to do.\n\n168\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:26.196\nSo let's look at the top, and it says, so,\nhow do you want to set up your letters?\n\n169\n00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:28.642\nDo you want to use the current document?\n\n170\n00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:30.190\nWell, this is the one\nthat I have right now.\n\n171\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.490\nSo, yeah Christmas Cats is going to be the\nstarting document that I got ready to go.\n\n172\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.120\nI've typed everything out,\nso, this the one I wanted.\n\n173\n00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.120\nNow, if you were like,\nI don't really know what I want to do.\n\n174\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.410\nSome templates,\nthat could be a good thing to do.\n\n175\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.900\nThere's ones, you can go out to office.com\nand find something that has, and\n\n176\n00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.550\nmaybe you can type in mail merge templates\nand you can find one like, that's great.\n\n177\n00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.530\nBut this will take you out directly to,\nI'm just gonna choose this option for\n\n178\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.190\na second.\n\n179\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.970\nNotice that down at the bottom, so\na lot of times in these wizard steps.\n\n180\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.360\nThings that you choose up here,\n\n181\n00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.410\nchanges the thing that you have down in\nlike this middle section right there.\n\n182\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.260\nSo, in this one it's like,\nselect a template.\n\n183\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.280\nNow, I don't want to go any further\nbecause it's really saying,\n\n184\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.310\nit's gonna delete the current\ncontents of this file.\n\n185\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.520\nAnd I'm like, no, no, no,\nno, I don't want to do that.\n\n186\n00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.817\nSo do be aware that if you have\nsomething open with stuff in it,\n\n187\n00:09:21.817 --> 00:09:26.211\nit's gonna say, I can't do that\nunless I start from scratch.\n\n188\n00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:29.257\nSo, using this template option would be,\nor\n\n189\n00:09:29.257 --> 00:09:33.997\nfrom the existing document,\nI would start with a blank new document.\n\n190\n00:09:33.997 --> 00:09:35.940\nAnd that way, blank doesn't matter.\n\n191\n00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.630\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting that those are options\nfor this because typically if I\n\n192\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.470\nwanted to start with a blank document, I\nwould have started with a blank document.\n\n193\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.010\nNot open a document I already\nhave just to wipe it all out.\n\n194\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.570\nAnd then, of course,\nthe whole option of, what is it,\n\n195\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.158\nstart from an existing document.\n\n196\n00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.270\nI am starting from an existing document,\nand\n\n197\n00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.502\nI don't wanna mess with it other than\nto put the mail ware stuff in it.\n\n198\n00:09:56.502 --> 00:09:57.670\n&gt;&gt; And I would have already opened it.\n\n199\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because, if you choose the,\n\n200\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.290\nI'm gonna close this.\n\n201\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.450\n&gt;&gt; If I start from the existing\ndocument then it's gonna say,\n\n202\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:03.430\nwell which file do you want?\n\n203\n00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.330\nAnd which file do you-\n&gt;&gt; I would have opend this one, yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I feel this step\ncan be slightly confusing.\n\n205\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.740\nAnd that's why I say open\nthe document that you know-\n\n206\n00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.740\n&gt;&gt; Just bring it up.\n\n207\n00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if I'm gonna start a template\nthen go ahead and do a blank doc.\n\n208\n00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:25.290\nSo it's kind of like one of those,\nit's almost like too common sensey.\n\n209\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, someone over thought this,\nI think [LAUGH].\n\n210\n00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:31.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like, we'll put in this, yeah,\n\n211\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.296\nwe would have already been there, homie.\n\n212\n00:10:33.296 --> 00:10:34.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah, but\n\n213\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.750\nat least it's trying,\nthat too much hand holding.\n\n214\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.282\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Can be a little misleading.\n\n215\n00:10:39.282 --> 00:10:39.808\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:44.320\n&gt;&gt; So yep, I'm using the current document,\nI'm good, that’s step two.\n\n217\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.060\nSo the next step I’m gonna\ndo is select my recipients.\n\n218\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:55.690\nOkay, so again, all of those,\nsteps one and two, it’s almost understood.\n\n219\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It’s assumed.\n\n220\n00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n221\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.430\n&gt;&gt; So just click through it because these\nnext steps will help you kinda, hey,\n\n222\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.580\nwhat do you need to do.\n\n223\n00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.120\nOkay, select our recipients.\n\n224\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.580\nWell we know of other episodes,\n\n225\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.490\nwe can use an existing list,\nOutlook context, or type a new one.\n\n226\n00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.230\nWe're gonna go with an existing list and\nchoose that Excel file.\n\n227\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.153\nSo down here at the bottom,\nyou can see that I need to browse and\n\n228\n00:11:18.153 --> 00:11:19.674\nfind that data source.\n\n229\n00:11:19.674 --> 00:11:23.203\nI've been going up to here in our other\nepisodes, where I'm like go ahead and\n\n230\n00:11:23.203 --> 00:11:24.902\nselect recipients and choose this.\n\n231\n00:11:24.902 --> 00:11:28.528\nBecause I wasn't ready\nto show you the wizard,\n\n232\n00:11:28.528 --> 00:11:33.040\nand I should perform the whole\nmerge as a full process.\n\n233\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.690\nSo, you could totally do this, there's\nnothing wrong with using this method.\n\n234\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.430\nThat wizard over there, or\n\n235\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:44.120\nover here on the right,\nit's only there to kinda guide you along.\n\n236\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.670\nSo doing it from the drop-down\nhere on the ribbon,\n\n237\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.060\nor doing it over here from the wizard,\nit's gonna do the same thing.\n\n238\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.750\nIt's gonna connect you to a data source.\n\n239\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.570\nSo don't let that throw you off either.\n\n240\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.660\nIt's like, why are you doing it that way?\n\n241\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.660\nDoesn't that work?\n\n242\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.110\nIt does, okay, options.\n\n243\n00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.440\nSo we're gonna click the Browse button,\nit's,\n\n244\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.060\nnow I'm gonna click the Browse button.\n\n245\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.110\nTakes us out, finds our file.\n\n246\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.920\nWell, we have to find our file.\n\n247\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.660\nAnd we'll go to the Desktop,\nwe'll go to our folder, and\n\n248\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.360\nwe will go to our Excel file.\n\n249\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.710\nWe will click Open.\n\n250\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.540\nI have to choose a worksheet,\nwe know this.\n\n251\n00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.220\nI'm gonna choose the first one.\n\n252\n00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.440\nAnd my first row has headers now.\n\n253\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.220\nThis is one that we haven't popped up yet\n\n254\n00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.250\nin our other episodes when we were\nselecting a data source, it just did it.\n\n255\n00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:32.320\nIn this one, this is where going through\nthe wizard, it's automatically bringing up\n\n256\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:38.970\nthis dialog box for you to be able to\nsort your records, filter your records.\n\n257\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.170\nTurn ones that you don't want off.\n\n258\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.520\nI really don't wanna send it\nto Bishop Timothy because\n\n259\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.740\nhe's already in the letter, right?\n\n260\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:51.740\nSo I could just take that and uncheck\nthis one record off and not use it.\n\n261\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.690\nI can filter it, I only want\nthe people from the state of Florida.\n\n262\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.330\nI only want the marketing department.\n\n263\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.040\nAll of that can be done\nfrom this particular step.\n\n264\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.128\nI'm gonna click okay,\ncuz you're like, goodness,\n\n265\n00:13:04.128 --> 00:13:06.600\nI didn't do what I was supposed to do.\n\n266\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.260\nThat dialog box that you can use to\nfilter your list, it's right here.\n\n267\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.815\nAnytime you have any data source, it\ndoesn't matter if it's Excel or Outlook,\n\n268\n00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:17.035\nyou click this and\nit's gonna bring us back up, okay?\n\n269\n00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:17.845\n&gt;&gt; Well that's handy.\n\n270\n00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:18.885\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and\n\n271\n00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:22.505\nwe're gonna have a whole episode on\ndifferent ways that we can do this.\n\n272\n00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:26.060\nAnd how we can kind of limit\nour searches and, not searches,\n\n273\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.220\nmail merges and everything.\n\n274\n00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.170\nIt's a whole other way.\n\n275\n00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.170\nDeep dive, right?\n\n276\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.530\nLittle pieces.\n\n277\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.932\nWhat, deep dive, little pieces,\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n278\n00:13:34.932 --> 00:13:36.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; LAUGH] You\n\n279\n00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.917\nall know what I'm talking about.\n\n280\n00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:41.150\n[LAUGH] And so now you could see,\nin the wizard, it's like, yep.\n\n281\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.720\nThere we go,\n\n282\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.370\nit has selected that particular\nworksheet in this particular file.\n\n283\n00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:50.190\nSo I am ready to go, let's go down to\nthe bottom and go to the next step,\n\n284\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.650\nwhich is write your letter.\n\n285\n00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.380\nSo if you have not already done so,\nwrite your letter.\n\n286\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.132\nWell, I have.\n\n287\n00:13:57.132 --> 00:14:00.640\nI've typed in, thank you for\nyour interest in Christmas Cats, and\n\n288\n00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.430\nthen you can add certain information.\n\n289\n00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.199\nThose Fields into your letter, cool.\n\n290\n00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:11.670\nIn the Word, no this is Word,\nin PC version,\n\n291\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.520\nWindows, you've got these pre-made blocks.\n\n292\n00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.669\nI can't remember if you were\nwith me on the Mac ones,\n\n293\n00:14:19.669 --> 00:14:24.040\nbut in Mac, they don't have\nan address block or a greeting line.\n\n294\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.611\nThey just don't have it, okay?\n\n295\n00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:29.402\nYou have to put in first, last,\naddress, city, state, ZIP.\n\n296\n00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:33.727\nSince it's a common thing,\nand we're in PC land,\n\n297\n00:14:33.727 --> 00:14:37.460\nit has address blocks, or a greeting line.\n\n298\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.990\nSo that's kind of a nice way\nof having these pre-made\n\n299\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.850\nthings that are very commonly\nused in a mail merge, neat.\n\n300\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.800\nLet's start with doing\nindividual fields first.\n\n301\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.900\nI have the word name,\nI physically typed that in.\n\n302\n00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.760\nI'm going to select this,\nI'm going to delete it just for fun,\n\n303\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.290\nand I always like to turn on my show and\nhide characters for anything I do in Word.\n\n304\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.430\nSo I'm gonna jump over to the home tab for\na minute and\n\n305\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.540\nturn on that pilcrow right here.\n\n306\n00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.350\nAnd turn on our show and hide\ncharacters so we can see the different,\n\n307\n00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.020\nthat's the wrong key, the different\nspaces and all that kind of fun stuff.\n\n308\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.160\nSo if I was typing this in I\nwould say dear, space, and\n\n309\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.320\nnow I want their first name.\n\n310\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.665\nBack over on Mailings,\nI'm going to give you a good suggestion.\n\n311\n00:15:23.665 --> 00:15:28.610\n[LAUGH] Right over here there's a, in\nthe wizard, there's a more items button.\n\n312\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.840\nWhen I click it it gives me\na list of all of our fields.\n\n313\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.460\nIt is much harder to insert fields and\n\n314\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:40.125\nthen continue to write your letters\nif you use this dialogue box.\n\n315\n00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:43.620\nCuz you can't come back and\nthen hit the spacebar.\n\n316\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.400\nCuz I wanna do first name,\nspace, last name.\n\n317\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.410\nThis is not going to be easy for\nyou, so I would just avoid it.\n\n318\n00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.430\nClose it out, use the drop down.\n\n319\n00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.605\nOkay, this is where you're gonna go up to\nthe ribbon, and stop using the wizard,\n\n320\n00:15:55.605 --> 00:15:56.400\nit's a lot easier.\n\n321\n00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.442\nFlashing cursor, I want my field to go\njust like I'd be writing regular text.\n\n322\n00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:05.554\nAnd you put in the First name fields and\nthose are gillnets.\n\n323\n00:16:05.554 --> 00:16:06.545\nThey are.\n\n324\n00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:08.143\n&gt;&gt; Don't even try.\n\n325\n00:16:08.143 --> 00:16:11.239\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The French word.\n\n326\n00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:12.665\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Angle Brackets.\n\n327\n00:16:12.665 --> 00:16:13.687\n&gt;&gt; We'll call it the French connection.\n\n328\n00:16:13.687 --> 00:16:17.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I've got that space and\n\n329\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.605\nnow I'm going to insert the last name.\n\n330\n00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:21.090\nPerfect!\n\n331\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.920\nSame thing with our city.\n\n332\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.590\nLet's select it.\n\n333\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.810\nDrop this down.\n\n334\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.560\nCity.\n\n335\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.350\nAnd maybe I'm feeling saucy.\n\n336\n00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:33.890\nI'm gonna do a comma, space,\nand then there's State.\n\n337\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.430\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n338\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.910\nNow, see, it moved everything around.\n\n339\n00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.500\nThat's okay.\n\n340\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.600\nIt, treat this like regular text.\n\n341\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.800\nIf you have a long line of text,\n\n342\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.770\nit's gonna move the line down because of\nthe default word wrap and everything.\n\n343\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.760\n&gt;&gt; But that's a variable thing, as the,\nit could be you know Bay Florida.\n\n344\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.445\nWhich would be very small, which would\nprobably not have any word wrap, so.\n\n345\n00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Just gonna depend on what that variable\n\n346\n00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.390\ncontent is.\n\n347\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:01.751\n&gt;&gt; Like Fort Washington,\nNew York is way longer than Park, Utah.\n\n348\n00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:03.190\n&gt;&gt; Kalamazoo, Michigan [LAUGH].\n\n349\n00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.950\n&gt;&gt; I've been to Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n350\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:05.470\n&gt;&gt; I have as well.\n\n351\n00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very cool.\n\n352\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks.\n\n353\n00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.670\n&gt;&gt; That's wonderful.\n\n354\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.700\nI went head and put in my field.\n\n355\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.380\nSo let's just see if this is\ngoing to work cuz maybe I'm done.\n\n356\n00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.250\nI don't need anything else.\n\n357\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.760\n&gt;&gt; Cuz down at the wizard,\njust to show you down at the bottom,\n\n358\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.300\nthe next step would be to\npreview your letters, okay?\n\n359\n00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.070\nAnd since I told you I was\ngonna go through the wizard,\n\n360\n00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:27.250\nI wanna stay on this cuz I just\nreally wanna go to the top and do it.\n\n361\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.510\nBut let's click on the preview, and yay,\n\n362\n00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:36.530\nI can see Bishop Timothy is\nthe first record in my data source.\n\n363\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.120\nSo I can see it.\n\n364\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.600\nAnd that was also up here.\n\n365\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.410\nThe preview results is turned on.\n\n366\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.390\nSo that's great.\n\n367\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.160\nEither from here or\nhere, it's all the same.\n\n368\n00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.920\nOkay, remember these\ncontrols are not different.\n\n369\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.320\n&gt;&gt; They're connected to the same thing.\n\n370\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.540\nSo, like a differant panel on your dash.\n\n371\n00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.350\n&gt;&gt; And since we've turned\non the step by step wizard,\n\n372\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.680\nit's giving us these options over here.\n\n373\n00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.100\nSo, if I click on\nthe recipients right there,\n\n374\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.380\nyou can just start kinda clicking\nthrough and you can see everything.\n\n375\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.870\nThere's that Port Washington, right?\n\n376\n00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.500\nBecause one of my friends lives there.\n\n377\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.480\nSo you could go through there and, yep,\nthat's working, and you just go back and\n\n378\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.920\nforth and\nthat looks like it's working pretty cool.\n\n379\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.900\nI like it, I'm very happy with this,\nbut I really want to add more fields.\n\n380\n00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.600\nMaybe I want to change the name to red.\n\n381\n00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.480\nMaybe I want to center the greeting line.\n\n382\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.605\nDoesn't really make any sense but\nyou could.\n\n383\n00:18:28.605 --> 00:18:31.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where I would suggest\n\n384\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.800\nturning off the preview.\n\n385\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.140\nEight times out of ten, it'll probably\nwork fine with the preview on and\n\n386\n00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.890\neverything will be great.\n\n387\n00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.535\n&gt;&gt; It's that ninth and\ntenth time that'll totally hose you.\n\n388\n00:18:43.535 --> 00:18:47.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing is the preview will\n\n389\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.586\nresult in it being blank.\n\n390\n00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:52.209\nAnd you're like, [SOUND] It's like,\nno, no, no, the field's there.\n\n391\n00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:53.900\nIt just kinda got self tripped up.\n\n392\n00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.700\n&gt;&gt; Freaked out.\n\n393\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI suggest turning off the preview.\n\n394\n00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.360\nAnd I'm going back.\n\n395\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.320\nNow, this is where I'm going to\nabandon the wizard, in the sense of,\n\n396\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.010\nI know I need to go back, in the sense of,\nI need to insert another field.\n\n397\n00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.940\nLet me just show you down at the bottom,\nhere in the Wizard.\n\n398\n00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.740\nNotice that I'm on step five of six,\nif I go, okay,\n\n399\n00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.640\nlet's go back, and I come over here.\n\n400\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.340\nBut I, really it's just\nmuch easier over here, so.\n\n401\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.060\nThey're not connected.\n\n402\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.240\nWell it's funny because we just\nsaid they are the buttons.\n\n403\n00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.250\nThe actual commands that were clicked in.\n\n404\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:34.480\nBut the steps as to which pane when\nI am in in the steps of the wizard.\n\n405\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.050\nThat could just stay out here, and I can\ndo everything up here from the river.\n\n406\n00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:39.880\nRiver?\n[LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.475\n&gt;&gt; From the river.\n\n408\n00:19:40.475 --> 00:19:41.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Down to the river,\n\n409\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.978\nall right Vonne, stop.\n\n410\n00:19:43.978 --> 00:19:45.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] I'm just gonna come back\n\n411\n00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.099\nup here and\ngo [LAUGH] from the ribbon, and\n\n412\n00:19:48.099 --> 00:19:51.740\nsay yep,\nlet's maybe put in the address block here.\n\n413\n00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.830\nCuz I wanna see that cool premade one.\n\n414\n00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.676\nSo I'm gonna click address block, yeah.\n\n415\n00:19:57.676 --> 00:20:02.750\nAnd then over here,\nthat doesn't look right does it?\n\n416\n00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.510\nBishop Timothy, Florida zip.\n\n417\n00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.420\nIt's missing some stuff.\n\n418\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.640\n&gt;&gt; Probably gonna have a hard\ntime getting to his city.\n\n419\n00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Or street.\n\n420\n00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n421\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.470\nSo we have some missing problems, but\n\n422\n00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.710\nI know I have that in the data source,\ndon't I?\n\n423\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:17.850\nWhat's going on here?\n\n424\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.460\nSometimes it doesn't make\nthe connection of how\n\n425\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.120\nmail merge in Word sees address line or\ncity.\n\n426\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.770\nLet's look at it.\n\n427\n00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.620\nThe cool thing is, if it doesn't match,\nand you know you have fields.\n\n428\n00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.470\nRight there,\nthere's a Match Fields button,\n\n429\n00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.320\nwhich is the same one up here, okay?\n\n430\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.250\nCould have done it either way.\n\n431\n00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.720\nSo I'm going to match the field,\nand see, it says, Address 1.\n\n432\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.150\nWell, that's not the name of my field,\nis it?\n\n433\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.760\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I don't have an Address 1, Address 2,\n\n434\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.430\nso it's just saying, hey, for what I see\nas Address 1, tell me what you named it.\n\n435\n00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.360\nThat one is address.\n\n436\n00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.900\nPerfect.\nSo now we're matching up, like, what word\n\n437\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.670\nmail merge is seeing, what my data source\nis seeing and connecting the dots.\n\n438\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.220\nSame with the city.\n\n439\n00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.640\nAnd that could, you're like city, city.\n\n440\n00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.860\nWhy didn't it?\nI think had that, like, spaced.\n\n441\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.680\nRemember?\n\n442\n00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.650\nMaybe that threw it off.\n\n443\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.070\nI'm just gonna go with that.\n\n444\n00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It just didn't.\n\n445\n00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.550\nThis is a nice thing,\nremember this matching for\n\n446\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.210\nthe set of data sources on this computer?\n\n447\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:19.680\nThat can be a good one if this is how,\nif you have a lot of files,\n\n448\n00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.350\nthe way that your data source is gonna\nbe and you need to match it to this.\n\n449\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.000\nSo just remember that check\nbox can be very handy for\n\n450\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.640\nyou, kind of takes out having\nto do this every time.\n\n451\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.110\nClick OK, and there we go.\n\n452\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.240\nNow we're looking pretty good over here.\n\n453\n00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.140\nThe default one, notice there's a lot\nof options of how you can address this.\n\n454\n00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.740\nAnd right here I have a Josh Q Randall,\nJr.\n\n455\n00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.360\nI click on that, that didn't change\nanything over there, did it?\n\n456\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.002\nOr I put in,\nI think there's another one of Mr.\n\n457\n00:21:48.002 --> 00:21:50.020\nJosh Randall, that didn't change either.\n\n458\n00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.057\nSo it's not gonna automatically add a Mr.\n\n459\n00:21:54.057 --> 00:21:57.690\nor a Mrs.\nIt has to be in your data source.\n\n460\n00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.000\nLet's go back down to that match fields.\n\n461\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.470\nDo you see how it has a courtesy title?\n\n462\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.350\nOkay, and a suffix?\n\n463\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.320\nOkay, and a nick name, all those things?\n\n464\n00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.870\nIf you had those fields\nin your data source.\n\n465\n00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.308\nThen it will go ahead and\npopulate in that address block of the Mr.\n\n466\n00:22:14.308 --> 00:22:16.470\nor Mrs. but it has to be a field.\n\n467\n00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:22.420\n&gt;&gt; Could I also have just made\nlike my first name Mr dot Daniel\n\n468\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.330\nand put that in the first name field?\n\n469\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.010\n&gt;&gt; You could.\n&gt;&gt; And that would pick it up as well?\n\n470\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:26.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n471\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that’s also I mean this gets into\n\n472\n00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.180\nthe weird rules of like,\n\n473\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.820\nyou want to try to keep each\none of these in its own field.\n\n474\n00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.710\nAnd if you put together like, if you\nput the first and last name in name,\n\n475\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.780\nthat can really throw some things off.\n\n476\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.140\nSo it's better or\n\n477\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.960\nsuggested to keep everything separate in\na separate column or a certain field.\n\n478\n00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.190\nBut yes, you could totally do that.\n\n479\n00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.190\nYes.\nThat's why.\n\n480\n00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.290\nSo don't just expect that it's going\nto throw all the stuff in here.\n\n481\n00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.230\nIt matches with your data source fields.\n\n482\n00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.980\nThat's the only way it's going to do that.\n\n483\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.520\nAnd that is good.\n\n484\n00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.550\nI like that.\n\n485\n00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.570\nAnd we're previewing.\n\n486\n00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.660\nAnd we're previewing.\n\n487\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.710\nAnd that looks good.\n\n488\n00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.440\nI like it.\nClick OK.\n\n489\n00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.920\nAnd in the Merge,\nit just says address block,\n\n490\n00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.160\nbut when you preview it, that's\nwhere you're going to see okay cool.\n\n491\n00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.330\nI like that.\n\n492\n00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.660\nI think that's good.\n\n493\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.956\nThis is, look, sorry.\n\n494\n00:23:20.956 --> 00:23:21.525\nSorry.\n\n495\n00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:23.480\n[LAUGH] I just stopped.\n\n496\n00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.895\n&gt;&gt; Lund's going to take her medicine.\n\n497\n00:23:25.895 --> 00:23:27.580\n[LAUGH] Or come back.\n\n498\n00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.730\n&gt;&gt; I got excited about this particiular\none because I'm in the preview I'm in\n\n499\n00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.490\nthe fifth record.\n\n500\n00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.181\nDo you remember You guys\nremember in the troubleshooting.\n\n501\n00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:37.193\nI said, like, in your data source,\nyou shouldn't have those extra spaces.\n\n502\n00:23:37.193 --> 00:23:37.745\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n503\n00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:41.703\n[CROSSTALK] And has it.\n\n504\n00:23:41.703 --> 00:23:43.970\nWe saw it in the Excel file,\nwhich I'm still using.\n\n505\n00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n506\n00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.340\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm just showing you in the preview,\n\n507\n00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.680\nand all those, I'm like,\nit's not doing it.\n\n508\n00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.000\nI don't know why Microsoft\nis trying to be forgiving.\n\n509\n00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.128\nWell, guess what This episode has\nproven me wrong in what I said.\n\n510\n00:23:54.128 --> 00:23:56.650\n[LAUGH] It's not forgiving.\n\n511\n00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:57.206\nIt's not trying it.\n\n512\n00:23:57.206 --> 00:23:59.275\nSomething was wrong with my file.\n\n513\n00:23:59.275 --> 00:24:01.169\nYou know.\n\n514\n00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:03.843\nSo but I did the merge and\nperform it again.\n\n515\n00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:04.816\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n516\n00:24:04.816 --> 00:24:06.294\nStranger things have happened, right?\n\n517\n00:24:06.294 --> 00:24:11.056\nBut that right there,\nyou can see that Sasha Cat has space,\n\n518\n00:24:11.056 --> 00:24:15.070\nspace from the data source,\nthen another space.\n\n519\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.254\nThis is the example of why you\nwanna make sure your data source\n\n520\n00:24:21.254 --> 00:24:25.801\nhas no extra white spaces after\nthe entry you have in that\n\n521\n00:24:25.801 --> 00:24:30.171\nparticular field,\nin that particular cell, cool.\n\n522\n00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:31.282\nSo I'm like, I know what this is.\n\n523\n00:24:31.282 --> 00:24:32.990\nWhat it does-\n&gt;&gt; It does do this thing.\n\n524\n00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.630\n&gt;&gt; Remember I said,\n\n525\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.750\neven though you don't see me right\nnow it's probably gonna happen.\n\n526\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n527\n00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.850\nThere you go.\nIt's happening.\n\n528\n00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.460\n&gt;&gt; So I feel slightly vindicated.\n\n529\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.341\n&gt;&gt; Vonne-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:24:42.341 --> 00:24:43.401\n&gt;&gt; Her gremlins are real.\n\n531\n00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:47.581\n[LAUGH] She's not making\nthem up in their head.\n\n532\n00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:49.296\n&gt;&gt; See, I told you people, I told you.\n\n533\n00:24:49.296 --> 00:24:50.930\n&gt;&gt; I told you gremlins are real.\n\n534\n00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.400\n&gt;&gt; Now this is where I'm going to\nhold myself back, because right now,\n\n535\n00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.640\nthat preview, I can't stand that\nthere's all that space after.\n\n536\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.310\nBut in our block, it's only one line.\n\n537\n00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.930\nSo it's like, hey,\nhow is it doing all that spacing?\n\n538\n00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.020\nYou have to remember\nthat this will export,\n\n539\n00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.050\nif you wanna say, out as three lines.\n\n540\n00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.410\nYou're gonna have to turn off the preview,\nstart formatting.\n\n541\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.510\nThis is where I'm holding myself back\nof going to crazy with the formats,\n\n542\n00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.610\nI'm just gonna do a few of them,\n\n543\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:23.010\nespecially with the address block,\ntaking that space after paragraph, yes.\n\n544\n00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.770\nSo then if I come back over to mailing,\npreview.\n\n545\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:27.780\nThat makes me feel better.\n\n546\n00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.670\nAnd maybe I want to bold this,\nmaybe I wanna center it,\n\n547\n00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.510\nchange the font, treat it as text.\n\n548\n00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.970\nSo you select, just like you would,\nselect your text.\n\n549\n00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.060\nYou come over.\n\n550\n00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.300\nYou bold it.\n\n551\n00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.600\nI make it a little bigger.\n\n552\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.050\nI make it red.\n\n553\n00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:43.900\nI center it.\n\n554\n00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.730\nI don't really want the last\nname in there anymore.\n\n555\n00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.940\nThis is just a text field.\n\n556\n00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.220\nYou take your cursor and you backspace.\n\n557\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.250\n&gt;&gt; You back it out.\n\n558\n00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.490\n&gt;&gt; I don't want this date anymore.\n\n559\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:02.570\nSo one back space selects it,\nsecond back space will then get rid of it.\n\n560\n00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.330\nDon't want that comma there, I'm good.\n\n561\n00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.060\nSo, format to your heart's content,\nokay, all of that stuff.\n\n562\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.500\nSpacings, font size, color, alignment.\n\n563\n00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.710\nLet's zoom out just slightly, and I will\nthen, whoops, that's the wrong button.\n\n564\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.590\nLet's go back to mailings and\ncome over to preview.\n\n565\n00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.910\nWonderful, that's great.\n\n566\n00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.980\nI know I'm gonna have the spacing\nbecause of my data source.\n\n567\n00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.480\nAnd so you just keep on going back.\n\n568\n00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.070\nNotice it's moving the text down,\ndepending on that variable length of text.\n\n569\n00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.055\n&gt;&gt; Cheetos.\n&gt;&gt; And this is-\n\n570\n00:26:32.055 --> 00:26:32.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n571\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.022\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n572\n00:26:34.022 --> 00:26:34.689\nI love Cheetos.\n\n573\n00:26:34.689 --> 00:26:35.382\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n574\n00:26:35.382 --> 00:26:37.883\n&gt;&gt; There's a whole litter\nof cats that we had,\n\n575\n00:26:37.883 --> 00:26:39.797\n&gt;&gt; Named after snack chips.\n\n576\n00:26:39.797 --> 00:26:43.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there was, the mom was Frito Lay.\n\n577\n00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.440\n&gt;&gt; Pringles.\n\n578\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:51.120\n&gt;&gt; There was Cheeto, Triscuit, and,\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n579\n00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.948\none cat we didn't care about,\nbecause we didn't even remember his name.\n\n580\n00:26:53.948 --> 00:26:57.895\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; There are barn cats and yeah so.\n\n581\n00:26:57.895 --> 00:26:58.645\nAnyways yes.\n\n582\n00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:00.325\nCheeto, and Trisket, and Frito Lay.\n\n583\n00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:01.185\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n584\n00:27:01.185 --> 00:27:02.765\n&gt;&gt; Okay cuz those are the ones I remember.\n\n585\n00:27:02.765 --> 00:27:04.575\nAll right lovely, I think that's great.\n\n586\n00:27:04.575 --> 00:27:06.375\nSo you can see all\nthe stuff it's been doing.\n\n587\n00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:10.001\nAnswer the fields, preview,\nturned the preview off, format, yay,\n\n588\n00:27:10.001 --> 00:27:15.380\ndelete, add, wonderful, I am done.\n\n589\n00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.410\nBig step,\nyou should save your merge document.\n\n590\n00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.870\nBecause remember, we're still on the what?\n\n591\n00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.680\nThe start document.\n\n592\n00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.560\nSo I am going to definitely do a file,\nsave as.\n\n593\n00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.900\nI am going to put this onto my desktop,\nand we are going to name this\n\n594\n00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.400\nChristmas Cats Merge Merged,\nand I'm gonna say show so\n\n595\n00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.860\nI know that I did this during the show,\nbecause I like to keep start, merged,\n\n596\n00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.920\nfinished as my naming convention for\nthe files that I need to have.\n\n597\n00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.120\nI click save, and so now I know that\nthis is the one with the data source,\n\n598\n00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.930\nhas all my fields, I'm good to go.\n\n599\n00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.950\nI only have one page in this document.\n\n600\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.410\nBut I have 19 wrappers in my data source.\n\n601\n00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.150\nBiggest step, and you can either do\nit at the bottom of this wizard,\n\n602\n00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:06.940\nbecause I'm in step five of doing my mail\nmerge, I need to complete this merge.\n\n603\n00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:12.830\nAnd from here,\nyou gotta go into edit individual letters.\n\n604\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:16.820\nThat's the same as up here on the ribbon,\nyou come to this and\n\n605\n00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.320\nyou edit the individual documents.\n\n606\n00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.550\nTelling you after all the many,\nmany years of teaching this product,\n\n607\n00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:27.740\nas soon as I show somebody,\nlike my gosh that's what I did.\n\n608\n00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.290\nI totally forgot because\nthey usually just print it.\n\n609\n00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.710\nThey're like, I just print and\n\n610\n00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.880\nwhen I print I know I can\nget everything printed out.\n\n611\n00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.730\nThat's fine, too.\n\n612\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:36.290\nI want the file.\n\n613\n00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.190\nYou gotta edit it.\n\n614\n00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:42.110\nYou tell it how your range\nof records you want.\n\n615\n00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.000\nWe're just going with all.\n\n616\n00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.160\nYou click okay.\n\n617\n00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.580\nLook at this, different file.\n\n618\n00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.650\nThat is not the same file.\n\n619\n00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:53.090\nSo with this, letters one,\nyou can see it down there.\n\n620\n00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.170\nThis is my 19 pages.\n\n621\n00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.710\nThis is my finish merge.\n\n622\n00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.130\nThis is not a field.\n\n623\n00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.170\nThere's no data connection here and\n\n624\n00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.680\nif I needed to come down\ninto like that Sasha cat.\n\n625\n00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.720\nLike I just have a couple.\n\n626\n00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.980\nI'll edit these individual, that's what\nI thought, edit individual letters.\n\n627\n00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.990\nAnd I'll take this one and edit and\nthen maybe I'm thinking, you know what?\n\n628\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.170\nI don't like the red.\n\n629\n00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.130\nRed 's not working.\n\n630\n00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:17.890\n&gt;&gt; Not a big fan.\n\n631\n00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:18.800\n&gt;&gt; No, it's fine.\n\n632\n00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.460\n&gt;&gt; It's dumb.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is the finished file.\n\n633\n00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.390\nYou close this.\n\n634\n00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.410\nHow easy was it for\nme to click that button to finish and\n\n635\n00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.430\nmerge and create this?\n\n636\n00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.960\n&gt;&gt; Pretty simple.\n\n637\n00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.660\n&gt;&gt; Pretty simple.\n\n638\n00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.500\n&gt;&gt; So you just say nope,\nI don't want this.\n\n639\n00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.680\nTurn off the preview.\n\n640\n00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.270\nClick on this.\n\n641\n00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.410\nSelect it.\n\n642\n00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.040\nLet's just put it over to the left.\n\n643\n00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.000\nLet's make it not red.\n\n644\n00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.210\nAnd there we go.\n\n645\n00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:44.440\nAnd then you just finish the merge,\nedit, yeah, all of them.\n\n646\n00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.530\nHere we go, that's what I want.\n\n647\n00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:51.580\nSo that's why you have that merge\ndocument and then you finish the merge.\n\n648\n00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.970\nThis is a separate document and\n\n649\n00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:57.320\nyou just keep on going back and\nclose this, don't save this,\n\n650\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.960\nas many times as you need then you get\nyour finished, finished product right.\n\n651\n00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.230\nAnd that's why the previews,\ni's nice to have that there so\n\n652\n00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:07.790\nyou don't have to keep like stop, delete\nthis file, all that kind of fun stuff.\n\n653\n00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.150\nBut if this is the one I want,\nI have a save as button by the

as long as you\n\n673\n00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:12.910\nkeep the same headings and\nthen you have different names,\n\n674\n00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.650\nall you gotta do is just\ncome back over to recipient.\n\n675\n00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.580\nSo you don't even have to do the wizard.\n\n676\n00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.050\nJust change the source.\n\n677\n00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.980\nCome on over to another one.\n\n678\n00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.050\nWhat did I call this?\n\n679\n00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.680\nChange source, okay.\n\n680\n00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.445\nThat's a good

block?\n\n685\n00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I should have checked that because I\n\n686\n00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.940\nwouldn't had this problem, but\nyou guys know how to fix it.\n\n687\n00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.350\nThere's Oliver, and Missy, and\nTwiggy, and Cupcake, and Boo.\n\n688\n00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.640\nSame exact headings, everything's fine,\nall I've

Pay no attention\n\n64\n00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:41.589\nto the label on this [LAUGH] box.\n\n65\n00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:42.483\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n66\n00:02:42.483 --> 00:02:45.642\nBut you could see we're not\nbrand-specific, there's all sorts of ones.\n\n67\n00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:46.828\nI think it-\n&gt;&gt; Choose your favorites.\n\n68\n00:02:46.828 --> 00:02:51.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and they come in these\ndifferent pre-made pieces of paper.\n\n69\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.795\nEither they're stickers, or sometimes\nthey're just perforated, for example,\n\n70\n00:02:56.795 --> 00:03:01.065\nlike these name badges, they're not\nlabels, like actual stickers, but\n\n71\n00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:03.530\nthey're perforated into six up on a page.\n\n72\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.790\nAnd a lot of them should\ntell you how many.\n\n73\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.860\nWe call this impositioning, imprinting.\n\n74\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.030\nSo how many up on a page you have.\n\n75\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.934\nSo we have 6 per name badge,\non this one it looks like we have 30.\n\n76\n00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.158\nSo these are our address labels and\n\n77\n00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:21.845\nthen each one of these pre-designed paper\nhas a specific number, which is somewhere.\n\n78\n00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:24.472\nYes, because this is saying 5160.\n\n79\n00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:28.205\nThat is a very common number for\naddress labels.\n\n80\n00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:30.435\nI've memorized that, well because\nI've been doing mail merge for\n\n81\n00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:32.225\nmany, many years, okay?\n\n82\n00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:36.049\nAnd then you go ahead and get the pieces\nof paper, and this one is half done so\n\n83\n00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.770\nyou can see that some of the stickers\nare printed out and not printed out.\n\n84\n00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.790\nAnd that's what you do.\n\n85\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.170\nSo you have to determine what type\nof label I'm going to be using.\n\n86\n00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.460\nMaybe, like the file folder,\n\n87\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.320\nwe talked about that in\ncreating the data source list.\n\n88\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.960\nWhich, guess what?\n\n89\n00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.530\nI have them right here.\n\n90\n00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n91\n00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:57.988\nSo I've got all these different ones,\nthe cool thing about it, these number and\n\n92\n00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:03.110\nthese branded products, whether it's\nAveyer, or 3M, or what have you.\n\n93\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.700\nThis is all like built into word.\n\n94\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.226\nAnd it has the entire library of\nanything that every creates, and\n\n95\n00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:12.457\nthere is a lot of stuff in there.\n\n96\n00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:16.128\nSo the neat thing is,\nyou go ahead and buy this paper,\n\n97\n00:04:16.128 --> 00:04:19.300\nthen you go ahead and do your mail merge.\n\n98\n00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.230\nAnd you match that number,\n\n99\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.610\nit changes the layout of your\ndocument to that and lines it all up.\n\n100\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.960\nWell, hopefully,\nlines it all up close enough and\n\n101\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.870\nthen you stick that into your printer and\nthen you print it out.\n\n102\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.480\n&gt;&gt; You print again afterwards, cuz it's\nwrong, [LAUGH] every time, every time.\n\n103\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.020\n&gt;&gt; Every single time, yeah.\n\n104\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.397\nAnd so, we'll talk about some\nof those little caveats and\n\n105\n00:04:40.397 --> 00:04:41.880\nmaybe some tips and tricks.\n\n106\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.440\nIf you don't already know some of\nyour little tips of how it makes for\n\n107\n00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.560\nyour particular printer, but\nwe'll cover that at the end.\n\n108\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.680\nLet's go ahead and\n\n109\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.290\nget down into the steps that we're\ngoing to need to perform with labels.\n\n110\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.270\nIt's very much like the letters, okay?\n\n111\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.230\nAnd that was on this page up here, so,\nif you wanna go ahead and work maybe.\n\n112\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.640\nAll right, well, ooh, guess what.\n\n113\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.000\nAnd we have a crash.\n\n114\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.740\nHey, guys [LAUGH].\n\n115\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.815\n&gt;&gt; Boom, welcome to real world.\n\n116\n00:05:10.815 --> 00:05:12.399\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Every time and\n\n117\n00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:14.140\nI don't know why it crashes.\n\n118\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.106\n&gt;&gt; Because it crashes.\n\n119\n00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.310\n[LAUGH] It's scheduled to\ncrash at this time today.\n\n120\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.923\nYou knew that.\n\n121\n00:05:17.923 --> 00:05:21.010\n&gt;&gt; Because it really likes this show.\n\n122\n00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.570\nThis by the way has happened\na couple times on this show.\n\n123\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.500\nIt really want to prove me wrong.\n\n124\n00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.860\nSo why don't we try that again?\n\n125\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.650\nLet's go ahead and\nopen that file up once more.\n\n126\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.292\nYou know what,\nI bet you there's some updates,\n\n127\n00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:35.416\ncuz I think that was the last time it\nhappened Word crashed in the middle, and\n\n128\n00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:38.650\nthen I opened up Outlook and\nit says, new in Office 365.\n\n129\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.960\nYou might have seen that episode.\n\n130\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.005\nAnd then I was like hm,\n\n131\n00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:43.270\nlooks like it did some updating-\n&gt;&gt; Look at this.\n\n132\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.936\n&gt;&gt; Right in the middle of\nfilming my episode, so\n\n133\n00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:48.472\nlet's put there we go now we're working.\n\n134\n00:05:48.472 --> 00:05:50.190\n[LAUGH] Nothing like a good restart.\n\n135\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.610\nSo, in their labels,\nit's very much like our letters.\n\n136\n00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.018\nBut the biggest difference, I would say,\nis that when you're doing labels,\n\n137\n00:05:58.018 --> 00:06:00.880\nyou're not gonna have a start document.\n\n138\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.740\nLike the letters,\nwhere you type it all out.\n\n139\n00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.440\nLike I just need a blank new document.\n\n140\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.380\nSo really if you think about the files,\nremember in letters I have one,\n\n141\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.120\ntwo, three, one was optional.\n\n142\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.220\nYou start with a new one so\nyou kind of end up with just three files.\n\n143\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.370\nTwo files, sorry, [LAUGH], one two, the\nmerged document and the finished document.\n\n144\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.660\nSo I'm also going a little bit more on.\n\n145\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.255\nYou've already watched\nthe letters episode.\n\n146\n00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:33.550\nSo I might just kind of\ncondense a few steps,\n\n147\n00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.730\nand just kind of assume\nyou've watched that.\n\n148\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.270\nSo some of this might be a little foggy,\ndefinitely go back and\n\n149\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.260\nwatch that one first.\n\n150\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260\nCuz I'm just gonna go maybe\na little faster with our labels.\n\n151\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.500\nSo you have a merged document that has\na data source connection, and the fields,\n\n152\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.720\nand then the finished documents.\n\n153\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.590\nSo you really only have two.\n\n154\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.880\nSame steps you go through.\n\n155\n00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.980\nYou can do the wizard just like we did.\n\n156\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.230\nI'm not gonna do the wizard for\nthis particular example just for fun.\n\n157\n00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.240\nThe biggest one is that it's going to\nchange the layout of your document\n\n158\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.250\nbased on what number of\npaper that you selected.\n\n159\n00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.060\nAnd it's gonna create a table.\n\n160\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.540\nThat's the biggest one here.\n\n161\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.615\nIf you are not comfortable working\nin tables in Word, you might want to\n\n162\n00:07:15.615 --> 00:07:20.530\nbrush up on that before you start\nmaking labels with the mail merge.\n\n163\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.750\nBecause you do need to\nunderstand the conceptual table.\n\n164\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.570\nHow to select on the contextual tabs.\n\n165\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.060\nI am gonna show you, but I'm gonna just,\n\n166\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.970\nkind of, again, that assumed\nknowledge of you know how to do this.\n\n167\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.922\nThere is a Word Advanced Show series and\nthen you can find, I think there's four or\n\n168\n00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:40.010\nfive episodes on working\nwith tables in Word, okay?\n\n169\n00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.863\nThe other biggest difference in being\nlabels as opposed to letters is this one\n\n170\n00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:45.691\nright here.\n\n171\n00:07:45.691 --> 00:07:50.502\nYou got to update the label, if you don't\nupdate the label it's not going to fill up\n\n172\n00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:54.902\nthe whole thing because you are going\nto be still putting in your fields, but\n\n173\n00:07:54.902 --> 00:07:58.172\nyou're only gonna design for\nthe first top left label.\n\n174\n00:07:58.172 --> 00:08:02.421\nAnd then when you update it,\nit will populate for all of your labels.\n\n175\n00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:04.670\nSo that's another big part here.\n\n176\n00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.820\nYou've still got the hole.\n\n177\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.540\nYou've gotta finish the merge.\n\n178\n00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.960\nAnd you're going to preview, and then turn\noff the preview and edit as needed, and so\n\n179\n00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.590\non and so forth.\n\n180\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.485\nAnd I'll show you some little\ntips with the formatting that I,\n\n181\n00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:20.041\nyou know like to do for my labels and\nhopefully you might to, because if you\n\n182\n00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:25.290\nare as OCD as me [LAUGH] about spacing and\nalignment, then you've got the right show.\n\n183\n00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n184\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:26.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n185\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.080\noverall that's good to go.\n\n186\n00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.300\nI'm going to close this file, I'm gonna\nalso like help restart Word, since it was.\n\n187\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.350\nI don't know if you notice,.\n\n188\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.380\nI was trying to select text.\n\n189\n00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:36.978\nAnd it wasn't like.\n\n190\n00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:38.307\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't hanging out for you?\n\n191\n00:08:38.307 --> 00:08:39.175\nIt wasn't doing a thing?\n\n192\n00:08:39.175 --> 00:08:40.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so I'm just like.\n\n193\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.480\n&gt;&gt;

Yes.\n\n536\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.463\n&gt;&gt; Down, left, right, do this, do that.\n\n537\n00:24:36.463 --> 00:24:39.742\nYou'll even see little graphics on\nthe printer itself to let you know.\n\n538\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.050\nThis reverses itself inside of there.\n\n539\n00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.080\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you how\nmany times I've done this.\n\n540\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.770\nAnd this is going to be very specific\nto your printer at your company,\n\n541\n00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.230\noffice, home, whatever it is.\n\n542\n00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.830\nBecause I know the one at UF I have,\nmy gosh,\n\n543\n00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.720\ncuz it was like the big one, right,\nand so you had to do the trays.\n\n544\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.850\nAnd what I would do is I'd\ntake a piece of paper and\n\n545\n00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.730\nI do like top, bottom, right, and left.\n\n546\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:11.200\nI put in letters here and\nthen I would do up and this would be down.\n\n547\n00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Or front and back, yeah.\n\n548\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.700\n&gt;&gt; And that way I know, and\nthen you have to remember.\n\n549\n00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.390\nOkay so, I put the paper in down.\n\n550\n00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:20.772\n&gt;&gt; Down, face up.\n\n551\n00:25:20.772 --> 00:25:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Upways.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n552\n00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.260\n&gt;&gt; Downward facing dog.\n\n553\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.750\n&gt;&gt; Downside up, yeah.\n\n554\n00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.080\n&gt;&gt; And then, which way, and\n\n555\n00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.090\nthen you have to reorient your head and\nbrain to like- what?\n\n556\n00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n557\n00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.340\nit takes a long time\n[LAUGH] to figure it out.\n\n558\n00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.040\nSo print on this,\ndon't print it on the exp-\n\n559\n00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.110\n&gt;&gt; That's expensive.\n\n560\n00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.640\n&gt;&gt; No.\nPut it on regular paper.\n\n561\n00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n562\n00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:44.850\nPrint on normal paper first and\nthen you can take it and line it up.\n\n563\n00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.440\nAnd that's why like right here-\n&gt;&gt; It does have some.\n\n564\n00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.060\nOn that one doesn't it have\nsome like arrows on it I think?\n\n565\n00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the name badge does.\n\n566\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This one like it says,\n\n567\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.390\nI know you can't really\nsee right there but\n\n568\n00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.310\nit says\n&gt;&gt; Feed this end.\n\n569\n00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n570\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.620\n&gt;&gt; Good luck if that works.\n\n571\n00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n572\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.580\n&gt;&gt; But then I take\n\n573\n00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.170\nthe regular piece of paper.\n\n574\n00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.690\nI take the printed label paper.\n\n575\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.690\nAnd then I line it up.\n\n576\n00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.680\nOkay, is this?\n\n577\n00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.920\nYeah, that looks good.\n\n578\n00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.050\nAnd that's gonna be close enough.\n\n579\n00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.170\nI know you guys can't\ncompletely see this on the.\n\n580\n00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:13.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n581\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.720\n&gt;&gt; Just trust me.\n\n582\n00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so I can see,\n\n583\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.500\nyep, that line's up enough.\n\n584\n00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.140\nOkay, we're good.\n\n585\n00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.130\nNow I'll go ahead and\nstick in my fancy paper.\n\n586\n00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.380\nAnd remember which way I have\nto load it into the printer for\n\n587\n00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:31.260\nit to turn around and spit itself out,\nand then print the right side up.\n\n588\n00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.330\nThe cool thing with mailing labels\nit doesn't matter if it's up or\n\n589\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:34.960\ndown necessarily.\n\n590\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, just as long as it's centered.\n\n591\n00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you're okay with that and\nI find that when you said it's\n\n592\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.800\nwritten on the printer-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n593\n00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.500\n&gt;&gt; Or what have you.\n\n594\n00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.780\nOn this particular I don't know if you can\nsee this but this is our shipping labels\n\n595\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.340\nand there’s a sentence right here,\nit’s actually written on our envelope.\n\n596\n00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.755\n&gt;&gt; Written in Sanskrit, apparently.\n\n597\n00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:57.070\n[LAUGH] It’s so hard to read.\n\n598\n00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.450\n&gt;&gt; It’s like, this is somebody’s really\nbad hand writing, this is worse then mine.\n\n599\n00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.123\nIt’s like two facing up top to the back,\nso.\n\n600\n00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:04.925\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n601\n00:27:04.925 --> 00:27:07.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Decipher the code and\n\n602\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.150\nprint correctly, it's amazing.\n\n603\n00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.750\n&gt;&gt; That's that whole where am I gonna,\n\n604\n00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.810\nbecause you can see that they\nalready printed the top labels or\n\n605\n00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.870\nmaybe they had some,\nno they did this on their own printer.\n\n606\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.280\nSo, they did this and they had it ready so\nthat way you can go ahead and\n\n607\n00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.490\ngo into this, mail merge it, and\nthen stick the paper in the right way, so.\n\n608\n00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.875\nThat is, that would be a whole\ncarnival ride in itself.\n\n609\n00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:29.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n610\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.230\n&gt;&gt; To try and get your labels,\nand print right.\n\n611\n00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.468\nBut this part of actually doing\nthe mail merge in Word, I think-\n\n612\n00:27:34.468 --> 00:27:35.685\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n613\n00:27:35.685 --> 00:27:36.980\n&gt;&gt; Relatively simple, you know.\n\n614\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.793\nAnd the nice thing is you saw,\nit was pretty simple.\n\n615\n00:27:39.793 --> 00:27:41.960\nIf you do anything to really mess it up,\njust start over.\n\n616\n00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.190\nAnd go from there.\n\n617\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.460\nMake sure your data is right,\nyou don't have those extra spaces, and\n\n618\n00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.310\njust make sure to update your labels.\n\n619\n00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.280\nThat's the biggest thing and\nthen fight with the printer.\n\n620\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.106\n&gt;&gt;

I'm\n\n34\n00:01:14.897 --> 00:01:16.230\nconfused.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Because I just told these good folks\n\n36\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.220\nthat the title of this show is Mail Merge.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.973\n&gt;&gt; And yet, from what you just said,\n\n38\n00:01:23.973 --> 00:01:26.824\nwe're not doing any mail merging.\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n39\n00:01:26.824 --> 00:01:27.350\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n40\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.250\nwe're at the edge of our seat, Vonne.\n\n41\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.027\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:32.290\n&gt;&gt; But I mean the things that\n\n43\n00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.860\nwe're going to be doing,\nwe're going to be creating labels.\n\n44\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.050\nAnd that could be very much\nincluded into the mailing process.\n\n45\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.890\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of a tertiary thing,\n\n46\n00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.568\nthat you didn't wanna leave to the side.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n47\n00:01:44.568 --> 00:01:45.208\n&gt;&gt; You wanted to bring them in together.\n\n48\n00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:46.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I mean,\n\n49\n00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:50.314\nI don't know if you've ever gotten maybe\nin the, I get them in the mail like from\n\n50\n00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:54.134\nthe different charities where they print\nout your return address labels with\n\n51\n00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:56.350\nthe cute little stickers on them.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n52\n00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.756\nI always put those back in your mailbox,\nI'm gonna take the good stuff.\n\n53\n00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.371\n[LAUGH] I mean,\n\n54\n00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:04.797\ndid I just confess to a federal crime?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n55\n00:02:04.797 --> 00:02:07.731\nno, it didn't happen.\n&gt;&gt; No, that was totally facetious.\n\n56\n00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:10.287\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But those things where you get\n\n57\n00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:15.151\nlike printed out return addresses, with\nyour cute little sticker or a little logo,\n\n58\n00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.626\nor it has like whatever season it is.\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, okay.\n\n62\n00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:22.920\n&gt;&gt; Well we're not gonna add the image,\n\n63\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.940\nthat's a separate episode,\n\n64\n00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.180\nbecause there's some tricks to\nthat one that I'll show you.\n\n65\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.720\nBut we want to print out\nmaybe a single label.\n\n66\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.020\nI actually forgot my props with the piece\nof paper, the Avery label that had like,\n\n67\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.770\nhalf of the stickers were done.\n\n68\n00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.161\nIf you guys didn't see that\nin the previous episode,\n\n69\n00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:42.895\ndefinitely check that out so you can, so I\ncan refer to my props to another episode.\n\n70\n00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:43.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n71\n00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n72\n00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:49.180\nit's just the piece of paper that has the\nlabels, or the either return address or\n\n73\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.400\nwhat have you.\n\n74\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.680\nAnd you just need to print\nmaybe one single label, right?\n\n75\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.900\nCuz you just keep using it,\nyou put the paper in the printer,\n\n76\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.340\nyou tell what position you want\non that particular label paper.\n\n77\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.510\nAnd then you say, yeah, print on column\ntwo, four down, type in my address,\n\n78\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.630\nprint one out, stick it on an envelope and\nbe done with it, okay.\n\n79\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.198\nSo that might be one reason why we need\nto have this episode is to print out\n\n80\n00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:15.039\na single label.\n\n81\n00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:20.381\nOr I wanna do that whole one sheet of\nthe same address for my returns or\n\n82\n00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:24.950\nwhatever and then go ahead\na print that whole thing out.\n\n83\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.750\nThat's what I wanted to concentrate\non in this particular episode, and\n\n84\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.460\nshow you again those little kind of,\nthey don't really tell you\n\n85\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.920\nthis in the instructions and\nthis is just from personal experience.\n\n86\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.925\nLike, this is going to be the easiest\nway to do some of these things, so\n\n87\n00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:40.948\nwhy don't we get started?\n&gt;&gt; Shall we begin?\n\n88\n00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:41.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Shall we?\n\n89\n00:03:41.797 --> 00:03:42.601\nWe shall.\n\n90\n00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:43.363\nLet's go.\n\n91\n00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:48.235\nLet's go ahead to our Word document, it's\njust a blank document that I've started,\n\n92\n00:03:48.235 --> 00:03:49.582\nso just do a File, New.\n\n93\n00:03:49.582 --> 00:03:53.094\nAnd again we don't have\na starting position or\n\n94\n00:03:53.094 --> 00:03:57.955\nanything like that And so\nin the last episode, we did go ahead and\n\n95\n00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:01.300\ndo the start mail merge,\nand do our labels.\n\n96\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.470\nAnd then go on through there,\nand select our recipients.\n\n97\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.960\nAnd I did it without the wizard\nin that particular episode just\n\n98\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.388\nto mix things up a little bit.\n\n99\n00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:12.560\nAnd we didn't mention like here,\nthe labels and\n\n100\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.670\nthe labels in both of\nthese different places.\n\n101\n00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.830\nSo we're going to check\nout this guy right here.\n\n102\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.740\nI'm going to click on this button for\nLabels.\n\n103\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.350\nAnd then it brings me into\nthis option of my labels.\n\n104\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.950\nNotice that it is the same dialog box\nthat you have for your envelopes,\n\n105\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.480\nthey're just different tabs up at the top.\n\n106\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.920\nSo Envelopes and Labels,\nso I can click here.\n\n107\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.240\nLet's go with that whole idea of like,\nI need to print on that Avery label,\n\n108\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.810\nthat column two, row four.\n\n109\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.930\nThat's the one I need to\nprint that thing out on.\n\n110\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.000\nRight down here in this kind of,\nwhat is this,\n\n111\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.270\nthe center area [LAUGH] we've got full\npage of the same label or a single label.\n\n112\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.690\nOkay, cool,\nit's the title of our episode right now.\n\n113\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.560\nSingle label.\n\n114\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.820\nNow I gotta pick the row and the column.\n\n115\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.150\nNow it's going to be based off of whatever\n\n116\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.310\npaper that is designated\nat this particular point.\n\n117\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.900\nRight now, because it was kind of hinging\noff the things that I had done before\n\n118\n00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.430\nin this particular program,\nit's saying that I was using the 51-60,\n\n119\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.630\nwhich is exactly what we did.\n\n120\n00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.220\nBut maybe I'm printing out those\nfile folders, or name badges,\n\n121\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.180\nor whatever number of those Avery\nlabels that I need to have.\n\n122\n00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.750\nIf you need to change the paper type, the\nlabel type, you go down here to Options.\n\n123\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.302\nWhen we click on Options this is,\nthis should look familiar to our-\n\n124\n00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:34.969\n&gt;&gt; It's a big list.\n\n125\n00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, huge list.\n\n126\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.711\nAnd like, what vendor of label am\nI my using, what's the number,\n\n127\n00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:43.645\nI mean that's just,\nI mean I'm going pretty fast.\n\n128\n00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.190\nBut you can see all of\nthose numbers in there.\n\n129\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.220\n&gt;&gt; You would think that they would have\n\n130\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.030\nmade that box a little bit bigger.\n\n131\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.810\nJust for\na little more action happening there.\n\n132\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.895\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n133\n00:05:51.895 --> 00:05:53.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n134\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.059\nMaybe that's in the next episode?\n\n135\n00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:57.076\nEdition.\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:10.830\n&gt;&gt; I will try to tweak it,\n\n345\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.340\nbut I'll control myself and go from there.\n\n346\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.080\nIf you did want to change the indents and\n\n347\n00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.490\nI just saw my notes of yeah,\nshow them this one.\n\n348\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.800\nYou've seen in the other episode,\n\n349\n00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.670\nI like to have things left justified or\nleft aligned within my table options, but\n\n350\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.378\nit's always still a little too\nfar over to the left hand side.\n\n351\n00:16:33.378 --> 00:16:36.620\nYou saw on the other episode\nwhen we did the mail merge,\n\n352\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.210\nI did it in that first one and\nthen it populated.\n\n353\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:44.220\nYou can't do indents when you\nhave the whole table selected.\n\n354\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.540\nIt just doesn't work very well.\n\n355\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.290\nAnd I've tried it with the cell margins.\n\n356\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.120\nThat's one thing I will\npoint out right here.\n\n357\n00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.020\nCell margins, cool,\nI'll go ahead and do that.\n\n358\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.450\nCareful about this one.\n\n359\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.010\nWhen you change the cell\nmargins within a mail merge,\n\n360\n00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.020\nyou're changing the actual\nstructure of the table.\n\n361\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.420\nAnd if you change the structure of\nthe table, when you print it out again.\n\n362\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.265\nPretend this is my Avery\ntemplate right now.\n\n363\n00:17:06.265 --> 00:17:07.496\nLAUGH] Or my paper.\n\n364\n00:17:07.496 --> 00:17:12.200\nIt's gonna move where it's\nprinting based on the paper.\n\n365\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.190\nSo if it's like I need\nthe column to start here,\n\n366\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.060\nwhen you do the cell margins,\nit's gonna move over a little bit.\n\n367\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.970\nSo it's just,\nit's basically going to throw everything\n\n368\n00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:19.790\noff.\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n369\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay so be careful about doing margins.\n\n370\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.520\nI would avoid; I never do this.\n&gt;&gt; Margins completely when it comes to\n\n371\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.440\nlabels.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah and any mail merge or\n\n372\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.725\nsingle don't change the cell margins.\n&gt;&gt; Put too much salt in the soup.\n\n373\n00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:33.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] I like alot of\n\n374\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:33.830\nsalt.\n&gt;&gt;

I do I do.\n\n64\n00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:30.395\n[LAUGH] Three if you count my wife.\n\n65\n00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:34.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's true, yeah,\nexactly and she's very crafty.\n\n66\n00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.790\nSo, we've got that and\nthere we go, wonderful.\n\n67\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.400\nIf I jump over here, this is,\nall I did was an alt tab, by the way.\n\n68\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.240\nAnd this is just our 5160\nwith our address block there.\n\n69\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.980\nSo, I wanted to get those two beginning\nbecause the way that you insert images on\n\n70\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.290\nthis particular layout verses this one.\n\n71\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.130\nThere are some different tricks.\n\n72\n00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.000\nLet's preview this so we can see it.\n\n73\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.650\nI want to put a picture like\nup on the top of this label.\n\n74\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.975\nYou could put your cursor right here\nin front of the first field and\n\n75\n00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.530\ninsert the image, but\nIn this particular instance,\n\n76\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.500\nif I want it to be by itself\nlike on the top of it,\n\n77\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.850\nthere's an easier way to do it if you\njust put it in its own paragraph.\n\n78\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.400\nThat's kind of a key thing when you're\nadding images in this type of stuff,\n\n79\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.230\nis whether you put in line with\na paragraph that's already existing, or\n\n80\n00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.740\nyou put it in its own paragraph and\nthen do all of the formatting to that\n\n81\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.260\nparticular image to be able\nto move it all around.\n\n82\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.220\nSometimes it works better than others.\n\n83\n00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.460\nOkay, I cannot say across the board\nlike always put it in its own paragraph.\n\n84\n00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.740\nI could say that in the Mac series because\nits the way that Mac works a little\n\n85\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.250\nbit differently.\n\n86\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.020\nIn Windows it's 50/50.\n\n87\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.560\nYou're going to have to see and\n\n88\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.330\nlike if you're fighting with an image\nlike the placement and the word wrap and\n\n89\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.490\nhow it all goes with it, if you're putting\nin line with existing text and paragraph.\n\n90\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.430\nTry putting in its own paragraph and\nthen moving it around whether\n\n91\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.960\nit's at the end or the beginning just\ntest it, that's the only thing I can say.\n\n92\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.070\nSo but on this particular example I\nwant to put the paragraph up top.\n\n93\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.740\nWell here's the kicker, if I take this,\neven if I don't have it preview.\n\n94\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.650\nSee my cursor's right there\nin the front of that field.\n\n95\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.730\nIf I hit enter it doesn't\nactually create an enter, yeah.\n\n96\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.360\n&gt;&gt; No it did not.\n\n97\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.370\n&gt;&gt; No, it didn't.\n\n98\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.010\nIt created an enter outside of the whole\ntable in the whole document and\n\n99\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.220\npushed the whole table down.\n\n100\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which, we're doing lable printing.\n\n101\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.920\n&gt;&gt; That could mess stuff up.\n\n102\n00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.130\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, big time.\n\n103\n00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.460\n&gt;&gt; Not good, we don't want this.\n\n104\n00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.318\nSo this is kind of weird but\n\n105\n00:05:33.318 --> 00:05:38.478\nI really want a paragraph on top of\nthose fields, undo, can't do that.\n\n106\n00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:41.675\nYeah I do a little trick,\nremember this whole.\n\n107\n00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:45.999\n&gt;&gt; Bribe a city official.\n\n108\n00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.244\n&gt;&gt; How much is this going to cost?\n\n109\n00:05:47.244 --> 00:05:52.648\n&gt;&gt; Come on man.\n\n110\n00:05:52.648 --> 00:05:55.418\n&gt;&gt; So if I hit enter at the end\nI can add an extra paragraph,\n\n111\n00:05:55.418 --> 00:05:59.396\nyou add it towards the bottom, then you\ntake this and you get all the way there,\n\n112\n00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:01.705\nyou cut that out, you, don't click there.\n\n113\n00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:03.790\nThat is.\n[LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.180\n&gt;&gt; I see where this is going.\n\n115\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.012\nSee, I'm a hacker.\n\n116\n00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:07.985\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You work around the problem.\n\n117\n00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:08.936\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I was, like,\n\n118\n00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:12.066\nyou've been paying attention,\nyeah, cuz you knew, you're, no,\n\n119\n00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:16.063\ndon't put it there down below cuz you know\nthat's a whole extra paragraph, don't you?\n\n120\n00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:19.572\n&gt;&gt; If I want the paragraph before,\nall of my addresses stuff.\n\n121\n00:06:19.572 --> 00:06:20.352\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I've got to go on the other side of\n\n122\n00:06:20.352 --> 00:06:22.050\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz that's the end of the cell,\n\n123\n00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.180\nbut it's really the end of the extra\nparagraph underneath that.\n\n124\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.284\nSo put your cursor right there and\nthen you paste.\n\n125\n00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:31.513\n[SOUND] There you go, perfect, right?\n\n126\n00:06:31.513 --> 00:06:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Perfection.\n\n127\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.300\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Are you not able to do an insert\n\n128\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.940\nparagraph if you put the cursor\nbefore that, isn't that a thing?\n\n129\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.820\n&gt;&gt; Like.\n\n130\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.990\n&gt;&gt; In case you go in the insert field,\nis there not a paragraph to insert.\n\n131\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.360\n&gt;&gt; I don't, yeah, as soon as you\nsaid that, I'm like I don't know.\n\n132\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.030\n&gt;&gt; I vaguely remember,\nI am not a Word expert.\n\n133\n00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.340\nThat's why Vonne is doing this.\n\n134\n00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.030\n&gt;&gt; There I don't know.\n\n135\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.660\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI like to ask these questions.\n\n136\n00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] I'm like, I don't know but\n\n137\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.250\nthis works.\n\n138\n00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.340\n&gt;&gt; But this works.\n\n139\n00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.842\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Totally do this.\n\n140\n00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:07.570\n&gt;&gt; I don't really care about that.\n\n141\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.020\nI always care about your questions\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n142\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.219\n&gt;&gt; But I would just say I don't know,\nso I'm gonna stick with doing it this.\n\n143\n00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.939\n&gt;&gt; Right well obviously.\n\n144\n00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:13.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This work and\n\n145\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.830\nit's a fine way of doing it.\n\n146\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.600\n&gt;&gt; But now you've like,\nyou've got my brain going up.\n\n147\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.273\n&gt;&gt; I know, I put a splinter in her mind,\nshe's gotta go follow that.\n\n148\n00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:20.562\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Rabbit trail until it ends.\n\n149\n00:07:20.562 --> 00:07:22.388\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly but not right now.\n\n150\n00:07:22.388 --> 00:07:23.350\n&gt;&gt; Afterwards.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.880\n&gt;&gt; So now that I have got my paragraph on\n\n152\n00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.840\ntop, so now I could say all right this\nis where I want the picture to go to.\n\n153\n00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.890\nSo I will go to the now I'm\non the insert tab already.\n\n154\n00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.160\nI'll go with pictures and\nI'm going to find I have these pictures.\n\n155\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.730\nYou know what?\n\n156\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.770\nThey're so cute.\n&gt;&gt; What's a day without sunshine?\n\n157\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.080\n&gt;&gt; I know got to have Mr. Fish up.\n\n158\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.240\nIt's okay that it's too big.\n\n159\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.170\nYou just go ahead and\nchange the size of it.\n\n160\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.200\nAnd because of the alignment\nof the table that I have.\n\n161\n00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.320\nI have it vertically justified here.\n\n162\n00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.620\nIt kinda fit if I turn this off.\n\n163\n00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.925\nNow, I still have that vertical\njustification so I would come down here,\n\n164\n00:07:57.925 --> 00:07:59.915\nhit the backspace, move everything down.\n\n165\n00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:02.057\nAll right, that's lovely cuz, and\n\n166\n00:08:02.057 --> 00:08:05.661\nI don't have to do anything else\nbecause of the table layout.\n\n167\n00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:07.911\nBut if I did wanna move this around,\n\n168\n00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:10.990\nnotice you now have\ndifferent contextual tabs.\n\n169\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.430\nWith the picture selected,\nyou can change like the wrap.\n\n170\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.460\nAnd you can make this square, and\nthen you can kind of move it around.\n\n171\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.223\nForce it over here, but\nnotice how it's like [SOUND], God.\n\n172\n00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:21.904\n&gt;&gt;

Pass out the [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n179\n00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:41.838\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthat's why in this example works fine,\n\n180\n00:08:41.838 --> 00:08:46.100\nnew paragraph,\nkeep out the alignment at the table,\n\n181\n00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.110\neverything is great,\nworking okay, all right?\n\n182\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.690\nNow I need to make sure\nit happens to all of it.\n\n183\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.442\nWhen you have labels with a mail merge,\nit's easier within the full page, because,\n\n184\n00:08:58.442 --> 00:09:02.220\nwell, it's here all we gonna do\nis to wait of the labels, right?\n\n185\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.460\nNeed to update the labels.\n\n186\n00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.090\nEverything works,\ndon't worry about that next record.\n\n187\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.651\nYou preview, and yeah, that looks great.\n\n188\n00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:07.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, fantastic.\n\n189\n00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:11.590\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, I'm liking it, works good.\n\n190\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.020\nIf you wanted to get a little crazy,\nI'm gonna turn on that Show and Hide,\n\n191\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.600\nyou could always come\nto the same paragraph.\n\n192\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.840\nYou could insert.\n\n193\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.690\nI'll just do it quickly and if this kinda\nblows up just, we'll say, okay, moving on.\n\n194\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.420\nCuz this is where we could start\nreally playing around with everything.\n\n195\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.160\nIf I really wanted that heart and\n\n196\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.790\nchange it to yellow and do all\nthe effects, and change the transparency.\n\n197\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.280\nBut remember the whole send to\nthe back and change in a word wrap.\n\n198\n00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.840\nWell, I can send it to the back,\n\n199\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.335\nbut it's still not working and then I just\nremembered, yeah, that doesn't work fine.\n\n200\n00:09:43.335 --> 00:09:45.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But how did I do it?\n\n201\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.930\nThis goes back to\nthe wrapping of the text.\n\n202\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.800\nIt's not the alignment or stacking order,\n\n203\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.540\nit's you take this and\ndo it behind the text.\n\n204\n00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.270\nBut again, I inserted it inside that same\nparagraph the picture was in, and so\n\n205\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.930\nthat's why it's going to allow me do that.\n\n206\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.860\nBut notice if I get my four corners and\nstart moving it,\n\n207\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.101\nit will change the alignment of the text.\n\n208\n00:10:09.101 --> 00:10:10.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.370\n&gt;&gt; So, this is okay for\n\n210\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.880\nme right now, I can live with this and\nwith the alignment, cuz I\n\n211\n00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.670\nreally want that weird looking heart now\n[LAUGH] cuz I can't really change that.\n\n212\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.830\nAgain, because of that vertical\njustification of the cell.\n\n213\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.840\nBut just giving you an idea\nthat you could play around\n\n214\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.370\nwith this-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n215\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.410\n&gt;&gt; And start getting kind of\ncreative with your labels.\n\n216\n00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.667\n&gt;&gt; Have some fun.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n217\n00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:32.890\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n218\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.450\nSo you got that, wonderful,\ndo your updates and it works, cool.\n\n219\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.858\nNow this example,\nthis is the one that will throw you, and\n\n220\n00:10:42.858 --> 00:10:45.390\nthis is a very common layout for people.\n\n221\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.890\nAnd this is part of a mail merge.\n\n222\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.330\nSo remember that this is\nnot a full sheet right now.\n\n223\n00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.910\nBut the things I'm gonna show you,\nthese little tricks right now,\n\n224\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:57.410\nit does apply to the next example when we\ndo the same address for the full page.\n\n225\n00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.840\nYou put your cursor, now this is the one\nthat I have found in my experience\n\n226\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.380\ndoesn't work as well if you add\nanother paragraph like we did before.\n\n227\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.290\nLike add to the end cut and paste with\nthat paragraph put the insert and\n\n228\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.570\nimagine to move it around.\n\n229\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:18.010\nDoesn't work nearly as good as if you just\nput it in line, meaning in the first part\n\n230\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.640\nof your text in that first paragraph,\nand I'm actually gonna do this zoom in.\n\n231\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.650\nI think it'll be a little easier\nthan zooming in my whole screen.\n\n232\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.603\nWhoops, sorry, guys.\n\n233\n00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.089\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect [LAUGH] I'll get us there.\n\n234\n00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:30.101\nSo I click there.\n\n235\n00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:32.810\nI'm gonna keep the preview on\nto help me with my alignment.\n\n236\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.030\nWe're gonna insert the same picture.\n\n237\n00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:40.842\nWe'll go with Little Bishop,\nyeah, this will work.\n\n238\n00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:42.427\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I realized I use\n\n239\n00:11:42.427 --> 00:11:45.030\na different image, but\nit'll get the same concept.\n\n240\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.052\nSo I make this a little smaller.\n\n241\n00:11:47.052 --> 00:11:50.550\nNow in this one, you take the picture and\nthen you change the wrap, and\n\n242\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.910\nyou change this to square.\n\n243\n00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.448\nYou can stop right there.\n\n244\n00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:55.525\nThat's actually pretty good.\n\n245\n00:11:55.525 --> 00:11:56.414\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

There we go, the conflict continues.\n\n261\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The struggle is real.\n\n262\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.939\nSo, okay, that's better, and\nyou can really try to force it.\n\n263\n00:12:30.939 --> 00:12:36.730\nBut I'm just gonna go ahead and\nshow you my trick right now, okay?\n\n264\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.580\nIf this doesn't work,\ncuz if I took this and made it bigger,\n\n265\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.590\nlet me just make the whole picture bigger.\n\n266\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:47.860\nAltogether, like if it occupied this\nwhole space and I kinda moved like that,\n\n267\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.860\nkinda moves everything but\nit still changes the alignment here.\n\n268\n00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:57.450\nOkay, so this is my trick,\nI call it the reverse crop, okay?\n\n269\n00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.680\nCuz normally when you crop an image,\nyou are removing space.\n\n270\n00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.610\n&gt;&gt; Bringing it down, yeah.\n\n271\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, I want to like take out\nthe top and take out the bottom and\n\n272\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.060\nsomething to that effect.\n\n273\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.770\nWhen you do what I call,\nthis is my terminology, a reverse crop,\n\n274\n00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.923\nyou're actually.\n\n275\n00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.790\nYeah, Dan is doing this.\n\n276\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.710\nYou're adding space to the area.\n\n277\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.410\nIn Photoshop,\nit's known as changing the canvas size.\n\n278\n00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.020\nYou want to actually\nextend the canvas size.\n\n279\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.940\nNot the image size,\nnot the resolution, but\n\n280\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.410\njust make the physical canvas\nthat I'm working on bigger.\n\n281\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.620\nThat's what you're gonna do here.\n\n282\n00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.480\nI'm going to zoom in\njust a little bit more so\n\n283\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.560\nyou can see the controls that\nI'm going to be looking at.\n\n284\n00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.340\nPictures is selected.\n\n285\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.151\nWe go to crop, we don't have to\nclick the drop-down, honestly,\n\n286\n00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.100\nyou can just click that right there.\n\n287\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.650\nNow, with the crop, you can get,\n\n288\n00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:46.050\nsee these, there are these black boxes\nright here and then the white dots.\n\n289\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.084\nSo you don't want the two-pointed arrow.\n\n290\n00:13:48.084 --> 00:13:50.050\nYou want like the-\n&gt;&gt; Angle.\n\n291\n00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the little backward,\nsee, L black thing.\n\n292\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.380\n[LAUGH] And then you take this and\nyou see how I'm pulling this out,\n\n293\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.710\nI'm extending the canvas\nsize of the picture.\n\n294\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.170\nSo, and notice if you pull it down,\nit does kind of mess with that alignment.\n\n295\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.620\nSo you wanna try to say.\n\n296\n00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.450\nOops, how about we undo that?\n\n297\n00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:10.950\n&gt;&gt; Ctrl+Z.\n\n298\n00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.910\n&gt;&gt; You wanna try to keep\nit not going too far up and\n\n299\n00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.320\ndown to keep with\nthe vertical justification.\n\n300\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.650\nBut if you move this over,\nokay, that's cool.\n\n301\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.950\nThen you take the picture within the crop,\nso now I get the four-point corner arrows,\n\n302\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.860\nand then I can move this\nkind of wherever I want.\n\n303\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.436\n&gt;&gt; So it kind of gives you a matte,\nbut it's transparent.\n\n304\n00:14:31.436 --> 00:14:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, I could see,\nI could move it down there,\n\n305\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.540\nto where I only want a little\nbit of Bishop hanging out.\n\n306\n00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.590\nBut it's just such a neat to me.\n\n307\n00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.540\nThis has been like the easiest\nway that I can kinda control.\n\n308\n00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.070\n&gt;&gt; Just a fun control.\n\n309\n00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nget the space on the left that I'm so\n\n310\n00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:53.112\nwanting to you know have,\ncuz I'm obsessed about it.\n\n311\n00:14:53.112 --> 00:14:55.700\nGetting enough space over here and\n\n312\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.870\nthen being able to kinda move this\nindependently now within that space.\n\n313\n00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.850\nThe other way of moving\nthe picture with the word wrap,\n\n314\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.540\nit's like, that I was struggling.\n\n315\n00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.750\nSo I just kinda say, nope, we're good.\n\n316\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.290\nAnd I will,\n\n317\n00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.810\nI know it's a little bit higher than\nthe Bishop one, but you know what?\n\n318\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.060\nI'm gonna stop, because this is\nsomething that you will sit there and\n\n319\n00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.380\nlike really work with and everything.\n\n320\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.410\nBut that-\n&gt;&gt; That looks pretty good.\n\n321\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.130\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I wanted, okay.\n\n322\n00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.880\nReverse crop, I haven't found it.\n\n323\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.424\n&gt;&gt;

Your red light's on.\nThey need us.\n\n488\n00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:44.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's just like I\ndon't want to work for you.\n\n489\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.610\nThere we go.\nLet me go ahead and select this.\n\n490\n00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.760\nI will change that.\n\n491\n00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.700\nOkay, that's what I was trying to get to.\n\n492\n00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.825\nYou're going to whether\nyou get to this step.\n\n493\n00:22:53.825 --> 00:22:58.760\nAnd you get to where you have your table,\ncuz I can't update right here.\n\n494\n00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:05.344\nBut I've got everything working\nthe way I want it to, right now.\n\n495\n00:23:05.344 --> 00:23:06.070\nLeave it alone, Vonne.\n\n496\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm good, right?\n\n497\n00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.410\nSo this is what I was trying to get to,\nget to where everything's good.\n\n498\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.080\nSelect all of this.\n\n499\n00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.777\nYou copy this.\n\n500\n00:23:16.777 --> 00:23:21.015\nI'm doing a Ctrl+C.\n\n501\n00:23:21.015 --> 00:23:25.840\nI do a Ctrl+-N for New.\n\n502\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.700\nWe paste.\n\n503\n00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:33.020\nYou want to keep the source formatting.\n\n504\n00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.860\nIt still didn't like that part, but I do\nhave my reverse crop, so let's go ahead.\n\n505\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.209\nAnd I'm having a couple\nbackfires happening on me.\n\n506\n00:23:40.209 --> 00:23:43.860\nI will take that and\nwe will remove this spacing.\n\n507\n00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.354\nThere we go, that's what I want.\n\n508\n00:23:46.354 --> 00:23:49.590\n[SOUND] Cross our fingers.\n\n509\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.367\nYou're gonna have to do a lot of steps,\nlike new documents.\n\n510\n00:23:53.367 --> 00:23:57.700\nI have so many new files going on\nright now, but I select all of this.\n\n511\n00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.116\nCome back into mailings,\ncome back to our labels.\n\n512\n00:24:02.116 --> 00:24:05.584\nKeep it in there, say new document.\n\n513\n00:24:05.584 --> 00:24:09.710\nI just need to change the layout of\nmy table to here, and there you go.\n\n514\n00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.920\nOkay, sorry, it was a little swervy.\n\n515\n00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.475\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n516\n00:24:14.475 --> 00:24:15.425\n&gt;&gt; Little swervy.\n\n517\n00:24:15.425 --> 00:24:16.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit had a couple of twists and turns,\n\n518\n00:24:16.845 --> 00:24:18.935\nbut we ultimately got there safe and\nsound.\n\n519\n00:24:18.935 --> 00:24:21.785\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo, again the steps are right here,\n\n520\n00:24:21.785 --> 00:24:25.025\nwell it's printed out right now,\nof where you create a blank label and\n\n521\n00:24:25.025 --> 00:24:26.495\nthe size and layout desires.\n\n522\n00:24:26.495 --> 00:24:31.595\nThat was, we want to making\nour labels with nothing in it.\n\n523\n00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:35.795\nWe get our table, you insert the image,\nyou wrap the text, you insert your text,\n\n524\n00:24:35.795 --> 00:24:38.880\nyou format that text,\nyou do the crop trick or\n\n525\n00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.060\nthe placement,\nyou then select all of that.\n\n526\n00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.130\nYou copy and\npaste it in to a new black document.\n\n527\n00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.000\nYou then select all of that and\n\n528\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.010\nthen create the label by clicking\nthe new document, and then it opens.\n\n529\n00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.670\nIt works, it worked,\nI kinda fooled with it a little bit.\n\n530\n00:24:55.670 --> 00:25:00.950\nBut you see this is why understanding how\nto format tables on the same table limit,\n\n531\n00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.050\nsuper important.\n\n532\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.090\nUnderstanding images and\nthat text wrap, and the crop, and\n\n533\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.330\nhow to format images, that's key.\n\n534\n00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.850\nSo this is something like I know\na decent amount about this stuff.\n\n535\n00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:15.880\n&gt;&gt; You bring early a good point actually,\ncuz I've worked with help desks and\n\n536\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.130\nI've worked creating up procedures and\nthings like that.\n\n537\n00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.510\nAnd procedures only gets yourself are.\n\n538\n00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.300\nI can give somebody a procedure, and\n\n539\n00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.670\nYvonne has written a procedure for\ndoing this.\n\n540\n00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:29.020\nBut you understand why we're doing each\none of the steps that we're doing.\n\n541\n00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.630\nWhen things crop up,\nlittle gremlins start taking over, you go,\n\n542\n00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.390\nsomething's wrong here because I know\nthat this is supposed to work like that.\n\n543\n00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.120\nSo understanding these\nconcepts is key to really\n\n544\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.260\ngaining a level of mastery over\nthe program and doing the mail merge.\n\n545\n00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.610\nSo make sure you take some time understand\neach one of those concepts, hopefully, and\n\n546\n00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.730\nnot just say I've got the procedures\nthat allows me to do X, Y or Z.\n\n547\n00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that whole it kinda backfired\non me, like I'm gonna do this steps, wait.\n\n548\n00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.470\nBut wait, hold on, I already got\nthat step to where I need the layout\n\n549\n00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.660\nof the table from my labels and\nget that one space.\n\n550\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.240\nJust need to make sure I can put\neverything in the confines of that\n\n551\n00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.280\nlabel space,\nthat's what I was trying to get to.\n\n552\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.900\nIt was fine with me, so\nI said I was just gonna go over here.\n\n553\n00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.570\nThat's what I need.\n\n554\n00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.312\nOkay, great.\n\n555\n00:26:12.312 --> 00:26:16.414\nThe other thing that happen when copy and\npasted it into the new document,\n\n556\n00:26:16.414 --> 00:26:19.119\ndid you see how it didn't keep the-\n&gt;&gt; Right, the format.\n\n557\n00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.670\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Spacing.\n\n558\n00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.770\nSo I had to know enough\nabout paragraph spacing, and\n\n559\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.860\nline spacing to say, whoops let me just\ntake out that extra line and paragraph,\n\n560\n00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.180\ncuz you saw me with the smart tag.\n\n561\n00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.290\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was taking that\nfrom the new document, right?\n\n562\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nI was looking at that smart tag,\n\n563\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.340\nI'm like no keep the source formatting,\ncuz that's the button I was looking for\n\n564\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.275\nin case any of y'all are like\nwhat was she clicking on.\n\n565\n00:26:39.275 --> 00:26:42.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm like all I'm getting is so\n\n566\n00:26:42.024 --> 00:26:45.750\nI'm also in the middle trying to\ntell you what I'm doing to my folks.\n\n567\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.390\nNo back up, back up, back up, okay let's\ngo ahead, just take it out of you know.\n\n568\n00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.660\nSo yes I know Word pretty well.\n\n569\n00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.347\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm glad that you pointed that out\n\n570\n00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:59.853\njust it, this has taken me years of\nexperience to try to get to where I can,\n\n571\n00:26:59.853 --> 00:27:01.516\n[SOUND] sometimes\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n572\n00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:02.338\n&gt;&gt; You know, very.\n\n573\n00:27:02.338 --> 00:27:03.620\n&gt;&gt; It throws a curveball\nfrom time to time.\n\n574\n00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.589\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.\n\n575\n00:27:05.589 --> 00:27:07.545\nThat's why I was like, stay with me.\n\n576\n00:27:07.545 --> 00:27:12.009\nWe will get to that place and it will\nwork, but you will have to fight with it\n\n577\n00:27:12.009 --> 00:27:15.844\nas much as I fight with it,\njust like I fought with it right now.\n\n578\n00:27:15.844 --> 00:27:17.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, I got there.\n\n579\n00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:20.731\nI have 15 open documents right now,\nbut as long as you get them,\n\n580\n00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:22.209\nthen you do a File Save As,\n\n581\n00:27:22.209 --> 00:27:26.950\nyou kinda get your starting point, and\nthen you can move right on from there.\n\n582\n00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.690\nPut another picture and\ndo all that formatting.\n\n583\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.214\nSo, yes, it's not as easy as it looks.\n\n584\n00:27:32.214 --> 00:27:33.279\nLike just put in another picture.\n\n585\n00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:33.951\n&gt;&gt;

Correct.\n\n172\n00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:11.063\n&gt;&gt; So it's-\n\n173\n00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:12.643\n&gt;&gt; There's an icon that says mail and\n\n174\n00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:16.990\nyou go in there and it opens up some\ndifferent properties for the Outlook.\n\n175\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.130\nKind of like the back end\nof the Outlook app, right?\n\n176\n00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.043\nWhen you click on that there will\nbe one option that says profiles.\n\n177\n00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:28.484\nAnd in there if you have multiple people\nthat share a computer and even a login,\n\n178\n00:07:28.484 --> 00:07:33.430\nI’ve dealt with this before in corporate\nwhere you have a secretary and\n\n179\n00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.912\nthe secretary switches out for\nwhatever reason.\n\n180\n00:07:36.912 --> 00:07:39.222\nInstead of having Amy, Bob, and Jerry,\n\n181\n00:07:39.222 --> 00:07:44.048\nI'll have their own login with their own\nemail, they all share Secretary1, right.\n\n182\n00:07:44.048 --> 00:07:46.941\nBut they also have Secretary2,\nSecretary3, so\n\n183\n00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:51.598\nif you want you wanna switch profile even\nthough you log in, they wanna get Bob or.\n\n184\n00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:54.707\nOr let me put it this way,\nyou log in the secretary but\n\n185\n00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:59.394\nBob wants to get his email, so he logs in,\nhe changes the profile of Bob right?\n\n186\n00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:04.464\nAmy comes into work, Bob goes The\ncomputer's still logged in as secretary,\n\n187\n00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:08.040\nshe logs into Outlook as Amy\nby changing the profile.\n\n188\n00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.860\nAnd it always prompts her, you have\nthe ability to say, default profile.\n\n189\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.080\nAnd this is what we're\ngetting to right here.\n\n190\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.440\nIf you click on View Profiles,\nit'll take you into the next box, and\n\n191\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.160\nhere's where you can create different\nprofiles and attach each mailbox.\n\n192\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160\nThus, right?\n\n193\n00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.840\nYou'll also see it says,\nplease use this profile.\n\n194\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.240\nYou select the one as your default\nprofile so it'll automatically log in\n\n195\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.430\nas said profile if you change,\nif you make this the option, but\n\n196\n00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.450\nif you make that the option,\nyou'll always use that person.\n\n197\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.120\nSo if you're looking for\n\n198\n00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.550\ncontacts, it's going to use\nthe default profile's contacts.\n\n199\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.730\nYou don't want that to be something\nthat happens automatically.\n\n200\n00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.800\nYou need to uncheck that default business,\ngo there.\n\n201\n00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.770\nRight.\nPrompt me for\n\n202\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.950\nwhich profile you want me to use,\nso that I can select.\n\n203\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.300\nI'm Amy, so I want to use Amy's contacts.\n\n204\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.390\nI'm Bob, so I want to use Bob's contacts.\n\n205\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.390\nAnd it'll always prompt me for that.\n\n206\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.570\nAnd not just assume that\nI'm logged in as Bob or\n\n207\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.250\nwhoever the default is.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I think this is were I\n\n208\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.900\nknow I had updates happen.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.840\n&gt;&gt; I know some things,\n\n210\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.645\nI think I even did Windows updates\n&gt;&gt;

Think I'm talking correctly.\n\n248\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.140\nThat is remembering it off\nthe on dot on Microsoft.\n\n249\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.340\nIt keeps saying like, I'm not connected\nto you in your office profile, so\n\n250\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.940\nsomething's kind of-\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n\n292\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.948\n&gt;&gt; And then it will stick itself down.\n\n293\n00:12:18.948 --> 00:12:21.986\nSo [SOUND] maybe we should\njust print out our labels and\n\n294\n00:12:21.986 --> 00:12:25.075\nstick them on the envelopes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just use labels.\n\n295\n00:12:25.075 --> 00:12:25.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Better than\n\n296\n00:12:25.592 --> 00:12:27.280\ntrying to print directly on an envelope.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I\n\n297\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.840\ndo.\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\n\n464\n00:19:57.254 --> 00:19:58.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to.\n\n465\n00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.240\n[LAUGH] That's the way\nyou should do it here.\n\n466\n00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.790\nLet's just use big blocky fonts.\n\n467\n00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.850\nYou can change this size, but\nI wouldn't get too crazy.\n\n468\n00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.610\nNow you've seen like wedding envelopes and\neverything.\n\n469\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.740\nAnd they, scripty fonts and everything.\n\n470\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.390\nSo you can get a little\nbit of personality.\n\n471\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.410\nYou can pick a fun font.\n&gt;&gt; Make sure it's legible.\n\n472\n00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:19.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n473\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.720\npick the right colors, that type of thing.\n\n474\n00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.840\nIf you have really dark envelopes,\nokay then yeah, maybe go ahead and\n\n475\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:30.520\nuse white text, but\njust be aware that the Post Office does\n\n476\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:36.720\nhave specific rules and you should\nabide by them and don't go too crazy.\n\n477\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.370\nAll right, lovely, that is wonderful.\n\n478\n00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:42.220\nSo you can see that envelopes\naren't really too terribly hard.\n\n479\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.370\nJust don't go to this button.\n\n480\n00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.340\nMake your life easier.\n\n481\n00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:51.080\nStart with a merge, whether it is\na single envelope or you do a mail merge.\n\n482\n00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.250\nAnd then that's, I would say that's it.\n\n483\n00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.680\nBut I want to just tack on this\none last thing about envelopes.\n\n484\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.750\nAnd I'm gonna do a new document.\n\n485\n00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.300\nEdit control.\n\n486\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.400\nAnd then we go back over here to\nmailings and we go to envelopes.\n\n487\n00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.990\nThere is this add to document button.\n\n488\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:14.560\nNow this kind of a weird one, and I'm just\ngonna type in something really quick.\n\n489\n00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.650\nThis is one where I have a, if there,\n\n490\n00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.850\nbut your probably shouldn't do it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n491\n00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, because, there we go,\n\n492\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.440\nlet’s just put that, and then something.\n&gt;&gt; Just because you can doesn’t\n\n493\n00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.050\nmean you should kind of thing.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and this is also one of those like\n\n494\n00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.570\nI remember this being on like some\nof the certification exams, like add\n\n495\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.120\nan envelope to your document, so you go\nunder here and you click add to document.\n\n496\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.230\nNow watch what happens.\n\n497\n00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.270\nWhat it does is it creates, and\nI’ll zoom out a little bit so you can see.\n\n498\n00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.350\nIt puts the envelope in line,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n499\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.530\n&gt;&gt; With your paper, right?\n\n500\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.170\nSo you go to here and you type and\neverything like that.\n\n501\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:56.480\nAnd you do your regular.\n&gt;&gt; I see their philosophy here.\n\n502\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.710\nWe're gonna make,\nmaking a letter that I'm going to mail.\n\n503\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.760\nMaybe I wanna print out\nthe envelope as well.\n\n504\n00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.390\nSee the envelope, letter,\nyou do all this stuff,\n\n505\n00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.600\nand that's the idea of it.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n506\n00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.100\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n507\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:06.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n508\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.870\nBut this is your first piece of paper, and\n\n509\n00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.470\nthis is your second piece of paper.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n510\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.127\n&gt;&gt; You know on your printer, you can't.\n\n511\n00:22:12.127 --> 00:22:13.249\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You can't feed one, and\n\n512\n00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:14.740\nthen the other.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n513\n00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.230\nIt's not in line.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n514\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:17.040\n&gt;&gt; So, and\n\n515\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.750\nI've asked my husband about this,\nI asked Ronnie, and\n\n516\n00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.290\nI said, you can't.\n&gt;&gt; You'd probably have to do the side\n\n517\n00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:28.270\ntray, put the envelope in first,\nlet it print and then go out of paper.\n\n518\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.520\nAnd then here's your second sheet of\npaper, and then it prints it out.\n\n519\n00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.870\nThat would be my guess, but\n\n520\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.090\nthat's a lot of work.\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee and\n\n521\n00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.050\nI were talking about this in\nthe max theories of this show.\n\n522\n00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:40.430\nAnd she's like well you know it is just\nprint language and you can probably figure\n\n523\n00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.850\nout some way to say pull from paper tray\none and then pull from paper tray two.\n\n524\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.930\nAnd maybe you have a fancy\nprinter that does all of this.\n\n525\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.678\nI personally I have\nnever experienced this.\n\n526\n00:22:49.678 --> 00:22:52.032\n&gt;&gt; This is some $30 code hacking jet\n\n527\n00:22:52.032 --> 00:22:56.071\n[LAUGH] that I got with a bowl of cereal.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n528\n00:22:56.071 --> 00:22:59.320\nSo our regular desktop, of course,\nI don't care how fancy it is, I'm not\n\n529\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.990\nsure if your're ever gonna be able.\n&gt;&gt; They can trust in those as far\n\n530\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.600\nas they can throw them.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n531\n00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.700\nAnd it's just one of those, like,\nI'm not sure if I would ever want.\n\n532\n00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.550\nI asked my husband Terry, so\nif you got somebody like this,\n\n533\n00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.260\nlike we would never\naccept this type of file,\n\n534\n00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.260\nwe would say to your envelopes is\none file, to your letters is one.\n\n535\n00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.520\nOr you just give us the mailing list and\nwe'll do everything for you,\n\n536\n00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.870\nbecause that's why you're paying\nus to do this particular job.\n\n537\n00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.540\nSo It does have a purpose.\n\n538\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.760\nAnd maybe there is some\nfancy way to do it.\n\n539\n00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.490\nI personally have not been able to\never been able to print this in line\n\n540\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.920\nthe way it's like print\nan envelope then print the letter.\n\n541\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.770\nBecause then it's like, like me I'm like\nyou can do all your mail merge here too\n\n542\n00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:40.450\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n543\n00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.355\n&gt;&gt; Put in your field and\n\n544\n00:23:41.355 --> 00:23:44.770\nlook, my fields and my envelope\nare the exact same in my paper, and\n\n545\n00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.450\nthen we, no, it doesn't work that way.\n\n546\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:52.700\nIt's not that simple in my experience,\nin my opinion.\n\n547\n00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.050\nI say that because I'm sure\nthere's somebody out there like,\n\n548\n00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:55.910\nif you do that-\n&gt;&gt; I can do\n\n549\n00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.100\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n550\n00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.890\nI wouldn't do it this way.\n\n551\n00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:03.350\nI would go ahead and keep it as print\nyour envelope, print your letters,\n\n552\n00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.110\nyou then have an intern,\n\n553\n00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.440\nsomebody that stuffs them all to make\nsure that they match up together.\n\n554\n00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.310\nOr you know what, just go ahead and\ndo some labels and call it a day.\n\n555\n00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.320\nOr send it to a print provider and\nhave them do it for you, okay?\n\n556\n00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.540\nSo there are other ways\nto do this properly, but\n\n557\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.670\nI wanted to at least address that whole\nadd to document, what it will do.\n\n558\n00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.510\nAnd why Mike just keep it centered.\n\n559\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.156\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n560\n00:24:28.156 --> 00:24:30.250\nBut hey, we'll cover it.\n\n561\n00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.270\nAnd that's it.\n&gt;&gt;

It's a good cause, that's right.\n\n178\n00:07:46.084 --> 00:07:50.004\n&gt;&gt; You're printing out my little stickers\nanyways and giving me little notepads, so\n\n179\n00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:51.413\nI have to give you some money.\n\n180\n00:07:51.413 --> 00:07:52.616\nI know I'm such a sucker.\n\n181\n00:07:52.616 --> 00:07:55.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But anyways, you could do that.\n\n182\n00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.922\nNow I also have seen like\nwith wedding invitations,\n\n183\n00:07:59.922 --> 00:08:05.832\nI mean some graphical elements\naround like the delivery address.\n\n184\n00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:09.563\nAgain, back to those rules that we're\ntalked about in the other episode,\n\n185\n00:08:09.563 --> 00:08:13.711\nyou don't wanna got to see this one up too\nmuch, because those OCR readers that with\n\n186\n00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:17.683\nthe optical care recognition that will\nread the delivery addresses on your mail\n\n187\n00:08:17.683 --> 00:08:18.993\npieces,\n&gt;&gt; Freak them out.\n\n188\n00:08:18.993 --> 00:08:24.457\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I've seen it above, like\nmaybe a whispy thing or what have you.\n\n189\n00:08:24.457 --> 00:08:28.996\nSo that's totally okay, just be careful.\n\n190\n00:08:28.996 --> 00:08:32.521\nIf you're doing like a really big\nmass mailing to a lot of people,\n\n191\n00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:36.365\nyou might wanna take like an example\ninto the post office and say, hey,\n\n192\n00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:40.345\nthis is what I'm doing,\nI'm I gonna have any issue with this?\n\n193\n00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:44.251\nAnd just show them like an actual\nprinted envelope that you plan on using,\n\n194\n00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:48.788\njust to make sure, you don't want,\nif you're doing a 10,000 mailing piece,\n\n195\n00:08:48.788 --> 00:08:50.946\nyou don't want that coming back on you.\n\n196\n00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:53.210\nSo just be careful about that.\n\n197\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.287\nAnd if you're doing a 10,000\nmailing piece, I'm not sure.\n\n198\n00:08:56.287 --> 00:08:57.575\n&gt;&gt; You've got some money to spend,\nfor one thing.\n\n199\n00:08:57.575 --> 00:08:59.874\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's some postage.\n\n200\n00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:02.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's some postage.\n\n201\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you all know,\nmy husband works in the shop like this.\n\n202\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.330\nThey put out some mailings where it's like\ntens of thousands of dollars in postage,\n\n203\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.360\ncuz they're sending out\nlike 500,000 pieces.\n\n204\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.020\nI mean, that's the size of mailings that\nlike the company that he worked for does.\n\n205\n00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.145\nSo I mean, a 1,000,\nyou could probably do it.\n\n206\n00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:22.915\nYou could probably do 10,000 if you've\ngot enough interns to go ahead and\n\n207\n00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:25.120\nstuff all the stuff, and\nput them in the boxes and everything.\n\n208\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.525\nSo there you go.\n\n209\n00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:28.950\nAnyways, I digress yet again.\n\n210\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.230\nIf I wanna put pictures in here,\nthere is a textbox here.\n\n211\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.920\nDon't try to put the picture\n\n212\n00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.290\nthe same way that we did in the return\naddress in the delivery address.\n\n213\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.860\nI would advise you, you could but\nyou're gonna fight with it more and\n\n214\n00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.210\nI'm gonna show you easier way.\n\n215\n00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.410\nYeah, you could put your\ncursor there into the image,\n\n216\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.980\nit's the same thing do the Word and\nblah, blah.\n\n217\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.010\nBut you're in the confines of this\ntextbox, and sometimes putting an image in\n\n218\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.930\na text box is almost like putting an image\nin the cell of the table for the label,\n\n219\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:57.840\nit was a little weird.\n\n220\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n221\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.620\nSo just don't do that.\n\n222\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:06.534\nYou have more flexibility if\nyou put the picture up here.\n\n223\n00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:12.297\nRemember that fourth paragraph\nhere in the return address,\n\n224\n00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:16.818\nand that's where that\ntext box is anchored to.\n\n225\n00:10:16.818 --> 00:10:20.510\nYou're gonna put the picture in here,\nput on your square text wrap and\n\n226\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.960\nmove it around the envelope\nwherever you are.\n\n227\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.770\nJust like you would if you were putting in\nan image in a regular document in Word,\n\n228\n00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.240\nto free float it anywhere you want,\nyou put the square text wrap on it.\n\n229\n00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.750\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n230\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.660\n&gt;&gt; So that's the easiest way\nthat you're going to get this.\n\n231\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.170\nSo if I go to, say, Insert.\n\n232\n00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.778\nI'll just even put in like a little shape,\nmaybe I wanna go ahead and\n\n233\n00:10:41.778 --> 00:10:43.440\nput in a star and like, [SOUND].\n\n234\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.930\nNow star already has that text\nwrap by default on of the square.\n\n235\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.630\nSo the image you'd actually have\nto apply the text wrap, see?\n\n236\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.520\nAnd this is actually in front of the text.\n\n237\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.110\nI lied, it's not a star,\nwait, it's not square.\n\n238\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.730\nIt is a star,\nit's not the square text wrap.\n\n239\n00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.294\nOkay, I didn't even have that\nmuch caffeine this morning.\n\n240\n00:11:04.294 --> 00:11:05.072\n&gt;&gt; Apparently you did.\n\n241\n00:11:05.072 --> 00:11:07.994\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I\"m just so excited to be here,\n\n242\n00:11:07.994 --> 00:11:09.333\nI really mean that.\n\n243\n00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:10.912\nThat actually came off very faceitious.\n\n244\n00:11:10.912 --> 00:11:11.539\n&gt;&gt; It did, yeah.\n\n245\n00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:14.871\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I really do like.\n\n246\n00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:17.076\n&gt;&gt; Sure Vonne, whatever you say.\n\n247\n00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:18.762\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think you all know,\n\n248\n00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.374\nI do get pretty excited about this stuff.\n\n249\n00:11:20.374 --> 00:11:20.974\n&gt;&gt; She does, she does.\n\n250\n00:11:20.974 --> 00:11:24.578\n&gt;&gt; So I could put this here, and\nI could put that down there and\n\n251\n00:11:24.578 --> 00:11:25.912\njust be done with it.\n\n252\n00:11:25.912 --> 00:11:28.571\nThere is my picture,\nyou could go ahead and do your own,\n\n253\n00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:30.844\nmaybe do some transparency,\nstuff like that.\n\n254\n00:11:30.844 --> 00:11:34.042\n&gt;&gt; You wanna send a lot of envelopes,\nespecially when it comes from like mass\n\n255\n00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:37.970\nmailing and things like that,\nthey'll put a barcode on the bottom.\n\n256\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.895\nSpecifically like for\nreturn envelopes, maybe payments and\n\n257\n00:11:41.895 --> 00:11:45.828\nthings of that nature so\nyou could do that with this probably.\n\n258\n00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:47.535\n&gt;&gt; I'd probably send that to\na service provider, [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:11:47.535 --> 00:11:48.661\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n260\n00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:49.764\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I know exactly what\nyou're talking about.\n\n261\n00:11:49.764 --> 00:11:50.542\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou know what I'm talking about, yeah.\n\n262\n00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:52.736\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's perfect match,\nwhat they call it.\n\n263\n00:11:52.736 --> 00:11:57.282\nYou have barcodes on the letter, and\nthen barcodes on the envelope and\n\n264\n00:11:57.282 --> 00:11:59.901\npeople are tracking that to see when it,\n\n265\n00:11:59.901 --> 00:12:03.460\ncuz when it comes back they\nwill go ahead and scan that.\n\n266\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.593\nIt's usually on your return envelopes\nin there, and so they can track and\n\n267\n00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:10.206\nthen see how well that\nmailing campaign does.\n\n268\n00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:12.443\nAnd we talked about\nthe little lot numbers.\n\n269\n00:12:12.443 --> 00:12:14.428\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Look at mail pieces and\n\n270\n00:12:14.428 --> 00:12:19.130\nover on this right hand corner,\nyou'll see tiny little numbers.\n\n271\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.820\nAnd there's usually a number then a line,\nthen another number.\n\n272\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.779\nAnd that's like your lot numbers and the\nbox numbers, and it's all this whole thing\n\n273\n00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:29.310\nabout how the Post Office actually\nsends the mail, it's pretty amazing.\n\n274\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.250\n&gt;&gt; That is kinda cool.\n\n275\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.582\n&gt;&gt; And Terry's shop,\nmy husband's shop, does all that.\n\n276\n00:12:33.582 --> 00:12:35.243\nAnd so all the barcodes.\n\n277\n00:12:35.243 --> 00:12:39.828\nAnd then when you get into specific\nbarcodes of how it's reading like\n\n278\n00:12:39.828 --> 00:12:43.400\nthe address and everything,\nthat is very specific.\n\n279\n00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.301\nAnd there are other pieces of software,\nlike third party softwares and everything,\n\n280\n00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:51.030\ncuz there is an option in our mail merge\nthat said something about like a barcode.\n\n281\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.581\n&gt;&gt; Did it really?\n\n282\n00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:54.321\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI'll throw it up there for a second.\n\n283\n00:12:54.321 --> 00:12:56.720\nBut again,\nit takes it to like the next level.\n\n284\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.630\nJust like in another episode that we're\ngonna do with our validating your\n\n285\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.590\naddresses?\n\n286\n00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.810\nWell, you have to have something\nto validate it against.\n\n287\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:10.765\nAnd that's, again, something from\nthe Post Office that let's you say,\n\n288\n00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:14.110\nyup, this is a valid address\nbased on what their records are.\n\n289\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.740\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, and\na lot of times that whatever you're gonna,\n\n161\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.170\nif you're gonna start putting\nin fancy stuff here in Word.\n\n162\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:41.970\nIt most likely asterisk\nwill be able to go through,\n\n163\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.729\nand the person receiving it should be able\nto see it in the way that you intended it.\n\n164\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.090\nCaveat there is if you start adding\nin very specific Microsoft stuff,\n\n165\n00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.550\nlike Smart Art, or a chart.\n\n166\n00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.660\nNow, these aren't graphical elements,\nso hopefully,\n\n167\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.150\nwhatever mail server that you\nare sending this email to,\n\n168\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.240\nthat recipient's email server will\nlike just translate that as a picture.\n\n169\n00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.060\nBut, you don't want to gussy\nit up too much, you know?\n\n170\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.140\nYou want to keep it plain.\n\n171\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.290\nMaybe put in one picture.\n\n172\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.100\nIf you start putting in things\nlike page borders, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.480\nThat's in the design.\n\n174\n00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.060\nAnd I've tried this.\n\n175\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.320\nIf you do page orders,\nthat's not gonna translate,\n\n176\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.780\ncuz it doesn't really understand.\n\n177\n00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.760\nEspecially when you get into\nthe art stuff that you can get.\n\n178\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.490\nWait, it's down here [LAUGH].\n\n179\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.567\nInto the candy apples and stuff.\n\n180\n00:09:32.567 --> 00:09:34.961\n&gt;&gt;

It does.\n\n251\n00:12:27.964 --> 00:12:30.340\n&gt;&gt; But it's per tab.\n\n252\n00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.030\nIt's not for both, okay?\n\n253\n00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.590\nSo, just to quickly show you, let's,\nI'll keep the stored on, okay?\n\n254\n00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.430\nNot to just quickly show you.\n\n255\n00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.200\nLet's go ahead and talk about filter but\nnotice that sort has these three sortings.\n\n256\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.341\nFilter, so the spaghetti thing, right?\n\n257\n00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:48.918\nAnd it's very tiny right there, but\nthere's a tiny little call like Calendar\n\n258\n00:12:48.918 --> 00:12:50.742\nlooking thing right here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n259\n00:12:50.742 --> 00:12:53.340\n&gt;&gt; So I want to take out.\n\n260\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.950\nI only want to see the specific fields.\n\n261\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.420\nYou gotta choose a field.\n\n262\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.300\nThen your comparison.\n\n263\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.590\nAnd notice there's an equal to not\nequal to, is blank, is not blank.\n\n264\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.346\nIf it was like a numerical\nvalue greater than.\n\n265\n00:13:07.346 --> 00:13:09.858\nLike I want only sales that are above\n\n266\n00:13:09.858 --> 00:13:12.380\n5000.\n&gt;&gt; This is really getting into logical\n\n267\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.054\nstructures.\n\n268\n00:13:13.054 --> 00:13:16.115\nLike figuring out the logic of a, b, c or\n\n269\n00:13:16.115 --> 00:13:16.840\nd.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n270\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.420\n&gt;&gt; If it's this then do this.\n\n271\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.250\nIf it's not this then do something else.\n&gt;&gt; They're not operators,\n\n272\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.250\nthey're comparisons.\n\n273\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.910\nLike the double pipes and the.\n&gt;&gt; Logical operators.\n\n274\n00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:27.910\n&gt;&gt; Logical operators.\n\n275\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.360\nOkay good.\nI remember [LAUGH],\n\n276\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.250\nI remember something from my coding.\n\n277\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.527\nYou've got me on the N-\n&gt;&gt; NDN.\n\n278\n00:13:33.527 --> 00:13:34.305\n&gt;&gt; NDN.\n\n279\n00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:34.967\n&gt;&gt; NDN.\n\n280\n00:13:34.967 --> 00:13:35.989\n&gt;&gt; ND-\n\n281\n00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:38.088\n&gt;&gt; D-N-D-I-A-N, NDN.\n\n282\n00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:38.713\n&gt;&gt; I'll just let you say it.\n\n283\n00:13:38.713 --> 00:13:39.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:13:39.223 --> 00:13:39.824\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you\n\n285\n00:13:39.824 --> 00:13:43.800\ncan see our different comparison,\nwe'll just go with department equal to M.\n\n286\n00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.690\nWe're gonna type in Marketing.\n\n287\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.440\nGreat.\n\n288\n00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.700\nI'm gonna stop here and just click okay.\n\n289\n00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.270\nAnd notice there you go perfect.\n\n290\n00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:57.280\nIt went ahead and filters and shows me\nthe five records based on marketing.\n\n291\n00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.145\nNotice it did remember m\na capital MARK capitalizing.\n\n292\n00:14:03.145 --> 00:14:04.878\nIt doesn't matter if I have lowercase.\n\n293\n00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:08.778\nCuz right now if I wanted to say\nwell then show me the marketing, but\n\n294\n00:14:08.778 --> 00:14:10.530\nonly marketing in Florida.\n\n295\n00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.270\nSo there's five now,\nthere's one in North Carolina.\n\n296\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:18.760\nSo if I went back to filter,\nand notice I had to filter by\n\n297\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.310\ndepartment, and then filter by state.\n\n298\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.030\nThat is equal to, and\n\n299\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.570\nI'm gonna type in lowercase fl, just\nto show that it is not case sensitive.\n\n300\n00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.050\nAnd then it takes that\nNorth Carolina reference out, but\n\n301\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.820\nthat's where you can go ahead and\ntake that filter.\n\n302\n00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.610\nIt is still applying that sort,\ncuz it's gonna do that and\n\n303\n00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.680\nthen it's gonna sort back to here.\n\n304\n00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.910\nOkay well if I clear this,\nlet's go ahead and clear the filter.\n\n305\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.190\nThe sort stays on.\n\n306\n00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.750\nAnd that's something that I\nthought it would do both.\n\n307\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.060\nNo, it's either one.\n\n308\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.900\nIf I clear the filter, that takes off,\nthe sorting's still on.\n\n309\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.680\nBut if I wanted to clear the sort,\nthen I clear it, and say okay, and\n\n310\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.460\nthen it goes back.\n\n311\n00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.570\nAnd actually it goes back\nto the Cheetos sticks and\n\n312\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.460\neverything is back to where it was.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n313\n00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.390\n&gt;&gt; So two separate clears on that tab\n\n314\n00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.290\nin there,\nsome different things that you can do.\n\n315\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.619\nLet's just go back to that\nfilter by department,\n\n316\n00:15:15.619 --> 00:15:17.691\nwhat if I said filter by fuego?\n\n317\n00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:20.630\nThere is is fuego in there, right?\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n\n318\n00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.210\n&gt;&gt; But it doesn't, that's last one thing,\n\n319\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.880\nlike it's not giving me any warning.\n\n320\n00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.150\nIt's just showing me that,\nhey it doesn't work.\n\n321\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.560\nDo you know why it didn't work?\n&gt;&gt; I am at a loss.\n\n322\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.500\n&gt;&gt; There's a fuego.\n\n323\n00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.070\n&gt;&gt; There's a fuego, right.\n\n324\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.510\nIf I'm filtering by fuego,\n\n325\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.240\nshould look through the records\nfind a fuego filter that out.\n\n326\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.110\nIs it filtering it out,\n\n327\n00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.800\nis that what its doing?\n&gt;&gt; Well fuego is\n\n328\n00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.760\nhis what?\n&gt;&gt; Is first\n\n329\n00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.600\nname?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n330\n00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.178\nwhat are we filtering by?\n&gt;&gt; We're filtering\n\n331\n00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:52.167\nby a different parameter.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n332\n00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:56.326\nso that's a thing that\nkind of will catch it.\n\n333\n00:15:56.326 --> 00:16:00.612\nIt doesn't give you like, nope, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n334\n00:16:00.612 --> 00:16:02.495\n&gt;&gt; It does, but in a silent way.\n\n335\n00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:04.145\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's\n\n336\n00:16:04.145 --> 00:16:04.759\nthe silent no.\n&gt;&gt;

And\n\n384\n00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:20.033\nit's case insensitive.\n\n385\n00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:20.921\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n386\n00:18:20.921 --> 00:18:21.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n387\n00:18:21.586 --> 00:18:26.097\nthat's where it will find in any\nfield where the word Bishop is.\n\n388\n00:18:26.097 --> 00:18:30.968\nNow if I said find bishop\nin the department,\n\n389\n00:18:30.968 --> 00:18:33.745\nthen it will give me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.513\n&gt;&gt; I don't see that because it's\n\n391\n00:18:35.513 --> 00:18:39.331\na find feature, it's not just a filter,\nso that's kind of nice.\n\n392\n00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:43.788\nThe other thing about if I'm looking\nin department, if I type in MA, right?\n\n393\n00:18:43.788 --> 00:18:47.451\nJust do MA, okay, Find Next, Find Next.\n\n394\n00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:48.558\nOkay, it's gonna keep on going.\n\n395\n00:18:48.558 --> 00:18:51.670\nThere's the one that I wanted to show you.\n\n396\n00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.651\nHuman MA.\n\n397\n00:18:53.651 --> 00:18:54.880\nMA, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's part of it.\n\n398\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.790\nWe've tried it with like the operators and\neverything.\n\n399\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.027\nI haven't had much luck with\nit like anything before it and\n\n400\n00:19:02.027 --> 00:19:03.360\nafter with wildcards.\n\n401\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.778\nSo it has some limitations.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n402\n00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:07.496\n&gt;&gt; In this particular spot.\n\n403\n00:19:07.496 --> 00:19:09.716\n&gt;&gt; I will give you guys some words of\n\n404\n00:19:09.716 --> 00:19:10.460\ncomfort.\n\n405\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.210\nThis is what's properly known\nas regular expression, and\n\n406\n00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.968\nit is nothing but a pile of not fun.\n\n407\n00:19:17.968 --> 00:19:18.468\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:19:18.468 --> 00:19:19.584\n&gt;&gt; It's extremely powerful.\n\n409\n00:19:19.584 --> 00:19:21.792\nIf you ever get really good at doing\n\n410\n00:19:21.792 --> 00:19:26.296\nregular expression, you will be a god\namongst men or women as it were.\n\n411\n00:19:26.296 --> 00:19:28.248\nBut cuz it's extremely hard to get all\n\n412\n00:19:28.248 --> 00:19:32.592\nthe rules down of how these things work.\nBut that's why Vonne's bringing it up,\n\n413\n00:19:32.592 --> 00:19:36.470\nis to say we have MA, it's looking for\nMA wherever where it may find it,\n\n414\n00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.590\nwhich is why human resources\nreturns this valid return.\n\n415\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.223\nIf you wanna weed that you,\n\n416\n00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:44.497\nyou have to get more specific.\nAnd the specificity is going to lead\n\n417\n00:19:44.497 --> 00:19:45.848\nto better results.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n418\n00:19:45.848 --> 00:19:47.121\nthat's where you can do the wild cards.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n419\n00:19:47.121 --> 00:19:49.263\n&gt;&gt; Like the wild card in front of it is\n\n420\n00:19:49.263 --> 00:19:52.869\nlike any character before but\nnot after, and all that.\n\n421\n00:19:52.869 --> 00:19:54.658\n&gt;&gt; Then there's must have one\n\n422\n00:19:54.658 --> 00:19:58.997\nprevious character before it.\nOne or more, or must have zero or\n\n423\n00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.380\nmore, or must have none.\n\n424\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.290\nIt gets extremely techincal, but\n\n425\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.800\nyou can start pretty easy,\nbut to get better results,\n\n426\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.172\nyou're gonna wanna earn those operators.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is where if you\n\n427\n00:20:10.172 --> 00:20:14.098\nreally need to have a better searching and\nfinding and other ways of,\n\n428\n00:20:14.098 --> 00:20:16.463\nyou might wanna do it in the data source.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n429\n00:20:16.463 --> 00:20:17.756\n&gt;&gt; Now sometimes you can't do that.\n\n430\n00:20:17.756 --> 00:20:18.595\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n431\n00:20:18.595 --> 00:20:20.000\n&gt;&gt; And so you have some capabilities\n\n432\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.101\nhere which is nice.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n433\n00:20:21.101 --> 00:20:23.457\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, I don't think you're going to\n\n434\n00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:27.309\nbe able to get that level of\nthe finding that you're talking about.\n\n435\n00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:28.054\n&gt;&gt; Right, that control.\n\n436\n00:20:28.054 --> 00:20:29.600\n&gt;&gt; What is it, the?\n\n437\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.272\n&gt;&gt; Regular expression.\n\n438\n00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:30.788\n&gt;&gt; Regular\n\n439\n00:20:30.788 --> 00:20:31.721\nexpression.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n440\n00:20:31.721 --> 00:20:32.638\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n441\n00:20:32.638 --> 00:20:34.346\nAt least you know that MA,\n\n442\n00:20:34.346 --> 00:20:35.799\nthat MA's in there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n443\n00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:38.246\n&gt;&gt; So we've got it in different places.\n\n444\n00:20:38.246 --> 00:20:41.033\nAnd especially if you do all field,\nthen you're probably gonna find\n\n445\n00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:41.668\na lot of them.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n446\n00:20:41.668 --> 00:20:43.738\n&gt;&gt; So we will cancel that, but again,\n\n447\n00:20:43.738 --> 00:20:45.580\nwhy would I want to find that?\n\n448\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.492\nBecause I wanted to find,\nlet's just pretend that I found it, and\n\n449\n00:20:48.492 --> 00:20:50.833\nthen said okay, and\nthen unchecked Bishop Timothy,\n\n450\n00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:52.250\ncuz I don't want him in there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n451\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.374\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna remove the duplicates.\n\n452\n00:20:53.374 --> 00:20:54.652\nThis validated address is,\n\n453\n00:20:54.652 --> 00:20:58.095\nthis is going along the same thing we\nwere talking about with the envelopes.\n\n454\n00:20:58.095 --> 00:21:01.180\nIf I click on this, it's like you\nneed to install other software for\n\n455\n00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.730\nyou to be able to do this.\n\n456\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:07.598\nTo say, hey, I'm validating\nthat this is a real address.\n\n457\n00:21:07.598 --> 00:21:12.455\nAnd this is something that Terry says,\nit's like revolving all the time.\n\n458\n00:21:12.455 --> 00:21:16.247\nYou're getting updates like daily for\nwhatever software that they use.\n\n459\n00:21:16.247 --> 00:21:17.554\nI don't know if it's daily, but\n\n460\n00:21:17.554 --> 00:21:19.246\nit's definitely wanna have those like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n461\n00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:20.241\n&gt;&gt; And you have to run it.\n\n462\n00:21:20.241 --> 00:21:21.182\n&gt;&gt; Constant updates,\n\n463\n00:21:21.182 --> 00:21:21.847\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n464\n00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:25.149\nlike think about how many different\naddresses change and everything.\n\n465\n00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:29.580\nSo that's something, yeah, I don't have\nany experience with it personally of\n\n466\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.132\nfinding add-in software that validates it.\n\n467\n00:21:32.132 --> 00:21:32.918\nBut I would say just-\n\n468\n00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:33.503\n&gt;&gt;

Quote Vonne Smith,\n\n552\n00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.609\nit'll have quotes around Vonne Smith.\n\n553\n00:24:58.609 --> 00:25:02.729\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's one of those English language\n\n554\n00:25:02.729 --> 00:25:05.142\nrules where I thought was so\neasy going through school.\n\n555\n00:25:05.142 --> 00:25:07.310\nIt was like, gosh, and\nI say it all the time now.\n\n556\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.830\nI'm like, what's wrong with me?\n\n557\n00:25:10.065 --> 00:25:10.584\nMy brain.\n\n558\n00:25:10.584 --> 00:25:15.352\nOkay, back to here, and\nthe last one in our merge documents from,\n\n559\n00:25:15.352 --> 00:25:19.140\nthis is again,\nwhatever filter rules you have on.\n\n560\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.951\nIf I had the marketing and I'd said,\nfrom records three through four,\n\n561\n00:25:23.951 --> 00:25:29.563\nthat I'm only gonna get three and four of\nthe filter results versus I don't have any\n\n562\n00:25:29.563 --> 00:25:34.881\nfilter on it, and then I get records\nthree through six or what have you, okay?\n\n563\n00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:38.331\nSo all of this comes into\nplay based off your filters,\n\n564\n00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:41.254\nbased on what you want\nto have in your ranges.\n\n565\n00:25:41.254 --> 00:25:45.544\nAnd that's why looking at those previews,\nyou can kind of bump through it and\n\n566\n00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:48.850\nbe like, okay,\nI really only need ranges 4 through 20.\n\n567\n00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.190\nBut then, again,\n\n568\n00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:54.460\ncuz that might be something you\ncan't get out of your filtering.\n\n569\n00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.310\nYou can get enough in the filter and\n\n570\n00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:01.950\nthen it's almost like an extra level\nof filtering of only these particular\n\n571\n00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:07.060\nrecords based on the numbers that you\nsee up here when you do your preview.\n\n572\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.070\nSo that's pretty nice.\n\n573\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.410\nAnd that Find Recipient right here\nis the same thing that we did\n\n574\n00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.240\nfrom that other way.\n\n575\n00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.780\nIt's just a different button or\na different location.\n\n576\n00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:22.040\nAnd it's in the preview\nrather than the list,\n\n577\n00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.280\nso I can go to the actual\npreview in the page and\n\n578\n00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.820\nnot just the list view and\nthe edit recipients.\n\n579\n00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.340\nSo just a different viewpoint,\nI guess you could say,\n\n580\n00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.590\nbut same functionality.\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n581\n00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.526\n&gt;&gt; All right, so filter, sort, and find.\n\n582\n00:26:37.526 --> 00:26:38.639\nMy.\n[LAUGH]\n\n583\n00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:40.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n584\n00:26:40.421 --> 00:26:43.780\nVonne, it's been a lot of fun to\nlook at filter, sort, and find.\n\n585\n00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.370\nLooking at the power behind them,\nthey seem like very simplistic functions.\n\n586\n00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.995\nBut if you work with them correctly and\nyou get everything to kind of\n\n587\n00:26:51.995 --> 00:26:56.528\ngetting the right order, you can really do\nsome damage inside of your mail merge and\n\n588\n00:26:56.528 --> 00:26:58.559\nget it down to exactly what you need.\n\n589\n00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.436\nVonne, is there anything you wanna\nleave us with before we call it a day?\n\n590\n00:27:00.436 --> 00:27:02.512\n&gt;&gt; I think you called it right there is\n\n591\n00:27:02.512 --> 00:27:04.731\nlike, you said it's very simple but\n\n592\n00:27:04.731 --> 00:27:07.466\nI think this is what a lot\nof people need to do.\n\n593\n00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:12.855\nAnd that's why I wanted to keep it as it's\nown episode, to really focus on this.\n\n594\n00:27:12.855 --> 00:27:18.023\nBecause working with massive mail lists,\nyou really probably need only bits and\n\n595\n00:27:18.023 --> 00:27:22.820\npiece of it, and being able to sort it\nclick click click boom you're done.\n\n596\n00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.100\nBut again,\nthat final step of understanding that\n\n597\n00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.850\nit's connected to your finished result, so\n\n598\n00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.240\ndon't let that throw you off.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n599\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.490\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, this is easy, but\n\n600\n00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.390\nI really wanted to emphasize that like,\nbe careful on that finish and\n\n601\n00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.620\nmerge, it's very much connected.\n\n602\n00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.680\nA lot of times I say,\nthese are mutually exclusive, this-\n\n603\n00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.850\n&gt;&gt; This is not.\n\n604\n00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.350\n&gt;&gt; These are connected.\n\n605\n00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Vonne, thanks for\n\n606\n00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.240\njoining us today,\nwe appreciate your time and effort.\n\n607\n00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.210\nAnd we do appreciate you,\nas the audience out there, for watching.\n\n608\n00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.740\nBut it loks like we are at that part\nof the show where we say, sayonara.\n\n609\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.460\nCalling it a day, signing off for\nour OfficeProTV, I've been your host,\n\n610\n00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.880\nDaniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt;

Exactly, how can I hack everything?\n\n28\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.330\nSo yes, we're gonna be talking\nabout rules within mail merge.\n\n29\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.357\nAnd I will tell you that when I first saw\nand learned about rules with mail merge.\n\n30\n00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:14.462\nI'm like, this is really cool.\n\n31\n00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:16.493\nAnd then I learned more about it and said,\n\n32\n00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.790\nhmm I'm not sure if this\nis very cool anymore.\n\n33\n00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.490\n&gt;&gt; At least you learned more and\nwas like this ain't cool.\n\n34\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm kind of like mm.\n\n35\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.310\n&gt;&gt; I'm interested.\n\n36\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.300\nI know nothing about the rules\nwhen it comes to this.\n\n37\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.590\nWhen I think rules I think\noutlook rules right?\n\n38\n00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.470\nSomething to the effect.\n\n39\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.580\nEspecially when office comes into play.\n\n40\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.480\nSo I'm looking forward to seeing where\nyou're going to take us with this.\n\n41\n00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.449\nAnd how it works itself out.\n\n42\n00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:39.470\n&gt;&gt; I too think immeadiately of\nwriting the rules in Outlook.\n\n43\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.380\nSo that's always the example I give.\n\n44\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.020\nActually, in the Mac series,\nthat's exactly what I said.\n\n45\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.690\nSo I'm like, did you watch that episode?\n\n46\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.620\n&gt;&gt;

Just some logic in play.\n\n50\n00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n51\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.905\nAnd that's what's happening here\nin the rules in mail merge.\n\n52\n00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:04.580\nBut there are some that\nare better than others.\n\n53\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.734\nSome that you're just kinda be like,\nhm all right.\n\n54\n00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:08.392\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Why don't we go ahead and\n\n68\n00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:36.568\njust jump down into Joey's computer.\n\n69\n00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:40.393\nAnd so first of all, I do have a Website\nwhere it says setting the rules for\n\n70\n00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.164\na mail merge.\n\n71\n00:02:41.164 --> 00:02:42.803\nOkay that's great.\n\n72\n00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:47.639\nAnd so it's going to be going over\nsome of the ones that you have as\n\n73\n00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.170\npart of your rules.\n\n74\n00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.819\nAnd it actually shows you right here in\nthe drop down that this is where you're\n\n75\n00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.733\ngoing to be finding them.\n\n76\n00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:54.750\nAnd there's a couple of them in there.\n\n77\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.208\nAnd then it goes through and\ngives you examples of what it does.\n\n78\n00:02:58.208 --> 00:02:59.070\nAnd everything like that.\n\n79\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.530\nFunny because some of the ones that I\nread their example and their method.\n\n80\n00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.090\nAnd I'm like, that's not gonna work.\n\n81\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.095\nThat is not how,\nthey don't explain it very well.\n\n82\n00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:12.735\nI'll just say that.\n\n83\n00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:17.368\nSo this is taking some of my\nown personal figuring it out.\n\n84\n00:03:17.368 --> 00:03:20.475\nYou know, trying to consult the oracle\nof the internet is not giving me\n\n85\n00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:21.380\nthe answers right.\n\n86\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.480\nAnd I'm like so,\nif you are trying to do that.\n\n87\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.120\nGood luck.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.623\n&gt;&gt; And that's where hopefully I can help\n\n89\n00:03:29.623 --> 00:03:31.818\nyou make sense of this.\n\n90\n00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:33.877\nAnd then there's this fill-in.\n\n91\n00:03:33.877 --> 00:03:35.202\nThe if then else.\n\n92\n00:03:35.202 --> 00:03:36.380\nThat's actually the best one.\n\n93\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.340\n&gt;&gt; It's very standard.\n\n94\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.800\nThat of conditional logic.\n\n95\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.570\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nyeah.\n\n96\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.270\nA for this.\n\n97\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.920\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; If this, then do this.\n\n98\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.830\nElse, do something else.\n\n99\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.450\n&gt;&gt; Thank you [LAUGH].\n\n100\n00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.040\nThis is a good one.\n\n101\n00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.410\nAnd I had its own episode for\nthis particular one.\n\n102\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.906\nBecause I would like to focus on that.\n\n103\n00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:53.356\nI was like, yes, this is a cool one.\n\n104\n00:03:53.356 --> 00:03:54.276\nGo ahead and use this.\n\n105\n00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:55.560\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n106\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.390\n&gt;&gt; And these next ones,\nthe merge record, merge sequence.\n\n107\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.540\nNext record is what will you\nnormally see on the labels.\n\n108\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.680\nRemember, like the next record.\n\n109\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.560\nSo that's kind of like a default one.\n\n110\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.950\nSo I'm not sure about if we'd have to\nreally actually use that as a rule.\n\n111\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, it does that by default.\n\n112\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's kind of just right there.\n\n113\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.090\nBut the merge record,\nI kind of skipped over it.\n\n114\n00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.548\nThe record and the sequence.\n\n115\n00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:20.968\nWe're gonna focus on that\nin this particular episode.\n\n116\n00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:22.273\nInteresting.\n\n117\n00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:27.790\nAnd then we have this next record if and\nthen there's a skip record if.\n\n118\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.320\nI did skip over the bookmark one because\nit's connected to like the ask and\n\n119\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.280\nfill in rules.\n\n120\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.050\nWhich again are kinda weird.\n\n121\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.930\nBut it's in there.\n\n122\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.290\nSo all of these are in here.\n\n123\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.920\nYou can read and\nyou'll get yourself confused.\n\n124\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.490\nAnd it doesn't really actually\napply to how they really work.\n\n125\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n126\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.020\n&gt;&gt; Just let me know.\n\n127\n00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.460\nSo get that out of the way.\n\n128\n00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.960\nBut at least its a good place to start.\n\n129\n00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.340\nAlrighty.\n\n130\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.520\nSo this example that we're going\nto be doing with the merge.\n\n131\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.340\nWait the record number, the sequence\nnumber and the skip if and the next if.\n\n132\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.280\nI'm gonna just say, stay with me.\n\n133\n00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n134\n00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.610\n&gt;&gt; Hang on, cuz we're on for\na wild ride right now.\n\n135\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.675\n&gt;&gt; I'm putting my helmet on.\n\n136\n00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:11.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it now.\n\n137\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.040\n&gt;&gt; You might need it,\nso i just stay with me.\n\n138\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.420\nI'm gonna try very hard to go through\nmethodically and explain this.\n\n139\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it takes me a while to really wrap\n\n140\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.375\nmy head around this.\n\n141\n00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.426\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Fire when ready.\n\n142\n00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:26.205\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like I'm kinda scared now.\n\n143\n00:05:26.205 --> 00:05:27.282\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'll be fine.\n\n144\n00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:31.686\n&gt;&gt; We have a data source and\nthe one that I have is our filter rules.\n\n145\n00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:33.100\nI'm gonna go ahead and open this up.\n\n146\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.380\nThis is just our Excel file.\n\n147\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.730\nAnd we've got our Cheeto sticks and Fuego.\n\n148\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.280\nBut let's just make a mental note\nabout what we have going on here.\n\n149\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.335\nSo you can see, who is in what order.\n\n150\n00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:49.337\nOkay, so we have Cheeto, Fuego, Mocha,\ndown a little bit we have Zinger and\n\n151\n00:05:49.337 --> 00:05:50.577\nTootsie without the t.\n\n152\n00:05:50.577 --> 00:05:54.080\nCuz every time I see them I'm like,\nI keep forgetting to put that in there.\n\n153\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.650\nThat's okay, she's just gonna be Toosie.\n\n154\n00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.470\nSo this is what we've got.\n\n155\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.739\nNow I'm gonna close this.\n\n156\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.770\nAnd I took a screenshot of this.\n\n157\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.880\nCuz remember the whole\ntroubleshooting episode,\n\n158\n00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.660\nlike we can't open up the data source.\n\n159\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.005\nOr at least it kinda freaks out and\nsays it's locked for editing.\n\n160\n00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We can open up a read only file, but\n\n161\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.850\nI just decided to take\na screenshot of this.\n\n162\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.430\nSo we can kinda keep referring\nback to this is how the data\n\n163\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.880\nis organized in the source.\n\n164\n00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n165\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're like, all right, got it.\n\n166\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.610\n&gt;&gt; I'm moving along.\n\n167\n00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's open up a file\nthat is called our Rules Start.\n\n168\n00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.784\nLet's come on down here.\n\n169\n00:06:34.784 --> 00:06:36.424\nThis is a Word document.\n\n170\n00:06:36.424 --> 00:06:41.480\nOkay and it does have a connection to\nthat Excel file that I just opened.\n\n171\n00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.300\nSo that's why I'm getting the, hey,\ndo you wanna go ahead and do this?\n\n172\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.302\nYes, I want to continue.\n\n173\n00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:50.760\nAnd I've already went ahead and\nwrote some of the text in here.\n\n174\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.060\nYour record number is and\nI've got my show high characters.\n\n175\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.218\nI've already put some\nfields right in here.\n\n176\n00:06:56.218 --> 00:06:56.806\nAll right.\n\n177\n00:06:56.806 --> 00:06:58.630\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Everything that we've done so far.\n\n178\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.090\nWe can preview, all right.\n\n179\n00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.960\nAnd you can see Cheeto,\nbecause that was the first one.\n\n180\n00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.000\nAnd then there was Fuego and\nthen Mocha and it was Tuesday.\n\n181\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.616\nSo we can see that this is pulling\ndirectly from the data source.\n\n182\n00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:14.612\nIn the order that the data\nsource was organized.\n\n183\n00:07:14.612 --> 00:07:16.994\nGood, so [LAUGH].\n\n184\n00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:25.130\nWhen you want to show the record number,\nthat's part of the rules.\n\n185\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.640\nSo right here,\nlet's zoom in a little bit so we can see.\n\n186\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.520\nThat's the other way.\n\n187\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.640\nLet's go ahead and zoom in just\na little bit so we can, come on.\n\n188\n00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.680\n&gt;&gt; There, perfect.\n\n189\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.170\n&gt;&gt; You did it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So your record number is.\n\n190\n00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.680\nThat's not a field.\n\n191\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.620\nSo that's not a field in our data source.\n\n192\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.080\nIt's one in our rules.\n\n193\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.500\nSo if you go ahead and\nsay merge record number.\n\n194\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.440\nAnd I click the preview.\n\n195\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.760\nIt's going to give you record number.\n\n196\n00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.350\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n197\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.030\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, right?\n\n198\n00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.835\n&gt;&gt; Very straightforward.\n\n199\n00:07:52.835 --> 00:07:54.096\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so not so bad right now.\n\n200\n00:07:54.096 --> 00:07:57.940\nAnd I can see number two, number three,\nnumber four, okay, great.\n\n201\n00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.281\nSo the preview.\n\n202\n00:07:59.281 --> 00:08:02.035\nWorks for\nthe rule that we just went ahead and\n\n203\n00:08:02.035 --> 00:08:07.660\nput in which was the I just want you to\ndisplay the merge record number group.\n\n204\n00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.900\nRight, I'll write it.\n\n205\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.900\nKeep it on going, right.\n\n206\n00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.760\nThis is the sequence number so\nI'm going to take my role.\n\n207\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.359\nAnd I'm going to Tool.\n\n208\n00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:18.760\nIt'll tell me the sequence.\n\n209\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.340\nAnd when we have sequence like in steps,\nright?\n\n210\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.680\nSo this is the first and\n\n211\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.900\nthe second and the third in\nthe sequence of what we're doing.\n\n212\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.880\nWhich kind of sounds\nlike record number for-\n\n213\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say how's this\n\n214\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.570\nany different than\nthe actual merge record?\n\n215\n00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:35.420\nKeep that thought.\n\n216\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.290\n[LAUGH] Yes, cuz this is all part of that,\n\n217\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.680\nwait what type of-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n218\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.310\ncuz how would I tell it there is a\nsequence of events that are happening, and\n\n219\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.470\nyou are on step three of said sequence?\n\n220\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.820\n&gt;&gt; It's connected to something else.\n\n221\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.440\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n222\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes, all right, let's keep it.\n\n223\n00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm just making sure I'm following.\n\n224\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, I am too,\nthat's why I'm checking in with you.\n\n225\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.200\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n226\n00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.520\n&gt;&gt; So we have our preview results.\n\n227\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.070\nAnd you're like, well, that didn't work.\n\n228\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz there's, apparently,\n\n229\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.950\nyou haven't connected the sequence\nnumbers to whatever they connect to.\n\n230\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.770\n&gt;&gt; And this is when, when I first\nstarted doing this, I'm like, well,\n\n231\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:07.670\nthis is broken.\n\n232\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.745\nLike, this thing doesn't work.\n\n233\n00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:09.245\n&gt;&gt; Move on.\n\n234\n00:09:10.405 --> 00:09:11.633\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Move on.\n\n235\n00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:14.725\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And I.\n\n236\n00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:17.375\nWhen I don't fully understand\nsomething I do just move on.\n\n237\n00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:20.075\n&gt;&gt; It's obviously cuz it's dumb.\n\n238\n00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:21.320\n&gt;&gt; It's not working.\n\n239\n00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.760\nSo it's like the preview worked.\n\n240\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.590\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't be that we don't know\nsomething about it that should\n\n241\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.660\nmake it work?\n\n242\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm telling you,\nI'm Googling or whatever.\n\n243\n00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.010\nI'm like, sequence number doesn't display,\nsequence number is broken.\n\n244\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.200\nI couldn't find anything to document.\n\n245\n00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.110\nAnd there was one.\n\n246\n00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.390\nIt was like in a forum.\n\n247\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.810\nAnd you have to read\nevery single one of them.\n\n248\n00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.030\n&gt;&gt; Six pages into your Google search.\n\n249\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and okay.\n\n250\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.760\nThe reason why it doesn't\nwork is because merge\n\n251\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.610\nsequence number only happens and\nit's displayed once you finish the merge.\n\n252\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.380\n&gt;&gt; Wow, really?\n\n253\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.070\n&gt;&gt; This one, remember the final step?\n\n254\n00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's what I found.\n\n255\n00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.110\nI'm like, that's kind of weird.\n\n256\n00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.300\nIt'll come back around.\n\n257\n00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.020\nSo if I come back and say, let's edit this\nindividual documents, and I want all them.\n\n258\n00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.240\nAnd I look at here and\nit's like, okay, so this is?\n\n259\n00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.670\n&gt;&gt; Sequence number 1.\n\n260\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.050\n&gt;&gt; 1 and 1.\nAnd this is?\n\n261\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.650\n&gt;&gt; 2 and 2.\n\n262\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it keeps-\n&gt;&gt; So on and so forth.\n\n263\n00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.970\nYeah, and so you kind of like-\n&gt;&gt; Still not seeing the necessity of\n\n264\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.910\nthe sequence number,\n\n265\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:26.420\nobviously it's going to do something\nthat we just don't know about.\n\n266\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nExactly.\n\n267\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.680\n[LAUGH] So right now, because I was like\nokay, this doesn't make any sense or\n\n268\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.689\nit's just the sequence number and\nthe reference number are the same.\n\n269\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.160\nMm, no.\n\n270\n00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.580\nI'm just gonna close this letters one\nbecause I don't need this file anymore.\n\n271\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.080\nAnd yet, I don't need to save the changes,\nand I'm back with my rules right?\n\n272\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.795\nAll right, well.\n\n273\n00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:50.960\n[LAUGH] This is where we start\nto get a little strange.\n\n274\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.190\nIt is connected to these other ones.\n\n275\n00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.780\nThere is Next Record If and\na Skip Record If.\n\n276\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.600\nSo, remember we talked about a whole\nepisode where we had filtering and\n\n277\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.410\nsorting, right?\n\n278\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.440\nWhere I wanted to go ahead,\n\n279\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.490\nI only wanted the people the from Florida\nand I wanna sort it by last thing.\n\n280\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.470\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n281\n00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's, and\n\n282\n00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.150\nyou can think about it\n&gt;&gt; Skip record if, okay?\n\n283\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.390\nI want you to skip a record if it\nmeets this particular criteria.\n\n284\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n285\n00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.740\n&gt;&gt; Just kinda like filtering, isn't it?\n\n286\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.570\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar.\n\n287\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this might be where\nyou're like, okay, great,\n\n288\n00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.680\nbut I'd still just use the filter, okay?\n\n289\n00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.140\n&gt;&gt; But let's just go with this, okay?\n\n290\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.680\nSkip record.\n\n291\n00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.090\nIf.\n\n292\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.660\nNow, the placement of this particular\nfield or rule doesn't matter.\n\n293\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.300\nYou can put this in the beginning or\nthe end.\n\n294\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.820\nSo I don't want you to think, you have to\nput it in the beginning of your document.\n\n295\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.080\nThat doesn't matter.\n\n296\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.580\nI'm going to put in this rule,\nskip record if.\n\n297\n00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.980\nBecause my end result is I'm trying\nto get only the marketing people.\n\n298\n00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.210\nI only want to see\nthe marketing department.\n\n299\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.600\nAnd this is where we get\ninto this backwards logic.\n\n300\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.270\nI want you to skip the record,\nif the department\n\n301\n00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.870\nis not equal to marketing.\n\n302\n00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you just want to, basically,\nfilter out anybody in marketing?\n\n303\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:22.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and see this is where you wanna\nskip it if it is not equal to market.\n\n304\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.470\n&gt;&gt; So it's the other way around, yeah.\n\n305\n00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is funny cuz I went,\nCherokee and I did this episode,\n\n306\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.710\nthe mail merger one, and she's like,\nI think she said, she goes.\n\n307\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.850\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if it's a skip if not\nrecord equals marketing.\n\n308\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.760\n&gt;&gt; And\nit's like why does Microsoft do this?\n\n309\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.680\nIt's like the whole I wanna show\nsomething, so you have to uncheck hide.\n\n310\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.980\nIt's like the backwards\nthing of why can't.\n\n311\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.030\n&gt;&gt; They do that, yeah, you're right.\n\n312\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.790\nIt's counterintuitive.\n\n313\n00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so and that's why I have to\nstop and think about this every time.\n\n314\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.710\nSkip it, if it's not marketing.\n\n315\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.120\n&gt;&gt; If it's not marketing.\n\n316\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo that means, if it's advertising,\n\n317\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:57.930\nyou're skipping.\n\n318\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.910\n&gt;&gt; So instead of saying,\n&gt;&gt; Just give it marketing.\n\n319\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.721\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if equals marketing.\n\n320\n00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:07.120\nThen give it to me.\n\n321\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.880\n&gt;&gt; So you really have to think about that.\n\n322\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.830\nAll right, that's what we've got.\n\n323\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, take an exam from Microsoft.\n\n324\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.250\nSo you'll understand exactly how they\nthink, cuz it's exactly what they do.\n\n325\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.000\n&gt;&gt; It's so amazing.\n\n326\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.500\nSo now, here you're like Skip Record If.\n\n327\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.788\n&gt;&gt; And then you go and\nyou preview it, okay?\n\n328\n00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:26.390\nWell, now the record number\nbecause think about it.\n\n329\n00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.390\nIt's still five but\nnow it's not one anymore is it?\n\n330\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.190\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n331\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.000\n&gt;&gt; Because this is record number five.\n\n332\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.590\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n333\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.960\n&gt;&gt; Right now and so,\nwhat's my sequence number?\n\n334\n00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.620\nIf I go ahead and finish this merge.\n\n335\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.940\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be one.\n\n336\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.080\nYes.\n\n337\n00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.920\nSo this is where your record number's\nfive but your seeker's number is one.\n\n338\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Because even though this is\nthe fifth record this is the first\n\n339\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.050\nin the sequence of marketing records\nthat we're going to be pulling.\n\n340\n00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n341\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:58.440\n&gt;&gt; Good. Yes. And this is very much\nconnected to the rule of the skip.\n\n342\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:58.970\nAnd everything.\n\n343\n00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.280\nSo now it's like,\nokay this record number six, but\n\n344\n00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.336\nyour sequence number's two\nin this finished merge.\n\n345\n00:14:03.336 --> 00:14:05.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then down here, let's go ahead and\n\n346\n00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.890\nscroll, oop sorry.\n\n347\n00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.945\nOkay your record number seven,\nand then your record number 13.\n\n348\n00:14:10.945 --> 00:14:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because the scroll went through, skip,\n\n349\n00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.278\nskip, skip, skip, now at 13, now.\n\n350\n00:14:14.278 --> 00:14:15.532\n&gt;&gt; Right through.\n\n351\n00:14:15.532 --> 00:14:16.266\n&gt;&gt; Now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n352\n00:14:16.266 --> 00:14:18.060\n&gt;&gt; So that's what this is doing.\n\n353\n00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.080\nOkay, cool.\n\n354\n00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.320\nAnd if I come back up here and\nlet's look at that first one.\n\n355\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.980\nSo Bishop Timothy was record number 5.\n\n356\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.337\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Let's just verify.\n\n357\n00:14:28.337 --> 00:14:30.370\nOne, two, three, four, five.\n\n358\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.430\nYes, it's the fifth record.\n\n359\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.510\nI know it says number six but\n\n360\n00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.410\nremember we had a-\n&gt;&gt; Six but\n\n361\n00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.050\nit's counting, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n362\n00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.870\n&gt;&gt; Weirdly.\n&gt;&gt; So it is the fifth record\n\n363\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.810\nin this data source.\n\n364\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.230\nCool, that's making sense.\n\n365\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.550\nThis is where there's\nanother kicker to this.\n\n366\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.330\nSo you're following so far?\n\n367\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.340\nYou're doing okay?\n\n368\n00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.960\nRemember the filtering and the sorting\nthat we did in the other episode?\n\n369\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.780\nSo I still have, let's uncheck.\n\n370\n00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.990\nWe're not taking the previous.\n\n371\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.665\nThe Skip Record If is still there.\n\n372\n00:14:56.665 --> 00:14:57.910\nWe still have all the stuff.\n\n373\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.090\nIf I come in and edit the recipient list.\n\n374\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:06.804\nAnd now, I go through and\nsort this by last name.\n\n375\n00:15:06.804 --> 00:15:08.980\nSo, we're sorting by last name.\n\n376\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.480\nWe click Ok.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n377\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.580\n&gt;&gt; So, we can see Jack Bowtie and\nlet's kinda look through here.\n\n378\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.840\nOkay, so Jasmine Flower.\n\n379\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.748\nWe click, okay?\n\n380\n00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:19.250\nAnd then I still have all of that stuff.\n\n381\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.040\nI finish the merge.\n\n382\n00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.610\nAnd we merge all our records.\n\n383\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.690\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna predict that\nit comes out the same way.\n\n384\n00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.490\nLike it still says record five,\niteration one.\n\n385\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Close, so\nI see Jasmine Flower is record six.\n\n386\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.940\n&gt;&gt; But it's iteration one.\n\n387\n00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So it does modify it.\n\n388\n00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.340\nI was thinking that maybe it's\nstill reading in a certain way.\n\n389\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nTrouble pauses number 11,\n\n390\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.395\nsequence two, and then we will go\nwith pumpkin squash is number 14.\n\n391\n00:15:45.395 --> 00:15:48.150\n&gt;&gt; 14.\n&gt;&gt; But let's come back here.\n\n392\n00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.934\nPumpkin squash is record number what?\n\n393\n00:15:50.934 --> 00:15:52.544\n&gt;&gt; Six.\n\n394\n00:15:52.544 --> 00:15:54.990\n&gt;&gt; Six, yeah.\n\n395\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.520\n&gt;&gt; Odd.\n\n396\n00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.695\n&gt;&gt; Because this Sequence number,\nand the record number is\n\n397\n00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:07.981\nconnected to how it's filtered and\nsorted in the merge,\n\n398\n00:16:07.981 --> 00:16:13.570\nand is not connected back to\nits order in the data source.\n\n399\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n400\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.975\nHopefully you guys\nfollowed along with that.\n\n401\n00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just had my little ah-ha moment\n\n402\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.640\nabout what she was saying.\n\n403\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.560\nSo you've got your full table of records.\n\n404\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.360\nPull records out for marketing, right?\n\n405\n00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.314\nThen we filter and sort it.\n\n406\n00:16:28.314 --> 00:16:29.110\n&gt;&gt; In the merge.\n\n407\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, in the merge.\n\n408\n00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.633\n&gt;&gt; And that's the record number.\n\n409\n00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:33.980\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's how we're gonna get them, yeah.\n\n410\n00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And because it's being filtered and\n\n411\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.980\nsorted, even though, remember we had\na subset of records that got pulled.\n\n412\n00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.270\nThen it got jumbled around,\nnow it's being sorted out.\n\n413\n00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.620\n&gt;&gt; It's all about\nthe sorting in the merge.\n\n414\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.270\nAnd that where it,\n\n415\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.610\ncuz up until that point-\n&gt;&gt; So don't do this.\n\n416\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n417\n00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.430\n&gt;&gt; Because it's completely useless, or\n\n418\n00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:59.400\nat least from what I can see,\nI can't think of any practical reason why\n\n419\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.771\nI would want this this way\n&gt;&gt; I agree, okay.\n\n420\n00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:06.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And this is the kind of conclusion, and\n\n421\n00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:09.472\nI think we've done this\nin a couple of place and\n\n422\n00:17:09.472 --> 00:17:15.040\nit's really in Microsoft's like, this\nis how this particular function works.\n\n423\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.127\nThis is what it does, this is the result.\n\n424\n00:17:18.127 --> 00:17:20.036\n&gt;&gt; Great.\nIt's a Rube Goldberg machine,\n\n425\n00:17:20.036 --> 00:17:23.713\nit's a complicated thing that does\nsomething simple that you won't ever use.\n\n426\n00:17:23.713 --> 00:17:25.739\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it's kind of like yes,\n\n427\n00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:27.721\nit is possible, you can do this.\n\n428\n00:17:27.721 --> 00:17:28.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n429\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.540\n&gt;&gt; This is what it will do.\n\n430\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.800\n&gt;&gt; Getting, trying to give you a real\nworld example of why I would want to do\n\n431\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.931\nthis, I'm struggling with that.\n\n432\n00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:37.003\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm really trying to\n\n433\n00:17:37.003 --> 00:17:37.518\nthink about this.\n\n434\n00:17:37.518 --> 00:17:38.198\n&gt;&gt; I bet.\n\n435\n00:17:38.198 --> 00:17:42.254\n&gt;&gt; And I've looked at like the, and\nthat's where going back to like\n\n436\n00:17:42.254 --> 00:17:45.320\nthe examples that they\ngive you in the website.\n\n437\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.760\nIt's like, okay, like so where?\n\n438\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.500\nYou've merged a batch of letters, okay.\n\n439\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.650\nAnd you can use this total to\ncalculate the cost of postage.\n\n440\n00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.520\nOkay, if you're gonna be doing that, you-\n&gt;&gt; You're probably not doing this.\n\n441\n00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.050\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n442\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna go and\n\n443\n00:18:01.124 --> 00:18:02.780\nhave a service provider go ahead and\ndo that for you.\n\n444\n00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.959\nAnd tell them put [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; I mean it's nice that they throw\n\n445\n00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:06.613\nthat in there for\n\n446\n00:18:06.613 --> 00:18:10.500\nmaybe somebody who doesn't realize that\nthat's a service most people pay for.\n\n447\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.290\nYeah.\nAnd I'm sure people can do this.\n\n448\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:12.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n449\n00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.494\n&gt;&gt; I mean, cuz I know it's possible\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n450\n00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:17.979\n&gt;&gt; But it's just like that, just because\nit's possible doesn't mean you should.\n\n451\n00:18:17.979 --> 00:18:18.718\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you should.\n\n452\n00:18:18.718 --> 00:18:20.304\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know, and\n\n453\n00:18:20.304 --> 00:18:22.036\nthe one with the merge record is like,\n\n454\n00:18:22.036 --> 00:18:24.490\nokay you wanted to create\na unique invoice number.\n\n455\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.260\nOkay, I can kinda see that, of like,\nall right I'm finishing this merge and\n\n456\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.610\nI just need to have something\nthat I can tie back to but to me.\n\n457\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.800\nI'm thinking if you want\na unique invoice number.\n\n458\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.580\nI kinda wanna connect it back\nto that data source anyways.\n\n459\n00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.861\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that I can look\nit up by the invoice number.\n\n460\n00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:42.759\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but then it doesn't have any\nconnection to the data source we just saw\n\n461\n00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.960\nwith the sorting.\n\n462\n00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.180\nSo what was what they say is the result\nof the record number 11 is really\n\n463\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.020\nrecord number 6 in our data source.\n\n464\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.177\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So then that evens-\n\n465\n00:18:51.177 --> 00:18:53.510\n&gt;&gt; So it becomes disassociated.\n\n466\n00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.500\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n467\n00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.760\nAnd that's where, so I'm struggling\nwith trying to give you a reason.\n\n468\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.347\n&gt;&gt; Like if I was going to need\na subset of marketing only,\n\n469\n00:19:03.347 --> 00:19:05.833\nI would make a marketing only table.\n\n470\n00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:07.512\n&gt;&gt; And just filter it.\n\n471\n00:19:07.512 --> 00:19:09.775\nI mean we saw how easy it was to filter\nit- &gt;&gt; Yeah, or just filter it, yeah.\n\n472\n00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:13.039\n&gt;&gt; Like just filter, and don't worry\nabout these skip rule things and\n\n473\n00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:14.710\nbackwards logic and everything.\n\n474\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.600\n&gt;&gt; But you can do it, if you want to.\n\n475\n00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.350\n&gt;&gt; You totally can.\n\n476\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.867\nSo that's, yeah, and so\nI would just filter it.\n\n477\n00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:26.404\nAnd if I needed to have a connection\nto Pumpkin Squash back to it's original\n\n478\n00:19:26.404 --> 00:19:27.778\nrecord number,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n479\n00:19:27.778 --> 00:19:31.850\n&gt;&gt; I would make the data\nsource have a numbered record.\n\n480\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.050\nIt's kinda like primary keys in Access.\n\n481\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I would do that.\n\n482\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.569\nAnd just as an example, we're not gonna\ndo the merge or anything like that, but\n\n483\n00:19:39.569 --> 00:19:44.750\nlike right here, what I'm talking about is\nI would have, look, a data order number.\n\n484\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.818\nSo Bishop, Timothy will always\nbe connected to number 5 and\n\n485\n00:19:47.818 --> 00:19:50.357\nI would enter that in as\na field in my merge letter.\n\n486\n00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:53.117\n&gt;&gt; So any time I pull number 5\nit's always Bishop, Timothy.\n\n487\n00:19:53.117 --> 00:19:55.872\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's where I can\nconnect it back to my data source.\n\n488\n00:19:55.872 --> 00:19:56.989\nBut I can't do that with the rules.\n\n489\n00:19:56.989 --> 00:19:59.611\n&gt;&gt; Right, they become synonymous\nwith each other at that point.\n\n490\n00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:00.963\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz that's part of the record.\n\n491\n00:20:00.963 --> 00:20:03.104\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n492\n00:20:03.104 --> 00:20:05.605\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Musings of two people, what can we say?\n\n493\n00:20:05.605 --> 00:20:08.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So following along okay?\n\n494\n00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.626\n&gt;&gt; Following along.\n\n495\n00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I get it,\n\n496\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.850\nI can do it, I understand what\nwould happen if I did it.\n\n497\n00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.700\nJust again, like you said,\nstruggling to figure out why.\n\n498\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.730\n&gt;&gt; A real world application of being able\nto do it, that makes sense to my brain.\n\n499\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.490\n&gt;&gt; Rob told me one time we are Hollywood\nproducers, we have to shoehorn this in.\n\n500\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.045\nWe need a big giant mechanical spider.\n\n501\n00:20:28.045 --> 00:20:29.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gotta be in the episode.\n\n502\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:30.472\nMake it happen.\n\n503\n00:20:30.472 --> 00:20:31.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n504\n00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.986\n&gt;&gt; And there you go,\n\n505\n00:20:31.986 --> 00:20:33.776\nthere's our giant mechanical spider.\n\n506\n00:20:33.776 --> 00:20:35.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n507\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:40.480\nthe skip record if thing about\nthe next record, if is the same idea.\n\n508\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.122\nGo to the next record,\nif it meets the specific criteria.\n\n509\n00:20:44.122 --> 00:20:46.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of one and the same,\n\n510\n00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.030\nthe same but different.\n\n511\n00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just in different logic and\n\n512\n00:20:48.193 --> 00:20:49.600\nyou really have to think about it.\n\n513\n00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.400\nAnd look, even look,\nWord didn't like it either.\n\n514\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.062\n&gt;&gt; Nope, hated its guts.\n\n515\n00:20:53.062 --> 00:20:54.166\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it's crashing yet again.\n\n516\n00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:55.157\n&gt;&gt; The crashes.\n\n517\n00:20:55.157 --> 00:20:59.885\nGoodness, what is,\nwhat is up with this account?\n\n518\n00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:02.349\n[LAUGH] Well I know what's wrong,\nRonnie and I need to fix it.\n\n519\n00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:04.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I still haven't found that little\n\n520\n00:21:04.399 --> 00:21:06.930\nguy so,\nI need [LAUGH] to have him fix my text.\n\n521\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:07.910\n&gt;&gt; The gremlins?\n\n522\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes, always contact your IT department.\n\n523\n00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.850\n&gt;&gt; Don't feed the Mogwai after midnight\npeople, please don't get them wet.\n\n524\n00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.392\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n525\n00:21:15.392 --> 00:21:18.431\nmaybe that's how you feel about\nthose particular rules, and\n\n526\n00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:21.018\nso I think we're done with\nthose particular rules.\n\n527\n00:21:21.018 --> 00:21:21.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n528\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.950\nWe'll come back with another episode\nof the if, then, else, which I do like.\n\n529\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.939\nAnd that's actually way\nmore straightforward.\n\n530\n00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:27.600\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n&gt;&gt; Unless I have a full keyboard.\n\n133\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.790\nSo you might be like,\nI don't have a full keyboard either, so\n\n134\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.790\nwhat can I do with this?\n\n135\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.360\nI have this little button up here,\nand I'll slow you where I got it.\n\n136\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.790\nOkay, so it's way up here,\nit's our quick access tool bar.\n\n137\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.650\nAnd I have a view field codes, and you\ncan see they're right there, ALT F9, and\n\n138\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.400\nthat's where I've added this particular\ncommand on to my quick access toolbar.\n\n139\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.730\nIf you're like, how did you get there?\n\n140\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.730\nJust as a quick review, if I drop this\ndown again, let me zoom out again, oops!\n\n141\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.410\nLet's go ahead and oops, that is the wrong\nway, sorry guys, there we go, [LAUGH].\n\n142\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.530\nLet's get back we have our\ncustomized quick access toolbar and\n\n143\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.070\nyou can do more commands.\n\n144\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.080\nNow the more commands, I'm pretty sure\nI went ahead and did the Alt commands,\n\n145\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.770\nI'm pretty sure it's not on the ribbon,\nso you might wanna use that.\n\n146\n00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.010\nBut in the Alt commands, I had to go all\nthe way down to the view and find it.\n\n147\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.910\nCuz, I was looking for a show code or\nreveal codes but it's right here.\n\n148\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.750\nView field codes and it has that\nlittle A in the parentheses and\n\n149\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.580\nthat's where I went ahead and\nadd that on to the quick access toolbar.\n\n150\n00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.760\nThis is also something that you\ncan find in your preferences, and\n\n151\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.290\nthis is something that, I've had people\nsay, I don't know what's going on, but\n\n152\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.280\nI see all of this extra code in my\ndocuments, and I can't make it stop.\n\n153\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.735\nI'm like, check your preferences and\ntell me if you see that.\n\n154\n00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:50.527\nSo if I go back over- or Options,\n\n155\n00:07:50.527 --> 00:07:54.754\nI'm sorry, I'm in the PC world, so\nit's Options, the Preferences in Mac.\n\n156\n00:07:54.754 --> 00:08:00.037\nIf I go here to Options,\nI'm pretty sure it's in advanced.\n\n157\n00:08:00.037 --> 00:08:04.156\nAnd it's, right here,\nsee in the show document content,\n\n158\n00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:07.020\nshow field codes instead of their values.\n\n159\n00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.582\nPeople have this checked on and they're\nlike, my gosh, how'd you know that?\n\n160\n00:08:11.582 --> 00:08:15.410\nI'm like, years of people asking me,\nand me finding it.\n\n161\n00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.788\n&gt;&gt; Does that come from accidentally\nhitting the Alt+F9 or whatever?\n\n162\n00:08:18.788 --> 00:08:24.648\n&gt;&gt; Probably, yeah, or some even crazier,\nwhat was I trying to say?\n\n163\n00:08:24.648 --> 00:08:27.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly that [LAUGH].\n\n164\n00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Keyboard shortcut, whoa, I messed\nup some of those syllables in there.\n\n165\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.835\nBut yeah, and the show crop marks,\nand the text boundaries.\n\n166\n00:08:34.835 --> 00:08:38.841\nThere's some weird things that you can\nget turned on in these preferences.\n\n167\n00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:42.210\nYou're like, why is that there?\n\n168\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.244\n&gt;&gt; Why does this exist?\n\n169\n00:08:43.244 --> 00:08:46.048\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Check your advanced options, and\n\n170\n00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:50.618\nthis is over, again, years of me just\nlooking at every single line and\n\n171\n00:08:50.618 --> 00:08:55.280\nthen remembering, and\nit's popped up quite a few times.\n\n172\n00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.837\nAnyways, long story short.\n\n173\n00:08:56.837 --> 00:09:02.431\nI'm gonna click this button, now that\nI have on my Quick Access toolbar,\n\n174\n00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:07.768\nto show you, it says if the merged\nfield is equal to Gainesville.\n\n175\n00:09:07.768 --> 00:09:10.861\nThen you can see, it doesn't have the\nactual word then, but the next sentence,\n\n176\n00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:12.926\nGainesville employees are welcome to come,\n[SOUND].\n\n177\n00:09:12.926 --> 00:09:17.160\nAnd then you see there's a closed quote,\nso\n\n178\n00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.036\nthis right here is the string of text\nto show if this evaluation is true.\n\n179\n00:09:24.036 --> 00:09:26.990\nElse, and then, see, there's another\nset of quotes, but it's blank.\n\n180\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.684\nIt's empty, so that's that whole,\nif it's not going to be Gainesville,\n\n181\n00:09:30.684 --> 00:09:32.081\nthen don't show anything.\n\n182\n00:09:32.081 --> 00:09:35.680\nAnd that is the code that you're\nseeing in the background.\n\n183\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.832\nYou don't see that unless you\nhave that show/reveal code thing,\n\n184\n00:09:40.832 --> 00:09:44.237\nbecause the preview is only for\nthe fields.\n\n185\n00:09:44.237 --> 00:09:48.330\nIt's not gonna show you that whole block\nof code to let you know the logic that's\n\n186\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.195\ngoing on there.\n\n187\n00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:51.775\nSo that's just something good to know\nabout when we start getting into these\n\n188\n00:09:51.775 --> 00:09:54.810\nmore advanced rules.\n\n189\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.760\nThe merge sequence number and the merge\nrecord number, I didn't even show\n\n190\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.305\nthat in that particular episode,\nbecause it wasn't really applicable.\n\n191\n00:10:02.305 --> 00:10:04.710\nWe didn't need to have the show fields.\n\n192\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.665\nBut notice up here when I click on this,\n\n193\n00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:09.524\nit's gonna show the merge\nfield first merge field last.\n\n194\n00:10:09.524 --> 00:10:14.298\nSo there is extra code that is associated\nwith our insert merge fields, so\n\n195\n00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:19.000\njust in case you're looking at that,\nthat's what's going on, cool.\n\n196\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.393\nSo that's pretty neat, let's look\nat another example just for fun.\n\n197\n00:10:24.393 --> 00:10:26.971\nWe'll do another document so\nyou can just see, hey,\n\n198\n00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:31.360\nthere's going to be a different sentence\ninvolved, those quotes that we just saw.\n\n199\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.890\nWell, then there's just gonna\nbe a different sentence.\n\n200\n00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:39.040\nSo if the merge field is equal to\nadvertising, then you go ahead and display\n\n201\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.220\nthe sentence that says, the advertising\nmeeting will be held on the 19th.\n\n202\n00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.837\nWell, it's past the 19th, so\nsorry if you didn't get the memo.\n\n203\n00:10:45.837 --> 00:10:50.700\n[LAUGH] And then else your department\nmeeting is not scheduled for this month.\n\n204\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.920\nSo this is maybe an example of\nsomething you do as like a mail merge.\n\n205\n00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.679\nEvery month you have the sync,\n\n206\n00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:58.500\nand that's the kind of cool thing\nof like you have the same list.\n\n207\n00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.310\nYou have your same source\nthat you're connected to.\n\n208\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.841\nYou still have your first, last, so\nyou're not really changing this part out.\n\n209\n00:11:04.841 --> 00:11:07.770\nYou're just changing\nthe little sentence out and\n\n210\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.050\nthe nice thing is,\nyou can just come into here.\n\n211\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.768\nAnd if you can see the codes, maybe next\nmonth you change advertising to marketing.\n\n212\n00:11:15.768 --> 00:11:22.520\nAnd then you change the 19th to the 22nd\nor whatever, run it and then go.\n\n213\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.910\nSo you can see that there's some\nkinda neat things that you can do.\n\n214\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.230\nAnd I'm only using one if statement, but\n\n215\n00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.351\nyou could put if statements all over\nthe place, and it's just like this.\n\n216\n00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:36.815\nIt adds a whole other variableness,\nfor lack of a better term,\n\n217\n00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:39.530\nto being able to complete that merge.\n\n218\n00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.257\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, is it always an if, then,\nelse, or is there nesting iffing or\n\n219\n00:11:44.257 --> 00:11:45.870\nthings of that nature?\n\n220\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.040\nI know that, in programming,\nit can get very complex, and\n\n221\n00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.810\nactually drive the logic to a very,\nvery complex systems, just using this.\n\n222\n00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.021\n&gt;&gt; Nested if statements are super popular\nin Excel, and like you're saying,\n\n223\n00:11:57.021 --> 00:11:58.185\nin programming language.\n\n224\n00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:01.269\nThis one-\n&gt;&gt; It's meant to be simple.\n\n225\n00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:06.759\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's only one statement, it's not\nif, but then another if, then another if.\n\n226\n00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.251\nThat's what we're talking\nabout nested ifs,\n\n227\n00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:10.260\nthere's multiple conditions\nif you wanna say.\n\n228\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.785\nIn this, it's just one, but\n\n229\n00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:17.747\nyou can put multiple single\nif statements and connect it.\n\n230\n00:12:17.747 --> 00:12:22.122\nSo you could have it if the merge field\nequals advertising do this one part, and\n\n231\n00:12:22.122 --> 00:12:24.839\nthen later down in the,\nsay, same connection,\n\n232\n00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:28.390\nif it's advertising then\ndisplay this sentence.\n\n233\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.880\nBut it can't be like,\nwell if it's advertising do this,\n\n234\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.020\nif it's marketing do this.\n\n235\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.020\nYou could, but\nyou can't all put in into one.\n\n236\n00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.730\nAt least I haven't seen any\nexamples that support that.\n\n237\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.783\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and typically, with higher\nfunctioning programming languages,\n\n238\n00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:47.795\nthey have if L if, or else if.\n\n239\n00:12:47.795 --> 00:12:51.300\nSo that you can chain those structures\ntogether, and that's why I was asking.\n\n240\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.485\nI didn't know if it was a part of this or\nnot.\n\n241\n00:12:53.485 --> 00:12:56.450\n&gt;&gt; Not to my knowledge, and\nthat's where I'm going to cover myself.\n\n242\n00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, hedge your bets.\n\n243\n00:12:57.204 --> 00:13:04.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If it is possible,\ngreat, I'm not gonna go that far.\n\n244\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.156\nAnd I honestly haven't even really,\nI really haven't even researched it, so\n\n245\n00:13:08.156 --> 00:13:09.312\nit's a possibility.\n\n246\n00:13:09.312 --> 00:13:11.060\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n247\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.208\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say, possibly no.\n\n248\n00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.341\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, positively, maybe [LAUGH].\n\n249\n00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:19.678\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you guys.\n\n17\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.835\nThis one, it took me a while to\ncome around to even half liking it.\n\n18\n00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:01.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That means this is gonna be\n\n19\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.130\na rough one.\n\n20\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.906\nBetter get the shoulder pads on.\n\n21\n00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:04.516\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n22\n00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:11.310\n[LAUGH] It's a little convoluted, and\nit's taken me a lot of trial and error.\n\n23\n00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.540\nA lot of testing or what if I do this?\n\n24\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.530\nWhat about, why isn't that work?\n\n25\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.450\nNot really finding a lot\nhelp online again.\n\n26\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.410\n&gt;&gt; Love that.\n\n27\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd so you it's\n\n28\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.710\njust you kinda have to take a little\npieces, take it back, figuring on out and\n\n29\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.600\nthen put it together and you've like.\n\n30\n00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.300\nSo that's how it really works.\n\n31\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.590\nOkay well that didn't really tell me that\nwell so that's whats kind of, I've come\n\n32\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.095\naround but I've struggled I always was\nlike this is dumb I don't wanna do this.\n\n33\n00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:44.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well don't sugar coat it\n\n34\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.370\ntell us how you really feel\n&gt;&gt; You know this is pre-\n\n35\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.180\n&gt;&gt; We can take it\n\n36\n00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.440\n&gt;&gt; This is pretty much the end of\n\n37\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.950\nthe series.\n\n38\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.010\nOr at least for right now.\n\n39\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.480\nThis is my last episode in this series.\n\n40\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.470\nSo you know what, you know\n&gt;&gt; You call a spade\n\n41\n00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.600\na spade\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.410\n&gt;&gt; That's how it works.\n\n43\n00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.650\n&gt;&gt; This is a weird one.\n\n44\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.480\nOkay, and maybe it's just me\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.090\n&gt;&gt; You know I always have to take this,\nlike maybe this is just me and\n\n46\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.090\nthe way that I approached it.\n\n47\n00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.200\nAnd somebody else can turn around after\nI present it to you, you're like, that's\n\n48\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.890\nnot that bad, Vonne, it's good, I like it,\nI could totally see how this works.\n\n49\n00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.530\nWonderful, that's why I'm here, to tell\nyou how this actually works the right way.\n\n50\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.680\nSo ask and fill in.\n\n51\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.311\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were gonna say,\nask and you shall recieve [LAUGH].\n\n52\n00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, it's kind of like that.\n\n53\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n54\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.950\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n55\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.900\nA way for you to put in something,\na prompt for\n\n56\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.050\nthe word document to ask you,\nand you type in the answer.\n\n57\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.720\n&gt;&gt; So this is user input?\n\n58\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I love user input.\n\n59\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.400\nIt's one of my favorite\nthings in the world.\n\n60\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; When I'm doing programming,\n\n61\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.000\nI love to be able to\ninteract with the user.\n\n62\n00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.600\nAnd instead of just give me a bunch\nof fields and then I'll handle it.\n\n63\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.700\nI hate those kind of programs.\n\n64\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.130\nI love it when it goes what do you\nwant here, what do you want there.\n\n65\n00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.720\nIs that kind of like what\nwe are going to be doing?\n\n66\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm out.\n\n67\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n68\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.160\n&gt;&gt; Well this is a good show.\n\n69\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Too wrong.\n\n70\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.990\nLet's do it.\n&gt;&gt; Once I show you how to work it\n\n71\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.980\nthe right way.\n\n72\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.930\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Right so that\n\n73\n00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.860\nis a good caveat because if you\ndon't know how to do it right.\n\n74\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.360\nProbably a big pile of frustration.\n\n75\n00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.920\n&gt;&gt; And maybe it's just,\n\n76\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.290\nagain, my little brain in here interpreted\nhow they were telling me how to use it.\n\n77\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.770\nI just was thinking\nabout it the wrong way.\n\n78\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.160\nSo I'm gonna walk you\nthrough this whole thing.\n\n79\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.340\nLet's come down here to our website.\n\n80\n00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.310\nThis is the same website that\nwe used in the 1st rules episode\n\n81\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.410\nwhere it just talked about studying\nthe rules and it gives you an evaluation.\n\n82\n00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.305\nI think when in that episode\nit was kinda like, this thing!\n\n83\n00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:39.800\n[LAUGH] So ask, okay, and fill in.\n\n84\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.030\nFill in is the much easier\nway of doing the ask.\n\n85\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.518\nOkay, just going to throw\nthat out right now.\n\n86\n00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:48.680\nBut in the fill in, fill in field, and\n\n87\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.830\nI'm like I've done plenty of fields,\nforms and things, okay.\n\n88\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.890\nAnd you can ask a field in\nmultiple times in document.\n\n89\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.600\nOkay, there's this fill in dialogue.\n\n90\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.250\nTell me what this ask wants,\nthat's a very important thing.\n\n91\n00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.110\nOkay, and then they, but the example,\n\n92\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.260\nyour organization is sponsoring this\nevent, the form asks for information.\n\n93\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.150\nAnd then you type in like how old are you.\n\n94\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.730\nOkay, so now this right here\nis where it threw me off,\n\n95\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.390\ncuz I'm thinking,\nI can put in this fill in field in like.\n\n96\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.940\nThe finished version, it's for\nthe end person, like the end\n\n97\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.270\nresult of when I'm sending this out to\nsomebody, you would get a proposes.\n\n98\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.820\nHow old are you?\n\n99\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.410\nYou type it in and fills it in.\n\n100\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.530\nI don't know why my brain thought that\nway, but it doesn't work that way.\n\n101\n00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.500\nIt is for you as a person who\nis creating the mail merge.\n\n102\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.410\nYou are the creator of the mail merge and\nyou're gonna spit out the final product.\n\n103\n00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n104\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.540\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I interpreted that wrong.\n\n105\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.750\n&gt;&gt; Start us from the beginning.\n\n106\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.530\nWalk from the top here.\n\n107\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.380\n&gt;&gt; You as I me,\ninsert yourself into this position.\n\n108\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.060\nI am the one performing the mail merge.\n\n109\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.200\nSo this is something I do every month.\n\n110\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay, doing the mail merge.\n\n111\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n112\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.490\nEasy peasy.\n\n113\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.490\n&gt;&gt; And this like, it's kind of back to\nthat whole thing we did with the if, then,\n\n114\n00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.030\nelse thing.\n\n115\n00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.700\nIn the sense of like,\n\n116\n00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.550\nthis is a variable piece that's\nnot connected to my data source.\n\n117\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.790\nBut it's kind of more of like\nprompting me to say, hey.\n\n118\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.280\nIs this month, yeah.\n\n119\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.650\n&gt;&gt; I see where you're going with this now.\n\n120\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.680\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Is this month, so\n\n121\n00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.190\nI'm basically putting a reminder into\nmyself, to hey, change this piece out.\n\n122\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; When, and\n\n123\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.030\nyou have to remember, it's February.\n\n124\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.420\nSo, we're going to maybe\nwhich holiday is this month.\n\n125\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.770\nAnd you type in Valentine's day.\n\n126\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's something like\nthe second Tuesday of the month,\n\n127\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.310\nwhich is different usually every month.\n\n128\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.220\nYeah, and so to me, I form a,\nI've said it's more of a reminder.\n\n129\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.654\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I am prompting myself as a creator of\n\n130\n00:05:45.654 --> 00:05:50.104\nthis mail merge, and the result is going\nto like, if I tag this little place that I\n\n131\n00:05:50.104 --> 00:05:54.507\nwanna say like, this month's holiday,\nand it's like Like a fill-in field.\n\n132\n00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:56.686\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it prompts, hey what's the holiday?\n\n133\n00:05:56.686 --> 00:05:59.682\n[CROSSTALK] I type in Valentine's Day,\nit puts in Valentine's Day.\n\n134\n00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:00.703\nI complete the merge, and\n\n135\n00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:03.778\nthen everything goes ahead with that\nparticular that says Valentine's Day.\n\n136\n00:06:03.778 --> 00:06:05.377\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n&gt;&gt; But next month it will be St.\n\n137\n00:06:05.377 --> 00:06:06.182\nPatrick's Day.\n\n138\n00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:07.554\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's so on so forth.\n\n139\n00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:08.054\n&gt;&gt; Whatever.\n\n140\n00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.350\nYes so that's how it works.\n\n141\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.530\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n142\n00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.360\n&gt;&gt; Again, I misinterpreted it and\nlike, okay, now I understand\n\n143\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.700\nwhat this fill in field will do for\nme as the creator of the mail merge.\n\n144\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.550\nCool, ask is pretty much the same thing,\nbecause it's like you're asking,\n\n145\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.060\nhey let me go ahead and\ngive you this prompt.\n\n146\n00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.740\nThe difference between the fill in and\n\n147\n00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.780\nthe ask is that there are actually\ntwo pieces to the ask.\n\n148\n00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.450\nThat the fill in goes automatically.\n\n149\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.000\n&gt;&gt; So it's just a more convoluted way\nof getting you to the same place.\n\n150\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n151\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.138\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, so don't use ask.\n\n152\n00:06:42.138 --> 00:06:45.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, if it's kind of why would I\n\n153\n00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.050\nuse one versus-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's an edge case that only ask\n\n154\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.270\ndoes, right?\n\n155\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.430\n&gt;&gt; Kind of,\nask is where you can ask one question, and\n\n156\n00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.110\nhave multiple places of\nwhere the answer goes.\n\n157\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.410\nSo fill in doesn't do that?\n\n158\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nCorrect, correct.\n\n159\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.490\nYou are correct yes.\n\n160\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.910\nSo it just could be like, hey,\nI'm asking you a question.\n\n161\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.830\nSame thing prompt and\neverything like that, but\n\n162\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.960\nthat ask has to be\nconnected to a ref field.\n\n163\n00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.030\nSo you have an ask and a ref.\n\n164\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.709\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n165\n00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:15.030\nthe way that you connect\nthose 2 is with a bookmark.\n\n166\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.450\nSo the ask bookmark would be,\nwe'll use holiday.\n\n167\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.507\n&gt;&gt; Man, you've really gotta\nwant to do this one, don't you?\n\n168\n00:07:22.507 --> 00:07:23.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.590\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I mean it seems to\n\n170\n00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.430\nbe taking a very simple idea and\nmaking it very complex.\n\n171\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.950\n&gt;&gt; Slightly, it's really not that hard to\nimplement if you understand the concept.\n\n172\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.010\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Ask, I'm gonna-\n\n173\n00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.970\n&gt;&gt; It just seems like a lot of steps\n\n174\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.580\nto get it to do what you want it to do.\n\n175\n00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.570\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, but not really.\n\n176\n00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully-\n\n177\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n178\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.560\n&gt;&gt; Once I show you how to do it-\n\n179\n00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, obviously-\n\n180\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.590\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it'll be like-\n\n181\n00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.150\n&gt;&gt; We haven't seen it\n\n182\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.010\nyet, so-\n&gt;&gt; All\n\n183\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.830\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n184\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.880\n&gt;&gt; But, the whole idea of the app,\n\n185\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.391\nand that's.\nThe thing.\n\n186\n00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:49.459\nIt's like they don't, and each one of\n\n187\n00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:53.782\nthem has this ask field, and it kinda goes\ninto, all right, and it does talk about\n\n188\n00:07:53.782 --> 00:07:57.451\nokay, well you have to have a ref.\nSo you have an ask field,\n\n189\n00:07:57.451 --> 00:08:01.795\nyou have to have the ref field.\nThe ask has to be named the same as your\n\n190\n00:08:01.795 --> 00:08:04.090\nref to have a connection.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n191\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.043\n&gt;&gt; So if you think about it,\n\n192\n00:08:05.043 --> 00:08:09.570\nit tends to separate, you could have\nref here, a ref here, a ref here.\n\n193\n00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.389\nYou can have multiple refs with the same\nbookmark that connects to the same\n\n194\n00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:15.171\nquestion.\n\n195\n00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:19.170\nSo that's where they are different and\ncould be beneficial.\n\n196\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.410\nOne question, same answer,\nmultiple places.\n\n197\n00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.950\nFill in, it does all of that so\n\n198\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.360\nyou don't have to, it's all kind\nof in a nice little package, but\n\n199\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.970\nyou just put it in one place and you\ncan't put the answer in multiple places.\n\n200\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.500\nThat's the basis of it.\n\n201\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, you're like, okay.\n\n202\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.710\n&gt;&gt; Now I want to see this thing work.\n\n203\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.560\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's why I wanted to\nmake sure we talk about these concepts\n\n204\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.190\nbecause for me that was the hardest part.\n\n205\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.382\nBesides remembering to put the ref\nfield in and what button to push.\n\n206\n00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:50.390\nOkay, once that's done, okay, got it.\n\n207\n00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.377\nNow I can just copy and paste and go ahead\nand put that ref field in multiple places.\n\n208\n00:08:55.377 --> 00:08:56.213\nGot it.\nAll right, here we go.\n\n209\n00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:59.800\n[LAUGH] So\nwe're going to go to this particular file.\n\n210\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.401\nI made a copy, so I have the rules, ask\nand fill in and then a copy cuz I wanna\n\n211\n00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:08.947\nsave some of the steps to show you\nclosing the file and opening it back up.\n\n212\n00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:13.027\nAnd I didn't want to do that in the actual\nfile that I'm going to give to you guys to\n\n213\n00:09:13.027 --> 00:09:16.110\nhopefully follow along if you so desire.\n\n214\n00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.240\nI need to enable the editing.\n\n215\n00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.410\nThis is gonna happen in all of\nyour exercise files because\n\n216\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.280\nit's done through the Internet.\n\n217\n00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.960\nSo we're going to, yes, perform the merge,\nmeaning connect to the data source.\n\n218\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.260\nWe know that warning very well.\n\n219\n00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.080\nIn this, I only have right now,\na couple fields,\n\n220\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.630\nwe have the first, last, and department.\n\n221\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.840\nAnd showing the fields,\nremember we know that button up there.\n\n222\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.550\nThere's no extra fields in here.\n\n223\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.500\nThe only reason why I have fill in cat,\nfill in dessert and ask color,\n\n224\n00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.400\nis for me to remember what I want to\nshow you, and how to do this, okay?\n\n225\n00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.380\nSo nothing up my sleeve right now, we've\ngot the preview and we can see that we\n\n226\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.470\nhave Jasmine in marketing,\nPuma in advertising, Frito in sales, cool.\n\n227\n00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.278\nAll right, here we go, ready?\n\n228\n00:10:02.278 --> 00:10:06.740\n[LAUGH] I'm practising this, cuz there's\na couple little turns in here, all right?\n\n229\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.210\nAnd I'll get to the final result of,\nthis is the best way to do this.\n\n230\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.640\nBut I wanna show you some of,\nthis is why it's not good to do it.\n\n231\n00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.720\nFill in cats, so\n\n232\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.080\nI start with come celebrate somebody's\nbirthday this Friday in the break room.\n\n233\n00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.540\nThis party will feature, specific dessert,\nas the main dessert dish.\n\n234\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.260\nPlease wear something to the party,\nlike pink, green depending on the party.\n\n235\n00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.270\n&gt;&gt;

It did not?\n\n314\n00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.365\n&gt;&gt; No, because I thought, from all of\nmy way of understanding it's like.\n\n315\n00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:06.400\nIt would ask me when I open the file.\n\n316\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.000\n&gt;&gt; No, it asked you.\n\n317\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.540\nThat's why you say ask once, right?\n\n318\n00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.360\nIs that where the ask once thing comes in?\n\n319\n00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.130\n&gt;&gt; Keep that in mind.\n\n320\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.270\n&gt;&gt; I'm keeping it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, my misunderstanding, is\n\n321\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:20.020\nit's going to prompt me that question when\nI open the file, nope, it doesn't do that.\n\n322\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.187\nOkay, so it does not have anything\nto do with when you open it.\n\n323\n00:14:22.187 --> 00:14:24.270\n&gt;&gt; Does it prompt when you do the merge?\n\n324\n00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you have to finish the merge.\n\n325\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.920\nThat was the big one, like okay.\n\n326\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.310\nAgain, little tid bits from\ndifferent websites that I found.\n\n327\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.930\nSo if I preview the results, okay,\nwell now, and I'm going to do this.\n\n328\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:36.790\nI'm gonna finish a merge.\n\n329\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.440\nI'm gonna edit the individual documents.\n\n330\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.120\nI'm purposely going to limit\nthis from all records.\n\n331\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.300\nI'm gonna type in 1 to 3.\n\n332\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.320\nSo we're only gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Right, just keeping it small.\n\n333\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you'll see why.\n\n334\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.630\n&gt;&gt; Demonstrative purposes, sure.\n\n335\n00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.730\n&gt;&gt; Remember that ask once?\n\n336\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, ready?\n\n337\n00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.790\nWe're gonna click OK.\n\n338\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.450\n&gt;&gt; Fire away.\n\n339\n00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.555\n&gt;&gt; Who's birthday is it?\n\n340\n00:14:57.555 --> 00:14:58.147\nFuego.\n\n341\n00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:58.647\n&gt;&gt; Fuego.\n\n342\n00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.460\n&gt;&gt; Who's birthday is it?\n\n343\n00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.080\n&gt;&gt; Bishop Timothy.\n\n344\n00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.062\n&gt;&gt; But the whole purpose is-\n&gt;&gt; It's Fuego.\n\n345\n00:15:07.062 --> 00:15:08.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n346\n00:15:08.155 --> 00:15:11.750\nI assumed it was asking me\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that's the thing.\n\n347\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.350\n&gt;&gt; Session.\n\n348\n00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.500\n&gt;&gt; So that's the thing ask if you\ndo not check the ask once and\n\n349\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.010\nwe'll click okay and then I'm like okay,\nnow I'm done, right?\n\n350\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:22.360\nI only did three because it's\nasking me for every single record.\n\n351\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.090\n&gt;&gt; In a row?\n\n352\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.054\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So I was right in my thought where,\n\n353\n00:15:25.054 --> 00:15:26.464\nI was moving from cat to cat.\n\n354\n00:15:26.464 --> 00:15:27.013\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n355\n00:15:27.013 --> 00:15:29.049\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was asking once per new record.\n\n356\n00:15:29.049 --> 00:15:32.506\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; 19 and we would have had 19,\n\n357\n00:15:32.506 --> 00:15:34.320\nyou had 1900?\n\n358\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n359\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.000\nWhich, could be an advantage.\n\n360\n00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.665\nThat could be alright.\n\n361\n00:15:37.665 --> 00:15:40.860\nYou'd be like, yeah, I do this every\nmonth, I just want to type in name, next,\n\n362\n00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.880\nname, next, name, next, and we're done.\n\n363\n00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.193\n&gt;&gt; If I had a couple of them.\n\n364\n00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:44.873\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But then, to me,\n\n365\n00:15:44.873 --> 00:15:47.330\nif you're going to do that why don't\nyou just put that as a field--\n\n366\n00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.209\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n367\n00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:51.177\n&gt;&gt; Next to the record, then it's like,\nespecially if you do sorting, and\n\n368\n00:15:51.177 --> 00:15:54.245\nfiltering--\n&gt;&gt; You and your logic, things,\n\n369\n00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.002\ndoing it smart ways.\n\n370\n00:15:56.002 --> 00:15:59.436\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cause I'm like, If I wanted\nit to prompt me every single time,\n\n371\n00:15:59.436 --> 00:16:02.127\nwhy not just make it a field,\nconnect it to the record?\n\n372\n00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:05.825\nBecause then how do we connect it\nto Cheetos sticks to Fuego and?\n\n373\n00:16:05.825 --> 00:16:07.193\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nthere's already a record there, so\n\n374\n00:16:07.193 --> 00:16:08.603\nmight as well just do it\nthe old fashioned way.\n\n375\n00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:10.789\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthat was the one where I'm like, [SOUND].\n\n376\n00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:14.598\nAnd the whole idea was, I thought you were\njust gonna ask me about Fuego's birthday.\n\n377\n00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:18.175\nSo now I have Fuego, and\nthen Fuego, and then a special cat,\n\n378\n00:16:18.175 --> 00:16:19.941\nbecause I started to get mad.\n\n379\n00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:21.183\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, tap, tap, tap.\n\n380\n00:16:21.183 --> 00:16:25.554\n&gt;&gt; And then you cancel, and so\nnow you've got this default one,\n\n381\n00:16:25.554 --> 00:16:27.752\nthat's where, to me, here.\n\n382\n00:16:27.752 --> 00:16:29.759\n&gt;&gt; Right, in a way, intuitive thinking.\n\n383\n00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:33.457\n&gt;&gt; Ask it once, and if I ask it once.\n\n384\n00:16:33.457 --> 00:16:36.424\nIt asked me the one time, I type in Fuego,\nand then it puts Fuego in for all of them,\n\n385\n00:16:36.424 --> 00:16:38.120\nthat's, to me,\nthe way you should use this.\n\n386\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.644\n&gt;&gt; I can see your point,\nand I think I agree.\n\n387\n00:16:42.644 --> 00:16:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, [LAUGH], so that way,\n\n388\n00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:50.770\nyou know you have to do this,\nthis is where, do I want to?\n\n389\n00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.126\nSorry, I don't want to save the changes,\nbecause that's the letters,\n\n390\n00:16:53.126 --> 00:16:54.733\nthat was my finish merge,\nokay, so I close that.\n\n391\n00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:59.289\nSo here, the thing is, I can't really,\nat least I don't know how to edit\n\n392\n00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:03.719\nthe whole ask once, that check box,\nit's only in that one dialog box.\n\n393\n00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:08.599\nSo you have to know what it does and\ncheck it before you put the stuff in.\n\n394\n00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:12.060\nSo for us, what we're going to do is,\nI'm going to turn the fields on,\n\n395\n00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.624\nI'm going to delete all of that and\njust start over.\n\n396\n00:17:14.624 --> 00:17:16.094\nBecause you saw,\nit was pretty simple, right?\n\n397\n00:17:16.094 --> 00:17:18.441\nIt's just one dialog box,\nyou go ahead and put it in.\n\n398\n00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:22.597\nSo, and let's go ahead and get it right\nin front of the cursor or the apostrophe.\n\n399\n00:17:22.597 --> 00:17:27.306\nWe'll go back in, we'll say, fill in,\nand we'll type in a birthday, for\n\n400\n00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:30.559\nlack of me trying to type in,\nwho's birthday is it?\n\n401\n00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:31.245\n&gt;&gt; Mine.\n\n402\n00:17:31.245 --> 00:17:32.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:17:32.581 --> 00:17:35.915\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll have a special hat,\n\n404\n00:17:35.915 --> 00:17:41.036\nwe will ask once,\nbecause that's important, good.\n\n405\n00:17:41.036 --> 00:17:45.694\nAnd then it's asking me this time,\ndon't worry, we'll click OK, because,\n\n406\n00:17:45.694 --> 00:17:49.199\nremember, it's when we perform the merge-\n&gt;&gt; When the merge happens.\n\n407\n00:17:49.199 --> 00:17:49.838\n&gt;&gt; That this really happens.\n\n408\n00:17:49.838 --> 00:17:50.464\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n409\n00:17:50.464 --> 00:17:52.423\n&gt;&gt; So I'm going to turn off the fields,\nall right?\n\n410\n00:17:52.423 --> 00:17:54.743\nWe're going to do the same thing here,\njust for fun.\n\n411\n00:17:54.743 --> 00:17:59.032\nWe can have multiple ones, and this is\nwhere we will have our catnip cake, or\n\n412\n00:17:59.032 --> 00:18:01.189\nwhatever the dessert of the month is.\n\n413\n00:18:01.189 --> 00:18:01.784\n&gt;&gt;

You did, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, [LAUGH],\n\n418\n00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:20.591\nthat's that whole like, gosh,\nI don't want to have to redo this.\n\n419\n00:18:20.591 --> 00:18:23.843\nYep, there's something yummy,\nall right, let me go ahead and\n\n420\n00:18:23.843 --> 00:18:26.326\nget rid of all these extra spaces,\njust for fun.\n\n421\n00:18:26.326 --> 00:18:31.604\n&gt;&gt; And there we go, get that extra space,\nperfect, and we will save the changes.\n\n422\n00:18:31.604 --> 00:18:33.294\nI'm just going to click the Save button.\n\n423\n00:18:33.294 --> 00:18:37.221\nAnd then we will finish the merge,\nwe'll just do ten this time,\n\n424\n00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:40.882\nit doesn't matter because it's\nonly going to ask me once.\n\n425\n00:18:40.882 --> 00:18:42.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n426\n00:18:42.578 --> 00:18:43.744\n&gt;&gt; Okay, who's birthday is it?\n\n427\n00:18:43.744 --> 00:18:44.863\nIt's Bishop, all right.\n\n428\n00:18:44.863 --> 00:18:49.347\nAnd don't hit Enter after this one, cuz it\nwill add an extra Enter into the response.\n\n429\n00:18:49.347 --> 00:18:52.474\nSo that's the only reason why I\nwould say don't hit Enter, click OK,\n\n430\n00:18:52.474 --> 00:18:53.482\nwhat's the dessert?\n\n431\n00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:58.325\nWe're gonna say catnip cake,\nand that sounds gross.\n\n432\n00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:00.726\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then, there you go, so\n\n433\n00:19:00.726 --> 00:19:04.506\nnow you can see, it's Bishop's birthday,\nI took out the bold on that, and then,\n\n434\n00:19:04.506 --> 00:19:05.163\nthere you go.\n\n435\n00:19:05.163 --> 00:19:09.843\nNext one, Bishop catnip, Bishop catnip,\nokay, there you go, now,\n\n436\n00:19:09.843 --> 00:19:13.361\nI think that's kind of a cool\nexample in how to use it.\n\n437\n00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:16.727\nThe ask once, you have to do it on\nthe merge, the finisher merge, so\n\n438\n00:19:16.727 --> 00:19:19.110\nit does not prompt you\nwhen you open up the file.\n\n439\n00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.998\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool,\n\n440\n00:19:20.998 --> 00:19:25.127\nthis is my finished file, so\nI'm going to not save the changes.\n\n441\n00:19:25.127 --> 00:19:29.085\nSo now the ask,\nit's not too terribly difficult,\n\n442\n00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:33.505\nunderstanding that you can't\nforget the ref field, and\n\n443\n00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:36.742\nI keep forgetting to put the ref field in.\n\n444\n00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.459\n&gt;&gt; Stinkin' ref field,\ngets you every time.\n\n445\n00:19:38.459 --> 00:19:39.790\n&gt;&gt; I know!\nAnd so it's like, yeah,\n\n446\n00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.226\nI'm done with the ask, nope,\nyou've got to make that connection,\n\n447\n00:19:42.226 --> 00:19:43.454\nyou've got to say where to put it.\n\n448\n00:19:43.454 --> 00:19:47.320\nHere's the question,\nthis is where I want the answer to go.\n\n449\n00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.763\nSo I could actually put the ask\nat the top, that doesn't matter,\n\n450\n00:19:50.763 --> 00:19:53.212\nthey don't have to be in\nline with each other.\n\n451\n00:19:53.212 --> 00:19:56.143\nI'm doing this just for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n452\n00:19:56.143 --> 00:19:59.045\nPlease wear something, and\nI want the color, cursor,\n\n453\n00:19:59.045 --> 00:20:02.214\nI want to go, I'll put an extra\ncouple spaces just to see it.\n\n454\n00:20:02.214 --> 00:20:06.618\nAnd we will go up to rules and ask.\n\n455\n00:20:06.618 --> 00:20:08.543\nYou have to give it a bookmark.\n\n456\n00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:15.441\nNow from what I know about bookmarks,\nin regular world land, no spaces.\n\n457\n00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:20.173\nNo special characters, so I would keep\nit lowercase and if you wanted to space,\n\n458\n00:20:20.173 --> 00:20:21.386\nuse an underscore.\n\n459\n00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.752\nSo I'm going to type in colors,\n\n460\n00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:28.670\nI'm naming this particular ask field or\nask question a bookmark.\n\n461\n00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.278\nThen I give it a prompt, and\nI'm going to say, theme color, right?\n\n462\n00:20:33.278 --> 00:20:37.104\nThis is for me,\nto what the prompt is going to ask me.\n\n463\n00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:41.058\nI will definitely ask once,\nbecause we know that's important.\n\n464\n00:20:41.058 --> 00:20:45.732\nAnd the text will be something festive,\njust in case we don't have\n\n465\n00:20:45.732 --> 00:20:50.413\na particular theme, and\nthere's no color or anything like that.\n\n466\n00:20:50.413 --> 00:20:53.494\nNotice I'm not capitalizing it.\n\n467\n00:20:53.494 --> 00:20:56.775\nWait, actually, wait,\nplease wear something, you know what?\n\n468\n00:20:56.775 --> 00:21:01.014\nLet's take out the extra something\nin there, festive, okay, [LAUGH].\n\n469\n00:21:01.014 --> 00:21:03.463\nSo I have to make sure\nit makes logical sense.\n\n470\n00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:06.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Of how it's being read.\n\n471\n00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:11.946\nWe click OK, and it's asking me now,\nI'm just going to use festive,\n\n472\n00:21:11.946 --> 00:21:16.022\nand then you click OK, and\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n473\n00:21:16.022 --> 00:21:18.522\nAgain, you're like, it didn't work,\nwhy didn't it work?\n\n474\n00:21:18.522 --> 00:21:22.213\n&gt;&gt; Because it's dumb,\n[LAUGH], I don't know.\n\n475\n00:21:22.213 --> 00:21:23.236\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What's the other part?\n\n476\n00:21:23.236 --> 00:21:24.515\nThe ask, and then the?\n\n477\n00:21:24.515 --> 00:21:25.985\n&gt;&gt; The ref, right.\n\n478\n00:21:25.985 --> 00:21:26.792\nYou need the ref.\n\n479\n00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:27.588\n&gt;&gt; Got to have the ref.\n\n480\n00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:28.779\n&gt;&gt; See, I told you,\nrefs get you every time.\n\n481\n00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:30.489\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n482\n00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:31.139\n&gt;&gt; Called my shot.\n\n483\n00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:34.983\n&gt;&gt; They denied us that last\ngoal to go to the Stanley Cup.\n\n484\n00:21:34.983 --> 00:21:37.538\nI'm sure there was some year that,\nokay, so now-\n\n485\n00:21:37.538 --> 00:21:38.341\n&gt;&gt; Bring back the goons, [LAUGH].\n\n486\n00:21:38.341 --> 00:21:43.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I turned on the field codes,\nso just to see it, it's asking the color.\n\n487\n00:21:43.499 --> 00:21:47.774\nIt's putting in festive, but\nI've got to get that connection, so\n\n488\n00:21:47.774 --> 00:21:51.752\nwe're going to come on over here,\nto your Fields, all right.\n\n489\n00:21:51.752 --> 00:21:56.426\nSo that's where, knowing Word,\nit's in a different place,\n\n490\n00:21:56.426 --> 00:21:59.345\nit has nothing to do with the mailings.\n\n491\n00:21:59.345 --> 00:22:03.117\nIt's Fields in general,\njust like a regular field.\n\n492\n00:22:03.117 --> 00:22:04.521\nWe go to Insert, and\n\n493\n00:22:04.521 --> 00:22:09.158\nover here is this button right here,\nit is part of the quick parts.\n\n494\n00:22:09.158 --> 00:22:12.695\nWe talked about this in\nthe Word Expert series, I believe,\n\n495\n00:22:12.695 --> 00:22:16.248\nwhere we do cover letters,\nand your document properties.\n\n496\n00:22:16.248 --> 00:22:19.515\nYour document properties are fields, and\nyou can actually bring those fields and\n\n497\n00:22:19.515 --> 00:22:20.612\nput it into your document.\n\n498\n00:22:20.612 --> 00:22:23.430\nAnd that's what your cover\nletter's actually pulling from.\n\n499\n00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:26.682\nIf you haven't seen that,\nit's a pretty cool episode,\n\n500\n00:22:26.682 --> 00:22:30.497\nit does get into a little bit more\ncoding stuff, if you want to say.\n\n501\n00:22:30.497 --> 00:22:33.911\nWe're going to go with a field, and you're\nlike, well, I don't know which one it is,\n\n502\n00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:35.586\nwell, I told you, it's the ref, [LAUGH].\n\n503\n00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:36.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n504\n00:22:36.487 --> 00:22:39.346\ndon't worry about all the rest of this,\nokay?\n\n505\n00:22:39.346 --> 00:22:42.177\nBut notice, as soon as you choose ref,\nwhat does it ask you?\n\n506\n00:22:42.177 --> 00:22:46.908\nWell, you need to associate this\nwith a particular bookmark.\n\n507\n00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:49.724\nThat's why in that ask,\nit said, give it a bookmark-\n\n508\n00:22:49.724 --> 00:22:50.253\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n509\n00:22:50.253 --> 00:22:52.120\n&gt;&gt; And so that's that connector.\n\n510\n00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.890\nSo it's kind of nice that\nit's forcing you to do this.\n\n511\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.627\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n512\n00:22:54.627 --> 00:22:57.571\n&gt;&gt; You click Color, and\nthen you say, yeah, I'm good,\n\n513\n00:22:57.571 --> 00:22:59.506\nwe don't need to format anything.\n\n514\n00:22:59.506 --> 00:23:03.572\nThere's a lot of other things that\nI'm just going to go ahead and\n\n515\n00:23:03.572 --> 00:23:06.827\ngloss over because it gets\nway more than we need to.\n\n516\n00:23:06.827 --> 00:23:12.960\nSo we'll just click OK, and then notice\nright down here, we've got the connection,\n\n517\n00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.172\nhere's the ask color, ref color,\nso here's the prompt.\n\n518\n00:23:17.172 --> 00:23:20.612\nThat's what's just going to be inserted,\nso that sounds great.\n\n519\n00:23:20.612 --> 00:23:24.670\nTurn this off, and just for fun,\nlet's go ahead and select this,\n\n520\n00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.601\noops, come on, let's go ahead and\nselect this field, there.\n\n521\n00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:29.358\n&gt;&gt; Like a champ.\n\n522\n00:23:29.358 --> 00:23:35.285\n&gt;&gt; I did a control B for bold,\njust so we can see it in the result.\n\n523\n00:23:35.285 --> 00:23:38.531\nWe know that this only happens\nwhen we finish the merge, so\n\n524\n00:23:38.531 --> 00:23:41.396\nwe will edit the individual,\nwe're going crazy.\n\n525\n00:23:41.396 --> 00:23:44.417\nWe're doing it all, because we know\nit's not going to prompt us for\n\n526\n00:23:44.417 --> 00:23:45.269\nevery single one.\n\n527\n00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:49.717\nSo, here we go, so, think about it, you've\nsaved this, ready to go, you go ahead.\n\n528\n00:23:49.717 --> 00:23:51.108\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, and\nthat's only when you perform the merge,\n\n556\n00:24:56.482 --> 00:24:59.507\nit's not when you open the file,\nthat's when the prompts happen.\n\n557\n00:24:59.507 --> 00:25:01.380\nCheck that box off for only ask once,\n\n558\n00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.076\nat least in my opinion, I think it's\ngoing to be the easiest way to do it.\n\n559\n00:25:05.076 --> 00:25:07.238\nI don't want it to prompt me for\nevery single one,\n\n560\n00:25:07.238 --> 00:25:08.638\nI have other ways of doing that.\n\n561\n00:25:08.638 --> 00:25:09.185\n&gt;&gt;
