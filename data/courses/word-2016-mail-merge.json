Word\n2016 Mail Merge series.\n\n4\n00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.749\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n5\n00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.366\nAnd in this course overview,\n\n6\n00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:18.690\nwe're gonna be going over exactly\nwhat is in this particular series.\n\n7\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.450\nWhat is the target audience, or I guess I\nshould say who is the target audience for\n\n8\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.150\nthis show?\n\n9\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.950\nAny prerequisites that we\nneed to know about and\n\n10\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.544\nany extra tidbits that I might have for\nyou.\n\n11\n00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:33.310\nSo in this particular show,\nwe're going to be covering mail merge.\n\n12\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.793\nThis is a deep dive into\nthis particular concept and\n\n13\n00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:42.139\nfunction inward that is very popular and\nvery powerful to be able to automate,\n\n14\n00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:46.759\ncreating things like letters and\nlabels and envelopes and emails.\n\n15\n00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.965\nSo we're going to spend some time and\n\n16\n00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.965\nreally get into\nthe nitty-gritty of mail merge.\n\n17\n00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:58.640\nThese are episodes that are present\nin the Word 2016 advanced series.\n\n18\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.550\nSo if you're like, hm,\nI've seen these before, you are correct.\n\n19\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.170\nBut this is where we really\nexplain our data sources,\n\n20\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.583\nlike getting into our file types and\n\n21\n00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:13.500\nunderstanding those data connections\nin a really very specific sense.\n\n22\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.920\nSo you have a very good understanding, and\n\n23\n00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.800\nyou will be very confident in\nhow to perform mail merges.\n\n24\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.400\nBut we do start as an introduction,\nkinda going down the list and up and\n\n25\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.100\nback around.\n\n26\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.616\nBut really there's only one topic,\nit's mail merge, and\n\n27\n00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:31.062\nwe're gonna be covering all\nthe different facets of itm,\n\n28\n00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:35.443\nincluding some kind of fun stuff that\nyou can do with some rules at the end.\n\n29\n00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:38.022\nSo who should be watching this series?\n\n30\n00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:42.480\nAnybody that wants to understand\nmail merge and its entirety,\n\n31\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.853\nso I would say Word and Office users,\nOffice with a capital O,\n\n32\n00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:49.559\nmeaning that it is for Office 365.\n\n33\n00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:54.696\nWe will be working within that\nparticular account, so you will need to\n\n34\n00:01:54.696 --> 00:02:00.196\nhave access to other products within\nthis suite such as Excel and Outlook.\n\n35\n00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:01.106\nAnd like I said,\n\n36\n00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:05.710\nthis will be a deep dive into this\nparticular functionality of Word.\n\n37\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.590\nAnd talking about those other software\ncomponents that you're going to need,\n\n38\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.690\nyou will need to have a foundational\nknowledge of Word 2016 and\n\n39\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.610\nExcel and Outlook,\n\n40\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.100\nbecause we’re going to be using those\nparticular programs within this series.\n\n41\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.437\nAnd I just realized I have a big\ntypo here in this particular slide,\n\n42\n00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:28.830\nis that I have a Mac OS basics.\n\n43\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.380\nLet's go ahead and clarify this.\n\n44\n00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.630\nThis is PC, this is for\nWindows operating system.\n\n45\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.850\nThis is not for a Mac operating system.\n\n46\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.650\nSo I do apologize about that.\n\n47\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.470\nYou can tell I do it for both platforms,\nand I forgot to go ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.801\nproofread my slides.\n\n49\n00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:43.900\nSo, hey, you know what?\n\n50\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.185\nWe'll turn this into a teachable\nmoment to always look at those things.\n\n51\n00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:50.505\nDouble-check your work before\nyou record a video on it.\n\n52\n00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:53.928\nBut we will need to understand\nhow to format text,\n\n53\n00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:58.982\na little bit of information about\ngraphical elements, page layouts, so\n\n54\n00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:04.635\nthose things, it is going to have\nsome assumed knowledge in this show.\n\n55\n00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:07.218\nYou also gonna need a little bit\nof experience working with Excel,\n\n56\n00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:09.080\nlike how to enter in data?\n\n57\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.630\nUnderstandings and file formats, which we\ndo talk about in our data sources like our\n\n58\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.870\nCSV file format and our text delimited or\ntab delimited text files that you\n\n59\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.930\ncan use as export file formats\nfrom an Excel starting point.\n\n60\n00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.980\nAlso some very fundamental concepts about\nusing database programs such as Access,\n\n61\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.620\nwe won't get very deep into it but\nwe will explain it.\n\n62\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.470\nThen understanding how to use Outlook.\n\n63\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.270\nThat there are things\ncalled contacts in Outlook,\n\n64\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.430\nthat you understand some basic\nemailing concepts of your inbox and\n\n65\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.870\nyour sent mail and\nmaybe a little bit about servers.\n\n66\n00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.169\nWe of course have shows on all\nof these particular pieces of\n\n67\n00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.197\nsoftware in its entirety.\n\n68\n00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:54.137\nSo definitely check out our library and\n\n69\n00:03:54.137 --> 00:03:58.212\nsee about working with those particular\nprograms before you get into mail merge.\n\n70\n00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:02.973\nSo a little bit of foundational\nassumed knowledge going on there.\n\n71\n00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:04.684\nWe do have exercise files and\n\n72\n00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:09.820\nepisode notes associated with every single\nepisode within this particular series,\n\n73\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.256\nthey are attached to them,\nso definitely look for that.\n\n74\n00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:15.917\nAll of the files are available\nin one folder or\n\n75\n00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:20.500\none zip folder here in this overview,\nso definitely check that out.\n\n76\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.900\nAnd if anything's missing or something\nnot right, just contact us, let us know.\n\n77\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.400\nI need to make sure that I've got\nthe right files associated with the right\n\n78\n00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.230\nepisodes, so let us know if you\nfind anything slightly awry.\n\n79\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.281\nOn that same note with\nthis particular series,\n\n80\n00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:40.631\nin the exercise files, you're going\nto get warnings on pretty much\n\n81\n00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:45.363\nall of the files that are associated\nwith this particular show because I am\n\n82\n00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:49.523\nmaking database connections to\nfiles as like a starting point.\n\n83\n00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:54.218\nSo you’re going to get a warning that’s\nsaying that the link is broken because\n\n84\n00:04:54.218 --> 00:04:59.110\nthat link is still trying to find it\non my desktop here on my computer.\n\n85\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.500\nWhen you open it up, it can't find that,\nso it's going to give you those warnings.\n\n86\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.630\nAnd it'll probably say something about\nenable editing because it's going to\n\n87\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.070\nthe Internet, and that's really with all\nof our exercise files for the most part.\n\n88\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.040\nSo I wanted to put this into the overview\nto let you know that this will happen.\n\n89\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.230\nSo you will need to relink the data source\nconnection to that particular file,\n\n90\n00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.890\nlike I don't know what\nyou're talking about.\n\n91\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.730\nDefinitely checkout our episode\nthat is called Data Sources,\n\n92\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.320\nand the one episode is the Existing Lists.\n\n93\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.210\nAnd there's two other\nepisodes that are for\n\n94\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.260\ntroubleshooting where we talked\nspecifically about missing data sources\n\n95\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.530\nand how to reestablish\nthat data connection.\n\n96\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.590\nSo check those out if\nyou need a little bit\n\n97\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.080\nmore information about it\nbefore getting started.\n\n98\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.600\nAnd then lastly,\nlike I said before, go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.158\nreview our other courses in our\nlibrary on Excel and Word and Outlook.\n\n100\n00:05:53.158 --> 00:05:56.710\nCheck them out, check all of\nthem out while you're there, and\n\n101\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.355\njust go ahead and update yourself\non some of those basic concepts,\n\n102\n00:06:00.355 --> 00:06:04.820\n[LAUGH]\nthere's always other options.\n\n103\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.151\nOkay, I present one way.\n\n104\n00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:09.029\nIn mail merge it's maybe\na little bit more limited, but\n\n105\n00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:13.730\nthere's always another way that you can\ndo things in any Microsoft products.\n\n106\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.985\nUpdates do happen.\n\n107\n00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:19.586\nSo if you are watching a version of Word\nthat might have like an extra button that\n\n108\n00:06:19.586 --> 00:06:22.305\nmy Word in this particular\nshow does not have,\n\n109\n00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:25.721\nit could be because there was\na Office 365 updates, and\n\n110\n00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:31.570\nthey're always going ahead and adding on\nthose features and incremental updates.\n\n111\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.460\nYou can also go into your help menu and\n\n112\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.230\ncheck for updates to see if you\nhave any updates available for you.\n\n113\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.920\nSearching for the answers, right?\n\n114\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.241\nThe Internet is a great treasure\ntrove of information, so\n\n115\n00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.767\nthere's probably other ways to do things.\n\n116\n00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:49.016\nSo I definitely encourage\nyou to go out and search for\n\n117\n00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:51.900\nanswers that you might have\nabout particular topics.\n\n118\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.100\nEverybody has different reasons of\nwhy they use different products, so\n\n119\n00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.300\nthe examples that I'm giving\nare my own personal experience.\n\n120\n00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.831\nAnd hopefully you can be able to correlate\nthat into the way that you need to use\n\n121\n00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:06.805\nthis product, or maybe not use this\nparticular function because it\n\n122\n00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:10.451\nmaybe is not applicable to how\nyou do things in your workflow.\n\n123\n00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:12.925\nSo, biggest thing, have fun.\n\n124\n00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.277\nI like to have fun.\n\n125\n00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:15.385\nWe like to joke.\n\n126\n00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:19.647\nAnd just try to make learning about\nthis information fun because if you can\n\n127\n00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.703\nunderstand and learn the concepts,\nhopefully it'll make it a little\n\n128\n00:07:23.703 --> 00:07:27.710\nbit more fun in your daily life and\nit won't seem so daunting.\n\n129\n00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.670\nSo, I look forward to seeing\nyou in future episodes.\n\n130\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.295\n[SOUND]\n\n",
