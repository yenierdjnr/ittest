series.\n\n3\n00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:21.115\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and in this course\noverview, we're going to be talking about\n\n4\n00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:24.668\nwhat is in this particular course,\nwhat is our target audience?\n\n5\n00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:28.983\nI guess, I really should say\nwho is our target audience?\n\n6\n00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:31.987\nAnything we need to know\nbefore we get started and\n\n7\n00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:34.707\nany extra tidbits that I might have for\nyou.\n\n8\n00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:38.057\nSo this is really one topic,\nit's Mail Merge.\n\n9\n00:00:38.057 --> 00:00:41.657\nThis is a deep dive into\nthe very popular and\n\n10\n00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:46.260\nvery powerful function within\nWord is the Mail Merge.\n\n11\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.903\nNow if you are thinking mm-hm, why,\nI think I've seen some of this before in\n\n12\n00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:52.270\nthe Word Advanced series,\nwell you are correct.\n\n13\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.950\nWe have a couple episodes in\nthere to get you started.\n\n14\n00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.523\nBut in this series we're gonna really\ndive deep into the data sources.\n\n15\n00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:04.034\nWhat does it really mean to have that\ndata source and those connections.\n\n16\n00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:08.672\nAnd the different types of data\nconnections that you can make, whether\n\n17\n00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:13.787\nwe're using Excel or a CSV file or a TXT\nfile, maybe even like a FileMaker Pro.\n\n18\n00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:18.370\nSo we're gonna cover all of those\nin those particular episodes.\n\n19\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.347\nAnd once we get our data source then\nwe're gonna learn how to connect that or\n\n20\n00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:27.070\ncreate letters and labels,\nand envelopes and emails.\n\n21\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.310\nAnd along the way we'll be talking\nabout how we can add images into that.\n\n22\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.433\nSo really just kinda taking it\na slower look, a really concise and\n\n23\n00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:39.263\nextensive look at how we\ncan perform Mail Merge.\n\n24\n00:01:39.263 --> 00:01:44.637\nSo hope we get into a level of confidence\nwith this particular functionality.\n\n25\n00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:49.888\nFor you to be able to just blow right\nthrough it because once you do understand\n\n26\n00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:55.303\nthe concepts of it it can become very easy\nonce you understand why we think is and\n\n27\n00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:58.260\nwhy it's doing, what it's doing.\n\n28\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.723\nWe'll also be covering some rules that\nwork in Mail Merge, some if, then,\n\n29\n00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:06.378\nelse statements, and\nsome fill-in things, and some asks.\n\n30\n00:02:06.378 --> 00:02:10.510\nSo all sorts of really neat things\nthan can really help you take\n\n31\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.897\nyour Mail Merge to that next level.\n\n32\n00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:14.285\nSo who is this for?\n\n33\n00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:16.565\nAnybody that uses Word extensively or\n\n34\n00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:19.493\nreally just wants to know\nmore about mail merge.\n\n35\n00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:23.948\nThis is something that can really\nhelp you automate your task in,\n\n36\n00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:29.307\nyour role within an office setting or\nin your small business, or in anywhere.\n\n37\n00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:33.366\nAnd so Office users,\nthat's a capital O with Office 365.\n\n38\n00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.619\nSo we will be using that account and\n\n39\n00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:41.590\nall the different pieces\nwithin the Office 365.\n\n40\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.183\nSuite is not necessarily for\n\n41\n00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:46.509\nyou have to be an office person\nwithin a physical building.\n\n42\n00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.047\nYou can be in any field of study or\n\n43\n00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:54.210\nof work that just uses these\npieces of software to help you.\n\n44\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.697\nAnd like I said this is a deep dive into\nthis particular functionality of Word.\n\n45\n00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:05.235\nYes, it's that extensive that we can have\na whole series on just this one part.\n\n46\n00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.314\nSome things that you need to know\nabout before we get started.\n\n47\n00:03:07.314 --> 00:03:11.490\nYou need to have a basic understanding\nof how the operating system works within\n\n48\n00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.810\na Mac, what is your Finder,\nand how to move around it.\n\n49\n00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.237\nBut also a foundational knowledge of Word,\nExcel, and Outlook cuz we are going\n\n50\n00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:25.262\nto be covering and using these other\napplications when using Mail Merge.\n\n51\n00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:28.664\nSo understanding how to format text,\n\n52\n00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:34.100\nhow to format graphical elements\nwithin your document how.\n\n53\n00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.926\nAnd what and\nwhy do we use page layouts in Word.\n\n54\n00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:42.955\nAll of these can be found on\nother series just like the Excel,\n\n55\n00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:47.709\nthis is a show Excel but we will be\nusing that in this particular series.\n\n56\n00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.608\nAnd understanding the CSV file format and\nhow we can export things and\n\n57\n00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:56.175\nwe're just entering in\ndata in Excel in general.\n\n58\n00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:58.196\nAlso some basic inner concepts.\n\n59\n00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.876\nDo you know what the inbox is?\n\n60\n00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:00.978\nDo you know the out box is?\n\n61\n00:04:00.978 --> 00:04:02.135\nDo you know what sent mail is?\n\n62\n00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:05.574\nDo you know that you have\ncontacts within Outlook?\n\n63\n00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:09.816\nSo those are some of the things that we're\ngoing to be kind of covering around within\n\n64\n00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:10.554\nthis series.\n\n65\n00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:15.360\nSo having a base knowledge of some\nother products is really going to hel[.\n\n66\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.757\nFiles and Notes, we have exercise files\nthat accompany these episodes and\n\n67\n00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:24.107\nepisode notes so\ndefinitely check those out.\n\n68\n00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:27.822\nYou can find all of the files and\nthe notes that are for\n\n69\n00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:31.371\nthis entire series within\nthis course overview or\n\n70\n00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:36.037\nin individual episodes,\nyou should be able to find that button.\n\n71\n00:04:36.037 --> 00:04:39.719\nAnd if there's anything missing or\nsomething's not working just go ahead and\n\n72\n00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.793\nlet us know, go ahead and\nshoot us an email.\n\n73\n00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:44.997\nOr type in a help ticket, and let us know\nif something's missing so I know and\n\n74\n00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:46.164\nI can go ahead and fix that.\n\n75\n00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:49.655\nNow a little note about the files, is that\nwith this particular series we are going\n\n76\n00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:52.657\nto be making data connections from\na Word file to an Excel or a CSV file.\n\n77\n00:04:52.657 --> 00:04:55.327\nOr type in a help ticket and let us know\nif something's missing so I know and\n\n78\n00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:56.330\nI can go ahead and fix that.\n\n79\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.678\nNow a little note about the files, is that\nwith this particular series, we are going\n\n80\n00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:02.476\nto be making data connections from\na word file to an Excel or a CSV file.\n\n81\n00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:06.298\nAnd when you do that you're creating\na path to that particular file format.\n\n82\n00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:08.019\nIt's gonna remember it on my computer.\n\n83\n00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:14.277\nSo when you open it it's going to tell\nyou that the data file can't be found.\n\n84\n00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:18.670\nAnd that the link is broken and\nyou're going to need to relink it.\n\n85\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.681\nNow if you're not sure what I'm talking\nabout we do cover this in the letters\n\n86\n00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:25.766\nMail Merge episode where we\ntalk about changing sources.\n\n87\n00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:30.104\nAnd how to do things when\nyou have a missing source.\n\n88\n00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:33.847\nSo definitely check that episode out and\nto be able to relink.\n\n89\n00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:38.137\nAnd that's gonna happen pretty much in all\nof your files that I already have a data\n\n90\n00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.347\nsource established.\n\n91\n00:05:39.347 --> 00:05:42.019\nSo just wanted to give you\nthat little FYI on that one.\n\n92\n00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:45.846\nSome extras, yet\nwe do have other courses on Excel and\n\n93\n00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:50.366\nOutlook that are in this library so\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n94\n00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:52.276\nAnd Word Advanced or Word X, so\n\n95\n00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:55.615\nyou can kind of re-up on\nsome of that word knowledge.\n\n96\n00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:59.269\nThere's always other options in these\nproducts and everything in Microsoft, and\n\n97\n00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:00.324\ncomputers in general.\n\n98\n00:06:00.324 --> 00:06:03.550\nSo if there's other ways to do\nthings it probably does exist,\n\n99\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.357\nI just might not cover all of them.\n\n100\n00:06:05.357 --> 00:06:08.327\nYour updates those updates\nget me every time.\n\n101\n00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:12.218\nSo if you're seeing something in your\nparticular environment that is not\n\n102\n00:06:12.218 --> 00:06:15.982\nbeing displayed in mine, it might be\nthat you're on a higher version of\n\n103\n00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:19.890\nthe software than I'm on at this\nparticular point in the filming.\n\n104\n00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.169\nSo just make sure that\nyou understand that.\n\n105\n00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.072\nAnd you can always go into your help menu\nand check to see if you have updates to go\n\n106\n00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:27.337\nahead and get you to the latest and\ngreatest.\n\n107\n00:06:27.337 --> 00:06:32.340\nThat's kinda the beauty of\nhaving our Office 365 products.\n\n108\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.692\nThere's answers out there and\nyou can search for them.\n\n109\n00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:40.022\nAnd so I encourage you to do that and read\nup on more about these types of topics.\n\n110\n00:06:40.022 --> 00:06:44.865\nAnd different ways to do things, everybody\nuses these products for different reasons.\n\n111\n00:06:44.865 --> 00:06:48.540\nI'm going give you examples as to why\nI use them and examples of how I use\n\n112\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.355\nthe certain functionality of Mail Merge\nbut you might have some others.\n\n113\n00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:56.348\nSo try to correlate into your need and you\nmight not need to use every single piece\n\n114\n00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:58.683\nof this particular service and\nthat's okay.\n\n115\n00:06:58.683 --> 00:07:03.210\nOf course to me always having fun,\nI like to have fun this episodes.\n\n116\n00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.806\nWe like to joke and make things little\nlight and light and airy for you.\n\n117\n00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:10.409\nSo hopefully go ahead and get those\nconcepts across.So you can have fun\n\n118\n00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:14.386\nperforming Mail Merges and maybe it won't\nbe such a daunting task after this.\n\n119\n00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:17.356\nSo definitely have some fun,\nstick around and\n\n120\n00:07:17.356 --> 00:07:20.181\nI hope to see you in\nsome episodes very soon.\n\n121\n00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:25.261\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] Well, thank you for\n\n34\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.000\nsharing that information with us.\n\n35\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.950\nI don't even know what it actually means,\nwhat this term is.\n\n36\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.831\nMy guess would be some kind of merge or\nmarriage between the Word application,\n\n37\n00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:16.588\nand then integrating that\ninto some form of mail.\n\n38\n00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:19.910\nAre we talking about Outlook, or\nis it third party mail application?\n\n39\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.935\n&gt;&gt; You are really close, [LAUGH] okay,\n\n40\n00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:26.132\nI'm like, pretty good, and then,\noops, we took a tiny little detour.\n\n41\n00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:28.726\nCuz I think the word mail\nalways confuses people,\n\n42\n00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:32.145\nwhere they automatically think\nof emailing and stuff like that.\n\n43\n00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:36.353\nBut this is the example that I've used\nin the other show, or other episode.\n\n44\n00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:39.573\nSo have you ever gotten a piece of junk\nmail that you know it's not really\n\n45\n00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:42.569\naddressed only to you?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, especially like\n\n46\n00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.636\nthe Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coupons, I can't\neven tell you how many of those I have.\n\n47\n00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:49.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, and it will say dear,\n\n48\n00:02:49.663 --> 00:02:52.915\nand they have something-\n&gt;&gt; Our neighborhood resident, or\n\n49\n00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:55.810\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; You know they have your information\n\n50\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.242\nsomewhere in their database.\n\n51\n00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:01.275\nOkay, it's gonna be Cherokee Boose,\nthis is your address, this is your phone\n\n52\n00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:04.782\nnumber, all that kind of stuff, so\nthey have all that information.\n\n53\n00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:08.881\nThink about all the different\ncustomers they have.\n\n54\n00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:12.694\nSo they’ve got this extensive data source,\nand\n\n55\n00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:19.030\nthen they're merging those fields into\nthat particular postcard or whatever.\n\n56\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.590\nSo when it says, Dear Cherokee, there’s\nobviously something in there that says,\n\n57\n00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.380\nfirst name.\n\n58\n00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.420\nPull out that first name from\nthat database that we have,\n\n59\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.970\nand insert that person's name.\n\n60\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.083\nAnd then they might have one main\ndocument with the merge field,\n\n61\n00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:38.500\nand then what they do\nis they finish it out.\n\n62\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.466\nAnd they'll have hundreds of thousands\nof postcards that they then send out.\n\n63\n00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:48.226\nSo, yes, it is usually associated with\nmailing, per se, but we can use this for\n\n64\n00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:50.048\na whole bunch of other things.\n\n65\n00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:53.126\nWe could use them for name badges,\nright, we're having a party and\n\n66\n00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:54.964\nyou wanna go ahead and make name badges.\n\n67\n00:03:54.964 --> 00:03:58.561\nWell, you have a list of all of your\nattendees, well, I wanna go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:58.561 --> 00:03:59.730\njust spit them all out.\n\n69\n00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.960\nI don't wanna write them out,\neach one individually, no, that's no fun.\n\n70\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.000\nSo take your data source, merge it into\nyour Word application, and then it spits\n\n71\n00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.760\nout all the results, so it's pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n72\n00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.972\nwe're not quite at the database level yet,\nbut maybe something like Excel or CSV\n\n73\n00:04:14.972 --> 00:04:16.238\n&gt;&gt; The files or something.\n\n74\n00:04:16.238 --> 00:04:19.675\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes [LAUGH].\n\n75\n00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:21.318\n&gt;&gt; You're catching on, so\n\n76\n00:04:21.318 --> 00:04:26.260\nI actually have a diagram, if you\nwanna say, of explaining this process.\n\n77\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.270\nThis is just a Word file, and I'm just\nusing text boxes and everything like that,\n\n78\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.352\nso it's nothing super fancy.\n\n79\n00:04:32.352 --> 00:04:34.775\nBut that whole idea of, okay,\n\n80\n00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:37.840\nthere's a certain letter\nthat you're going to create.\n\n81\n00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.640\nAnd we're gonna give the example with\nletters, but we can create labels,\n\n82\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.210\nlike I said, the name badges.\n\n83\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.130\nYou can create mailing labels,\nlike the ones that go on the stickers.\n\n84\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.810\nYou could create envelopes, so what you\ncan actually produce is not just letters,\n\n85\n00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.760\nit's all different things in there.\n\n86\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.340\nSo you can see that you have something\nthat you have composed, and it's like\n\n87\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.250\ndear, and you would probably want\nthe person's first name and last name.\n\n88\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.980\nSo what you're gonna do is, you're\ngoing to make a merge document to where\n\n89\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.540\nyou're saying, hey, find this data\nsource that has this information,\n\n90\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.490\nthat database that we were talking about,\nin some type of tabular format.\n\n91\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.430\nIt's gonna need to be in rows and\ncolumns, rows and columns,\n\n92\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.870\nyou think about that in Excel, right?\n\n93\n00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.856\nAnd in Access, same idea, but they call\nthem fields, those would be the columns,\n\n94\n00:05:28.856 --> 00:05:31.220\nand then records, the amount of rows.\n\n95\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.020\nSo I'll probably be interchanging rows and\nrecords and columns and\n\n96\n00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.180\nfields a lot throughout this series, but\nthat's the whole idea that we've got here.\n\n97\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.230\nSo you can see in this data source, and\nlike you said, it could be an Excel file,\n\n98\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.350\nit could be a CSV,\nit could be a FileMaker Pro.\n\n99\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.000\nI mean, all the different data sources,\n\n100\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.380\nwe'll talk about that\nin a specific episode.\n\n101\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.320\nSo it has to be somewhere,\nso you're marrying,\n\n102\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.610\nif you said, that data source,\nin with your Word document.\n\n103\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.470\nAnd then it's gonna pull, Word is gonna\nbe able to pull all of the fields.\n\n104\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.670\nAnd then you're going to then put\nin the field into your letter, and\n\n105\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.580\nso you're saying, pull this out.\n\n106\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.380\nAnd so what happens, your result right\nhere, is it's gonna go ahead and\n\n107\n00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.640\nsay, all right, well,\ntake the first name, that F_name.\n\n108\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.251\nAnd I use that F_name because it\ndoesn't have to be named first,\n\n109\n00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.230\nit doesn't have to say first name.\n\n110\n00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.640\nIt's whatever your data\nsource is labeled as for\n\n111\n00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.246\nthat particular column.\n&gt;&gt; As long as that relationship exists.\n\n112\n00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:36.329\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it will pull that,\n\n113\n00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:39.084\nbecause you'll tell Word,\nwhen you're gonna perform the mail merge,\n\n114\n00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:41.680\nyou're gonna say,\nselect this particular data source.\n\n115\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.830\nIt will find that data source,\n\n116\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.040\nit will always pull that\nfirst row as your heading.\n\n117\n00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.705\nSo that's another important\ntip that we'll definitely\n\n118\n00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:54.030\nre-emphasize there in the next episode,\nis you have to have headings.\n\n119\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.346\nYou have to have headings in your\nfields or columns to understand,\n\n120\n00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:01.050\nthis is that particular information.\n\n121\n00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.090\nFirst name versus address versus city\nversus state, those type of things.\n\n122\n00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.320\nAnd so you can see as a result,\nit's gonna say, there's Bishop, Timothy,\n\n123\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.140\nthat's that first record there.\n\n124\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.010\nThen the next record, Fuego Pants,\nso that's going to be the next one.\n\n125\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.950\nPumpkin Squash, so that's the third one,\nand it would keep on going.\n\n126\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.130\nFor as many of the records that\nyou have in your data source,\n\n127\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.590\nit's going to go ahead and spit out\nthat result, which is pretty cool.\n\n128\n00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.004\nSo you could see, I've done this for\nmy sister's wedding, right, she had-\n\n129\n00:07:32.004 --> 00:07:33.833\n&gt;&gt; That was my first thought, and then,\n\n130\n00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:35.376\nthe second thought was, well,\n\n131\n00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:38.080\nwe have one of our sales\nrepresentatives in chat today.\n\n132\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.510\nThank you for joining us, Meredith,\nand I thought this could be useful.\n\n133\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.823\nI leveraged this as a tool to go ahead and\nsend just updates and\n\n134\n00:07:45.823 --> 00:07:50.950\ninformation to customers.\n&gt;&gt; Everything, I mean, if you have a data\n\n135\n00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:57.319\nsource, you can then be able to send out\nthose, like you said, announcements.\n\n136\n00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:00.384\nOr, hey everybody,\nwhy don't you come to our webinar?\n\n137\n00:08:00.384 --> 00:08:01.652\nThat we're going to be putting on.\n\n138\n00:08:01.652 --> 00:08:04.727\nSo, you just go ahead and\nwrite it all out and it just spits it out.\n\n139\n00:08:04.727 --> 00:08:05.710\nIt's really, really powerful.\n\n140\n00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.090\nIt's awesome.\n\n141\n00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.770\nNow, one thing I wanted to kind\nof point out in this results.\n\n142\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.590\nI have it in three different boxes.\n\n143\n00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.510\nBut you're not making three files.\n\n144\n00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.040\nThis wouldn't become file one,\nfile two, file three.\n\n145\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.070\nWhat it does, it becomes pages\nwithin that finished document.\n\n146\n00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.890\nIt's really cool.\n\n147\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.120\nAnd I have some examples right here\nin Word that are all ready done.\n\n148\n00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.570\nAnd so, this is in the list that you\nhave access to all these files, so\n\n149\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.310\nyou can kinda get the idea\nof what's going on.\n\n150\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:44.290\nBut before I go there I did wanna go ahead\nand point out that while we're in Word,\n\n151\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.970\nin the environment.\n\n152\n00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.290\nWhere we go to perform mail merge,\nthere's a whole tab on the ribbon for\n\n153\n00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.045\nmailings, so that would be the,\nI would think the place to go.\n\n154\n00:08:54.045 --> 00:08:55.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, apparently,\n\n155\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.310\nI missed that tab.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.940\n&gt;&gt; That's okay,\n\n157\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.870\nI know what you.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n158\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.590\n&gt;&gt; So, you can see that they have all\n\n159\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.680\nthe buttons and things that we're\ngoing to be doing through out this\n\n160\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.270\nshows on how we're going to actually\nfinish these results and do everything.\n\n161\n00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.530\nRight now we're just\nintroducing the topic and\n\n162\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.160\nthe whole concept of\nwhat this going to be.\n\n163\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.320\nSo, I've got a data source right here.\n\n164\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.800\nSo, let's just look at this Excel.\n\n165\n00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.840\nI think it's the easiest way to\nstore information, personally.\n\n166\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.470\nBut it's again personal preference.\n\n167\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.180\nYou can see that I've got first, last,\nall of these different things in here.\n\n168\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.370\nRight, so this is an Excel file.\n\n169\n00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.190\nWhat I have down here,\nI got a lot of files open, so\n\n170\n00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.920\nlet me just go ahead and find this one.\n&gt;&gt; So, this is just a-\n\n171\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.390\n&gt;&gt; Just a regular Word document.\n\n172\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.180\nThere's no mail merge, or\nanything of merge feels going on here.\n\n173\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.370\nThis is just like my source document.\n\n174\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.330\nThe one that I wanted to start with.\n\n175\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.580\nAnd I've put my own internal\nnotes if you want to say.\n\n176\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.840\nLike I want the name to go here,\nI want the city to go here.\n\n177\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.540\nSo, I've written this out,\nand I named it, and\n\n178\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.720\nthis is my naming convention,\nmy start file.\n\n179\n00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.440\nThis is the letter that\nI want to begin with.\n\n180\n00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.820\nThen what I do, is I create a merged file.\n\n181\n00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.702\nNow, you can see Christmas Cats\nmail merge, merged.\n\n182\n00:10:13.702 --> 00:10:17.030\n[LAUGH] Again, my naming convention\nI have a start, I had a merge, and\n\n183\n00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.090\nI had a finish.\n\n184\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.750\nThat way I can understand, keep track\nof which ones going to be which.\n\n185\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.870\nMy start, my merge.\n\n186\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.960\nAnd we are finished, okay.\n\n187\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.980\nExactly what it means.\n\n188\n00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.510\nSo, you can see right here is that I\nhave back here on the mailing tab.\n\n189\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.470\nI have a data source connected.\n\n190\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:41.000\nI have connected this particular\nWord documents to this Excel sheet.\n\n191\n00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.380\nIs just establishing\nthat database connection.\n\n192\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.030\nI know in database isn't it,\n\n193\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.260\nODBC, open database connection?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n194\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.435\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n195\n00:10:50.435 --> 00:10:51.410\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] think about it for\n\n196\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.210\na second.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think we're going that far,\n\n197\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.420\nhonestly, I don't think\nit's actually doing that.\n\n198\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.630\n&gt;&gt; And I've never done this, but\n\n199\n00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.910\nyou can do it right\n\n200\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.500\nhere within these applications?\n\n201\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n202\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.680\nAgain, don't quote me that\nit's an actual ODBC [LAUGH],\n\n203\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.640\nbecause I know that gets very\ntechnical into database stuff,\n\n204\n00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.760\nbut there's a connection.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n205\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay, back to saying hey,\n\n206\n00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.760\nlink if you want to say to\nthat particular data source.\n\n207\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.590\nAnd, up here, notice, I have the fields.\n\n208\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.560\nDoesn't this look familiar,\nas the things across the top, right?\n\n209\n00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.000\nAll of these different columns, or fields,\n\n210\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.520\nthat are growing on that heading row,\nthey're being pulled into this, and\n\n211\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.320\nWord recognizes it, and is saying, okay,\nhere's all your fields that you can have.\n\n212\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.310\nAll right, cool.\n\n213\n00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:42.570\nSo, what I did is I wrote my letter as\nI went ahead and put in these fields.\n\n214\n00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.178\nNow, notice that they have\nthose little angle brackets.\n\n215\n00:11:46.178 --> 00:11:47.003\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n216\n00:11:47.003 --> 00:11:47.692\n&gt;&gt; Those\n\n217\n00:11:47.692 --> 00:11:49.410\nare called pilcrow?\n\n218\n00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.130\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; A pilcrow.\n\n219\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.490\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n220\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n221\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.550\n&gt;&gt; I always, well,\n\n222\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.950\nI don't really use those per say,\nbut in scripting,\n\n223\n00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.470\nI just have the less than and\ngreater than symbol,\n\n224\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.210\nand I always call them carrots.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n225\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.880\n&gt;&gt; But I don't think that's the technical\n\n226\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.750\nterm [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Actually, you know, I'm wrong.\n\n227\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.430\nThat's not a pill crow, but it's,\nokay, you know that paragraph signs?\n\n228\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.080\nHere, we'll get there, I promise.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n229\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:12.580\n&gt;&gt; You know this,\n\n230\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.920\nlike the paragraph signs?\n&gt;&gt; Let me look.\n\n231\n00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.470\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; You see that\n\n232\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.210\nthere?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n233\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.580\n&gt;&gt; That's actually called a Pilcrow,\n\n234\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.740\nso all of these,\nwhere we have our show and hides,\n\n235\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.100\nwhere we have like every\nchange in paragraph,\n\n236\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.730\nI call it like the paragraph button, or\nthe backwards P, it's called a Pilcrow.\n\n237\n00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.060\nDid you know that?\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know that.\n\n238\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.050\nWe'll have to look at the origin later,\ncuz I'm not really sure what that would\n\n239\n00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.740\nmake sense with, but okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I confused myself,\n\n240\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.710\nbecause what those little, these guys,\nI'm kinda making a tangent right now,\n\n241\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.210\nthose little angled brackets, the double\nangled brackets, that's how I got to it.\n\n242\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.513\nIt's actually called a.\n&gt;&gt; Well, now I know.\n\n243\n00:12:49.513 --> 00:12:52.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's angled quotes, right there,\n\n244\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.060\nthat's what they look like.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n245\n00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.800\n&gt;&gt; No way.\n\n246\n00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.750\nSo, there's an actual, I always\ncalled them double angled quotes, or\n\n247\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.111\ndouble angled, Gator mouths.\n\n248\n00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.080\n&gt;&gt; You know, they have a real name.\n\n250\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.510\nAnd that paragraph, it has a real name.\n\n251\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.360\nIt's a pilcrow.\n\n252\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.498\nSo, now you've got some\ntrivia knowledge right there.\n\n253\n00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:14.416\nYou know what those are called for\nreal?, so, anyways.\n\n254\n00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:15.697\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm just trying to think,\n\n255\n00:13:15.697 --> 00:13:16.337\nwhere would be,\n\n256\n00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:19.750\nlike that would be appropriate, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and people would just be\n\n257\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:25.820\nlike, I don't know don't talk to her.\n&gt;&gt; This is a technical show,\n\n258\n00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.963\nso.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n259\n00:13:26.963 --> 00:13:31.548\nI always never use the technical\nterminology [LAUGH], but\n\n260\n00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:37.869\nI wanted to let you all know that those\nare actual words that do mean something.\n\n261\n00:13:37.869 --> 00:13:40.232\nAnd we see them day in and\nday out in Word, so\n\n262\n00:13:40.232 --> 00:13:43.010\nI wanted to give you their\ntextbook definitions.\n\n263\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.870\nBut back to the double gator mouth.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n264\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.150\n&gt;&gt; That's what's indicating your\n\n265\n00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.070\nfield right there.\n\n266\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.130\nAnd notice, when I click on it,\nit's also gray, so\n\n267\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.100\nthat's, again, it's not just the word.\n\n268\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.150\nI didn't type in, angle,\nangle, birth, angle, angle.\n\n269\n00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.940\nI inserted it from here.\n\n270\n00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.300\nI said, insert this field.\n\n271\n00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.610\nThen insert this field.\n\n272\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.340\nDown here, insert this city.\n\n273\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.120\nSo, this is my merged document.\n\n274\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.040\nNow, notice down here,\nit's kind of small, but\n\n275\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.640\nit's just saying that this is one page.\n\n276\n00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.190\nI have page one of one.\n\n277\n00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.420\nWhen I start a mail merge,\nyou go through this preview.\n\n278\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.420\nNow, when I click this preview button up\nhere, notice that it now changed from\n\n279\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.430\nfirst, last, and city,\nto Bishop, Timothy, Gainesville.\n\n280\n00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.180\nAnd if I click up here,\nnotice I have multiple records.\n\n281\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:37.060\nThere's Mr Fuego Pants, and Mr Pumpkin\nSquash, and Puma Princess, and Sasha Cat.\n\n282\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.420\nTootsie paws and, my gosh,\nI'm gonna start crying,\n\n283\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.604\ncuz these are all my old cats.\n\n284\n00:14:40.604 --> 00:14:41.624\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Aww.\n\n285\n00:14:41.624 --> 00:14:44.790\n&gt;&gt; That since passed, but that's okay.\n\n286\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.380\nZinger was my cat when\nI was in middle school.\n\n287\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.710\n&gt;&gt; So, Vonne, how do we get those\n\n288\n00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.110\nrelationships established?\n\n289\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.670\nHow do you get that linkage there?\n&gt;&gt; Great question, it's right here.\n\n290\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:58.367\nWhen I have this document,\nI need to select the recipients.\n\n291\n00:14:58.367 --> 00:15:00.948\nAnd that's where we talked about those\ndifferent types of mail merge, or\n\n292\n00:15:00.948 --> 00:15:02.660\nthe different type of data sources.\n\n293\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.900\nThat's where you basically\nmake this connection.\n\n294\n00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.920\nSo, you say you have your start document,\nthen you connect it into a data source,\n\n295\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.620\nthen that's when I usually do like the\nsave as and this is the merge document.\n\n296\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.260\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n297\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.910\n&gt;&gt; And so, that's all I have to do, and\n\n298\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.870\nthen it just knows to connect to it.\n\n299\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.330\nPulls the fields, and then it goes along.\n\n300\n00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.820\nAnd then, you write your letter,\nyou preview it to see what it looks like.\n\n301\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.150\nYou can turn the preview off and\ndo other types of editing.\n\n302\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.220\nAnd then, the biggest stuff that I think\npeople, cuz people, a lot of times,\n\n303\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.310\nthe information's out there,\n\n304\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.430\nbut this part is what throws\npeople off every single time.\n\n305\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.830\nRight now only one page.\n\n306\n00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.830\nRemember, back on that example,\nthe results,\n\n307\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.670\nI had three pages that I talked about.\n\n308\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:48.980\nWell, that's where doing your finished,\nit's this one right here.\n\n309\n00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.540\nThis is my finished document.\n\n310\n00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.960\nNotice down here,\nthere are 19 pages in here.\n\n311\n00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.573\nThis is the result of that merge.\n&gt;&gt; That's really cool Vonne.\n\n312\n00:15:59.573 --> 00:16:03.559\nSo, now instead of having 19 different\nfiles, we have 1 jumbo file.\n\n313\n00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:06.250\nSo, we could just print\nit on one fell swoop.\n\n314\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.563\nAnd just, I don't know, I'm guessing the\nultimate reason we'd want to do this would\n\n315\n00:16:10.563 --> 00:16:13.701\nbe for efficiency here in the workplace.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n316\n00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:14.714\n&gt;&gt; Or in your personal life,\n\n317\n00:16:14.714 --> 00:16:16.613\nif you're using them for\nweddings or whatever.\n\n318\n00:16:16.613 --> 00:16:17.222\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n319\n00:16:17.222 --> 00:16:21.138\nAnd this is something, like if you had\nsomeone else printing your document,\n\n320\n00:16:21.138 --> 00:16:23.197\nlike the actual results of everything.\n\n321\n00:16:23.197 --> 00:16:24.983\nI don't want to send somebody 19 files.\n\n322\n00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:29.399\nNow that I have 19, we're talking about,\nwhat if there's 19,000, or 1,900?\n\n323\n00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:33.693\nThat's where you don't want\nto have individual files,\n\n324\n00:16:33.693 --> 00:16:37.009\nit's all one file, and it creates a break.\n\n325\n00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:40.923\nActually, here, I have it down here,\nlet's come back down over to my computer,\n\n326\n00:16:40.923 --> 00:16:41.789\nsee right there?\n\n327\n00:16:41.789 --> 00:16:44.643\nIt creates a next page section break.\n\n328\n00:16:44.643 --> 00:16:47.517\nSo it found the one, and then it\ngoes right onto the next record, and\n\n329\n00:16:47.517 --> 00:16:50.003\nthen break, next record, and\nthen break, next record.\n\n330\n00:16:50.003 --> 00:16:53.145\nBecause you might have\nyour start document, or\n\n331\n00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:55.746\nthe one that you've had as your merge.\n\n332\n00:16:55.746 --> 00:16:59.402\nAnd by the way, I'm using command\ntilde to switch between open\n\n333\n00:16:59.402 --> 00:17:01.820\ndocuments within the Word application.\n\n334\n00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.014\nIn your merge, this is one page, but\nyou could have two pages in there.\n\n335\n00:17:06.014 --> 00:17:10.357\nYou could have to where you have\na letter that is two pages.\n\n336\n00:17:10.357 --> 00:17:10.886\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n337\n00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:12.438\n&gt;&gt; And you have your 19 recipients,\n\n338\n00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:15.747\nwell, then it's going to do your two\npages, break, then the next record,\n\n339\n00:17:15.747 --> 00:17:16.743\nthen the next record.\n\n340\n00:17:16.743 --> 00:17:20.757\nSo it doesn't have to be just\na single page to start and\n\n341\n00:17:20.757 --> 00:17:24.878\nhave your merge,\nit can be as many pages as it needs to.\n\n342\n00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:27.327\nAnd you can have merged\nfields all over the place.\n\n343\n00:17:27.327 --> 00:17:29.775\nWe're trying to make it a little\nbit simpler of an example.\n\n344\n00:17:29.775 --> 00:17:30.386\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n345\n00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:32.727\n&gt;&gt; But that's the idea of the finished\n\n346\n00:17:32.727 --> 00:17:38.361\nfile, having those sections adds to every\nchange in your record of your data source.\n\n347\n00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:40.934\nAnd it goes ahead and\ngives you this as your result.\n\n348\n00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:41.746\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n349\n00:17:41.746 --> 00:17:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, yeah, really, really neat.\n\n350\n00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.866\nBut back on that merged\nfile back over here, that,\n\n351\n00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:51.608\nthe command that everyone always\ngets lost on is this one.\n\n352\n00:17:51.608 --> 00:17:53.928\nWhere you have to take\nyour merged document,\n\n353\n00:17:53.928 --> 00:17:57.483\nwhere you have all of your fields and\nyou've composed your letters.\n\n354\n00:17:57.483 --> 00:18:00.096\nAnd you need to edit\nthe individual document.\n\n355\n00:18:00.096 --> 00:18:02.610\nThat's what's going to go ahead and\n\n356\n00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.840\ncreate that separate file with\nthe different pages in there.\n\n357\n00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.612\nNow, you could, if you wanted to,\ngo straight to printing.\n\n358\n00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:12.913\nBut that's like, okay, I've connected\nto printer, it's just going to go.\n\n359\n00:18:12.913 --> 00:18:16.732\nBut I don't,\nyou don't have to have a finished file,\n\n360\n00:18:16.732 --> 00:18:19.556\nbut I think it's the best way to go.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n361\n00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:24.741\nI just to make sure I'm totally\nunderstanding this, once I edit that file,\n\n362\n00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:27.100\nwill it be a separate file?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n363\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.591\n&gt;&gt; So, like, hey, I want to go ahead and\n\n364\n00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:30.376\nchange the date for\nthis particular person.\n\n365\n00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:34.110\nMaybe they have a private showing of\nmy new art exhibit, or whatever, and\n\n366\n00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:38.183\nthen I'll have a separate document.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or maybe in your data source,\n\n367\n00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:42.054\nlike Puma Princess, like that's\nher name that you have in there.\n\n368\n00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:45.990\nBut you realize it's actually Puma Queen,\nor whatever.\n\n369\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.700\nAnd so you didn't really necessarily\nchange in the data source,\n\n370\n00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.593\nlike the Excel file.\n\n371\n00:18:49.593 --> 00:18:53.146\nBut you could come back over\nto your finished document and\n\n372\n00:18:53.146 --> 00:18:54.637\nthen make an edit here.\n\n373\n00:18:54.637 --> 00:18:59.624\nOr maybe pumpkin squash, just this one,\nyou needed to add in an extra line\n\n374\n00:18:59.624 --> 00:19:01.447\nof information.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n375\n00:19:01.447 --> 00:19:02.383\n&gt;&gt; Just for pumpkin.\n\n376\n00:19:02.383 --> 00:19:04.353\n&gt;&gt; What if you wanted to keep it in line,\n\n377\n00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:06.189\nis that an option?\n&gt;&gt; As in?\n\n378\n00:19:06.189 --> 00:19:07.698\n&gt;&gt; As one big document, or\n\n379\n00:19:07.698 --> 00:19:11.937\ndoes it always pull it off to the side and\nsave it as a separate file?\n\n380\n00:19:11.937 --> 00:19:14.771\nWhen you do the edit and\nedit individual results,\n\n381\n00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:17.244\nit will always produce a separate file.\n\n382\n00:19:17.244 --> 00:19:19.465\nYou're saying, the merge and\nthen the finish all together?\n\n383\n00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:21.142\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, just to make sure,\n\n384\n00:19:21.142 --> 00:19:25.593\nbecause if I'm thinking, hey, I only have\na few changes, it's probably best to\n\n385\n00:19:25.593 --> 00:19:28.479\nchange the original source.\n&gt;&gt; It depends.\n\n386\n00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:30.276\n&gt;&gt; Plan for having two separate or\n\n387\n00:19:30.276 --> 00:19:32.072\nmultiple files.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n388\n00:19:32.072 --> 00:19:36.340\nthat's actually a really good point,\nof like, where do I want to do my editing?\n\n389\n00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.599\nDo I want to go back and edit the source\ndata, like the actual Excel file and\n\n390\n00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:42.815\nmake sure I change everything there?\n\n391\n00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:48.477\nBecause this document is gonna,\nthe merge one, if I update my data source.\n\n392\n00:19:48.477 --> 00:19:51.312\nIf I add more records, it's just\ngoing to keep pulling from there.\n\n393\n00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:51.839\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n394\n00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:52.730\n&gt;&gt; It just, it's like, hey,\n\n395\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.003\nwhatever's in there, it's going to.\n\n396\n00:19:54.003 --> 00:19:58.874\nSo you can edit your data source,\nand then take the merge document,\n\n397\n00:19:58.874 --> 00:20:01.956\ngo ahead and produce your final document.\n\n398\n00:20:01.956 --> 00:20:06.202\nAnd everything will just come over\nbecause of the data source connection.\n\n399\n00:20:06.202 --> 00:20:08.795\nOr you can then take the finished file and\n\n400\n00:20:08.795 --> 00:20:11.704\nthen do any type of\nindividual editing here.\n\n401\n00:20:11.704 --> 00:20:15.901\nSo it really just depends on which\nplace you want to go ahead and\n\n402\n00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:19.224\nmake your adjustments.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then also, I'm just trying to\n\n403\n00:20:19.224 --> 00:20:21.092\nwrap my head around all of this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no.\n\n404\n00:20:21.092 --> 00:20:21.743\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n405\n00:20:21.743 --> 00:20:22.796\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, keep going, [LAUGH].\n\n406\n00:20:22.796 --> 00:20:25.071\n&gt;&gt; So the original source file,\n\n407\n00:20:25.071 --> 00:20:30.720\nif you change the location to that,\ndoes that affect that relationship?\n\n408\n00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.016\nDo you need to keep it in the same place,\nor?\n\n409\n00:20:33.016 --> 00:20:34.646\n&gt;&gt; That is fantastic.\n\n410\n00:20:34.646 --> 00:20:35.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.302\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because it's still gonna,\n\n412\n00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:38.847\nit's like a path.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n413\n00:20:38.847 --> 00:20:40.776\n&gt;&gt; So, when you have your Word document\n\n414\n00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:44.658\nthat has a conection to that Excel file,\nor whatever your data source is.\n\n415\n00:20:44.658 --> 00:20:48.806\nAnd you move that Excel file, it's still\ngoing to look at that place and be like,\n\n416\n00:20:48.806 --> 00:20:50.321\nI don't see it.\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n417\n00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:51.621\n&gt;&gt; And it's going to be like, hey,\n\n418\n00:20:51.621 --> 00:20:53.909\nI don't know what happened here.\n&gt;&gt; You just broke something.\n\n419\n00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:54.682\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n420\n00:20:54.682 --> 00:20:55.293\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:20:55.293 --> 00:20:56.389\n&gt;&gt; It will ask you to fix it.\n\n422\n00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:56.915\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n423\n00:20:56.915 --> 00:20:57.685\n&gt;&gt; Like say, hey,\n\n424\n00:20:57.685 --> 00:20:59.948\nwhy don't you tell me\nwhere the new location is?\n\n425\n00:20:59.948 --> 00:21:04.847\nAnd then, okay, now I understand it's\nnot on your desktop anymore, it's in\n\n426\n00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:07.880\nyour source data folder, or whatever.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n427\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.435\n&gt;&gt; So it will know that, and if you come\n\n428\n00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:15.656\ninto your source data and you say,\nyou delete out all of your last names.\n\n429\n00:21:15.656 --> 00:21:19.072\nFor some reason, you deleted this whole\ncolumn, well, in your merge document,\n\n430\n00:21:19.072 --> 00:21:20.781\nyou have last-\n&gt;&gt; You're looking for that.\n\n431\n00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:22.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you mess that up,\n\n432\n00:21:22.131 --> 00:21:25.592\nin the sense of, you delete it,\nit's not going to understand that either.\n\n433\n00:21:25.592 --> 00:21:27.731\nIt's going to be like,\nI don't have a last field anymore.\n\n434\n00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:28.419\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n435\n00:21:28.419 --> 00:21:29.682\n&gt;&gt; So you definitely need to make sure\n\n436\n00:21:29.682 --> 00:21:31.932\nthat you keep those-\n&gt;&gt; Maintain that integrity for\n\n437\n00:21:31.932 --> 00:21:33.575\nthat original document.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n438\n00:21:33.575 --> 00:21:34.202\nyes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH], I'm getting it, [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:21:34.202 --> 00:21:37.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, that's awesome, yes.\n\n440\n00:21:37.673 --> 00:21:41.149\nSo, I mean, there's all different ways\nthat you can go ahead and do this.\n\n441\n00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:46.504\nAnd this is kinda back to the, hey,\nI have this particular Excel file for,\n\n442\n00:21:46.504 --> 00:21:51.275\nlet's say we're doing a mail merge,\nand this is for quarter one.\n\n443\n00:21:51.275 --> 00:21:55.050\nAnd these are all the people that I need\nto make my letters for in quarter one.\n\n444\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.626\nBut I have a separate Excel file for\nquarter two.\n\n445\n00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:02.961\nWell, I can take that same merge\ndocument that I have here,\n\n446\n00:22:02.961 --> 00:22:06.425\nI have the merge one here.\n&gt;&gt; Link it to an additional file.\n\n447\n00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:07.023\n&gt;&gt; I can just say,\n\n448\n00:22:07.023 --> 00:22:08.134\nchange it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n449\n00:22:08.134 --> 00:22:10.966\n&gt;&gt; Stop looking at quarter one Excel.\n\n450\n00:22:10.966 --> 00:22:15.491\nLook at quarter two Excel, and as long\nas quarter two Excel file is created\n\n451\n00:22:15.491 --> 00:22:17.948\nthe the same way-\n&gt;&gt; It's the same columns or\n\n452\n00:22:17.948 --> 00:22:19.705\nwhatever you have associated.\n\n453\n00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:20.758\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n454\n00:22:20.758 --> 00:22:22.095\n&gt;&gt; That header row is the same, then,\n\n455\n00:22:22.095 --> 00:22:24.189\nit's just going to go ahead and\njust say, okay, cool,\n\n456\n00:22:24.189 --> 00:22:25.765\nI'm just going to go ahead and pull that.\n\n457\n00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:26.862\nYou finish that one, and\n\n458\n00:22:26.862 --> 00:22:29.902\nnow you have all of your quarter two\nresults versus your quarter one.\n\n459\n00:22:29.902 --> 00:22:33.584\nIt's lots and lots of fun, there's so\nmany cool things you can do with it.\n\n460\n00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:37.256\nSo, and that's what we're going to be\ndoing throughout these different episodes.\n\n461\n00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:42.732\nIs we are going to be doing different\nexamples of what you'll be able to create.\n\n462\n00:22:42.732 --> 00:22:47.474\nAnd just as a little teaser, I have a\ncouple of them done for you, so if you see\n\n463\n00:22:47.474 --> 00:22:50.725\nright here, these are envelopes, right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n464\n00:22:50.725 --> 00:22:53.063\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that this is a regular\n\n465\n00:22:53.063 --> 00:22:57.516\nmailing envelope, so\nit's not an 8.5 by 11 piece of paper.\n\n466\n00:22:57.516 --> 00:23:01.402\nIt's an envelope, and\nit's got all of the different people,\n\n467\n00:23:01.402 --> 00:23:04.274\nsame data source,\njust in different places.\n\n468\n00:23:04.274 --> 00:23:06.885\nWhat about doing name badges?\n\n469\n00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:09.533\nWe talked about that,\nwe even got a little picture in there.\n\n470\n00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:14.314\nSo we could go ahead and pull from\nthat same Excel file, but this one is\n\n471\n00:23:14.314 --> 00:23:19.436\ngoing to go ahead and pull like the first,\nlast, department, and city.\n\n472\n00:23:19.436 --> 00:23:22.932\nWhat about making mailing labels, right?\n\n473\n00:23:22.932 --> 00:23:26.982\nI need to go ahead and put these labels on\neverybody's envelopes rather than printing\n\n474\n00:23:26.982 --> 00:23:28.567\nthem on the envelopes directly.\n\n475\n00:23:28.567 --> 00:23:30.272\nYou can go ahead and do that.\n\n476\n00:23:30.272 --> 00:23:33.780\nSo this is that same data source,\nthis is the finished one,\n\n477\n00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.405\nthis is not the merged one.\n\n478\n00:23:35.405 --> 00:23:39.303\nI'm just showing you the end result\nof what we're going to be creating\n\n479\n00:23:39.303 --> 00:23:40.370\nthroughout here.\n\n480\n00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.131\nSo you can see lots and lots of different\nexamples of what we're going to\n\n481\n00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:43.646\ndo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n482\n00:23:43.646 --> 00:23:45.687\nI think I might want to\njust switch careers and\n\n483\n00:23:45.687 --> 00:23:49.199\nbecome a party planner after this,\nI'll have all the tools that I need here.\n\n484\n00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:50.905\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH], that's awesome.\n\n485\n00:23:50.905 --> 00:23:53.693\nSo and\nthis is the last one I have in here,\n\n486\n00:23:53.693 --> 00:23:56.985\nthis is just the help\nfiles that Microsoft has.\n\n487\n00:23:56.985 --> 00:24:01.825\nPretty decent, I feel that it misses a few\nthings here and there, just to like,\n\n488\n00:24:01.825 --> 00:24:04.436\nhey, yeah, this is if it goes perfectly.\n\n489\n00:24:04.436 --> 00:24:06.793\nBut there's a lot of times\nit doesn't go perfectly.\n\n490\n00:24:06.793 --> 00:24:07.985\n&gt;&gt; That's why we have you to fill in those\n\n491\n00:24:07.985 --> 00:24:08.705\ngaps.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n492\n00:24:08.705 --> 00:24:09.681\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for that.\n\n493\n00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:12.201\nAnd I look forward to the rest of\nthe series, because there's so\n\n494\n00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:13.804\nmuch more to learn here with mail merge.\n\n495\n00:24:13.804 --> 00:24:17.015\nAnd I thank you for your time as well,\nbut for this show, looking at the clock,\n\n496\n00:24:17.015 --> 00:24:18.388\nit looks like we're out of time.\n\n497\n00:24:18.388 --> 00:24:21.850\nVonne, do you have any final thoughts\nthat you'd like to add or anything else?\n\n498\n00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:22.913\n&gt;&gt; We're just going to have lots of fun,\n\n499\n00:24:22.913 --> 00:24:24.007\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds great.\n\n500\n00:24:24.007 --> 00:24:27.155\nFor this show, we'll go ahead and sign\nout, I've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n501\n00:24:27.155 --> 00:24:27.884\n&gt;&gt;

Exactly.\n\n16\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.110\nYeah, we're gonna focus on the data source\n\n17\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.080\nhere of where we're needing\nto select our mailing list.\n\n18\n00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.438\nAnd that's actually how they\nexplain it in the help files.\n\n19\n00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:03.160\nI actually forgot to mention that\nin the previous episode is that,\n\n20\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.070\nI'm gonna continually say data source,\ndata source.\n\n21\n00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.569\nBut they don't really\nsay that anywhere else.\n\n22\n00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.133\n[LAUGH] Even when we're\ndoing the drop down,\n\n23\n00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.890\nit's really like the select recipients.\n\n24\n00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.200\nSelect recipients, find your mailing list,\nget your data source.\n\n25\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.480\nThey really all mean the same thing.\n\n26\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.560\nSo if you're reading help files and\nsaying, use your mailing list.\n\n27\n00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190\nThat's what we're doing here, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.790\nThat tabular formatted data, and\n\n29\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.240\nthere's a lot of different places and\na lot of different ways that we can get\n\n30\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.610\nour data sources to be connected\ninto our Word documents.\n\n31\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.660\nAnd that's why I wanted to kinda break\nthem up into some different categories\n\n32\n00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.965\nto really kinda concentrate on this\nparticular set which is the existing\n\n33\n00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:50.550\nlists.\n\n34\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.280\nI have an existing file and I wanna to\nuse that and how do I connect it and\n\n35\n00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.656\nwhat are the different examples?\n\n36\n00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:59.334\nThat's where we're gonna start.\n\n37\n00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:00.603\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, you know what,\n\n38\n00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:04.614\ntalking about where we're gonna start,\nwhy don't we jump down into my computer?\n\n39\n00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:06.820\nAnd this is my start file.\n\n40\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.547\nIt's just a blank document, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:12.881\nI didn't have a letter like we had in the\nintroduction where we have the Christmas\n\n42\n00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:17.233\ncats and everything like that because you\nmight not even have a composed letter.\n\n43\n00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:19.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna do it all together so\n\n44\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.315\nit's not like you have to write your\ndocument first before you select anything.\n\n45\n00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:26.769\nYou can do it all together, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.368\nSo it's really kind of how-\n&gt;&gt; That's a little more my style.\n\n47\n00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:30.558\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n&gt;&gt; On the fly.\n\n48\n00:02:30.558 --> 00:02:31.335\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n49\n00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:32.448\n[LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n50\n00:02:32.448 --> 00:02:33.161\nSo I mean, but\n\n51\n00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:35.506\nthis still would be your start document-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n52\n00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:37.816\n&gt;&gt; In the sense that you gotta\nstart with a blank document.\n\n53\n00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:39.027\n&gt;&gt; A document, yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:40.957\n&gt;&gt; Either a blank document or\none you already wrote.\n\n55\n00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:41.675\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n56\n00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:43.610\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're gonna go here.\n\n57\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.640\nNow on this Mailing tabs,\nwe have the Select Recipients.\n\n58\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.145\nNotice it doesn't say data source,\ndoes it?\n\n59\n00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:49.786\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n60\n00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:51.223\n&gt;&gt; It's select recipients.\n\n61\n00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:54.950\nNow these are the different\noptions that we have here.\n\n62\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.469\nWell, we're gonna do a different\nepisode on the contacts,\n\n63\n00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.611\na different episode on the new list.\n\n64\n00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.805\nAnd I might as well go ahead and\nmention here, FileMaker Pro, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:05.260\nDo you know what Filemaker Pro is?\n\n66\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.960\n&gt;&gt; I don't, Vonn.\n\n67\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.270\nI heard you reference it in the last show,\nso\n\n68\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.890\nI'm assuming that it's some kind\nof file management application.\n\n69\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, almost.\n\n70\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.318\nInstead of files, it's data.\n\n71\n00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:16.927\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n72\n00:03:16.927 --> 00:03:18.312\n&gt;&gt; So access-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:19.860\n&gt;&gt; Access is a database program.\n\n74\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.792\n&gt;&gt; This is the Mac version\nof a Access database.\n\n76\n00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:25.528\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, okay.\n\n77\n00:03:25.528 --> 00:03:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's the thing,\nit's specific to Mac.\n\n78\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.770\nThey don't make Access for Mac, okay?\n\n79\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.800\nSo that's why they have FileMaker Pro.\n\n80\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n81\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.298\n&gt;&gt; I have no experience\nwith FileMaker Pro.\n\n82\n00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:39.915\nI will just tell you right off the bat.\n\n83\n00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:41.252\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n84\n00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:44.240\nI am not gonna go very deep into this one.\n\n85\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.080\nIt's just that it's your database\n&gt;&gt; Another option.\n\n86\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n87\n00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.230\nSo, and by the way,\nI just realized that my watch just stings.\n\n88\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.710\nSo if I was like, what was that noise?\n\n89\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.900\nNo, it's not cookies.\n\n90\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just that my fancy watch,\n\n91\n00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:58.128\nI forgot to go ahead and\nput it on silence.\n\n92\n00:03:58.128 --> 00:03:59.902\nThere you go, so\nwe won't be hearing any more rings, okay?\n\n93\n00:03:59.902 --> 00:04:02.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In case anyone was wondering\n\n94\n00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.890\nabout that.\n\n95\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.719\n&gt;&gt; Well, which brings up another\noption there, it says Apple contacts.\n\n96\n00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.320\nDid I say that correctly?\n\n97\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.050\nSo integrating that, incorporating with\ncontexts that you may already have.\n\n98\n00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes, from your mail programs.\n\n99\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.820\nAnd that one,\nthose have those little nuances as well.\n\n100\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.070\nSo that's why we're gonna\nkeep that in another episode.\n\n101\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.721\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But yes, you can use.\n\n102\n00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:22.905\nI mean, cuz there's so\n\n103\n00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:27.490\nmany different places that you could store\nthis information, couldn't you, right?\n\n104\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.727\nIn your Outlook contacts,\nyour Apple contacts,\n\n105\n00:04:30.727 --> 00:04:34.455\nyour FileMaker Pro database,\nor your existing list.\n\n106\n00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:35.220\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n107\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.436\nclick on this just to give you\nan example of right here where,\n\n108\n00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:41.540\nall right, well then, these are where\nit's gonna go out and choose data files.\n\n109\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.210\nSo we would go into our different\nfiles and we will go ahead and\n\n110\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.970\npick the one that's in the format\nthat we have available to us, okay?\n\n111\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.650\nI'm gonna stop there because I\nwant to kinda just take a quick\n\n112\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.580\nmoment to talk about those\ndifferent file formats, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.280\nBecause it's something worth noting.\n\n114\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.220\nWe mentioned that it has\nto be in a tabular format.\n\n115\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.107\nIt has to have columns and\nit has to have rows, columns and rows.\n\n116\n00:05:14.107 --> 00:05:18.368\nWell, Excel is probably one of\nthe most common ones that we're used\n\n117\n00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:20.050\nto dealing with.\n\n118\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.730\nI say that because I use Excel.\n\n119\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.268\n[LAUGH] If you're like,\nI've never used Excel before, or\n\n120\n00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:30.982\nI barely touch that program, then you\nmight not be as comfortable with that.\n\n121\n00:05:30.982 --> 00:05:34.680\nBut just from a very simple standpoint,\n\n122\n00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.410\nif you do have Excel,\nthis is just making columns.\n\n123\n00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.710\nGo ahead and putting, I want all my\nfirst names in the first column and\n\n124\n00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.610\nthe last names in the next column.\n\n125\n00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.820\nAnd then, you go ahead and\nput in your entries.\n\n126\n00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.800\nOkay, so that's how we are going to,\n\n127\n00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.610\nI think the easiest way to kinda\ndemonstrate this concept is using Excel.\n\n128\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.820\nBut that's not the only option.\n\n129\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.895\n&gt;&gt; Well, so would Microsoft Word be,\nwould that really count?\n\n130\n00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:02.935\nBecause I know you can put\ntables inside of Word.\n\n131\n00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:03.988\nBut I don't know.\n\n132\n00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:04.795\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n\n133\n00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:07.916\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which is to me kinda, not odd.\n\n134\n00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:10.065\nIt's not odd at all, but\nyeah, you totally can.\n\n135\n00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:10.895\nSo let me show you.\n\n136\n00:06:10.895 --> 00:06:15.834\nSo I have a data source\nthat is in a table, okay?\n\n137\n00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.145\nSo this is just a docx.\n\n138\n00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.765\nSo this is a full Word file and\n\n139\n00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:26.110\nit's just a single table with rows and\ncolumns, yeah.\n\n140\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.239\nThis could be a viable-\n&gt;&gt; Data source.\n\n141\n00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:28.940\n&gt;&gt; Data source.\n\n142\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.440\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n143\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.057\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n144\n00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.801\n&gt;&gt; So if this is how you wanna organize\n\n145\n00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:34.630\nyour information, go right ahead.\nNothing wrong with that.\n\n146\n00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.920\nSo it's just Excel is really the same\nthing, totally not the same thing.\n\n147\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.158\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the idea of rows and columns.\n\n148\n00:06:42.158 --> 00:06:46.990\nSo now there are some other file\nformats that maybe you might not\n\n149\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.641\nbe as familiar with.\n\n150\n00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:55.086\nBut they are common especially if you\nhave some proprietary database system for\n\n151\n00:06:55.086 --> 00:06:59.801\nyour particular company,\nbecause there's lots of big,\n\n152\n00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:01.410\nbig databases-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n153\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.470\n&gt;&gt; That are not just like Excel.\n\n154\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.850\nAnd Excel's not a database, it's\nreally a spreadsheet, but that's okay.\n\n155\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.055\nAnd then Access,\nwhich is the next step up.\n\n156\n00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:11.469\nAnd you have your SQL databases and\nOracle.\n\n157\n00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:13.140\n&gt;&gt; Oracle, all sorts of things.\n\n158\n00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's where you get in the big guys, and\n\n159\n00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:20.755\nif you're in a large organization,\nyour company might use that.\n\n160\n00:07:20.755 --> 00:07:25.228\nAnd so you might not have\ndirect access to the data but\n\n161\n00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:28.488\nyou have to call records or whatever.\n\n162\n00:07:28.488 --> 00:07:33.057\nYour records department say, hey,\nI need to pull all of our customers\n\n163\n00:07:33.057 --> 00:07:37.790\nwithin the state of Florida,\nwithin our North Central Florida region.\n\n164\n00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.815\nAnd they give you that file\nfrom the big database.\n\n165\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.663\nNow, they might give it to\nyou in a CSV file format.\n\n166\n00:07:48.663 --> 00:07:50.440\nYou know what that stands for, Cherokee?\n\n167\n00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.780\n&gt;&gt; Comma separated value.\n\n168\n00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.569\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I knew you knew it.\n\n169\n00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:57.330\n[LAUGH] Yes, it is a, or\na comma delimited file,\n\n170\n00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.039\na delimiter Just really a fancy term for\nseparator, okay?\n\n171\n00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:06.510\nSo that's where we've got,\nI have an example of a CSV file format.\n\n172\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:12.190\nNow because I have Excel on\nmy computer that file format\n\n173\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.040\nis gonna automatically be associated\nwith that particular application.\n\n174\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.250\nCuz you can kinda see it.\n\n175\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.870\nYou see it has an Excel looking icon for\nit.\n\n176\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.060\nIt's not the full one.\n\n177\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.520\nAnd the other thing is I always\ntell people look at the details.\n\n178\n00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.060\nI have it in the details view where I\nknow that this is not an Excel file.\n\n179\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.700\nIt is a comma separated value.\n\n180\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.940\nBut if I double click it,\nit's gonna open up in Excel.\n\n181\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.380\nThat's just the way it works.\n\n182\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.860\nBut it does have commas separating this.\n\n183\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.440\nI did a Command W, by the way,\nto close the file.\n\n184\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.090\nAnd I'm doing a command tab to\nswitch back over to my finder.\n\n185\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.790\nSo if I right click on this and\nopen this with just like a text editor.\n\n186\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.860\nI have Text Edit here.\n\n187\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.850\nThis is what it really looks like.\n\n188\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.410\nYou could see at every change in,\nwhoops, sorry, come up here.\n\n189\n00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.750\nAt every change in column,\nthere's a comma.\n\n190\n00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.710\nAt every change in row there is an Enter.\n\n191\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.360\nAnd so this is the exported version,\n\n192\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.150\nif you wanna say, of an Excel\na Database or something like that.\n\n193\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.050\nTo where cuz Oracle,\n\n194\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.210\nI don't even know what format\nOracle's in the Oracle format right.\n\n195\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:24.790\nSo but\n\n196\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.850\nyou need to have it in this generic file\nformat that a lot of different apps use.\n\n197\n00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.430\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty universal yeah.\n\n198\n00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:37.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly, I like the universal file\nformat that many of your products or\n\n199\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.170\napplications can understand and\nis used to transmit data that way.\n\n200\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.390\nSo you might have a CSV file.\n\n201\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.730\nOne note on CSV files,\nwe talk about this in the Excel show,\n\n202\n00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.470\nis that you can make a CSV file very\neasily by just doing the save as.\n\n203\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.510\nThe caveat there, is that you\ncannot have multiple worksheets\n\n204\n00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.870\nwithin a CSV file because\nit's really just text.\n\n205\n00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.210\nIt's not, and\nI know you're seeing it in Excel but\n\n206\n00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.470\nyou saw there in the text editor,\nit's just text.\n\n207\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.490\nYou can't have multiple worksheets,\nso you do need to be aware of that.\n\n208\n00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.530\nUsing Excel as your data source,\n\n209\n00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.010\nyou could have multiple worksheets\nwithin the same workbook.\n\n210\n00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.540\nSo you could still be connecting to\nyour Excel as your data source but\n\n211\n00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.300\nthen switching which worksheet\nthat you want to use.\n\n212\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.570\nFor say like, I think we did the example\nthat quarter one, quarter two,\n\n213\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.880\nquarter three.\n\n214\n00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.400\nWell you can have code one, two,\nthree, four all in one workbook, and\n\n215\n00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.200\nthen just pick which sheet you need\nto pull it from, and you can pick and\n\n216\n00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.190\nchoose from there, and\nI'll show you all of that.\n\n217\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.520\nJust kind of throwing that out,\nthere is another type of delimited file,\n\n218\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.220\nit's known as tab delimited file.\n\n219\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.960\nAnd it's really just again,\na delimiter is just a separator.\n\n220\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.150\nSo instead of just a comma\nseparating your values, or\n\n221\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.680\nyour fields, your columns,\nyou're gonna have a tab.\n\n222\n00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:06.020\nSo notice I have a data source tabs,\nand it's a .txt file.\n\n223\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.998\nThat's a common format\nthat they would come at.\n\n224\n00:11:07.998 --> 00:11:11.430\nRemember we talked about exporting our\nfrom those proprietary data bases.\n\n225\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.830\nMaybe you get it in a tab TXT file.\n\n226\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.940\nAnd if I write click on this and\nopen this with Text Editor,\n\n227\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.580\nyou can't really see the tabs in there.\n\n228\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.090\nYou see physical white space.\n\n229\n00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.190\nBut it is a single tab.\n\n230\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.800\nI actually have an example just here.\n\n231\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.650\nI don't know why I'm right clicking to,\nI guess, it's got to open in Word,\n\n232\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.860\ncause it's a Word document, but.\n\n233\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.210\nSee right here,\nif I turn on the show/hide characters,\n\n234\n00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:43.750\nthere's that single tab In\nbetween each one of those values.\n\n235\n00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.200\nWe talked a lot about this in the Word\nseries where we convert text tables,\n\n236\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.110\ntables to text.\n\n237\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.780\n&gt;&gt; I remember that.\n\n238\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you were in\nmy house on that one, so yeah,\n\n239\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.630\nit was lots of fun [LAUGH].\n\n240\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:59.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I remember you pointed out my\nage whenever we were looking at the tabs.\n\n241\n00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.720\nI'm like,\nis it supposed to be five spaces?\n\n242\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.705\nAnd you are like [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Only if you're 500 years old.\n\n243\n00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:06.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well no because\nI was taught the same way.\n\n244\n00:12:06.543 --> 00:12:07.464\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I was like no\n\n245\n00:12:07.464 --> 00:12:08.160\nthat's\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.150\n&gt;&gt; You know how many times it's so\n\n247\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.630\ncommon that people say that.\n\n248\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.438\nAnd I was like nope.\n\n249\n00:12:13.438 --> 00:12:17.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But yeah cuz I\n\n250\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.290\nthink I'm actually, I'm quite a bit older\nthan you, so let's not talk about that.\n\n251\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.300\n&gt;&gt; Anywho.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's move on.\n\n252\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.150\nSo you're gonna see those different types\nof data sources just showing you what they\n\n253\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:33.510\nlook like before we kind of get it into\nbeing connected into our mail merge.\n\n254\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.130\nSo why don't I, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose a couple of these.\n\n255\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.190\n&gt;&gt; I'll close that.\n\n256\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.190\nWe've seen them.\n\n257\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.430\nAnd also, I'll close the Excel file\neven though I don't technically have to,\n\n258\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.270\nbut it's just easier if okay.\n\n259\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.910\nNow we know the different types\nof data that are existing lists.\n\n260\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.550\nNow let's go through and\ndo this in mail merge.\n\n261\n00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.870\nSo we're on our Mailings tab.\n\n262\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:00.080\nWe talked about we're gonna go here and\nwe're gonna go to use an existing list.\n\n263\n00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.910\n&gt;&gt; Great, we're gonna come out and\npick the files.\n\n264\n00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.430\nI'll just go out to my desktop.\n\n265\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.500\nAnd I know that they're in\nthis particular folder.\n\n266\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.020\nSo you can see some of them.\n\n267\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.110\nI did want to point out one thing down\nhere on the Options button just for\n\n268\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.300\nvisual purposes, is that it's enabling.\n\n269\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.890\nAnd notice in this drop down,\nExcel does not\n\n270\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:23.210\nexist here which is a little weird\nbecause it's like wait a second.\n\n271\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.410\n&gt;&gt; This is one of the most common types,\nthen yeah.\n\n272\n00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay so [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see what our options are,\n\n273\n00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.920\nlet's see, all files, word documents.\n\n274\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's not in there,\nyeah, it's weird okay.\n\n275\n00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.470\nThis is one of those strange\nthings about Word for\n\n276\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:44.485\nMac when it comes to mail\nmerge with Excel files.\n\n277\n00:13:44.485 --> 00:13:47.526\n[SOUND] Oopf, okay,\njust keep that in mind.\n\n278\n00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:49.838\nWe'll come back to it\nin just a little bit.\n\n279\n00:13:49.838 --> 00:13:50.741\nLet's go down.\n\n280\n00:13:50.741 --> 00:13:55.061\nI have it in order of\nthe least resistance.\n\n281\n00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:56.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n282\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.360\nthe path of least resistance here.\n\n283\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n284\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.600\n&gt;&gt; And then we'd go down to just,\nit's not hard it's just\n\n285\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.670\nexplaining more of why it's giving you\nthese warnings that it's giving you.\n\n286\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So let's select that one where it was\n\n287\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.790\njust the word table, okay?\n\n288\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.880\nSo we have our data source,\nour word table, we saw it right?\n\n289\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.630\nIt was just a single table,\ncan't have any other information there.\n\n290\n00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.180\nJust has to be a single table,\n&gt;&gt;

So I wonder like,\nmaybe if you're utilizing and\n\n342\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.350\noperating a system in\na different language or\n\n343\n00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.140\nsomething, like proprietary to that\nsystem, it might not work properly?\n\n344\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.798\n&gt;&gt; Possibly, and this is where you\nstart getting into encoding and\n\n345\n00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:14.624\nlike where it came from, and\nmy gosh, is it gonna actually work?\n\n346\n00:17:14.624 --> 00:17:18.793\nThis just gets into the whole,\nI call it the Gremlins or the-\n\n347\n00:17:18.793 --> 00:17:19.625\n&gt;&gt; Twilight Zone?\n\n348\n00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:20.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n349\n00:17:20.155 --> 00:17:21.614\n&gt;&gt; The Gremlins, where you're like,\n\n350\n00:17:21.614 --> 00:17:23.031\nI have no idea why it's doing that.\n\n351\n00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:24.154\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We've all run into those, right?\n\n352\n00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where it's like, it should work, but\n\n353\n00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.999\nyeah.\n\n354\n00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:29.490\nSo just try to look for the red.\n\n355\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.300\nAnd the other thing is, if it's\ndoing something with red down here,\n\n356\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.130\nlike it's indicating an issue.\n\n357\n00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.103\nI don't have any issues right now.\n\n358\n00:17:36.103 --> 00:17:37.585\nChoose some of these other options.\n\n359\n00:17:37.585 --> 00:17:39.996\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Choose different encodings,\n\n360\n00:17:39.996 --> 00:17:43.090\nuntil it doesn't give\nyou any reds in there.\n\n361\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.383\nSo that would be my best suggestion.\n\n362\n00:17:46.383 --> 00:17:49.182\nIf it like is seriously broken,\n\n363\n00:17:49.182 --> 00:17:51.740\nthe CSV file might have a-\n&gt;&gt; Corruption or something?\n\n364\n00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might be a corrupted file.\n\n365\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.790\nIt could have an extra comma\nin there that it didn't have,\n\n366\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.220\ncuz it had blank fields or\na mix matched data.\n\n367\n00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.770\nSo your original data source or\nany data source,\n\n368\n00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.630\nit has to be-\n&gt;&gt; Quality, so like the whole garbage in,\n\n369\n00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:09.330\ngarbage out thing.\n\n370\n00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.515\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was gonna say pure.\n\n371\n00:18:11.515 --> 00:18:12.249\nI like what you said.\n\n372\n00:18:12.249 --> 00:18:14.022\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say pure.\n\n373\n00:18:14.022 --> 00:18:16.519\n&gt;&gt; So we have purity and then garbage.\n\n374\n00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:17.943\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like those are our different\n\n375\n00:18:17.943 --> 00:18:18.712\nperspectives here.\n\n376\n00:18:18.712 --> 00:18:20.238\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] That's exactly what it is.\n\n380\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.166\nIt's like, which way you wanna look at it.\n\n381\n00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:31.876\nIt's all either crap or crap.\n\n382\n00:18:31.876 --> 00:18:34.468\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, but that is true.\n\n383\n00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:37.171\nYou have to have everything done\nproperly in your data source or\n\n384\n00:18:37.171 --> 00:18:38.500\nyou're gonna have problems.\n\n385\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.927\n&gt;&gt;

Cool.\n\n392\n00:18:54.952 --> 00:18:57.264\n&gt;&gt; All right, now let's talk about Excel.\n\n393\n00:18:57.264 --> 00:18:59.045\n[LAUGH] This is a weird one.\n\n394\n00:18:59.045 --> 00:19:00.193\n[SOUND] I'm hitting on the wrong button.\n\n395\n00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:02.642\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna choose the existing list.\n\n396\n00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:05.817\nBy the way the top line,\nthose fields are gonna stay the same,\n\n397\n00:19:05.817 --> 00:19:09.131\nbecause remember I just saved\nthe CSV file from that Excel file.\n\n398\n00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:10.424\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n399\n00:19:10.424 --> 00:19:13.170\n&gt;&gt; So the insert fields is\ngonna look the exact same.\n\n400\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.320\nBut I come back out here to my files.\n\n401\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.050\nNow I have my XLSX, so this is the regular\nExcel file format and I click Open.\n\n402\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.671\nOkay, [LAUGH],\nthis is gonna sound really scary.\n\n403\n00:19:24.671 --> 00:19:29.874\nBut this is the thing where it is actually\nsaying this file needs to be opened\n\n404\n00:19:29.874 --> 00:19:34.597\nby Excel workbook text converter,\nwhich could be a security risk.\n\n405\n00:19:34.597 --> 00:19:36.974\nOpen a malicious file and\nyou're like, what?\n\n406\n00:19:36.974 --> 00:19:38.460\nYou get all scared, and you do what?\n\n407\n00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.642\nYou hit Cancel, right?\n\n408\n00:19:39.642 --> 00:19:43.380\nOkay, [LAUGH] well,\nthis is just one of those things.\n\n409\n00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.430\nThe mail, I'm sorry, Word for Mac doesn't\n\n410\n00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:53.589\ndirectly allow you to connect\nto Excel in mail merges.\n\n411\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.812\nWhy?\nI don't know, okay?\n\n412\n00:19:56.812 --> 00:20:02.679\nI mean, it's just one of those things of\nthis product word was originally made for\n\n413\n00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:03.709\nthe PC world.\n\n414\n00:20:03.709 --> 00:20:05.918\n&gt;&gt;

Okay.\n\n496\n00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:52.460\n&gt;&gt; So you shouldn't have any issues.\n\n497\n00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.118\nBut there are some suggestions out\nthere like, hey, if it's the XLSX.\n\n498\n00:23:57.118 --> 00:24:00.180\nSometimes try saving it\ndown into the the xls.\n\n499\n00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.191\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was gonna say.\n\n500\n00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:04.595\nWhat if you did your own translation and\nconversion and\n\n501\n00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:07.038\nthen handed them like, I don't know.\n\n502\n00:24:07.038 --> 00:24:07.575\n&gt;&gt;

Exactly.\n\n577\n00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.420\nJust make sure your data here is good.\n\n578\n00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.433\nThere are Excel formulas that you can\ngo in and look for white spaces and\n\n579\n00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:51.920\ntell it to remove it, so it's pretty cool.\n\n580\n00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.819\nSo it's a function that you can do.\n\n581\n00:27:53.819 --> 00:27:58.640\nAnd some other things about Excel,\nsome things like, here let me go.\n\n582\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.260\nI was wondering why my, ooh,\nhello, my zooms weren't working.\n\n583\n00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.220\nThings like zip codes, right?\n\n584\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.670\nNow again, this is more Excel stuff.\n\n585\n00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.160\nThis isn't Word, but Excel.\n\n586\n00:28:08.502 --> 00:28:11.860\nMaking sure zip codes are anything\nthat has a preceding zero,\n\n587\n00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:17.300\nyou wanna make sure your cell formatting\nis in text rather than in general.\n\n588\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.450\nSo notice here that this is in a text\ncell formatting versus your general.\n\n589\n00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.740\nIt'll drop your preceding zeros.\n\n590\n00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.012\nSo formatting yourselves\nas text will avoid that.\n\n591\n00:28:29.012 --> 00:28:31.185\nNow, this is a common Excel thing.\n\n592\n00:28:31.185 --> 00:28:34.290\nAnd again, this is a Word series, so\nI don't wanna get too deep into this.\n\n593\n00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.238\nBut we have episodes on that\nif you wanna go back there and\n\n594\n00:28:37.238 --> 00:28:39.535\ncheck out our Excel files or Excel series.\n\n595\n00:28:39.535 --> 00:28:41.150\n[LAUGH] So we talk about them.\n\n596\n00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.580\nBut just kinda keeping that in mind,\ncell formattings for\n\n597\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.460\nzeroes and things like that or preceding\nzeroes, extra white spaces in there.\n\n598\n00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.237\nI was trying to to see if I have any\nother, those are the biggest ones.\n\n599\n00:28:53.237 --> 00:28:55.040\nAnd of course, you have to have headers.\n\n600\n00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.830\nThat's in any data source.\n\n601\n00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:02.645\nIf you don't have a header, it's not\ngonna understand what is this column.\n\n602\n00:29:02.645 --> 00:29:03.165\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n603\n00:29:03.165 --> 00:29:07.594\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthat's just kind of a common thing in\n\n604\n00:29:07.594 --> 00:29:11.640\nany data source, Excel, or otherwise.\n\n605\n00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.960\nSo that's something to\nalways be familiar with.\n\n606\n00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:23.100\nAnd we will be taking the next step in the\nepisode where we start writing a letter.\n\n607\n00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to do letters, mail merge.\n\n608\n00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.865\nThat's where we're gonna say, cuz you're\nprobably like, okay, so now what?\n\n609\n00:29:28.865 --> 00:29:31.830\n[LAUGH] I've got my data source connected.\n\n610\n00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.149\nTell me what I'm supposed to do.\n\n611\n00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:34.389\nWell, we'll get there.\n\n612\n00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:37.388\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, but just an explanation about that\n\n613\n00:29:37.388 --> 00:29:42.540\nand all those little nuances that can\npop up when choosing a data source.\n\n614\n00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's better to get\nthose good habits from the onset\n\n615\n00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.605\ninstead of going back and trying to fix\nthings, just like our data entry so.\n\n616\n00:29:50.605 --> 00:29:51.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n617\n00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nthank you for your time.\n\n618\n00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.110\nAnd thank you for your time as well.\n\n619\n00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.810\nBut looking at the clock,\nI think we are out of time.\n\n620\n00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.220\nSo let's go ahead and\nsign out for the show.\n\n621\n00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.750\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n622\n00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n623\n00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.630\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at OfficeProTV.\n\n624\n00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:11.040\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Hi.\n\n36\n00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:36.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because yeah,\n\n37\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.048\nbecause you're probably like,\nwait, that's not Cherokee.\n\n38\n00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:40.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm distinctively not\n\n39\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.230\nCherokee.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.357\n&gt;&gt; The law of identity has proven the fact\n\n41\n00:01:43.357 --> 00:01:44.763\nthat I'm not Cherokee.\n\n42\n00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:45.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:47.056\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz Cherokee's been my host for\n\n44\n00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:50.060\nthis whole series.\nAnd this is actually something I\n\n45\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.036\nwanted to come back.\nThis is tacked on at the end, if you wanna\n\n46\n00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:57.132\nsay, because I went through everything.\nI'm like, no, I need to go back and\n\n47\n00:01:57.132 --> 00:02:01.162\ntell you all a little bit more\nabout the problems you're going\n\n48\n00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.251\nto have with existing lists.\nCuz it's great when everything works\n\n49\n00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:05.050\nperfectly-\n&gt;&gt; It is great,\n\n50\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.350\nit's a wonderful thing when that happens.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n51\n00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.304\nguess what?\nIt doesn't happen.\n\n52\n00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:10.350\n[LAUGH] And we did make\n\n53\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.456\nsome mention to it, you, not Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:15.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cherokee and I did talk about\n\n55\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.040\nsome of the issues you might have\nwith the white spaces and everything.\n\n56\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.065\nAnd Daniel was actually my host in the\nother series for the mail merge on PCs.\n\n57\n00:02:22.065 --> 00:02:24.720\nSo he has a little bit of\nexperience in this area.\n\n58\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.290\nSo you'll be interested to see some of the\nnuances of what Mac does that PC doesn't.\n\n59\n00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.630\n&gt;&gt; It is, okay, so just, if you set PC and\n\n60\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.610\nMac down, it's the same product.\n\n61\n00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.499\nThere are differences,\nfor whatever reason.\n\n62\n00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.570\nI don't know why they do that,\nbut they do.\n\n63\n00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.860\nSo gotta be prepared for it.\n\n64\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.207\nSo if Mac is the thing that you're,\nmaybe you're migrating over to a Mac and\n\n65\n00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:47.140\nyou're coming from a PC.\n\n66\n00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.205\nThis could be very, very helpful for you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I sometimes wonder if I\n\n67\n00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:55.900\nshould do this because this is Mail Merge\nfor Mac, so you're using a Mac.\n\n68\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.374\nBut I work on both systems, and you\nprobably have other people in your office\n\n69\n00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:02.370\nthat work on both systems, and so that's-\n&gt;&gt; Right, so cross-pollination, yeah.\n\n70\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.690\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.460\nAnd that, honestly,\nis sometimes part of the problem,\n\n72\n00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.280\nof you get a file from somebody on a PC.\n\n73\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.928\nYou bring it on your Mac, and it somehow\njust decides to just take a big old-\n\n74\n00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:16.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.468\n&gt;&gt; Yep on the floor.\n\n76\n00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:20.360\n[LAUGH] That's just like-\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n77\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.080\n&gt;&gt; I forgot where I was.\n\n78\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.513\n&gt;&gt; I like that, it's just s like, PG show.\n\n79\n00:03:22.513 --> 00:03:23.321\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n80\n00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:26.470\nit's like, why is this doing this?\n\n81\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.540\nSo I'm here to show you,\nand I feel your pain.\n\n82\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.040\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n&gt;&gt; Let's get our hands dirty.\n\n83\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes, let's do this, let's go ahead and\n\n84\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.240\nget into our files.\n\n85\n00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.380\nNow this is just our file list.\n\n86\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.000\nAnd where I wanted to start was,\n\n87\n00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.630\njust a small thing before\nwe get started into Excel.\n\n88\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.790\nBecause that's where I really wanna\nfocus on in this particular episode is\n\n89\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.670\nproblems you're gonna have\nwith the Excel file format\n\n90\n00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.970\nwhen using that as a data source\nin Mail Merge for the Mac.\n\n91\n00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.693\nBefore we did mention FileMaker Pro\nin our last episode, and\n\n92\n00:03:56.693 --> 00:04:00.718\nthat is like the Access for Mac,\nand that's a database program.\n\n93\n00:04:00.718 --> 00:04:04.110\nBut I did wanna kinda tack on\nsomething in this particular episode.\n\n94\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.440\nIs that when you're working\nwith databases, and\n\n95\n00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.650\nif you're in a primarily\nWindows networked environment,\n\n96\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.470\nyou might have things like SQL Servers and\nbigger servers, like Oracle servers and\n\n97\n00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.930\nblah, blah, blah, all those\ndifferent bigger types of databases.\n\n98\n00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.740\nWell, if that's where your\ndata source needs to be,\n\n99\n00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.390\nmail merge in Mac cannot connect\nto those types of databases.\n\n100\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.980\nBecause those types of connections\nuse what's known as ODBC,\n\n101\n00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.620\nOpen Database Connections.\n&gt;&gt; I'm starting to sing a rap song\n\n102\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.040\nfrom the early 2000s.\n\n103\n00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's dirty.\n\n104\n00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.068\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Baby, I got your money, so.\n\n105\n00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:47.022\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's how you can remember that,\n\n106\n00:04:47.022 --> 00:04:49.716\nyou'll never forget that now.\n&gt;&gt; It's ingrained in my head.\n\n107\n00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:50.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.050\n&gt;&gt; I am a product\n\n109\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.225\nof early 90s rap music.\n&gt;&gt; 90s, yeah.\n\n110\n00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:55.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I did wanna throw this out there,\n\n111\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.820\nand this is in the episode notes,\n\n112\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.080\nthat you can't make that type of\nconnection, it's not supported.\n\n113\n00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.490\nIt is a very Microsoft thing,\nOpen Database Connection, so\n\n114\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.750\nyou can't do that in a Mac.\n\n115\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.780\nSo if you do have, like somebody's saying\nlike, connect to the SQL Server, and\n\n116\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.400\nyou're on a Mac and\nthis is what you use, you can't do it.\n\n117\n00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.380\nOkay so I'm just throwing that out there,\nyou can't.\n\n118\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.520\nYou would have to have them\ntake down that information from\n\n119\n00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.501\nthat particular proprietary\ndatabase into a CSV file.\n\n120\n00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:28.386\nBecause CSV files is definitely the way\nto go when you're working with Mac and\n\n121\n00:05:28.386 --> 00:05:29.060\nmail merge.\n\n122\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.200\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nput this out there now, and you're like,\n\n123\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.330\nwell then why you talking about Excel?\n\n124\n00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.711\nWell, just in case.\n&gt;&gt; Well, because you have to.\n\n125\n00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:36.743\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that would really,\n\n126\n00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:40.565\nwe should probably just end\nthe episode right there, but-\n\n127\n00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:41.423\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do CSV,\n\n128\n00:05:41.423 --> 00:05:42.729\nthanks for watching.\n&gt;&gt; Just put everything in [CROSSTALK].\n\n129\n00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:43.288\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:05:43.288 --> 00:05:44.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, but this is why.\n\n131\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.790\nBecause we talked about the encoder.\n\n132\n00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.400\nThe thing that when you connect\nan Excel file to Mail Merge in Mac,\n\n133\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.210\nit has to convert,\nit's just what it does, okay?\n\n134\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.440\nNow this particular file\nwe're gonna start this, and\n\n135\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.330\nthen we're gonna talk amongst ourselves,\nDaniel.\n\n136\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.900\nBecause this is a mail merge merged.\n\n137\n00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.545\nThis is a file that all ready\nhas a data base connection.\n\n138\n00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:11.318\nSorry, well,\na data source connection to an Excel file,\n\n139\n00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:15.080\nlike the department and address, right?\n\n140\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.994\nWell when I open this, okay,\nwe did mention in the other one,\n\n141\n00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:21.584\nlike anytime you do make a database\nconnection to, I keep saying database,\n\n142\n00:06:21.584 --> 00:06:22.780\nI'm sorry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.610\n&gt;&gt; Data source,\n\n144\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.302\nan existing list connection in\na mail merge then save the file.\n\n145\n00:06:27.302 --> 00:06:29.745\nEvery time you open it,\nIf you're connecting to an Excel file,\n\n146\n00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:31.505\nit will always give you this.\n\n147\n00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:35.395\nHey, I need to do my workbook\ntext converter thing, do I?\n\n148\n00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.175\nYes, you do that, and then you sit and\n\n149\n00:06:38.175 --> 00:06:43.122\nyou wait, and it will take forever.\n\n150\n00:06:43.122 --> 00:06:45.726\nCuz it is doing all, it is doing all\nthese kinda backwards translations and\n\n151\n00:06:45.726 --> 00:06:46.692\neverything.\n\n152\n00:06:46.692 --> 00:06:51.042\nBecause, Daniel, since you weren't here,\nyou can't take Excel and\n\n153\n00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:53.434\nput it right in as a data source to Word,\n\n154\n00:06:53.434 --> 00:06:55.273\nwhich is really weird right?\n&gt;&gt; In\n\n155\n00:06:55.273 --> 00:06:55.793\na Mac?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n156\n00:06:55.793 --> 00:06:56.414\n&gt;&gt; That's very strange.\n\n157\n00:06:56.414 --> 00:06:57.134\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n158\n00:06:57.134 --> 00:07:01.420\n[LAUGH] So it has to do this converter\nthing in the background, and-.\n\n159\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.338\n&gt;&gt; What is it converting?\n\n160\n00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:06.430\nThings and stuff.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and-\n\n161\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.305\n&gt;&gt; And we have talked about trusted files.\n\n163\n00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:13.382\nThings like trusted source,\ncuz it is doing some programming and\n\n164\n00:07:13.382 --> 00:07:16.130\nscripting, and everything in the back.\n\n165\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.850\nSo you're like, okay, that's find,\n\n166\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.750\nit might pose a security risk that's\nwhy it gives us this warning.\n\n167\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.090\nBut you can see, see how long it's taking?\n\n168\n00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.733\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n169\n00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:26.120\n&gt;&gt; But we're kinda giving it a hard time\n\n170\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.969\nsaying, you know,\n\n171\n00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.620\nthis is a Microsoft product dealing\nwith another Microsoft product.\n\n172\n00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.440\nWhy is it doing this conversion and stuff?\n\n173\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.570\nApple OS is a different operating system,\nit works differently,\n\n174\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.280\nit does things differently than\na Windows operating system would do.\n\n175\n00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.400\nSo you've gotta bear that in mind.\n\n176\n00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.890\nSo yeah,\nmaybe they had to do this because of that,\n\n177\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.834\nand that's most likely the reason.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n178\n00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:46.538\npretty much, and\nthat's everything that I've read.\n\n179\n00:07:46.538 --> 00:07:48.640\nSo it's just just hey,\nand then look at this.\n\n180\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.590\nAnd this where I'm like okay,\nwell, now it can't find it.\n\n181\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.362\nOkay, well we do talk about\nthis in a future episode.\n\n182\n00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:59.000\nWe talk about missing sources and\nhey, it can't find it.\n\n183\n00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.868\nSo this is something that you will\nsee in the letters data emerge.\n\n184\n00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:07.313\nOkay let us go ahead and find that source\nand then let us go out to our desk top and\n\n185\n00:08:07.313 --> 00:08:08.620\ngo ahead and go to our Mac.\n\n186\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.690\nI debated whether I should even go\nthrough these steps because it is like.\n\n187\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.405\n&gt;&gt; Who won the debate?\n\n188\n00:08:12.405 --> 00:08:15.113\n[LAUGH] I did.\n&gt;&gt; A yeah.\n\n189\n00:08:15.113 --> 00:08:15.805\n&gt;&gt; Oddly enough.\n\n190\n00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:17.675\n&gt;&gt; And then look at what we got.\n\n191\n00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:18.640\nWait you have to convert it again?\n\n192\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.700\nAll right so we sit there and\nsay yes and then it goes through and\n\n193\n00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.120\ndoes a whole other process and\nit's just like all right and\n\n194\n00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.790\nI get the spinning beach ball.\n&gt;&gt; I would love to take an Apple guy and\n\n195\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.610\na Windows guy and sit them in a room and\n\n196\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.211\nwatch them point fingers\nat each other over this.\n\n197\n00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:33.936\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n198\n00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:37.320\nAnd it's just like, and then if it, cause\nI've done this like three or four times.\n\n199\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.460\nFour times, it's gonna say,\nI can't convert this.\n\n200\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.380\nI'm gonna get another\nwarning after all of this.\n\n201\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.490\nI was like, okay, it tried to convert,\nit couldn't find the file.\n\n202\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.550\nSo now I've told it where\nthe file needs to go.\n\n203\n00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.540\nGo ahead and\nfind the department and addresses.\n\n204\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.120\nNow I need to convert it again and\nnow I'm spinning again and\n\n205\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.600\nthen eventually it's going to,\neither one or two things is gonna happen.\n\n206\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.530\nIt will.\n\n207\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.360\nOkay, everything's fine.\n\n208\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.200\nIt found the file, and gave me like, okay,\nwhat worksheet do you wanna choose from.\n\n209\n00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.480\nOr you're gonna get a box that\nsays that the encoder, or\n\n210\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.830\nthe converter, cannot work on this file,\nand I can't do what I need to do.\n\n211\n00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.580\nAnd you're like.\n&gt;&gt; And that's when you set\n\n212\n00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.315\nfire to your building.\n\n213\n00:09:17.315 --> 00:09:17.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n214\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.500\nthis is where the frustration comes in.\n\n215\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.900\nOf just like, well, then what's going,\nlet's see, what did it do?\n\n216\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.440\nLook, I'm right back at the same place.\n\n217\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.510\nSo I'm just.\n&gt;&gt; Obviously it's having trouble.\n\n218\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.050\nIt's not gonna do it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n219\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:35.490\nthis is where we originally had it on Mac,\nand then I put it to PC.\n\n220\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.850\nAnd then I brought it back to Mac,\nso I did some translations.\n\n221\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.730\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.650\n&gt;&gt; And set the computer on fire.\n\n383\n00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.020\n&gt;&gt; This is that whole, it worked fine,\n\n384\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.310\nit worked last time.\n\n385\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.030\nI don't know but, hey,\nyou wanna go to this worksheet?\n\n386\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.820\nYes, perfect.\n\n387\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.600\nGreat, wonderful.\n\n388\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.980\nSo I've got this.\n\n389\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.880\nOkay, you saw that it was in\nthe percentages and it had the currency.\n\n390\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.570\nThe cool thing is there is gonna be\na little detour we're gonna take.\n\n391\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.020\nWhen I go to the mailings, and\nI go to preview, cuz I've got the fields.\n\n392\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.470\nLook, you can see first,\nlast, donation, discount,\n\n393\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.490\nthe same ones over in that particular\ndata source and I preview the results.\n\n394\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.790\nWait, uh-oh.\n\n395\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.430\nWhat is this?\n&gt;&gt; What have\n\n396\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.970\nyou done?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n397\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.930\n&gt;&gt; We haven't encountered this one yet,\n\n398\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:43.670\nand I don't think I encountered\nthis in the episodes after this.\n\n399\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.920\nSo this is a good one that I wanted\nto throw out is that, hey guess what,\n\n400\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.120\nit doesn't exist, this is the merge\nfield that is used as a main document.\n\n401\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.900\nIt doesn't exist in the data source.\n\n402\n00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.090\nYou're like wait, donation?\n\n403\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.209\nNo, the donation was there, we saw that.\n&gt;&gt; It's there, I saw it.\n\n404\n00:17:58.209 --> 00:17:59.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n405\n00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.846\nyou're like,\nI don't pay attention half the time.\n\n406\n00:18:01.846 --> 00:18:02.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what I think?\n\n407\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.700\nOffice doesn't know what\nthe heck it's talking about.\n\n408\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.380\n&gt;&gt; This is one\n\n409\n00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.640\nof those white space issues.\n&gt;&gt; I know, and we saw that in last\n\n410\n00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.410\nepisode where it can create some issues.\n&gt;&gt; Gets you every time.\n\n411\n00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.610\nYeah, so look at this and\n\n412\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.730\nthis is the error that will happen\nwhen I'm doing the preview.\n\n413\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.170\nIt says I got on-\n&gt;&gt; Error.\n\n414\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.335\nAt least it's pretty easy to find\nwhen you're just having trouble.\n\n415\n00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:23.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at this one,\n\n416\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.470\ndonation-\n&gt;&gt; Underscore.\n\n417\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:27.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n418\n00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.730\nthe preview it wants to\npull in donation no space.\n\n419\n00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.920\nThis was made on PC.\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n420\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.610\n&gt;&gt; I brought it over to my Mac, so\n\n421\n00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.720\nmaybe there's some weird things but the\ncool is now it's well, no, it does exist.\n\n422\n00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.370\nSo take this donation and\nreplace it with this particular field.\n\n423\n00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.360\nSo you can remap our fields or\nwhere it needs to be.\n\n424\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.370\nOr you can just remove it all together,\nlike nope that was the wrong one,\n\n425\n00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.590\nit doesn't exist.\n\n426\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.890\nSo it can happen from time to time.\n\n427\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.320\nEspecially if you're changing a data\nsource that doesn't have the same fields\n\n428\n00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.000\nand you have that merge field\nwritten in your document.\n\n429\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.490\nThis will kind of throw you off too.\n\n430\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.096\nSo I'm gonna say say nope, go back over\nto donation and I click OK and look.\n\n431\n00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:13.470\nIt kept the dollar sign, the decimal,\nit kept the 20%, cuz it just\n\n432\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.410\nsees it as whatever this value is, I'm\nputting it in, cuz PC does not do this.\n\n433\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.962\nAnd again, it's like,\nwell Mac did this, that's cool,\n\n434\n00:19:20.962 --> 00:19:22.252\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n435\n00:19:22.252 --> 00:19:25.732\nBut then it does this weird\nthing with your Excel converter,\n\n436\n00:19:25.732 --> 00:19:27.788\nand PC doesn't do the formatting.\n\n437\n00:19:27.788 --> 00:19:31.654\nIt makes your head spin a little bit, but\n\n438\n00:19:31.654 --> 00:19:36.447\nI did wanna show that in Mac,\nit does seem to work.\n\n439\n00:19:36.447 --> 00:19:40.870\nBut if it doesn't just incase,\njust go ahead, it's probably easier to\n\n440\n00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.450\nsave everything as a CSV file and call\nit a day cuz that makes it a lot easier.\n\n441\n00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.840\nSo dollar signs, in cell formatting,\nfrom the Excel file,\n\n442\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.406\nas your data force in\nMail Merge from Mac does stay.\n\n443\n00:19:52.406 --> 00:19:52.996\nYeah.\n\n444\n00:19:52.996 --> 00:19:53.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n\n445\n00:19:53.586 --> 00:19:55.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I said\n\n446\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:56.200\nthat right?\n\n447\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:56.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n448\n00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.350\n&gt;&gt; I had to stop myself,\n\n449\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.585\nI think that's right.\n&gt;&gt; Who was that smart person?\n\n450\n00:20:01.585 --> 00:20:02.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right and I would go ahead, and\n\n451\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.100\nsave the changes to this file, cuz I would\nwant it to remember, like donation, and\n\n452\n00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:06.600\ndonation.\n\n453\n00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.780\nThat's why.\nI'm closing it to not save the files,\n\n454\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:14.460\njust so if you guys want to have fun with\nthe mix-match fields and see how it works.\n\n455\n00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.220\nYou're gonna get errors and how it's\ngoing to not find your sources anyways,\n\n456\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.080\ncuz it's coming from my\ncomputer to your computer.\n\n457\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.040\nSo when you're opening\nup these exercise files,\n\n458\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.460\nyou're still gonna have to re-map it.\n\n459\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.090\nI talk about this in the overview.\n\n460\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.540\nYou're gonna have re-connect it and\n\n461\n00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.850\nyou're gonna find the infinite\nloop of frustration.\n\n462\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.660\nHave fun with it, just try and\ncreate your own, and\n\n463\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.045\nkinda use these as your guide to\nwhat to do and what not to do.\n\n464\n00:20:42.045 --> 00:20:45.945\nAnd I do have one more episode\nafter this because there's so\n\n465\n00:20:45.945 --> 00:20:49.255\nmuch problems that [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt;

Yes, yes, totally freaked out.\n\n42\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.172\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the data source,\n\n43\n00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:27.456\nwhen we were trying to connect that like\nkinda weird file in the mail merge in Mac.\n\n44\n00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:30.230\nIt was just like I don't understand,\nI can't do this, right?\n\n45\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.659\nAnd the whole encoder thing,\nand it really just freaked out.\n\n46\n00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.656\nSo this is what sometimes, may happen.\n\n47\n00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:41.728\nI can't exactly tell you\nwhy it happens but it does.\n\n48\n00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:45.767\n&gt;&gt; No consistency to see the pattern\nof why this is occurring.\n\n49\n00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.970\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; Just random fun.\n\n50\n00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.240\n&gt;&gt; Yap, random fun.\n\n51\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.917\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna call it that because-\n&gt;&gt; We'll call it.\n\n52\n00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:56.910\n&gt;&gt; The other word we wanna use\n[LAUGH] is not allowed on here.\n\n53\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.699\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nSo let's look at this one.\n\n54\n00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:04.950\nSo we have a couple CSV files and\nour department and address CSV file.\n\n55\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.232\nIf I open this one up,\nand since it's a CSV file,\n\n56\n00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:09.820\nit's automatically associating\nitself with Excel.\n\n57\n00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.771\nAnd look at here,\neverything looks fine, right?\n\n58\n00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:15.384\nWe have everything in columns,\nfirst name, last name, department,\n\n59\n00:03:15.384 --> 00:03:17.090\neverything's cool, all good.\n\n60\n00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.856\nIt always gives us some warning\nof some data loss, because yes,\n\n61\n00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:22.686\nit is not in Excel file format.\n\n62\n00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:26.008\nIt is the CSV file format, so\nthat's why it gives you this warning,\n\n63\n00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:27.890\nit can't do all kinds of fancy stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.461\nIt's just gonna hold data with\nthe commas as your delimiters.\n\n65\n00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.800\nI'm going to close that file,\nI don't need to save the changes.\n\n66\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.530\nI just changed the column width and\nthat's why it's asking me to do that.\n\n67\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.696\nLook at this one, let's open up this\nfiles, the department addresses order.\n\n68\n00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:48.970\nIt's a CSV file, it came from this\noriginal Excel file that I opened.\n\n69\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.520\nSaves a CSV on my Mac, and\nthen this is what happens.\n\n70\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.799\nWatch, I open this up and it's like,\nHey there, I mean what's going on?\n\n71\n00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.250\n&gt;&gt; So, a second, I can't really see\nit that well, it's a little small.\n\n72\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.671\nBut are there no actual commas?\n\n73\n00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:11.547\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything's in one column.\n\n74\n00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:15.970\nIt's just when I open this up, it's\nopening up everything in a single column.\n\n75\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.619\nYou're like, wait.\n\n76\n00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:20.051\n&gt;&gt; Well now I know a quick way to\nmake the rows into columns [LAUGH].\n\n77\n00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n78\n00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.903\nIt's like,\nI don't understand what's going on here.\n\n79\n00:04:23.903 --> 00:04:27.720\nThere should be multiple columns of like,\nfirst, last, department.\n\n80\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.932\nJust like everything else,\nso why is it doing this?\n\n81\n00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:31.310\nI don't know.\n\n82\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.761\n&gt;&gt; It just made one column.\n\n83\n00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:34.750\n&gt;&gt; And then let's look at this,\nlet's open this up.\n\n84\n00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.847\nWe're going to open this up with\na text editor, so we can see that.\n\n85\n00:04:38.847 --> 00:04:41.939\nBut when I look in here, okay now,\nthis is another indication of what's like,\n\n86\n00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:42.501\nwait, what?\n\n87\n00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:47.567\nLet's do a comparison, okay,\nlet's take this particular file.\n\n88\n00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:49.780\nRemember our CSV file,\nit'll open up just fine.\n\n89\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.112\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We'll open this up with our text\n\n90\n00:04:52.112 --> 00:04:52.738\neditor.\n\n91\n00:04:52.738 --> 00:04:55.577\nAnd if I look, yep, there's commas.\n\n92\n00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.670\n&gt;&gt; Commas.\n&gt;&gt; Comma, comma, comma-\n\n93\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.684\n&gt;&gt; Chameleon.\n\n94\n00:04:58.684 --> 00:05:00.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Chameleon, yeah, so\n\n95\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.424\nwe've got everything going out just\nfine there, but then there's no [LAUGH].\n\n96\n00:05:04.424 --> 00:05:05.690\nAre you making fun of me?\n\n97\n00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.561\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n98\n00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:08.888\n&gt;&gt; You know it happens and I can't stop.\n\n99\n00:05:08.888 --> 00:05:10.167\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:12.241\n&gt;&gt; This doesn't have any commas.\n\n101\n00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:13.398\nNo Comma, Comma.\n\n102\n00:05:13.398 --> 00:05:14.460\n&gt;&gt; No Comma Chameleon.\n\n103\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.530\n&gt;&gt; No Chameleons in here.\n\n104\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.100\n&gt;&gt; Boy George isn't gonna come by and\nsing us a song.\n\n105\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.420\n&gt;&gt; No, and i like run through the fields.\n\n106\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And everything, but\n\n107\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.982\nthat's a different song.\n\n108\n00:05:22.982 --> 00:05:24.577\n&gt;&gt; Interesting hat, though.\n\n109\n00:05:24.577 --> 00:05:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, this is a csv file.\n\n110\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.545\nSomehow you lost your commas.\n\n111\n00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:32.095\nI've dropped a comma and\neverything is not working right,\n\n112\n00:05:32.095 --> 00:05:35.140\nbut I don't understand\nwhat's going on here.\n\n113\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.516\nThis is all in a Mac, everything worked.\n\n114\n00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:41.600\nI don't know why it did that,\nbut it happens.\n\n115\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.605\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n&gt;&gt; This, and\n\n116\n00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:46.064\nsomehow it turned the commas into tabs.\n\n117\n00:05:46.064 --> 00:05:47.850\nOkay, it's still a delimiter.\n\n118\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.550\n&gt;&gt; So just change the delimiter and\nyou're in business?\n\n119\n00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.962\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, and this is the weird thing,\nremember back in the mail merge with PC,\n\n120\n00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:57.564\nwhen we tried to connect this,\ncuz we did the same example.\n\n121\n00:05:57.564 --> 00:05:59.474\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, we saw that it happened.\n\n122\n00:05:59.474 --> 00:06:04.140\nAnd then when we try to connect it in\nWord, it was like nope, I can't find this.\n\n123\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.385\nI don't understand, and it just breaks.\n\n124\n00:06:06.385 --> 00:06:07.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n125\n00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.338\nAll right, this is the weird thing.\n\n126\n00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:14.900\nThis is another weird thing in Word if I'm\ncome in here, you saw the broken file.\n\n127\n00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.576\nLet 's just make sure I\ndon't have it open, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.452\nI do not have it open, okay.\n\n129\n00:06:18.452 --> 00:06:21.855\nAnd let's zoom out a little bit so\nwe don't, we don't need to, but\n\n130\n00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:23.060\ncome over to Mailings.\n\n131\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.750\nCome to Select Recipients,\nchoose an Existing List.\n\n132\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.678\nCome into the desktop and\nmy files and we come in here.\n\n133\n00:06:31.678 --> 00:06:35.320\nWe saw that the ordered one, this is the\none with everything in that one column.\n\n134\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.187\nThere's no commas in there anymore.\n\n135\n00:06:37.187 --> 00:06:41.740\nI open it up, we still get this whole like\nhey, how do you want to converge this.\n\n136\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.562\nI see the tabs in here now like you see?\n\n137\n00:06:44.562 --> 00:06:45.560\nIt says it's task.\n\n138\n00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.262\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there they are.\n\n139\n00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:49.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm like, okay,\nI told you, dot, just click OK.\n\n140\n00:06:49.582 --> 00:06:50.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.298\n&gt;&gt; And it didn't break,\nit still sees everything.\n\n142\n00:06:54.298 --> 00:06:58.665\nIt still sees the fields because.\n\n143\n00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:01.421\n&gt;&gt; Very strange.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it is strange, it works.\n\n144\n00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n145\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.785\n&gt;&gt; So, hey.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\n146\n00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:07.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll work with it and\n\n147\n00:07:07.234 --> 00:07:09.952\nI'm just gonna show you,\nI put these all in and\n\n148\n00:07:09.952 --> 00:07:12.408\nI preview it and yep, everything works.\n\n149\n00:07:12.408 --> 00:07:17.539\nSo I guess like, it doesn't bark at\nyou like the way the PC did like,\n\n150\n00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.520\nI don't understand what's going on.\n\n151\n00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n152\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.546\n&gt;&gt; It still worked.\n\n153\n00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:26.376\nAll right, well then we can\nroll with it and still be okay.\n\n154\n00:07:26.376 --> 00:07:28.400\nI'm not saving the changes.\n\n155\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.527\nBut just in case, if anything,\nwhere you just like, this list,\n\n156\n00:07:31.527 --> 00:07:32.644\nI can't live with this.\n\n157\n00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:38.223\nIt needs to be in columns when I\nopen it up as a CSV file in Excel.\n\n158\n00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:40.873\nThere is a workaround just in case,\nit's like,\n\n159\n00:07:40.873 --> 00:07:44.119\nbecause maybe you might try to\nconnect it and it does break.\n\n160\n00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:49.000\nIt's like, I don't understand,\nI can't get this back, I can't see it.\n\n161\n00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.664\nThere's a workaround where you\ncan take a csv file, okay?\n\n162\n00:07:52.664 --> 00:07:55.032\nThe one that was broken, the one\nthat didn't have the commas anymore.\n\n163\n00:07:55.032 --> 00:08:00.519\nYou open up in your text editor,\nyou select all, CTL + a.\n\n164\n00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.886\nYou copy, sorry we're in Mac, command a.\n\n165\n00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:07.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On the PC shows you do Mac commands.\n\n166\n00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.738\nWe're on the Mac shows she\ndoes PC commands [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:12.075\n&gt;&gt; Is every time.\n\n168\n00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.961\nIt's so hard to keep my brain in order.\n\n169\n00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:17.720\nSo we're gonna do Command-C for\ncopy, cuz this does have a delimiter.\n\n170\n00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.600\nIt is a, and\nthey're consistent delimiters.\n\n171\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.910\nYou can take this open up Excel.\n\n172\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:30.170\nBring into a blank worksheet and\njust command V, paste, and there we go.\n\n173\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.910\n&gt;&gt; The heavens open, the angels descend,\none long note and there's your file.\n\n174\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.040\n&gt;&gt; And then you take this.\n\n175\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.600\n&gt;&gt; And you use it as a data source.\n\n176\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.760\n&gt;&gt; And you save it as a CSV file from\nhere, hopefully it doesn't break again.\n\n177\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.230\nAnd then you've got a CSV file with\nactual commas and then you can use it.\n\n178\n00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.160\nBut again, it didn't bark at me when\nI used that wierd tab, limited,\n\n179\n00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.050\nbut it's a csv file.\n\n180\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.480\nIt still saw it.\n\n181\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.630\nSo, but\nthis is kind of a general work around.\n\n182\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.880\nIf any of your csv files get\na little wierd, or any delimited.\n\n183\n00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.320\nThis could be your text delimited,\nthe txt with the tabs.\n\n184\n00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.600\nMaybe that got weirded out or whatever.\n\n185\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.000\nIf they are consistent delimiters, you\nshould be able to copy it as plaintext,\n\n186\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.460\nopening it up in your notepad,\nor text editor, or whatever.\n\n187\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.130\nCopy it, paste it right into Excel, don't\ndo anything else, just paste it right in.\n\n188\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.350\nAnd it should go ahead,\ncolumnize itself, and\n\n189\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.230\nmake its rows, and\neverything should be fine.\n\n190\n00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.490\nYou can save this as an Excel CSV,\nand move on with your merry life.\n\n191\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.570\nThat's the work around.\n\n192\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.680\n&gt;&gt; And it seems pretty simple\nto do it wasn't some crazy,\n\n193\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.350\nokay you're gonna have to hold shift and\ncommand here.\n\n194\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.960\nAnd then here's the kicker you know\nyou gotta learn to program in C++ but\n\n195\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.905\nonce you do that.\n\n196\n00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:48.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really just copy paste,\n\n197\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.950\njust make sure you don't select\nanything in Excel first,\n\n198\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.900\njust go right into paste\nright in that first cell.\n\n199\n00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.310\nAnd it should find its way around itself.\n\n200\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, now used the operative\nword there should, which is always fun.\n\n201\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:09.310\nDoes that mean that this is probably or\ncould maybe not work sometimes?\n\n202\n00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.120\n&gt;&gt; Probably most likely maybe.\n\n203\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.980\n[LAUGH] It is one of those things\nthat it's a work around and\n\n204\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.810\nyeah, it should probably work and it's one\nof those, if somebody's standing there,\n\n205\n00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.710\nand you try to show them, no, look it's\nnot working, and then it magically works.\n\n206\n00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Can't guarantee 100%\naccuracy on the work.\n\n207\n00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:32.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but if it is properly delimited\nand I know we said that a couple times.\n\n208\n00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.450\nThat's the biggest emphasis right there.\n\n209\n00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:38.570\nAs long as you're the limiters are in the\nright place and they're all consistent,\n\n210\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.060\nyou should be able to be cool with that.\n\n211\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n212\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.850\n&gt;&gt; Now that being said,\nwhat if they're not in the right place?\n\n213\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.620\nWhat if I have some missing delimiters or\n\n214\n00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.840\nextra delimiters that's going to cause\nyou a whole other set of problems.\n\n215\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.765\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n220\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.780\nwhy dont I show you about that when you\nhave some extra or missing delimiters.\n\n221\n00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.480\nSo lets just go ahead and\nwe can close this.\n\n222\n00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.120\nOne that we had copied and pasted and so\nwe'll just go ahead and we'll just quit.\n\n223\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.920\nWe'll do a command+Q out of this.\n\n224\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.970\nI don't have to save our, back here.\n\n225\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:19.690\nWe have our other CSV file in our\ntext editor that we were looking at.\n\n226\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.140\nLet's look at this particular file.\n\n227\n00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.680\nSo this is a depart and team colors.\n\n228\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.990\nIt's a CSV,\nlet's open it up in the text editor.\n\n229\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.890\nI'm specifically not opening it up in\nExcel just to kind of give us a little bit\n\n230\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.560\nof a vantage point.\n\n231\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.900\nSo we have first,\nlast department team color.\n\n232\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.270\nSo that's one, two, three, four,\n\n233\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.320\nfour columns because we know that wherever\nthere's a comma there's a delimiter.\n\n234\n00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.060\nAnd then we have [INAUDIBLE].\n\n235\n00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.850\n&gt;&gt;

We should delimit how many times.\n\n325\n00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:14.763\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n326\n00:16:14.763 --> 00:16:16.100\nLet's separate that out, right?\n\n327\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.174\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll separate that out.\n\n328\n00:16:17.174 --> 00:16:18.089\n&gt;&gt; I just got it.\n\n329\n00:16:18.089 --> 00:16:20.426\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyways,\n\n330\n00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:26.710\nwe're gonna move back onto our last\nexample, which is the word table.\n\n331\n00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.440\nIn the previous episode,\nin the part one, I said,\n\n332\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.240\nas long as you have a single table with no\nother information, then you'll be fine.\n\n333\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.990\nWell, if you don't, and\n\n334\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.520\nthis is the thing with using this\nparticular file format as a data source,\n\n335\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:46.110\nis a lot of times with Word, I'm going\nto have extra information, like a title,\n\n336\n00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.370\nand maybe a subtitle, and extra\nparagraphs, and everything like that.\n\n337\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.770\nI don't think about Word as,\n\n338\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.530\nI'm going to use this in\na tabular format to store my data.\n\n339\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:17:00.612\nI just don't, but it's a possibility,\nso might as well cover it, right?\n\n340\n00:17:00.612 --> 00:17:02.780\n[LAUGH] So, it's got extra information.\n\n341\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:08.100\nSo when I, I just did a command W,\nI'm doing a command N for\n\n342\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.590\nfile new, because I'm still in\nWord as my active application.\n\n343\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.910\nNow that I have a new document,\ncoming over to mailings and\n\n344\n00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.130\nselecting the recipients\nfrom our existing list,\n\n345\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:25.070\nI will choose that file that we just\nsaw with that extra information.\n\n346\n00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:29.392\nAnd when we open this, I'll just double\nclick it, we got that same warning that\n\n347\n00:17:29.392 --> 00:17:32.874\nwe just saw with the too many fields,\ncan't find my delimiter,\n\n348\n00:17:32.874 --> 00:17:36.390\ncuz I don't understand what's\ngoing on here, same thing.\n\n349\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.150\nWhere's your field delimiter?\n\n350\n00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.750\nAnd you're like, well,\nit's a word table, so it's a column.\n\n351\n00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.240\nBut they don't have column as a delimiter,\nso\n\n352\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.480\nmaybe you just go with\na lets go with the tab.\n\n353\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.800\nOkay, sure, and then, the record enter, or\nthe record delimiter, is the enter key.\n\n354\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.550\nYou click okay, and it'll still connect.\n\n355\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.430\nThe thing is, look at what our fields say,\ndoesn't say anything about first and last,\n\n356\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.720\nand I think it was department was the last\ncolumn, explain that first paragraph,\n\n357\n00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.540\nthat title that we had.\n\n358\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.380\nAnd so, you could insert it, but\nit's just gonna and I use my preview.\n\n359\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.122\nNow, that's like the next paragraph,\nand then,\n\n360\n00:18:13.122 --> 00:18:16.670\nthe next paragraph that was blank, blank,\nand then, the whole table by itself.\n\n361\n00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.693\nSo it's almost seeing your paragraphs as\nyour fields, which is not what you want.\n\n362\n00:18:21.693 --> 00:18:25.446\nSo the moral of the story would be, maybe\none, don't use word as your data source.\n\n363\n00:18:25.446 --> 00:18:26.014\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n364\n00:18:26.014 --> 00:18:26.787\n&gt;&gt; Or Word table as your data source.\n\n365\n00:18:26.787 --> 00:18:32.696\nOr if you are, you have to make sure that\nit is a single table, no other information\n\n366\n00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:38.007\nin the file, and that's the only way\nthat it can kind of read it as a tabular\n\n367\n00:18:38.007 --> 00:18:43.061\ndata source with the first line, or\nthe first row, as your headers and\n\n368\n00:18:43.061 --> 00:18:48.780\nyour fields, and then, you can insert\nit into your mail merge in Word.\n\n369\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.871\nSo, there you go.\n\n370\n00:18:49.871 --> 00:18:51.464\nSo now, we've covered [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n371\n00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.966\n&gt;&gt; All of the different file formats and\n\n372\n00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.662\nthe troubleshooting and\n\n373\n00:18:55.662 --> 00:19:00.111\nissues you might encounter when\nyou're using an existing list.\n\n374\n00:19:00.111 --> 00:19:02.990\nSo that will conclude\nour little miniseries.\n\n375\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.120\nBut again, I really just wanted to\nmake sure that you guys saw me go\n\n376\n00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.728\nthrough the same problems\nyou are most likely to\n\n377\n00:19:11.728 --> 00:19:17.500\n[LAUGH] encounter and give you a little\nbit of back story on some of it.\n\n378\n00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.680\nAnd hopefully, everything will\nwork out just peachy keen, and\n\n379\n00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.780\nyou won't have to pull your hair out.\n\n380\n00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.420\n&gt;&gt;

Wow, that's another great point, too.\n\n62\n00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.640\nI'ts like, I did the same thing.\n\n63\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.810\nI'll go ahead and add it to my contacts,\n\n64\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.740\nbut it's not like a real contact,\nit's not my business people.\n\n65\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.020\nIt's not the place that I personally\nam going to think about storing my\n\n66\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.200\ndata on either my customers or\nmy employees, or anything like that.\n\n67\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.741\nIt's just not going to be me personally,\n\n68\n00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:10.081\nwhere I'm going to do that cuz I kinda\nhave it when it comes to my contacts.\n\n69\n00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:12.883\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of like a weird\n\n70\n00:03:12.883 --> 00:03:18.080\nsituation, because in today's day and age,\nwhere we have that, I was gonna say merge.\n\n71\n00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.130\nBut that's [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n72\n00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.931\n&gt;&gt; No pun intended.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:23.668\n&gt;&gt; But where we see more of our personal\n\n74\n00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:27.600\nand business devices being\nused as one in the same.\n\n75\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.430\nSo being able to separate your\nbusiness account and have\n\n76\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.930\nthose contacts being used for business is\nprobably where we're heading here, right?\n\n77\n00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, definitely.\n\n78\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.290\nI mean, all of these factors are going\nto come into play as to why you may or\n\n79\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.760\nmay not honestly use your contacts for\ntheir mail merge.\n\n80\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.490\nBut there's plenty of people I know\nout there that are really meticulous\n\n81\n00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.160\nabout their Outlook contacts and\nhaving that separator for work.\n\n82\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.867\nAnd they'd only put their\nwork contacts in there and\n\n83\n00:03:55.867 --> 00:04:00.980\nthey're at that level of organized\nthat this could be perfect for them.\n\n84\n00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.347\nIf they're going to do a letter blast for\n\n85\n00:04:04.347 --> 00:04:09.012\ntheir Christmas cats super\ncostume that's coming up.\n\n86\n00:04:09.012 --> 00:04:12.750\nAnd you're like,\nI have all my business contacts and\n\n87\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.480\ncustomers in my Outlook contacts,\nso use that.\n\n88\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.350\nSo it just depends on where you're at.\n\n89\n00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.328\nBut ideally, the point that you just said,\nI'll throw in the parking or\n\n90\n00:04:24.328 --> 00:04:29.713\nwhat have you, because when you're using\nyour contacts as your data source,\n\n91\n00:04:29.713 --> 00:04:32.470\nit's gonna pull in everything.\n\n92\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.560\nI mean, every single contact that you\nhave in there, that's gonna be there.\n\n93\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.780\nSo that's that other level\nof kind of not being able to\n\n94\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.472\nfully control-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n95\n00:04:42.472 --> 00:04:43.332\n&gt;&gt; What you want.\n\n96\n00:04:43.332 --> 00:04:46.356\nNow once we get into the sorting,\nand the filtering, and\n\n97\n00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:50.650\nthe rules that you can apply on this, you\ncould probably filter some of that out.\n\n98\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.700\nBut again,\nit grabs everything in there, so-\n\n99\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.220\n&gt;&gt; All or nothing.\n\n100\n00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mm-hm, so make sure that you're\naware of how it's going to pull out, so.\n\n101\n00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n102\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.740\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah good points all around,\nwhen we're talking about context.\n\n103\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.790\nNow, why don't we do this?\n\n104\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.850\nWhy don't we jump down into here,\ninto my computer, and\n\n105\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.390\njust to show you that I\njust have a blank document.\n\n106\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.470\nAnd just to remind us of the process\nof selecting recipients.\n\n107\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.072\nGetting that data source that's right\nhere and we were going over the lists.\n\n108\n00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:25.180\nAnd then we have in our drop down\nchoose from Outlook contacts and\n\n109\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.590\nyour Apple contacts.\n\n110\n00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.555\nOkay, I have both, right?\n\n111\n00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:33.000\nI'm gonna open up Outlook,\njust to remind us really quickly,\n\n112\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.225\nby the way I just did the spotlight which\nis a command space bar is your keyboard\n\n113\n00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:40.610\nshortcut to pull that up so\nyou know the shortcuts that I know.\n\n114\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.090\nIt's one of those things that I just do\nit, and I gotta make sure to remind you-\n\n115\n00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.890\n&gt;&gt; No, I had to think about it and\n\n116\n00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.468\nI'm like, okay, that's right,\nI'm not on a Mac, so-\n\n117\n00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:47.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, you look like,\n\n118\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.250\nI don't remember that thing, so.\n\n119\n00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So here we go, and I've actually\n\n120\n00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:55.810\ndone some different tests for\nthe email parts of these episodes.\n\n121\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.813\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So if you're like,\n\n122\n00:05:56.813 --> 00:05:57.940\nwhat's going on here?\n\n123\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.440\nYeah, you'll see more of that later.\n\n124\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.462\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I really [LAUGH] wanna\n\n125\n00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:02.070\nget into our contacts.\n\n126\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.910\nI don't have a lot but I just wanted\nto get some examples here of,\n\n127\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.540\nI've got them all in here and\nwe have Joey and we've got Renee.\n\n128\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.120\nNotice Renee has some address in here,\nJoey doesn't, and\n\n129\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.711\nthat's what I was saying.\n\n130\n00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:16.635\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; For all of your contact or\n\n131\n00:06:16.635 --> 00:06:20.215\nRonnie I just have your name and\nand your email.\n\n132\n00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:22.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't need your address,\n\n133\n00:06:22.575 --> 00:06:23.382\nI don't need all of that.\n\n134\n00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.878\n&gt;&gt; That's why I never get\nyour Christmas cards Vonne?\n\n135\n00:06:25.878 --> 00:06:28.576\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Actually.\n\n136\n00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:31.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n137\n00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.711\nI don't have that fully filled out and\nmaybe that's why you didn't get.\n\n138\n00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.755\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You got me [INAUDIBLE] for me, so.\n\n139\n00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:40.343\n[LAUGH] But you can see that\nwe've got all of them in here.\n\n140\n00:06:40.343 --> 00:06:42.350\nAnd that's what it's pulling from.\n\n141\n00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.533\nYou can organize them.\n\n142\n00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:49.840\nBut again, like I said before, it doesn't\nmatter how many folders you have.\n\n143\n00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.153\nCuz if you like to organize it,\nit's gonna pull all of them, okay?\n\n144\n00:06:53.153 --> 00:06:56.860\nThere's no discrepancy here or\ndiscrimination if you wanna say.\n\n145\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.640\nWe're getting them all in there.\n\n146\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.290\nSo just to kind of remind you, I do\nhave Outlook I have established this is\n\n147\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:10.280\nthe program that I use for my Office Pro\ndemo for Justin Timberlake's e-mail.\n\n148\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.910\nI'm gonna do a command Q\njust to just quit that.\n\n149\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.420\nSo if I come into here and say let's go\nahead and chose my Outlook contacts, and\n\n150\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.190\nyou're like, okay, what happened?\n\n151\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.189\nIt did it, just like when we did that\nWord table, you just have to know, and\n\n152\n00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.964\nhow do I know?\n\n153\n00:07:24.964 --> 00:07:27.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, you checked up, there you go.\n\n154\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.107\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\nYou remember.\n\n155\n00:07:28.107 --> 00:07:28.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:29.940\n&gt;&gt; But look at what you've got here.\n\n157\n00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.324\nThat's a bunch of stuff, because-\n&gt;&gt; Way more than you had before.\n\n158\n00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:39.974\n&gt;&gt; Because think about\nhow your Outlook contact,\n\n159\n00:07:39.974 --> 00:07:45.460\nwe have all of these fields that\nare available for you to use in Outlook.\n\n160\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.630\nSo where Outlook stores your\ncontacts is in a big database.\n\n161\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.792\n&gt;&gt; Well that's pretty cool because\nthen you could use those individual\n\n162\n00:07:54.792 --> 00:07:59.242\nlittle grains of information\nto really select and choose.\n\n163\n00:07:59.242 --> 00:08:02.998\nLike if I had a sale on my\nSoutheastern region, or whatever,\n\n164\n00:08:02.998 --> 00:08:08.400\nI could pick by state, or zip code, or\nsomething to really target an audience.\n\n165\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.002\n&gt;&gt; If I have that information filled out.\n\n166\n00:08:10.002 --> 00:08:11.127\n&gt;&gt; If you have it all filled out.\n\n167\n00:08:11.127 --> 00:08:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a field for\nbirthday or anniversary.\n\n168\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.710\nThose are, spouse, cuz I know\nthat's like in the other tab but\n\n169\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.170\nagain if you're very meticulous\nabout this and you have birthdays,\n\n170\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.770\nyou could select birthday as a field,\nthen you could filter it when we get into\n\n171\n00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.175\nthat like only October birthdays or\nsomething.\n\n172\n00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:30.910\nSo yeah,\nit's just a different data stores.\n\n173\n00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.506\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nBut the cool thing is it's going to pull\n\n174\n00:08:33.506 --> 00:08:36.100\nin everything and every single field.\n\n175\n00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.090\nSo it all depends on how much\nyou use your contacts, cool.\n\n176\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.659\nAnd that's really it, but\nthere's of course so much more, right?\n\n177\n00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:48.370\n[LAUGH] Let's go back over here to,\n\n178\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.510\nall right well maybe I wanna\nuse my Apple contacts.\n\n179\n00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.430\nLet's come down into,\nthis is just my regular operating system,\n\n180\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.020\nhere's my contacts.\n\n181\n00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.430\nAnd again, this is why I use two\ndifferent accounts because this is\n\n182\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.560\nJustin's contacts, otherwise-\n&gt;&gt; Are we going to be Face timing\n\n183\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.765\nwith Justin Timberlake?\n\n184\n00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:06.587\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would be amazing.\n\n185\n00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:09.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My dream is hopefully one day he hears\n\n186\n00:09:09.152 --> 00:09:13.206\nabout this and he's just gonna\ncome walking into the set and\n\n187\n00:09:13.206 --> 00:09:14.785\ndo an episode with me.\n\n188\n00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.928\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or even Brittney.\n\n189\n00:09:16.928 --> 00:09:17.428\n&gt;&gt; Ma'am-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:19.321\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be amazing?\n\n191\n00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:20.060\nAnd then you and\n\n192\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.515\nI would just be like, my gosh!\n\n193\n00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:22.292\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A girl can dream.\n\n194\n00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:22.792\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n195\n00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:25.082\n&gt;&gt; But notice that in my Outlook,\n\n196\n00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:29.574\nno these are my Apple contacts,\nI have like Pumpkin Cat, and\n\n197\n00:09:29.574 --> 00:09:33.422\nI have Antel Lope and I have Puma.\nSame idea, just a different place of\n\n198\n00:09:33.422 --> 00:09:36.030\nwhere I'm storing it.\nSo I have contact, right?\n\n199\n00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.590\nCommand+Q to close that.\n\n200\n00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.400\nSo I come over here and I go,\nyep, let me go ahead and do this.\n\n201\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.220\nAnd I was like, nope, you can't do that.\n\n202\n00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.390\nWait I just saw it.\n\n203\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.075\nWhat's going on here?\n\n204\n00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:47.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n205\n00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.250\n&gt;&gt; This is the kicker, okay?\n\n206\n00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.963\nWhen you're gonna use your contacts,\nit all depends on\n\n207\n00:09:53.963 --> 00:09:58.688\nyour default mail application-\n&gt;&gt; Settings in\n\n208\n00:09:58.688 --> 00:10:03.860\nyour Operating System/your Apple mail.\n\n209\n00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.310\nSo it'll go to pull that first and\n\n210\n00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.290\nwhatever is first is gonna be the one\nthat you can potentially use.\n\n211\n00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:08.850\n&gt;&gt; You can only use one or the other.\n\n212\n00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.178\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And it all depends on,\n\n213\n00:10:10.178 --> 00:10:15.090\nlike you're saying, which one you told it\nto cuz this was kinda the thing I'm like,\n\n214\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.522\nit's working, right?\n\n215\n00:10:16.522 --> 00:10:19.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why would you give me both options?\n\n216\n00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.471\nNow it's all about your\ndefault mail settings, okay?\n\n217\n00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:26.047\nAnd another one,\nI'm just gonna fill this out I don't\n\n218\n00:10:26.047 --> 00:10:31.210\nhave an option right now because I don't\nhave any other recipients in here.\n\n219\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.310\nLet's try this oops, hold on.\n\n220\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.577\nSorry I'm gonna back up.\nOne second,\n\n221\n00:10:34.577 --> 00:10:37.560\nlet's just do this really quickly.\n\n222\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.620\nI'm not actually sure exactly what I'm\ndoing we'll get exactly to that when we\n\n223\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.870\ncompose a letter but you see right\nhere I've finished the merged email?\n\n224\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.080\nThis was grayed out for me.\n\n225\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.710\nWhen I first started prepping for\nthese shows and everything like that and\n\n226\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.958\nI'm like, why is that grayed out?\n\n227\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.930\nBecause on this particular account,\nyeah, I use Outlook, right?\n\n228\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.330\nI taught a whole show on it.\n\n229\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.780\nI use Word, I have everything\nestablished as my Office 365,\n\n230\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.370\nbut this account,\nit was still thinking that my mail\n\n231\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.800\nwas my default was my default email\neditor and default email program.\n\n232\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.350\nSo this only connects to Outlook.\n\n233\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.180\nSo that's why this merge to email\nwas grayed out, cuz it's saying,\n\n234\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.404\nI don't see this because you-\n&gt;&gt; I'm already in a committed relationship\n\n235\n00:11:24.404 --> 00:11:25.000\nto Microsoft.\n\n236\n00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n237\n00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:28.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so you can only use Outlook,\n\n238\n00:11:28.558 --> 00:11:32.012\nand so you need to go ahead and\nmarry these two together, and\n\n239\n00:11:32.012 --> 00:11:33.850\nthat's what we had to do.\n\n240\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.400\nSo that was like, all right.\n\n241\n00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.960\nThat's the the biggest one.\n\n242\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.120\nNow, setting your default mail program and\n\n243\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.810\nI'm actually I think I\nrealize that I closed, did I?\n\n244\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.110\nNo, there it is yeah.\n\n245\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.259\nLike I thought I opened this\nup before this shows started.\n\n246\n00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:53.870\n[LAUGH] Right here, how do you set\nyour default email app on your Mac.\n\n247\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.059\nI had to look this up,\nI couldn't remember [LAUGH].\n\n248\n00:11:56.059 --> 00:12:01.150\nAll right, cuz, again, you can still use\nOutlook without this being your default.\n\n249\n00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.360\nCuz I don't use the Mail app,\nI just always use Outlook.\n\n250\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:11.464\nBut you have to have it set up in the Mail\napp that you want to use Outlook.\n\n251\n00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:12.950\nOkay, cool.\n\n252\n00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.930\nSo you can see that these are the steps.\n\n253\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.060\nSo let me pull this up.\n\n254\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.520\nNow, I don't know about you,\n\n255\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.540\nCherokee, how long it's been since you've\nused a Macintosh Operating System.\n\n256\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.955\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, hardly ever.\n\n257\n00:12:22.955 --> 00:12:24.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n258\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, the very first time, or maybe\nlike any time you first set up Outlook.\n\n259\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.865\nDo you give that the-\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I've set it up for people, but\n\n260\n00:12:29.865 --> 00:12:32.370\nI just personally am not an avid Mac user.\n\n261\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n262\n00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.294\n&gt;&gt; You know that first window that comes\n\n263\n00:12:35.294 --> 00:12:38.196\nup where it's like choose Google, or AOL.\n\n264\n00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:39.216\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:40.102\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and\n\n266\n00:12:40.102 --> 00:12:41.236\nyou pick a little button and\n\n267\n00:12:41.236 --> 00:12:42.772\nthen you type in your information.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n268\n00:12:42.772 --> 00:12:43.593\n&gt;&gt; And you can,\n\n269\n00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:48.295\nthe thing is [LAUGH] you can't get to\nthe preferences of where you need to go in\n\n270\n00:12:48.295 --> 00:12:52.230\nyour Mail program until you\nset up at least one account.\n\n271\n00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.026\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; So you can't have it just\n\n272\n00:12:54.026 --> 00:12:54.640\nbe blank\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n273\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.626\n&gt;&gt; So, if you are like, yeah but\n\n274\n00:12:56.626 --> 00:13:00.915\nI am never going to use this Mail program,\nI still have an account\n\n275\n00:13:00.915 --> 00:13:05.141\nconnected to my Office 365 to\neven get the app to work at all.\n\n276\n00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:05.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n277\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.050\n&gt;&gt; So on that first window, even if\nyou're never gonna use it, go ahead and\n\n278\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:15.560\njust connect it to a Gmail, a Yahoo,\nyour Office 365, it doesn't matter.\n\n279\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.630\nJust so you can have it establish, okay?\n\n280\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.702\nI got something because then you\ncould come into your preferences and\n\n281\n00:13:22.702 --> 00:13:26.857\nonce you're in preferences see\nright there, default email reader.\n\n282\n00:13:26.857 --> 00:13:31.345\nI had to tell it to stop being on this and\nto go to Outlook.\n\n283\n00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n284\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:40.110\n&gt;&gt; And once I did this in my Mail app\nthen my Outlook became my default,\n\n285\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.920\nmy Outlook contacts is what Word\nis going to be able to recognize.\n\n286\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.440\nAnd it will be able to finally do my\nemailing and it stops recognizing,\n\n287\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.638\nback in my mail merge, for me to ever\nbe able to use my Apple contacts.\n\n288\n00:13:52.638 --> 00:13:54.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n289\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.990\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I just went in 15 circles.\n\n290\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is definitely\nnot the most fluid process,\n\n291\n00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.490\nit was a lot easier having\nthat established list.\n\n292\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.270\nSo I don't know, I think there might be\nsome pros and cons to that, because if\n\n293\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.530\nyou're used to working within changing\non the fly your contacts, then you might\n\n294\n00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:18.040\nwanna go through this process instead of\nhaving a dedicated spreadsheet or list.\n\n295\n00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.361\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's static, well I guess\nany of our data sources aren't totally\n\n296\n00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.249\nstatic-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n297\n00:14:22.249 --> 00:14:23.681\n&gt;&gt; Because we can always add to it,\nbut, yeah, it's-\n\n298\n00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:25.670\n&gt;&gt; It's a preference thing, really.\n\n299\n00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Totally, and even if you're not ever\ngonna use your contacts as your data\n\n300\n00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:36.690\nsource to compose your letters or\nyour mailing labels or anything.\n\n301\n00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.440\nIf you're gonna be doing mass mails,\n\n302\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.790\nlike emailing, send out a mass email,\nyou still have to do this step.\n\n303\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:49.230\nYou still have to set up the Outlook\nas your default mail editor.\n\n304\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.420\nCuz that, like I said, that finish button,\nthe one that says like,\n\n305\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.910\nsend it out to email,\nit won't work unless it's a set.\n\n306\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.438\nSo it has like a double meaning,\ndouble entendre.\n\n307\n00:15:00.438 --> 00:15:01.120\n&gt;&gt; Entendre.\n\n308\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.989\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that whole thing.\n\n309\n00:15:01.989 --> 00:15:03.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like it's applicable to multiple\n\n310\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.712\nthings, not just this one thing\nwe're talking about with data\n\n311\n00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:08.000\nsources, so-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n312\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's something you\ndefinitely need to be careful about.\n\n313\n00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.935\nAnd can I just throw this out here,\njust in case, cuz I've had people ask\n\n314\n00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:20.909\nme this before, they're like, so\nif I'm gonna use my mail contacts,\n\n315\n00:15:20.909 --> 00:15:25.430\nthat's only if I want to do a mass\nmail-merge with email, right?\n\n316\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.970\nI'm like no, it's just the data source.\n\n317\n00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.460\nYou can still be composing\n\n318\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.960\nlike printed letters is just\nyou're using that data source.\n\n319\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.250\nSo don't correlate your\n\n320\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:44.670\nmail contacts as a data source\nconnected to only to do email.\n\n321\n00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.630\nIt's a two separate things, okay?\n\n322\n00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:53.000\nIt's just the list of recipients and\nwhere that data source lives.\n\n323\n00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.255\nSo that's the biggest thing\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n324\n00:15:57.255 --> 00:16:02.195\nAnd then one thing, hey maybe you do\nuse your contacts a decent amount.\n\n325\n00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:08.610\nBecause back over here, remember\nwhen we were back into our mail and\n\n326\n00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.930\nit had all of these fields, you're\njust like, I don't need all of these.\n\n327\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.321\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You might wanna maybe export your\n\n328\n00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:20.510\nOutlook, or your Apple contacts,\ninto a CSV format.\n\n329\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Then you can modify the CSV format.\n\n330\n00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.270\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking that, but\nwasn't able to get it out there before and\n\n331\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.920\nsaying hey, that might be an easier\nway to go about doing this.\n\n332\n00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Unless you just already,\n\n333\n00:16:31.405 --> 00:16:34.918\nit works for you, you get it, you're\ncomfortable, and you remember those steps.\n\n334\n00:16:34.918 --> 00:16:38.370\n&gt;&gt; And it is one extra step that\nI don't necessarily have to do.\n\n335\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.748\nCuz it's all right there,\nwhy would I want to?\n\n336\n00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:40.955\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n337\n00:16:40.955 --> 00:16:46.150\n&gt;&gt; But again, especially if I'm doing\nsomething for a specific project or\n\n338\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:51.101\nlike quarter one sales, I know how\nmuch my mail context fluctuates.\n\n339\n00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:53.690\nLike the parking example we just did.\n\n340\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.688\nI kind of want a snapshot-\n&gt;&gt;

Right, usually,\ndon't we pay someone for that?\n\n25\n00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:14.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n26\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.190\nwe contact somebody in our department.\n\n27\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.680\nBut like, hey, go ahead and\nget all that stuff for my database.\n\n28\n00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.860\nWe talked about this in\nsome of our other episodes.\n\n29\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.850\n&gt;&gt;

You can do, yeah,\nexactly, it's on the fly.\n\n52\n00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:29.355\nI don't really have any other way,\nand I have to go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:30.585\ndo this merge really quickly.\n\n54\n00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:34.055\nBut I only have like, maybe six or\nseven entries, I could go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:37.040\nthrow in six or\nseven entries with a couple columns.\n\n56\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.500\n&gt;&gt; And there we go,\nlet's go ahead and do this out.\n\n57\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.340\nRather than like the whole\nokay you could do one letter,\n\n58\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.220\nsomething in Word then you do what?\n\n59\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.138\nSelect, copy, paste, change,\nselect, copy, paste, change, okay.\n\n60\n00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:51.455\nJust throw it into Mail Merge.\n\n61\n00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:54.107\nIf you need to have it you know, export or\n\n62\n00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:58.700\nfinish that merge product with a letter,\nso on and so forth.\n\n63\n00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.370\nJust keep that in mind as to when,\nand why you might need to use this.\n\n64\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.700\nCool, so why do we go ahead and\ntake a look at it, and\n\n65\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.180\nsee how we can make our own list.\n\n66\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.130\nI have Word.\n\n67\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.930\nLet's just start a blank document,\nright there, and we will create it.\n\n68\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.730\nHere we go.\n\n69\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.460\nGreat.\nSame thing we've been doing in\n\n70\n00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.890\nthese last couple episodes.\n\n71\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.320\nWe're going to go over\nto our mailings tab, and\n\n72\n00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.760\nwe're going to come over\nto select recipients.\n\n73\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.150\nChoose a new list,\nlet's go through the steps.\n\n74\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.470\nAnd now we go into our edit\nlist fields dialogue box.\n\n75\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.120\nSo your gonna have to establish\n\n76\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.440\nwhat fields you're gonna\nwant in this data source.\n\n77\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.680\nNow, they have some that are pre-made for\nus, cause things like, look first name,\n\n78\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.080\nlast name, company address, city, state,\nhome phone, work phone because again\n\n79\n00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.810\nthis are the common fields that people are\ngonna use for mail merges and anything.\n\n80\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.300\nSo they say hey well we have this\nestablished, why don't you go ahead and\n\n81\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.030\nuse these fields.\n\n82\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.710\nI don't really want half of this fields\nbecause I don't need them, all right.\n\n83\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.520\nSo you can first start off\nwith the field names list.\n\n84\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.570\nAnd then right down here,\nsee there's like a little minus sign.\n\n85\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.730\nI don't need, and so\nI'll just show it right there.\n\n86\n00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.940\nSee right there?\n\n87\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.160\nI don't need the work phone.\n\n88\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.400\nSo I single click it and\nthen I click the minus sign.\n\n89\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.390\nCome over to home phone,\ndon't worry that its populating over here,\n\n90\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.880\nwe'll come back to it in a minute.\n\n91\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.230\nI'm just editing the current default list,\n\n92\n00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.410\nall the fields are giving to me its\nlike I don't need any of these things.\n\n93\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.490\nI don't need the city, I don't need\nthe state, I don't need the address.\n\n94\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.749\nOkay, keep on going [LAUGH].\n\n95\n00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.129\nYou can see I'm going to keep on, there we\ngo and I'm going to take away the title.\n\n96\n00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.200\nYou know what, first name and\nlast name, that's pretty good.\n\n97\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.820\nI guess I should tell you what we're\nmaking a quick little list of.\n\n98\n00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.400\nWe're making a list of\nt-shirt sizes on the fly for\n\n99\n00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.570\nmaybe an upcoming company picnic.\n\n100\n00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.830\nAnd I know there's gonna be like seven\npeople that need to order shirts.\n\n101\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.560\nJust gonna go ahead and do this right now.\n\n102\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.280\nJust figured, that's what I wanna do.\n\n103\n00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.770\nAll right, so\n\n104\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.400\nnow I've got first name and last name\nin my list but I would need shirt size.\n\n105\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Your own fields.\n\n106\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I need my own fields.\n\n107\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.170\nNow I'm gonna create my custom fields\nthat I want to have in this data list.\n\n108\n00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.900\nSo let's type in shirt.\n\n109\n00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.762\nNow, something to note\nabout these field names.\n\n110\n00:05:23.762 --> 00:05:28.276\nShirt, space, size, I'm pretty sure,\nyep, it won't give me this,\n\n111\n00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:32.280\nyou see down there, I should be\nable to click the plus Plus sign.\n\n112\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.600\nBut it's not letting me, why?\n\n113\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.540\nYou have spaces,\nyou cannot put spaces in your field names.\n\n114\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.170\nThis talks about,\nthere's a lot of naming conventions when\n\n115\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.720\nit comes to data sources and\nthings like that.\n\n116\n00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.260\nSo right here, if you just, either,\ntake the space out or maybe do an-\n\n117\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.030\n&gt;&gt; Underscore it.\n\n118\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.020\nThat's what I always do for everything,\nbecause, even with a lot of scripting\n\n119\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.890\nlanguages, having those breaks,\nit's just a pain anyways because you'll\n\n120\n00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.960\nhave to add quotations or something\nlike that to keep it all together.\n\n121\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.170\nSo for me it's just a habit.\n\n122\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.779\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\nYou know especially coming from\n\n123\n00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:07.850\nweb design.\n\n124\n00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.980\nEverything is always, okay lower case,\nno spaces, no special characters, but if\n\n125\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.290\nyou do need a space Underscore or a dash,\nbut to me, I always went with underscores.\n\n126\n00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.030\nSo, that's just kind of my thing.\n\n127\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.875\nBut notice that now I do have\nthe plus sign available to me.\n\n128\n00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:25.210\nSo I can then add my custom list.\n\n129\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.970\nSo not so\nmuch as you have to keep it lowercase,\n\n130\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.520\nit's really just about the spaces.\n\n131\n00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.640\nIt might bark at you or\n\n132\n00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.700\nnot give you a plus if maybe you put an\nexclamation point or maybe an equal sign.\n\n133\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.930\nBecause those are different operators or\n\n134\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.530\ncharacters that mean something\nin database languages.\n\n135\n00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.020\nSo I would stay away from those.\n\n136\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.110\nI'll click the plus sign and there we go.\n\n137\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.055\nMaybe we will put a department.\n\n138\n00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:52.320\nLike what department they are in,\nyou want to add that in,\n\n139\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.020\nwith the plus sign, there we go,\nand put that there.\n\n140\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.750\nBut I really want to put first and last\nname, department, and then shirt size.\n\n141\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.840\nWell, that's what you go your little bumpy\narrows, yeah, that's what I call them.\n\n142\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.885\nThey're bumpy arrows.\n\n143\n00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:06.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you select\n\n144\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.830\nthe field that you want to move up or\ndown.\n\n145\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.420\nI'll click on department.\n\n146\n00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.280\nClick the little bumpy arrow up,\nthere we go, changed my order.\n\n147\n00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.980\nSo you need to make sure\nyou establish your fields.\n\n148\n00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.580\nSo remove the ones that you\ndon't want that are default,\n\n149\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.080\nadd the ones that you want,\nchange the order of them, and\n\n150\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.585\nyou need to be very solid in\nyour decision of like, I'm done.\n\n151\n00:07:29.585 --> 00:07:34.460\nBecause you can't come back to this\ndialogue box per se and be able to go,\n\n152\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.110\nlet me go add another field in this\nmanner, so just keep that in mind.\n\n153\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.220\nSo we click good, I click create,\nnow when you click create, it's gonna\n\n154\n00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.140\nautomatically go out and say, well hey\nguess what, you have to save this.\n\n155\n00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.030\nI've got to save this as a file\n\n156\n00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.080\nof some type of data source cause\nthat's how all mail merges work.\n\n157\n00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.680\nThey have to connect to some outside\nsource, whether it's our contacts or\n\n158\n00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.760\nan Excel file or what have you.\n\n159\n00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:08.860\nSo we're gonna save this as my new list,\nsee I'm doing underscores automatically.\n\n160\n00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.550\nAnd I'm just gonna say show so\n\n161\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.420\nthat I know that this is something\nthat I made during the show.\n\n162\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.090\nAnd I'll put it right on my desktop so\nI can throw it away later.\n\n163\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.920\nIt's just on the fly.\n\n164\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.290\nWe click save and here we go.\n\n165\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.420\nNow this is where you're going\nto be entering in the data.\n\n166\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.240\nYou're familiar with Access.\n\n167\n00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.150\nRonnie and I did a show on Access and\nthere are forms that you can create for\n\n168\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.740\nusers, like a end user interface where\nthey are entering on things in a form, but\n\n169\n00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.090\nit's connecting to a table.\n\n170\n00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.080\nThis is pretty much\nexactly the same thing.\n\n171\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.850\nIt's very similar too.\n\n172\n00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:48.179\n&gt;&gt; I can imagine, you know we talked\nabout this in a previous show\n\n173\n00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:53.316\nabout having that source in\na readily available location.\n\n174\n00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:57.679\nSomething to think about also, I am pretty\nsure I haven't tried this per se, but\n\n175\n00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:01.399\nlogic would tell me that if I am setting\nsomething up for an end user and\n\n176\n00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:06.043\nI am using my administrative credentials,\nand I have to create a document like this?\n\n177\n00:09:06.043 --> 00:09:10.750\nI don't want to create a document\nthat has any kind of permissions\n\n178\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.850\nthat would prohibit that end user\nfrom accessing this source file.\n\n179\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and that's\nworth with all of your data sources.\n\n180\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:25.010\nIt can't be behind a path or\nprotected folder, or anything like that.\n\n181\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.050\nSo yeah, making sure that you're\nputting this in a location that is\n\n182\n00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.070\naccessible to any other end user.\n\n183\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.650\nAnd a lot of times, you're probably\njust doing it for yourself.\n\n184\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.480\nBecause it is more of an on-the-fly,\nhey, I just need to go ahead and\n\n185\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.440\njust kind of bust this out really quick.\n\n186\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.880\nAnd it's kind of like an internal thing.\n\n187\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.330\nBut all of those different data sources\nwe've been talking about, like getting\n\n188\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.940\nsomething for Oracle, and if it's on\ncertain network drives, and everything.\n\n189\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.060\nYeah, Access is always Very Important, so.\n\n190\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.180\n[LAUGH] All right, so let's go ahead and\nfill a few of these out.\n\n191\n00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.280\nLet's go with,\nwe're gonna throw you in there.\n\n192\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.550\nWe're gonna say-\n&gt;&gt;

Okay.\n\n269\n00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.570\n&gt;&gt; That is mailing with a new one.\n\n270\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.560\nDo you want to save new list to, okay.\n\n271\n00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.888\nYes I do want to save that.\n\n272\n00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.540\nOkay don't worry.\n\n273\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.790\nI did a little circle.\n\n274\n00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:34.210\nI think it's because I hadn't saved\nthe document, the blank document.\n\n275\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.450\nSo I was kinda in the middle of\ncreating a mail merge on the fly.\n\n276\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.170\nI made my data source and\n\n277\n00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.790\nsince I'm kind making everything on\nthe fly, It's like, wait a second.\n\n278\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.155\nBut I thought we were working\non this connection and\n\n279\n00:13:47.155 --> 00:13:49.125\nyou're trying to make me\ndo too many things at once.\n\n280\n00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:52.385\nAnd you're trying to open up the source,\nbut I'm in the middle of something.\n\n281\n00:13:52.385 --> 00:13:53.145\n&gt;&gt; And it's like we're in\n\n282\n00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:56.345\nquasi completion state so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n283\n00:13:56.345 --> 00:13:58.126\nI'm gonna go with that, okay?\n\n284\n00:13:58.126 --> 00:14:02.815\n[LAUGH] Because now I just connected\nthis to a new source, so just so\n\n285\n00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:06.870\nyou know,\nthis is on a source that is an Excel file.\n\n286\n00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.170\nBecause I was really trying to\nget where I could open this.\n\n287\n00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.900\nSee, now I can open it just fine.\n\n288\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:18.640\nI think it was, yes, I hadn't\nfinalized here is the merge document.\n\n289\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.000\nHere is your data source and\n\n290\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.130\nnow everything's good because I\nwas doing everything in the fly.\n\n291\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.145\nBefore, we could do it and\nit would be fine.\n\n292\n00:14:25.145 --> 00:14:29.880\nAnyway, just wanted to show you that\nthis is the data source that I created.\n\n293\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.055\nRemember we made that file\ncalled new list show.\n\n294\n00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:33.837\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n295\n00:14:33.837 --> 00:14:36.320\n&gt;&gt; And this is it's just a table.\n\n296\n00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.950\nSo it's just right there it's in I think\nit's in a weird yep it's in draft mode i'm\n\n297\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.810\nlike what this looks kinda weird right?\n\n298\n00:14:44.447 --> 00:14:49.400\nWord is like hmm, it's not in print\nlayout that's what's going on there so\n\n299\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:55.440\nthat's what I did, I created that data\nsource on the fly by creating a new list.\n\n300\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.950\nIt made a table and I'm just gonna\nthrow on these borders really quickly.\n\n301\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.550\nJust so you guys can kinda see that.\n\n302\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:11.455\nSo let's say I realized, I really needed\nto add like the shirt color, right?\n\n303\n00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:12.395\nSo you could come back.\n\n304\n00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:15.025\nRemember I said make sure you've got\nall your fields right because you\n\n305\n00:15:15.025 --> 00:15:18.005\ncan never go back to this\nparticular dialogue box?\n\n306\n00:15:18.005 --> 00:15:22.105\nWell, yeah, that was in the middle of\nme doing our mail merge all together.\n\n307\n00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:26.880\nBut once I establish this I\ncould add another column,\n\n308\n00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.270\ncall that color,\nfill it in in my particular record,\n\n309\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:35.685\nmaybe I would want pink,\nRonnie would probably want black.\n\n310\n00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.230\n[LAUGH] What kind would you want?\n\n311\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.260\n&gt;&gt; Can we pick rainbow?\n\n312\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.189\n&gt;&gt; Let's do tie-dyes!\n\n313\n00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:43.572\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Tie-dye, I love tie-dye.\n\n314\n00:15:43.572 --> 00:15:45.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I want one of that too.\n\n315\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, you can see that\n\n316\n00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:51.505\nI would just add this column, and then\ngo ahead and use this as my data source.\n\n317\n00:15:51.505 --> 00:15:53.665\nConnect to whatever, my letters,\n\n318\n00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:56.295\nor the thing I was making on the fly and\neverything.\n\n319\n00:15:56.295 --> 00:16:00.155\nSo I don't want you to think that like you\ncould never, ever edit that data source.\n\n320\n00:16:00.155 --> 00:16:05.495\nYou just have to come back to\nthe source [LAUGH] of the data source.\n\n321\n00:16:05.495 --> 00:16:10.150\nAnd then reconnect it back into\nwhatever document you're then going to\n\n322\n00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.720\nmerge all together.\n\n323\n00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.140\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So, there you go.\n\n324\n00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:18.630\nYou can create lists on the fly and\nas a new list,\n\n325\n00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.462\nit does take a little bit more work\nbecause you're making the tabular data, so\n\n326\n00:16:23.462 --> 00:16:26.220\nhaving it on hand to begin with,\nthat's great but\n\n327\n00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.910\nit doesn't always happen that way.\n\n328\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.630\nAnd there you go, I will say there is one\nlast data source we've glossed over and\n\n329\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.675\nguess what I'm gonna gloss over it again.\n\n330\n00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:36.859\n[LAUGH] It's that File Maker Pro.\n\n331\n00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:40.900\nThe File Maker Pro,\nwe talked about this in another episode.\n\n332\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.790\nIt is the Mac version of Access because\nthey don't make Access for Mac.\n\n333\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.610\nSo, it is, I wanna say it's older,\nthe only reason I say it's older is\n\n334\n00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.140\nbecause I don't know if know anybody\nthat uses File Maker Pro anymore.\n\n335\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.240\nBut back in the day, because I've been\nteaching products for a long time I feel\n\n336\n00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.165\nlike there was a class in File Maker Pro,\nbut that was 15 years ago.\n\n337\n00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:07.890\n[LAUGH] So, it's still out there.\n\n338\n00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.470\nIt's still valid, cause there are probably\nsome File Maker Pro people out there.\n\n339\n00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.980\n&gt;&gt; Professionals.\n\n340\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.805\nYeah, you're invalidating my life's work.\n\n341\n00:17:15.805 --> 00:17:17.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I live in that product.\n\n342\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.420\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it's a data base,\n\n343\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.400\nit's going to have tables.\n\n344\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.120\nJust like if you have a work sheet,\na work book,\n\n345\n00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.353\nan Excel file you are going to\nhave work sheets in an Access or\n\n346\n00:17:29.353 --> 00:17:33.560\nFile Maker Pro database, you'll have\ntables, and those would be the ones\n\n347\n00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.530\nthat you would choose as your data\nsource and then do all your merge.\n\n348\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:42.020\nSo, I didn't totally forget it, it's just\nthat I don't have any experience with it.\n\n349\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.130\nAnd it's gonna be, as you can see,\npretty much the same steps on all of them,\n\n350\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.780\nI just wanted to take the time\nthrough these different episodes to\n\n351\n00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.040\nreally get into all the different\npieces of your data sources.\n\n352\n00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.010\nBecause it is an important step.\n\n353\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.920\nEven though once you do it.\n\n354\n00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.030\nOnce you are in the next episode we\nare going to start creating our letter.\n\n355\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:08.042\nYou are going to see how easy it is and\nyou took three episodes to describe this.\n\n356\n00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:10.360\nYeah, because I want to give\nyou all the information I have.\n\n357\n00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.670\n&gt;&gt; This is a deep dive into mail merge,\nand that's hopefully why you're here.\n\n358\n00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.450\nBut although this is a deep dive,\nwe're just kind of scratching the surface.\n\n359\n00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.885\nSo we still have quite a bit to go.\n\n360\n00:18:20.885 --> 00:18:23.825\nVonne, do you have any final thoughts\nbefore we go ahead and wrap up here?\n\n361\n00:18:23.825 --> 00:18:27.995\n&gt;&gt; I like what we said\nin the email context.\n\n362\n00:18:27.995 --> 00:18:30.285\nIt's like to each it's own.\n\n363\n00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:34.525\nThere are completely valid reasons for\nusing any of these different sources.\n\n364\n00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:38.065\nIt really depends on which way is best for\nyou.\n\n365\n00:18:38.065 --> 00:18:40.955\nWhatever your organization\nis set up with and\n\n366\n00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:43.990\nhow you're going to be able to work it.\n\n367\n00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.810\nPersonally, I would just\nalways go with Excel.\n\n368\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.320\nBut that's because I also,\nI live in Excel a lot.\n\n369\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.310\nSo to me, that would be my choice.\n\n370\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.090\nBut I know there's reasons for others.\n\n371\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.390\nSo go have fun and to each his own.\n\n372\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.940\nAnd lets go have some rainbow\ntie dye super parties.\n\n373\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.285\n[LAUGH] I dunno where that came from,\nbut all I'm thinking about is rainbow\n\n374\n00:19:02.285 --> 00:19:05.190\nT-shirts, so-\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you so much for that, Vonne.\n\n375\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.610\nAnd thank you guys for joining us as well.\n\n376\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.260\nBut for this show, let's sign out.\n\n377\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.770\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n378\n00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.490\n&gt;&gt;

and\n\n5\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.570\nthen specifically looking at how we can\nincorporate letters into Mail Merge.\n\n6\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.360\nSo, I'm not really sure how\nthat's going to happen.\n\n7\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.930\nLuckily we have Mrs. Yvonne Smith with\nus today to guide us through this topic.\n\n8\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.950\nThank you for joining us, Vonne.\n\n9\n00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.990\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\n\n10\n00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.330\nI'm so glad to be here,\nand I'm doing really good.\n\n11\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.840\nI was trying to give\nsomething funny to say,\n\n12\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.745\nbut I couldn't find anything with\nletters and merging and miraculous.\n\n13\n00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n14\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.195\n&gt;&gt; You're like just stop.\n\n15\n00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:54.820\n[LAUGH] But yes, but\nwe're here to talk about just letters.\n\n16\n00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.940\nWe're now at the point where\nwe're going to start composing\n\n17\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.375\nour mail-merge with our data sources.\n\n18\n00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:05.030\nCuz we've been going over all\nthe different types of data sources,\n\n19\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.530\nhow to connect to it.\n\n20\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.120\nSo, all of that we've covered.\n\n21\n00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.620\nSo, now it's just like let's chose\nthis Excel list and let's go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.560\nget those merged fields into the document,\nand perform that merge.\n\n23\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.990\nSo, that's what we are going\nto be concentrating on\n\n24\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.100\nin this particular episode.\n\n25\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.050\nSo, yes, I'm labeling this letters, colon,\n\n26\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.500\nmail merge because I kinda like\nto do the sub-topic of each one.\n\n27\n00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.170\nBecause there are certain episodes\nin this series where we're going to\n\n28\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.960\nnot be performing the actual\nmerge with a data source.\n\n29\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.870\nBut it is all part of\nthe mailing the letter,\n\n30\n00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.510\nthe labels and envelopes and\nthings like that, so lots of fun stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.140\nSo we're gonna start with our letters.\n\n32\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.730\nNow, what I have, I have the steps and\n\n33\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.260\nfiles written out in the episode notes.\n\n34\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.018\nSo all those files like the PDFs that are\nassociated with this particular episode\n\n35\n00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:02.238\nyou can download and\nyou can be able to see them.\n\n36\n00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:03.612\nSo I wanna start there.\n\n37\n00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:05.760\nI wanna start at, let's just go ahead and\n\n38\n00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.900\noutline the steps and\nthen lets do them together.\n\n39\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.380\nAll right, so why don't we jump down\nin here, and I have my Markdown editor.\n\n40\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.335\nI'm a fan of Haroopad.\n\n41\n00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:19.817\nWhich one do you use?\n&gt;&gt; I started with Markdown, and\n\n42\n00:02:19.817 --> 00:02:21.096\nI switched to Haroo.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n43\n00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:21.971\ndid?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:23.654\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just in case you all are like,\n\n45\n00:02:23.654 --> 00:02:25.610\nwhat are you talking about-\n&gt;&gt; It's that text\n\n46\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.680\neditor you're looking at.\n\n47\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.490\nAnd the only reason is because\nMarkdown was doing some strange\n\n48\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.740\nthings when I was saving my files and\noverwriting them.\n\n49\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.880\nThat was like the last thing you want\na text editor to do, so I switched.\n\n50\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the way that we internally\n\n51\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.090\ndo our show notes,\nthey're in a Markdown, a .md format.\n\n52\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.220\nAnd it's just it's like\na glorified txt but it does more.\n\n53\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.830\nYou don't have to get into\ntechnicality of it, but\n\n54\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.140\nin case you're like what is this\nthing that you bring up a lot,\n\n55\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.880\nit is a Markdown editor,\nit's really just a text editor.\n\n56\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.284\nYou could do for any type of coding or\n&gt;&gt; I guess it would be a little bit more\n\n57\n00:03:02.284 --> 00:03:03.070\nuniversal.\n\n58\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.150\nYeah, than something that maybe formatted\nin a way that wouldn't be compatible with\n\n59\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.612\ndifferent systems.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean there are so\n\n60\n00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:13.829\nmany different flavors of text editors for\ndifferent reasons, there's Atom.\n\n61\n00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.474\n&gt;&gt; Atom is a variation of a Markdown or\n\n62\n00:03:16.474 --> 00:03:18.082\nthey're related.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n63\n00:03:18.082 --> 00:03:20.210\n&gt;&gt; Like in the same family.\n\n64\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.870\n&gt;&gt; And I know a lot of coders that\n\n65\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.980\nuse Atom.\n\n66\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.560\nSo, anyways, sorry,\nlittle- squirrel, what's going on?\n\n67\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.880\nI like to diverge on different topics,\nand then take little detours, but\n\n68\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.260\njust in case you're wondering.\n\n69\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.390\nThat's what we've got in here.\n\n70\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.784\nSo, here are our steps,\nthat's already hard to say.\n\n71\n00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:41.660\n[LAUGH] The one on the side is the actual\nMarkdown that we can do, commands and\n\n72\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.460\nanything on the left is the preview.\n\n73\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.190\nSo you can just concentrate on\nthat would be the other left.\n\n74\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.989\nThat would be the right hand side.\n\n75\n00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.150\n[LAUGH] Which way are we going?\n\n76\n00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.260\nAll right, so the steps for\nwriting a letter with a mail merge.\n\n77\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.167\nWe're gonna start with a document.\n\n78\n00:03:56.167 --> 00:04:01.800\nNow, it could be blank or it could\nbe a letter that's already written.\n\n79\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.415\nAnd we talked a little bit about this\nin the introduction part of our show\n\n80\n00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:07.230\nthe episode.\n\n81\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.650\nBut your gonna have something that, hey,\nI want to have this letter written out.\n\n82\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.370\nWe've talked about the junk mail or all\nthe rest of the test is like universal,\n\n83\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.860\nbut there are specific places that your\nname or your city are inserted in there.\n\n84\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.480\nSo your gonna select the recipients.\n\n85\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.120\nFind your data source of whatever variety,\nyou're gonna insert those fields.\n\n86\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.750\nThat drop down that I was showing in\nthe data source episodes, where like, hey,\n\n87\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.600\ndid it connect?\n\n88\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.930\nThere are the headers.\n\n89\n00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.300\nThat's what we're gonna talk about,\nputting the fields.\n\n90\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.572\nThat's where your taking where you\nwant that variable content to go.\n\n91\n00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:44.691\nYou're gonna preview the results,\nyou are then going to edit as needed,\n\n92\n00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:49.409\ndo font changes, alignment definitely\nmaking sure you're turning the preview off\n\n93\n00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.750\nwhen you do that, when you're editing.\n\n94\n00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.280\nAnd then you're going to finish the merge\nand edit the individual documents or\n\n95\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.150\nyou can just go ahead and\nstraight print from there.\n\n96\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.440\nMy way that I do it, and I feel it's\na little more universal as well and\n\n97\n00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.730\ndefinitely suggesting of the different\nfiles that you're going to end up with.\n\n98\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.400\nYou're gonna end up with a start doc.\n\n99\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.583\nNow, I did put this as optional, because\nmaybe you're gonna, we talked about this,\n\n100\n00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.070\nyou're gonna write the letter\n&gt;&gt; On the slide?\n\n101\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.270\n&gt;&gt; And the mail, and do it all together\n\n102\n00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n103\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.360\n&gt;&gt; And you really only need the merge\n\n104\n00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.770\ndocument.\n\n105\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.020\nTotally fine, so that's why I'm saying\nyou don't have to write the letter and\n\n106\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.820\nhave it blank with no data connections.\n\n107\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.030\nIt's not the imperative stuff\nthat you must have, but\n\n108\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.470\nyou do need a merged document.\n\n109\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.670\nThat's the one that's gonna have the file\nwith the data connections in the merged\n\n110\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.820\nfields, the one that has all your setup.\n\n111\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.120\nThen you could, and\nshould have the finished documents.\n\n112\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.360\nThat's where you're going to have\na file with a number of pages based on\n\n113\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.120\nthe records in that merge options,\ncuz you can filter it and\n\n114\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.220\ndo different things with it.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n115\n00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.010\nour goal, right?\n\n116\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.892\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n117\n00:05:54.892 --> 00:05:57.160\n&gt;&gt; I wanna take my merge or\n\n118\n00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.680\nmy data source, take it with this letter\nmerge it together, spit out the results.\n\n119\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.950\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n120\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.680\nAnd the rest of it is really my\nsteps that I'm gonna show you next.\n\n121\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.480\nIf you've watched my episodes and\nseen my notes,\n\n122\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.840\nthey're, well they're our notes, right?\n\n123\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.010\nFor us when we're doing our shows,\nof how we need to follow along and\n\n124\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.960\npresent the information.\n\n125\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.500\nSo sometimes when you're reading and\nyou are like this is not meant to be like,\n\n126\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.825\na step by step tutorial.\n&gt;&gt; It's Vonne language or\n\n127\n00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:25.350\nCherokee language, in my case or whatever.\n\n128\n00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.600\nSo, what makes sense to us.\n&gt;&gt; Might not make sense to you.\n\n129\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.821\nSo, if you've ever wonder, like,\nokay, this is not written as,\n\n130\n00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:33.240\nit's not really meant to me.\n\n131\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just to keep us on track basically.\n\n132\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but we like to share it with\n\n133\n00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.060\nyou guys.\n\n134\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.760\nAnd I try to keep it that way, but I'm\nsure it's littered with spelling mistakes\n\n135\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.670\nand grammar mistakes, so sorry about that.\n\n136\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.520\nAll right, so why don't we start?\n\n137\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.190\nI have a file called Mail Merge Start.\n\n138\n00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.880\nSounds like a good place, we've seen this\nin some of our other episodes, great.\n\n139\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.640\nI put in my little placeholders\nof where I want to\n\n140\n00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.040\nmake sure that I know that\nthat's where the name goes.\n\n141\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.270\nNo data connection going on right now.\n\n142\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.690\nAll right, so\nlet's do our steps that we said.\n\n143\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.950\nWe're going to connect\nit to the data source.\n\n144\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.170\nSo I got everything else written out,\nand for show purposes, time saving.\n\n145\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.900\nLet's select it,\nwe're going to use our Excel list.\n\n146\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.560\nAnd I will just go ahead and\napologize up front.\n\n147\n00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.530\nRemember all those times where we were\nlike, it's gonna take a while to connect.\n\n148\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.851\nWell, we'll have have to keep doing that.\n\n149\n00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:27.567\n[LAUGH] Just to show I know how\nmuch of a pain that this is where\n\n150\n00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:31.192\nyou have to say yep I know because.\n&gt;&gt; Every time.\n\n151\n00:07:31.192 --> 00:07:33.420\n&gt;&gt; Every time and like I said before,\n\n152\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.340\nthis is where we're gonna add filler space\nof like okay, so how's the weather there.\n\n153\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.820\n&gt;&gt; Vonne fills your struggle.\n\n154\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.350\n&gt;&gt; Every day.\n\n155\n00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.860\nWell, everyday when I'm prepping for\nmail merge shows,\n\n156\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.140\nit's like all right, right there.\n\n157\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.388\nAnd like I said in the last one,\nit's like right when you think you're\n\n158\n00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:53.424\ngonna try to click it again,\nit connects for you.\n\n159\n00:07:53.424 --> 00:07:57.582\nYou know that whole click it once, click,\nclick, click, click, click, click,\n\n160\n00:07:57.582 --> 00:07:58.578\nclick, click, and\n\n161\n00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:02.235\nthen you're overloaded and it freaks\nitself out [LAUGH] It will get there.\n\n162\n00:08:02.235 --> 00:08:05.108\nAll right, so,\nI do wanna use this particular worksheet,\n\n163\n00:08:05.108 --> 00:08:07.360\nremember we did from\nthat data source before.\n\n164\n00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.681\nThis is the same file that we've been\nusing in all of our other episodes.\n\n165\n00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:13.880\nSo if you haven't seen the data source,\ngo back and watch that.\n\n166\n00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.630\nI'll probably pull it up at least once\nthroughout this particular episode.\n\n167\n00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.962\nNow it has my fields.\n\n168\n00:08:19.962 --> 00:08:24.050\nAnd we know because it's showing up as\nour header row in that data source.\n\n169\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:29.700\nCool, so now comes the time we need to\nput these fields into the document,\n\n170\n00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.150\nwhere we're going to\nwrite our merge letter.\n\n171\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.105\nSo, right here I'm gonna take this,\nI can just select it.\n\n172\n00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:41.105\nI'm gonna delete it just to get the idea\nif I want to put the first name in here.\n\n173\n00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:43.935\nBut just after the word dear\nyou're gonna need a what?\n\n174\n00:08:43.935 --> 00:08:45.230\n&gt;&gt; A salutation.\n\n175\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.590\n&gt;&gt; A salutation with a space.\n\n176\n00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.790\nBut yes you're correct [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.477\n&gt;&gt; I'm like yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n178\n00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:53.958\nI was going for,\nI need a space after dear.\n\n179\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.464\nBut I didn't really,\n\n180\n00:08:55.464 --> 00:08:58.649\nI didn't form the question properly so-\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:08:58.649 --> 00:08:59.750\n&gt;&gt; You get bonus points.\n\n182\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:03.452\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna do Dear space.\n\n184\n00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:07.580\nAnd I would think I'm typing\nthe word Cherokee for first name.\n\n185\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.250\nBut I want to connect\nit to that data source.\n\n186\n00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.960\nLet's put in the First.\n\n187\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.315\nAnd there we have our gimlets, forget it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:09:15.315 --> 00:09:17.099\n&gt;&gt; I looked it up right before this.\n\n189\n00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:18.840\n&gt;&gt; How about just give me a gimlet?\n\n190\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.270\nHow about that [LAUGH]?\n&gt;&gt; I can remember that one.\n\n191\n00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.494\nAnd sometimes you might want one after\ntrying to fight with mail merge.\n\n192\n00:09:26.494 --> 00:09:31.219\nWe're going to call those some gimlets.\n\n193\n00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:35.521\nThat is those angley brackets that we had\nin that one show that I called a pilcrow,\n\n194\n00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:36.927\nwhich is the backwards P.\n\n195\n00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:40.675\nGoodness, all right, so\nwe shouldn't try to get technical here.\n\n196\n00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:46.140\n[LAUGH] Now I'm going to put in\na space and then put in the last name.\n\n197\n00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.790\nAnd I do have my show hide characters on.\n\n198\n00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.850\nI always like to keep\nthem on in my mail merge.\n\n199\n00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.710\nAnd there we go, great.\n\n200\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.700\nSo let's go ahead and right now\njust see if this is working, okay?\n\n201\n00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.650\nGo to the preview.\n\n202\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.165\nIf I click the preview, Bishop Timothy.\n\n203\n00:10:00.165 --> 00:10:04.100\nYep, it's working and you can see\nwhen you go through those steps, yep,\n\n204\n00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.860\nit is going through each record\nthat's in my data source.\n\n205\n00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.690\nAnd I know it's working.\n\n206\n00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.070\nAnd the other thing I like\nto do to really know,\n\n207\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.580\nlike I hit these all the way to the back,\nlike the last record.\n\n208\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.040\nYep, yep, that's 19.\n\n209\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.380\nAnd knowing my data source,\nI know that that's how many.\n\n210\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.350\nSwitch to the beginning,\ngot record one, cool.\n\n211\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.780\nI do know that I'm in preview,\nwell, cuz I can see the names.\n\n212\n00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.190\nAnd see how your preview's got\nthe little button that's on?\n\n213\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.680\nSo if you wanna go back and edit,\n\n214\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.410\ncuz I'm not done, you need to make\nsure you turn the preview off.\n\n215\n00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.126\nYou can do some of the editing,\nactually most of it.\n\n216\n00:10:39.126 --> 00:10:42.054\nIt sometimes gets a little quirky\nif you stay in preview and\n\n217\n00:10:42.054 --> 00:10:43.380\ntry to keep doing things.\n\n218\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.620\nSo when you're designing,\ndon't be in preview.\n\n219\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.336\nSo let's keep going.\n\n220\n00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:52.800\nLet's go with we need to put in some more\nfields cuz we're just doing a couple.\n\n221\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.480\nYou can have as many as you want.\n\n222\n00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.550\nMaybe you need address blocks and\neverything, put the fields,\n\n223\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.870\nhowever you would normally\nwrite the letter.\n\n224\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:05.095\nSo we'll go with City, and we'll hit the\nspace bar, and then we'll go with State.\n\n225\n00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:07.545\nYou know what,\nwe should probably put a comma after this.\n\n226\n00:11:07.545 --> 00:11:11.480\nIt's city comma state if we're writing\nproper English after I just told you about\n\n227\n00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.290\nhow all my show notes were\nlike grammatically incorrect.\n\n228\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.540\nAll right, wonderful, I like that.\n\n229\n00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.263\nLet's do some formatting\ncuz this is just text,\n\n230\n00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.810\njust like it would be if you\nwere typing the words out.\n\n231\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.580\nMaybe I want this\nsalutation line to be bold.\n\n232\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.852\nLike let's go ahead and make it bold.\n\n233\n00:11:29.852 --> 00:11:31.070\nMaybe I want it centered.\n\n234\n00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.404\nNow I'm not sure if I really\nwant it to look like that.\n\n235\n00:11:33.404 --> 00:11:36.202\nBut I'm just trying to show you\nthat you do everything that way.\n\n236\n00:11:36.202 --> 00:11:41.420\nYou have paragraph spacing, you have\nindents, you have bullet numbering.\n\n237\n00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.870\nIt's just text.\n\n238\n00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.247\nThat's all it is.\n\n239\n00:11:44.247 --> 00:11:46.964\nOkay, even though it still fields,\nand connecting it,\n\n240\n00:11:46.964 --> 00:11:49.090\nit's still the end result is text.\n\n241\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.050\nSo do all that kind of fun stuff you want.\n\n242\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:56.645\nMaybe just for fun we'll change the city\nand state to purple, just because.\n\n243\n00:11:56.645 --> 00:11:59.580\n[LAUGH] And that's great.\n\n244\n00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.030\nI'll zoom out just a little bit so\nwe can see this.\n\n245\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.060\nLet's preview it.\n\n246\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.872\nGoing back over to Mailings and\nPreview, yep,\n\n247\n00:12:06.872 --> 00:12:08.594\nwe're working.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n248\n00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:09.413\n&gt;&gt; And that's it really.\n\n249\n00:12:09.413 --> 00:12:14.640\nI mean it really is that simple,\nonce you understand the concepts, okay?\n\n250\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.790\nGet my start document.\n\n251\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.100\nWrite my letter.\n\n252\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.380\nConnect my data source.\n\n253\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.610\nInsert the fields.\n\n254\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:20.940\nFormat as necessary.\n\n255\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.400\nPreview, okay I'm good.\n\n256\n00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.755\nI would always save one of your\ndocuments as that merge step.\n\n257\n00:12:28.755 --> 00:12:30.850\nOkay, this is my starting document.\n\n258\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.869\nWhether or\nnot you have a starting document,\n\n259\n00:12:34.869 --> 00:12:40.599\nyou really need to do a File &gt; Save As and\nsave this as your merge.\n\n260\n00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:43.499\nAnd the way, my naming convention, like\nI said before in some other episodes if\n\n261\n00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:46.155\nyou haven't watched them,\nyou're like you're repeating yourself.\n\n262\n00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:47.020\nYeah, I know.\n\n263\n00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.225\nBut I have a start, merge, finish.\n\n264\n00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:53.696\nThat's how like the last word in-\n&gt;&gt; Keep track of those different versions.\n\n265\n00:12:53.696 --> 00:12:55.045\n&gt;&gt; How my naming convention is.\n\n266\n00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:59.135\nHowever works for\nhow you want to do it go for it.\n\n267\n00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:02.480\n[LAUGH] I'll say merge and\nI'm also gonna just add this.\n\n268\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.790\nI'm gonna say Show, cuz so that way I\nknow that I did this during the show.\n\n269\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.233\nKeeping track of our own files\nis sometimes hard, isn't it?\n\n270\n00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:15.663\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Version 5.713 or\n\n271\n00:13:15.663 --> 00:13:18.240\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; And you you can't remember,\n\n272\n00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.470\nyou have two, three, four.\n\n273\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.944\nI'm like, I don't remember this.\n\n274\n00:13:21.944 --> 00:13:23.290\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and click Save.\n\n275\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.590\nI just put this on my desktop.\n\n276\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.880\nThere we go.\nNow I have my merge.\n\n277\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.300\nAnd that way I can have this designed\nletter anytime that I want to, and\n\n278\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.560\nbe able to do other things.\n\n279\n00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.460\nNow, the final step is all right,\n\n280\n00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.500\nI need to complete this merge, cuz I have\none page in this document right now.\n\n281\n00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.160\nIt's just the letter.\n\n282\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.530\nBut I have 19 recipients.\n\n283\n00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.310\nI know that I'm gonna need 19 letters.\n\n284\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.960\nSo this is the stuff, like I said,\n\n285\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.330\na lot of people miss is how do\nI get that final result file.\n\n286\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.450\nYou gotta go to the edit\nindividual documents.\n\n287\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:05.483\nThat's going to create, let's go head and\nclick it, a whole separate file.\n\n288\n00:14:05.483 --> 00:14:09.130\nLook, it says form letters one, okay?\n\n289\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.050\nGreat, look at how many\npages I have down here.\n\n290\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:17.555\nI have 19 pages and we go through all of\nthem as a section break after each one and\n\n291\n00:14:17.555 --> 00:14:19.786\nthen each individual letters.\n\n292\n00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:23.290\nIf I really zoom out you kinda\nsee this a little bit better.\n\n293\n00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:29.360\nThere we go, here are my 19 pages in this\none file for every record that I have.\n\n294\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.940\nIf you had two pages in this document,\nmaybe had a letter and a coupon page,\n\n295\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.310\nthat would have two pages,\nset your break, next one.\n\n296\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.220\nTwo pages, two pages,\ntwo pages, so on and so forth.\n\n297\n00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.770\nSo however many pages your original\nletter has, you get the same amount, but\n\n298\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.460\njust per record, that you are merging.\n\n299\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.580\nAnd this is your final product.\n&gt;&gt; So much easier than copying and\n\n300\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.103\npasting 19 separate times.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n301\n00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.058\nWhich before I knew mail merge, I mean,\n\n302\n00:14:57.058 --> 00:15:00.461\nI've done this before, but-\n&gt;&gt; I would think that there's a way to go\n\n303\n00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:01.820\nahead and automate that.\n\n304\n00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.874\nBut not knowing how is\nreally the key factor here.\n\n305\n00:15:04.874 --> 00:15:08.531\nSo making sure that you know how to go\nahead and set this up can really save you\n\n306\n00:15:08.531 --> 00:15:11.220\na lot of time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I know.\n\n307\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.751\nGoing through all of these years of\nlearning these products, you get one away.\n\n308\n00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:16.750\nAnd you're like, yeah, I've got this.\n\n309\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.593\nAnd then, maybe six months,\nsix years later you're like, my gosh.\n\n310\n00:15:21.593 --> 00:15:24.200\nSo this whole time I could\nhave been doing this way?\n\n311\n00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.990\nSo yeah, we're people too,\nwe experience this.\n\n312\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.877\nWe're just being able to show you so\nhopefully you don't have to have six years\n\n313\n00:15:31.877 --> 00:15:34.531\nin between [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, those things that you\n\n314\n00:15:34.531 --> 00:15:39.326\nlearn here even just watching the shows,\nif you become accidentally more efficient.\n\n315\n00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:41.866\nI always say that sometimes I'll\nstart playing with a product.\n\n316\n00:15:41.866 --> 00:15:46.559\nAnd I'm like just from playing around\nwith it, I'm becoming more efficient.\n\n317\n00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:50.051\nAnd that's how you gotta do it sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; I love that, accidentally, on purpose.\n\n318\n00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:53.142\nThat is so That's so key.\n\n319\n00:15:53.142 --> 00:15:55.435\nI'm like, that is right on.\n\n320\n00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:57.210\n[LAUGH] So good.\n\n321\n00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.714\nOkay, so right here I have this finished\nversion because maybe I need to send\n\n322\n00:16:00.714 --> 00:16:01.219\nthis off.\n\n323\n00:16:01.219 --> 00:16:04.621\nMaybe I'm not physically\nprinting it at my desk.\n\n324\n00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:08.429\nMaybe I'm sending it to somebody else that\nthey're gonna have like a fancier printer,\n\n325\n00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:10.390\nthat has fancy paper,\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n326\n00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.710\nOr you're sending it off to\na commercial print provider.\n\n327\n00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.050\nAnd they're going to print\nit on whatever cardstock,\n\n328\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.680\nthat fancy touch feel paper\nthat kind of freaks me out.\n\n329\n00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.110\nIf you're like what are you talking about?\n\n330\n00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.660\nSince my husband works in a print shop,\nI know a lot about paper that\n\n331\n00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.593\nis probably way more than I need to.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my grandfather use to own\n\n332\n00:16:29.593 --> 00:16:32.894\na printing company and then I worked-\nI started out in, for a newspaper.\n\n333\n00:16:32.894 --> 00:16:33.529\n&gt;&gt; You told me that before.\n\n334\n00:16:33.529 --> 00:16:35.423\n&gt;&gt; So you can even send these files, yeah,\n\n335\n00:16:35.423 --> 00:16:38.603\nto them and have your account\nrepresentative, go ahead for inserts\n\n336\n00:16:38.603 --> 00:16:41.290\nin the newspaper, or something like that.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n337\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.520\nyes, a real world example, I love it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n338\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.270\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n339\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.320\nthat touch feel paper that I just did a\nrush on it last night, that they had that.\n\n340\n00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.826\nIf you don't understand\nwhat I'm talking about,\n\n341\n00:16:51.826 --> 00:16:55.087\nthere's certain paper\nthat when you touch it,\n\n342\n00:16:55.087 --> 00:16:59.745\nit feels like it's fuzzy, it's soft.\n&gt;&gt; I gotta think back to think, yeah,\n\n343\n00:16:59.745 --> 00:17:02.200\ncuz I'm not ringing a bell.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm telling you,\n\n344\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.050\nonce you feel it you'll be like,\nI know what Vonne's talking about.\n\n345\n00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:09.480\nIt's like this synthetic fancy\ntouch feel paper that it's\n\n346\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.020\nkinda creepy to me [LAUGH].\n\n347\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.380\nBut again, I'm weird like that.\n\n348\n00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.940\nAnyways, another like tangent, again.\n\n349\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:23.123\nSo this is where I would save\nthis file as my completed merge.I\n\n350\n00:17:23.123 --> 00:17:28.019\nwould do Christmas cats,\nlet me do show, show finished.\n\n351\n00:17:28.019 --> 00:17:30.730\nAnd I'm gonna put it on my desktop so\nI can take it away later.\n\n352\n00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:36.600\nAnd there you go, so\nmy end result file, pretty cool.\n\n353\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.670\nSo what I like to do here cuz it's\nreally that easy boom, boom there we go.\n\n354\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:48.875\nI wanna just kind of dive into\nsome problems that you might have\n\n355\n00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:52.580\ncuz I have I'm back here I did a command\nW by the way to close that finish file.\n\n356\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.753\nI'm back here on my merge file.\n\n357\n00:17:54.753 --> 00:17:56.631\nBecause we've talked about this, or\n\n358\n00:17:56.631 --> 00:18:00.425\nalluded to in some other shows is like\nwhy I wanna keep this merged document?\n\n359\n00:18:00.425 --> 00:18:04.460\nCuz maybe I have my connection\nto a data source for\n\n360\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.840\nthis particular mailing,\nlike you do with the flier inserts, right?\n\n361\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:14.030\nSo maybe that was for whatever week,\nthe week of January 9th, okay.\n\n362\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.630\nAnd then next week,\nwe're going to have another flyer,\n\n363\n00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.730\n&gt;&gt; A new sale, or something.\n\n364\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.410\n&gt;&gt; Or, same letter, but\n\n365\n00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.660\na different recipient list-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n366\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.580\n&gt;&gt; Because now we're doing newspapers in\n\n367\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.960\nColorado instead of Florida, right?\n\n368\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.560\nAnd I have another data source\nwith my Colorado information.\n\n369\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.470\nAnd it's set up the same way, right?\n\n370\n00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.290\nSo let's come back out over to here and\njust to drive this point home,\n\n371\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.290\nin case you haven't watched\nthose other episodes.\n\n372\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.300\nWe have our department, and address, and\n\n373\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.330\nthis is where we had our\nBishop Timothy's first / last apartment.\n\n374\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:52.540\nWell, let's say I have this file,\nset up the same way, right?\n\n375\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.051\nDifferent people, in here.\n\n376\n00:18:54.051 --> 00:18:57.780\nWe've got Twiggy Taylor and\nCupcake Glen and everything like that.\n\n377\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.960\nSo another list with different cities and\nstates.\n\n378\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.750\nBut I have the same headers.\n\n379\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.110\nThat's that kind of idea like these\nare going to our Colorado fliers,\n\n380\n00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.470\nif we are going back to that\nexample that we are going with.\n\n381\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.760\nSo what I can do back here,\nis hey I'm ready to go ahead and\n\n382\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.070\ndo my second week flyer mail merge thing.\n\n383\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.430\nI've got my design letter here,\n\n384\n00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.032\nI just need to change the source.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n385\n00:19:22.032 --> 00:19:23.560\n&gt;&gt; We would just point it out to the Excel\n\n386\n00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.560\nfiles, so you just change the list.\n\n387\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:31.096\nSo I use the existing list,\nI come over here into my mail merge files,\n\n388\n00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:34.828\nI find the change source I click OK,\nI open it.\n\n389\n00:19:34.828 --> 00:19:38.190\nWe're gonna have to wait for\nthat little converter again.\n\n390\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.169\nEvery time but then what's gonna\nhappen because everything's setup.\n\n391\n00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:43.719\nOoh I got a spinning beach ball,\n\n392\n00:19:43.719 --> 00:19:46.546\nokay good at least I got some\nvisual indication this time.\n\n393\n00:19:46.546 --> 00:19:49.529\nIt doesn't happen all the time.\n\n394\n00:19:49.529 --> 00:19:55.100\nBut now I'll be able to see\nthe results of the Twiggy Taylor and\n\n395\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.030\nthe Cupcake one, I think those\nare the names and that would be it.\n\n396\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.770\n&gt;&gt; Did you come up with all these names?\n\n397\n00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:00.680\n&gt;&gt; No I did a random\n\n398\n00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.085\nname generator.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n399\n00:20:02.085 --> 00:20:03.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] There's a website that just\n\n400\n00:20:03.915 --> 00:20:08.020\nuse it it's like random pet names and\nI just found those, copy and\n\n401\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.030\npasted from right there-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n402\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.440\n&gt;&gt; So it's pretty neat.\n\n403\n00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.680\nSo you can see now there is\nWrigley Owens the first one,\n\n404\n00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.590\nthe other one's like Bishop Timmy me,\nthose are actually all your cats.\n\n405\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.830\n&gt;&gt; I do remember that part, but\n\n406\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.760\nI just didn't know about these.\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know,\n\n407\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.980\nbecause I asked like Rene, because Kimba,\n\n408\n00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.410\nthat was one of her cat's names.\n&gt;&gt; You were asking of the people.\n\n409\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\n\n410\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.295\nthey're all people I know's cat's names.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n411\n00:20:33.295 --> 00:20:35.447\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just made up some of the last\n\n412\n00:20:35.447 --> 00:20:35.973\nnames.\n\n413\n00:20:35.973 --> 00:20:39.150\nAll right, so now you can see\nthat I have another data source.\n\n414\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.400\nSuper cool, awesome, great.\n\n415\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.810\nSo you can always change it.\n\n416\n00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.830\nBut the problem is, what if I did this?\n\n417\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:53.920\nWhat if I went over to my desktop, I went\nback to the same file I had before, right?\n\n418\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.898\nDepartment and address,\nwe're still gonna have to wait.\n\n419\n00:20:55.898 --> 00:21:00.321\n[LAUGH] I could have just used CSV files\nor a file that format that wouldn't\n\n420\n00:21:00.321 --> 00:21:01.500\ngive us this-\n&gt;&gt; Take so\n\n421\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.141\nlong?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really wanted to put this\n\n422\n00:21:04.141 --> 00:21:08.130\ninto the episode, so\nyou can feel a little bit of the pain too.\n\n423\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:12.510\nCuz I know you're gonna keep feeling it so\njust, now I want to be real with you all.\n\n424\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.910\n[LAUGHTER] Give you the real\nstory of what's happening.\n\n425\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.652\nNot going to do any magic posts even\nthrough I know we have amazing people\n\n426\n00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:18.850\nthat can do all this post work.\n\n427\n00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.170\nThat's like I watched this when-\n&gt;&gt; TV time.\n\n428\n00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah where it kind of fades in.\n\n429\n00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.770\nYou know there was a duration of time\nthat happened but they edited it out.\n\n430\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.795\n&gt;&gt; But this is the real deal.\n\n431\n00:21:27.795 --> 00:21:32.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, we don't purposely do it.\n\n432\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.850\nAnyways, keep going Vonne.\n\n433\n00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.808\nSo we have here, I'm going to put it to\na different worksheet within this file,\n\n434\n00:21:38.808 --> 00:21:41.070\nbut there's a problem with this.\n\n435\n00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.720\nLet's look at it.\n\n436\n00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.801\nWhen i look at this particular\nworksheet and i can go ahead and\n\n437\n00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:48.941\nright here, just showing you.\n\n438\n00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:52.427\nWhat's different about\nthis worksheet versus this\n\n439\n00:21:52.427 --> 00:21:55.549\nworksheet hierarchy?\n&gt;&gt; Can you go back to the other\n\n440\n00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:56.520\none?\n&gt;&gt; That one.\n\n441\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay so the fields, the number.\n\n442\n00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no city,\n\n443\n00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.260\nthere's no address.\n\n444\n00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.440\nThere's no phone number.\n\n445\n00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.570\nAnd we used the city in this mail merge,\n\n446\n00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.370\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n447\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.100\n&gt;&gt; So watch what's gonna happen.\n\n448\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.850\nIt's gonna say, wait guess what?\n\n449\n00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.080\nHey that data source that you told me,\nand the way that you had designed this\n\n450\n00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.070\nparticular mail merge with these fields\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n451\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.103\nit gives you a couple options here.\n&gt;&gt; I don't see it.\n\n452\n00:22:22.103 --> 00:22:24.371\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's saying I don't see city,\n\n453\n00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:25.820\nso what do you want me to do?\n\n454\n00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.590\nDo you want me to remove it or, hey,\n\n455\n00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.880\nmaybe you need to replace\nit with a different field.\n\n456\n00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.700\nNow, in this particular example,\nI don't have anything to replace with.\n\n457\n00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.250\nSo I'd probably go ahead and\njust click remove field.\n\n458\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.140\nI'm gonna just cancel this,\njust to let you know that,\n\n459\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.440\nsee look at what happens\nwhen I have a preview.\n\n460\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.020\nSee this is like my, cuz like right here\nit looks like everything is fine, right?\n\n461\n00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.040\nBut, if I go to preview,\nand then cancel it.\n\n462\n00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.210\nIt's like nope, I can't find this\nin the header record information.\n\n463\n00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.905\n&gt;&gt; And you don't wanna send it off looking\n\n464\n00:22:55.905 --> 00:23:00.489\nlike that, and waste potentially\nthousands on your fancy paper.\n\n465\n00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:01.860\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah.\n\n466\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.985\nAnd then your customers are going to\nbe like I think you got a problem here.\n\n467\n00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:11.420\n[LAUGH] And I've seen some things where\nlike in advertisements or whatever.\n\n468\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.080\nOr improperly created mail merges or\n\n469\n00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.150\nthings where it was like you\nforgot a little character.\n\n470\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.797\nYou got to watch those things.\n\n471\n00:23:21.797 --> 00:23:24.500\n[LAUGH] Those are things that I look for.\n&gt;&gt; The things you notice.\n\n472\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.510\n&gt;&gt; I know that normal\n\n473\n00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.100\npeople wouldn't know.\n\n474\n00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.230\nAll right, so we've got that.\n\n475\n00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:33.410\nSo just make sure you understand that\nwhen you start switching data sources,\n\n476\n00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.845\nyou got to make sure that\nyour headers are the same.\n\n477\n00:23:36.845 --> 00:23:40.140\nAnd even if they're not the same,\ncuz maybe like I'll only use first and\n\n478\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:40.742\nlast names.\n\n479\n00:23:40.742 --> 00:23:44.822\nSo changing it over to that other\nworksheet would have been fine.\n\n480\n00:23:44.822 --> 00:23:46.516\nSo I'm not using fields that aren't there.\n\n481\n00:23:46.516 --> 00:23:49.102\nYou know what I'm saying, so\nyou could just kind of go with that.\n\n482\n00:23:49.102 --> 00:23:52.765\nAnd the last thing I wanted to just\nkind of mention, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n483\n00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:53.796\nclose these files.\n\n484\n00:23:53.796 --> 00:23:57.630\nI'm not gonna save the changes,\nI'm just doing command w by the way,\n\n485\n00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:58.760\ngoing through all of that.\n\n486\n00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.920\nAlso, the idea of, hey, I've got\na merge document, I have a data source.\n\n487\n00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.710\nBut the data sources moved.\n\n488\n00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.280\nThose types of things.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n489\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.160\n&gt;&gt; So we talked about\n\n490\n00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.480\nit makes a path-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n491\n00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.970\n&gt;&gt; To that particular file.\n\n492\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.250\nWell, what if I delete that file?\n\n493\n00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.160\nWhat if I rename it?\n\n494\n00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.130\nWhat if I move it?\n\n495\n00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.986\nA lot of times, a lot of times,\nit will give you a warning and\n\n496\n00:24:19.986 --> 00:24:21.325\ngive you some options.\n\n497\n00:24:21.325 --> 00:24:24.915\nSo I just wanted to show you really\nquickly that this department and\n\n498\n00:24:24.915 --> 00:24:29.880\naddresses desktop, this is an XL file,\nthat is the data source for\n\n499\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.800\nthis particular Word document, right?\n\n500\n00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.250\nYou're just gonna have to trust me on it.\n\n501\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.340\nI'm not gonna open it just for\ntime purposes.\n\n502\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.000\nBut it knows that it's on the desktop,\nright?\n\n503\n00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.710\nWhat if I took this and\nput this into this folder.\n\n504\n00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.920\nTotally change the location,\nmy path is different.\n\n505\n00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.690\nSo when I open this, there you go.\n\n506\n00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.820\nI get one like, hey, guess what?\n\n507\n00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.740\nNow, the cool thing is if I read this,\nit actually found it.\n\n508\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.300\nIt was originally on a Desktop.\n\n509\n00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.150\nAlthough, I saw that you\nput it somewhere else, and\n\n510\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:05.660\nalso it have to do the same portal that I,\nthe document you're opening is seeing.\n\n511\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.740\nSo you might not always get this\nit well found found it anyways.\n\n512\n00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.880\nOkay, it's just one of those things.\n\n513\n00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.380\nBut notice it says, hey, I just need\nto make sure that you want to me to\n\n514\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.280\ngrant access to this file.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's like going back\n\n515\n00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.436\nto the permissions thing.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and\n\n516\n00:25:20.436 --> 00:25:22.522\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, learning.\n\n517\n00:25:22.522 --> 00:25:25.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So now you could say, okay,\n\n518\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.240\nyes, I do want you to access it.\n\n519\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.790\nSo it's kinda like you have to\nredirect it out to the new location or\n\n520\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.190\nwhatever your source data is.\n\n521\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.150\nI just cancelled that for\nnow, just to let you know.\n\n522\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.000\nNow, the one thing I'm gonna go through\nhere, and I'm gonna cancel this.\n\n523\n00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.950\nI'm gonna say cancel, and then it just\nopens this up and it found it anyways.\n\n524\n00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.000\nAll right well that's fine.\n\n525\n00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.566\nIt happens in a show,\nit doesn't work the way it was,\n\n526\n00:25:49.566 --> 00:25:54.561\nthere is a place where if you keep\ncancelling it and it's like nope, nope,\n\n527\n00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:59.315\nnope, it will finally come to this\ndialog box that says, okay, well,\n\n528\n00:25:59.315 --> 00:26:02.210\nI can't resolve this issue for you.\n\n529\n00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.360\nSo do you want to just remove this\n\n530\n00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.430\ndata connection and\ngo back to a normal dialogue box?\n\n531\n00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.470\nThis is where I should have\nscreenshot that warning.\n\n532\n00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.728\nCuz I was like,\nI'll reproduce it in the show.\n\n533\n00:26:14.728 --> 00:26:16.062\nNot happening.\n\n534\n00:26:16.062 --> 00:26:19.205\nBut if you're watching this,\nand you're like, my gosh,\n\n535\n00:26:19.205 --> 00:26:20.730\nthat's exactly where I went.\n\n536\n00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.430\nCuz, you're like nope,\nnope, nope, nope, nope.\n\n537\n00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.070\nThat warning dialogue box,\nwhen I read it, it kinda scared me.\n\n538\n00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.230\nI was like, wait, so you want me to\nsend this back to a normal file?\n\n539\n00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.740\nMe, I'm thinking normal,\nI'm thinking normal template,\n\n540\n00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.370\nI'm thinking blank document.\n\n541\n00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.570\nSo it's gonna delete all my\ninformation that was in there.\n\n542\n00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.550\nIt didn't do that, it just takes out\nthe database connection and those\n\n543\n00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.164\nangly brackets or guillemets, okay, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Giblets.\n\n544\n00:26:44.164 --> 00:26:44.745\n&gt;&gt; Gimlets.\n\n545\n00:26:44.745 --> 00:26:45.366\n&gt;&gt; Gimlets, yeah.\n\n546\n00:26:45.366 --> 00:26:46.403\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n547\n00:26:46.403 --> 00:26:48.504\n&gt;&gt; Those things, they're there [LAUGH] and\n\n548\n00:26:48.504 --> 00:26:51.610\nthey're just text, so\nthere's no database connection.\n\n549\n00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.020\nIt doesn't remove all your information.\n\n550\n00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.390\nSo don't get too scared on that,\nI got a little scared,\n\n551\n00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.840\nI was trying to show you it didn't work.\n\n552\n00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.625\nBut long story short, if you change\nthe pack of your data source,\n\n553\n00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:07.820\nit sometimes finds it and\njust tells you grant vision.\n\n554\n00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.940\nOther times, if I just took this and\njust like let's go ahead and\n\n555\n00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.270\njust delete this,\nI did a command delete by the way.\n\n556\n00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.700\nThat’s an easy way to just tell it,\nright to the trash.\n\n557\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.270\nIf I open this up, I can’t find it.\n\n558\n00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:26.660\nI cannot find it, there’s nothing I\ncan do, and this is where, this is it.\n\n559\n00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.694\nOkay, maybe it was on this [INAUDIBLE].\n\n560\n00:27:28.694 --> 00:27:33.130\n[LAUGH] Anyways, whichever you go to,\nI know I did the other way too.\n\n561\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.670\nNotice it's like hye I don't like\nunderstand let me just go ahead and remove\n\n562\n00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:43.230\nthe association, okay, and then it's\ngonna go back to a normal Word document.\n\n563\n00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.755\nAgain, I got scared about\nnormal Template blank.\n\n564\n00:27:47.755 --> 00:27:49.035\nIt doesn't do that.\n\n565\n00:27:49.035 --> 00:27:53.485\nSo if I remove all, and now,\nyou can see there it's just straight text.\n\n566\n00:27:53.485 --> 00:27:56.315\nThere's no, well, there are fields still,\nbut there are no-\n\n567\n00:27:56.315 --> 00:27:57.665\n&gt;&gt; Association.\n\n568\n00:27:57.665 --> 00:27:59.327\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so there you go.\n\n569\n00:27:59.327 --> 00:28:05.257\nAll right, so anyways, just little tidbits\nat the end of mixed matched data sources,\n\n570\n00:28:05.257 --> 00:28:08.520\nthe warnings that you're\ngonna get with them.\n\n571\n00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.210\nAnd just knowing to keep\neverything in it's proper places.\n\n572\n00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.270\nKeep your data sources\nwhere your data sources go.\n\n573\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.918\nDon't move them.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe even establish\n\n574\n00:28:17.918 --> 00:28:20.510\na permanent house for your data sources.\n&gt;&gt; Cool,\n\n575\n00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.717\nI like that.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n576\n00:28:21.717 --> 00:28:23.414\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, but\n\n577\n00:28:23.414 --> 00:28:29.178\nif you do change houses, you can direct\nit to the one's you need to go to.\n\n578\n00:28:29.178 --> 00:28:32.657\nSo just know that,\nit's not too entirely difficult, but\n\n579\n00:28:32.657 --> 00:28:37.059\nI just wanted to give you those dialogue\nboxes that you might encounter and\n\n580\n00:28:37.059 --> 00:28:39.193\nexplain them.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so thanks for\n\n581\n00:28:39.193 --> 00:28:43.233\nprepping us there, it's always good to\nhope for the best, prepare for the worst.\n\n582\n00:28:43.233 --> 00:28:47.008\nSo, I think that's what we did in this\nparticular scenarios, thank you as always,\n\n583\n00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:49.044\nVonne, and thank you for\njoining us as well.\n\n584\n00:28:49.044 --> 00:28:50.810\nBut for this show, let's sign out.\n\n585\n00:28:50.810

--> 00:00:18.390\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n4\n00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.340\nIn this episode we'll be\ntalking about labels.\n\n5\n00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.910\nSome may call you a geek.\n\n6\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.630\nSome may call you a hipster.\n\n7\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.105\nBut you know,\nit really doesn't matter does it,\n\n8\n00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:29.728\nVonne?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, it doesn't.\n\n9\n00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:30.607\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:30.607 --> 00:00:32.377\n&gt;&gt; I just didn't know where she was going\n\n11\n00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:36.340\nthere, I'm like, I love the way, I love\nthis turn you've taken, yes [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.830\n&gt;&gt; But no, that's not what we're talking\n\n13\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.430\nabout, is it?\n&gt;&gt; No, I guess we could go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.490\ngive that a source of types of labels that\nyou could have, then print on some labels.\n\n15\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.160\nThat might be fun.\n\n16\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.327\nSo\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n17\n00:00:47.327 --> 00:00:49.444\nno I see you like actually\nhave labels over there, so-\n\n18\n00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:51.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n19\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.550\nSince we are going to be continuing down\nthe mail merge world, we went ahead and\n\n20\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.530\ndid some letters.\n\n21\n00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.236\nAnd now we need to talk about labels,\nand maybe traditionally\n\n22\n00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:06.110\nwe're thinking of mailing labels,\nto where we're gonna print them out.\n\n23\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.120\nAnd, yes I brought props.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.850\n&gt;&gt; I love props, they're so much fun, and\n\n25\n00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.820\nwe're not promoting any brand here, by any\nmeans because there's just plenty of them,\n\n26\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.720\nyou walk into any office supply store.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] staying away from branding.\n\n28\n00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.710\nI walk in,\nthere's always that wall of paper\n\n29\n00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.870\nthat just has every single type of\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n30\n00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.450\nknow\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n31\n00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.220\n&gt;&gt; I had to get my daughter's birthday\n\n32\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.760\ninvitations from one of those places and\nshe's just like, what is all of this?\n\n33\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.842\nI'm like, it's paper.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:37.186\n&gt;&gt; It's like, my gosh,\n\n35\n00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:37.890\nwow-\n&gt;&gt; Lots and\n\n36\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.577\nlots of paper.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n37\n00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:41.311\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like those faux towel walls at\n\n38\n00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:45.115\nthe other, the bed bath-\n&gt;&gt; Those aren't real towels?\n\n39\n00:01:45.115 --> 00:01:46.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n40\n00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:46.784\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n41\n00:01:46.784 --> 00:01:47.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:48.650\n&gt;&gt; I never knew.\n\n43\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.240\n&gt;&gt; Anyways,\n\n44\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.892\nI digress.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:52.526\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n46\n00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:54.005\n&gt;&gt; I didn't, I'm still like,\n\n47\n00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:55.840\nthey're not real towels?\n\n48\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.415\nOf course yeah, they really wouldn't be.\n\n49\n00:01:57.415 --> 00:01:59.200\nNobody's gonna reach up there.\n\n50\n00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.500\nOkay, yes exactly, it's just going to be\na wall of paper and different labels.\n\n51\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.400\nAnd yes we have one, now this is,\nI will say the brand that\n\n52\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.380\nI am most familiar with but I mean this\nis just like any other type of brand.\n\n53\n00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.670\nYou have your regular brands that,\ngenerics and stuff like that.\n\n54\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.030\nSo the biggest thing to know about when\nyou're looking at these labels and\n\n55\n00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.780\nthese like pre-made templates if\nyou want to say, is the number.\n\n56\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.910\nThere is a corresponding paper number\nthat indicates that these are,\n\n57\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.420\nthese are name badges.\n\n58\n00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.390\nSo you can see that it has\nlike its 6 up on a sheet.\n\n59\n00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.750\nAnd so that's how this paper is designed.\n\n60\n00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.260\nBut if I looked at one of,\nlet's say these,\n\n61\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.130\nand these are mailing labels, right?\n\n62\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.252\nAnd these are same as Avery 5160.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n63\n00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:50.002\n&gt;&gt; 5160's a very standard label and\n\n64\n00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:51.969\nI was like,\ncuz I've been doing this for so\n\n65\n00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.440\nmany years I've memorized\nthis particular number.\n\n66\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.440\nAnd maybe some of you out there are like,\nyeah,\n\n67\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.950\nknow exactly what our file\nfolder naming labels are.\n\n68\n00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.980\nLike that particular number.\n\n69\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.195\nOr the name badge and so on and so forth.\n\n70\n00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:10.335\nSo what you do is you buy this paper\nthat's already got the stickers,\n\n71\n00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:12.560\nand it's all laid out.\n&gt;&gt; Pre cut.\n\n72\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.875\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:18.541\nAnd so I actually have one right here.\n\n74\n00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:20.860\nSo it's got some of\nthe stickers already taken off.\n\n75\n00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.870\nSo you can see that this is, if you look\nat this, this is really just like a what?\n\n76\n00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.500\nOne, two, three, one, two, three,\nfour, it's a table, basically.\n\n77\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.730\nThey're stickers [LAUGH]?\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n78\n00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.310\nI'm like, where's she going with this?\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n79\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.135\nI those misguiding questions I always say,\ngoing like, yeah.\n\n80\n00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know, it's Ronnie.\n\n81\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.070\nHe scarred me.\n\n82\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.600\nHe always tries to trick me.\n\n83\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.046\nBetween him and Adam, those two.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're probably like,\n\n84\n00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:49.284\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like the obvious answer could\n\n85\n00:03:49.284 --> 00:03:53.550\nbe totally wrong here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I won't lead you astray and I'll\n\n86\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.302\nusually be like, no, that was mine, so.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n87\n00:03:57.302 --> 00:03:57.827\n&gt;&gt; So yes,\n\n88\n00:03:57.827 --> 00:03:59.680\nthey're just tables.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n89\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay and so what we have are different\n\n90\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.480\nrows and columns and\nhow many per things on a page and\n\n91\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.350\nthere's a specific layout for this.\n\n92\n00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.160\nSo the neat thing is in Word when\nwe're going to be creating labels\n\n93\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.460\nweather we're doing a whole,\none single address on a sheet.\n\n94\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.420\nOr let's say multiples on a page, see?\n\n95\n00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.280\nLots of props.\n\n96\n00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.140\nRight?\nThis is where we can either merge them or\n\n97\n00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.440\ndo a single record on our labels,\n\n98\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.740\nas long as we understand hey, this is\nthe particular paper that I purchased.\n\n99\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.209\nThis is the number.\n\n100\n00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.996\nAnd then go ahead and change\nthe layout and then I'll go ahead and\n\n101\n00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:42.503\nput in all the information.\n&gt;&gt; So you are telling me that\n\n102\n00:04:42.503 --> 00:04:46.485\nin Microsoft Word they actually have\nthese predefined numbers or templates.\n\n103\n00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:48.106\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and they go right for\n\n104\n00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:51.150\nevery brand that you have out there.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n105\n00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is really neat and so\n\n106\n00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.550\nthat is what we are going to be doing.\n\n107\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.180\nIn this particular episode we're\ngonna concentrate on doing\n\n108\n00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.150\na mail-merge with our labels,\n\n109\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.230\nthat's why it's titled Labels: Mail Merge.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I haven't like\n\n110\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.460\neven played with this in so long and I've\nlearned so much from the series so far.\n\n111\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.650\nAs a matter of fact the only time,\nor the last time I should say,\n\n112\n00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.050\nI tried to do something like this was\nwhen I was learning computers and\n\n113\n00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.920\nI was starting out as\na computer technician.\n\n114\n00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.980\nAnd I Didn't have enough money\nto order business cards, so\n\n115\n00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.868\nI made mine on cardstock.\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, that's awesome.\n\n116\n00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:22.513\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n117\n00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:24.484\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, well I mean that's exactly,\n\n118\n00:05:24.484 --> 00:05:27.060\nand I think you kinda hit\nthe nail in the head right there.\n\n119\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.900\nIt's like, okay, not all of us have\nin our budget the amount of money\n\n120\n00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.430\nnecessary to go ahead and print like\nprofessionally printed name badges.\n\n121\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.230\nProfessionally printed envelopes and\nlabels.\n\n122\n00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.710\nLike you know, we have to kind\n\n123\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.446\nof cut corners when we can.\n&gt;&gt; Work with what you have.\n\n124\n00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:43.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n125\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.150\nSo it's like,\nokay these aren't like crazy expensive.\n\n126\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.000\nNow some of the ones like\nthe more customized templates.\n\n127\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.080\nLike, I was doing it for my sister's\nwedding and they actually have like table\n\n128\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.800\ntent, like paper that's made in\ntable tents where it's creased and\n\n129\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.334\nyou go ahead and fold it and everything.\n\n130\n00:06:00.334 --> 00:06:01.926\nThat was fun trying to\nfigure out how to print.\n\n131\n00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:03.446\nBut that paper was a little\nbit more expensive.\n\n132\n00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.886\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n133\n00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.859\n&gt;&gt; But at least that's why, hey,\n\n134\n00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:10.662\nyou can do a lot of these stuff\nright here through mail merge and\n\n135\n00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.420\ndoing labels is part of it.\n\n136\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.090\nSo that's why we're gonna concentrate\non the merge and then the next episode\n\n137\n00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.970\nwe'll talk about that whole one\npage with a single address on it.\n\n138\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.480\nLike maybe you're doing\nreturn address labels.\n\n139\n00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.492\nI always get those from whatever charity-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the charities, exactly.\n\n140\n00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:28.542\n&gt;&gt; They tell you and\n\n141\n00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:30.330\nthey print out the little-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n142\n00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.514\nwe're not saying don't support charities.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] but that same idea and\n\n143\n00:06:34.514 --> 00:06:37.540\nI always get, and\nthen of course I get, I feel guilty.\n\n144\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.990\nI do donate, cuz it's all good causes.\n\n145\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.960\nAnd I'm like, you took all this time\nto go ahead and print this out for me,\n\n146\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.140\nI'll go ahead and do it.\n\n147\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.210\nBut yeah, that's the exact\nsame thing I'm thinking of is,\n\n148\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.030\nI can make my own, and I have.\n\n149\n00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.730\nFor Christmas cards and\nwhat have you, so it's pretty fun.\n\n150\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.641\nSo we are gonna make some labels today?\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n151\n00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:57.221\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n152\n00:06:57.221 --> 00:06:57.842\n&gt;&gt; So why don't we go ahead and\n\n153\n00:06:57.842 --> 00:06:59.301\nget started.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n154\n00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:02.145\n&gt;&gt; I do have the steps that we are going\n\n155\n00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:07.750\nto need to do when creating labels\nwritten out in the episode notes.\n\n156\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.980\nSo I want to start there,\n\n157\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.490\njust kind of like how I always\nstarted with our letters.\n\n158\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.370\nSo why don't we go ahead and jump down\nhere and see that these are the episode\n\n159\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.240\nnotes in our markdown file\nwhich we talked about before.\n\n160\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.900\nAnd they're very similar,\nI'm gonna move this over a little bit.\n\n161\n00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.820\nIt's very similar to what\nwe did with the letters.\n\n162\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.810\nBut it's just, there's a few\nextra little points in there.\n\n163\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.810\nBecause it's always like, okay we need\nto start document, you do your merge,\n\n164\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.380\nyou put in your field,\nyou finish the merge.\n\n165\n00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.290\nOkay, yeah, that's great but the part\nwith labels as a little bit different\n\n166\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.570\nthan letters is that, you're always\ngonna start off with a blank document.\n\n167\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:46.720\nBecause you're going to need to take this\n8.5 by 11 and then change the layout\n\n168\n00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.430\nfor the number of the paper that you\njust brought right here to match it up.\n\n169\n00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.511\nAnd it's gonna create that table.\n\n170\n00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:57.999\nSo understanding how to work with\ntables and formatting tables and\n\n171\n00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:02.930\nall those things that we cover in our Word\nadvance series Defiantly check that out.\n\n172\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.591\nSo just make sure cause I'm not\ngoing to explain all of it.\n\n173\n00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:08.050\nI'm just kind of gonna go right into it.\n\n174\n00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.690\nSo understanding how to work with a table.\n\n175\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.080\nAnd the same thing, you select your\nrecipients, you insert your fields.\n\n176\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.820\nThe other big step that is not the same\nin performing a mail merge for\n\n177\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.480\nletter Is that you're going\nto update your labels,\n\n178\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.520\ncause you are going to design\nthe label in that top left corner,\n\n179\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.290\nthe one that is like up here,\nyou design this one and\n\n180\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.110\nthen when you click this button in\nthe mail merge, it says update label,\n\n181\n00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.780\nit goes pouf and just goes ahead and\npop the rest of it, it's really cool.\n\n182\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.180\nBut again,\ndifferent than a letter mail merge.\n\n183\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.630\nAnd then, you preview, you edit and\nthen you finish the merge and go ahead and\n\n184\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:48.510\ncomplete it by editing\nthe individual document and\n\n185\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:55.990\nhaving the number of pages in there\nbased on your data source record number.\n\n186\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.280\nOkay, but the files you're going\nto have it's the same thing,\n\n187\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.320\nyou don't really have a start document,\neven a start document and\n\n188\n00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.020\na letters was optional right,\nbut you do wanna have a merged,\n\n189\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.400\nthat's the one with a data connection,\nand that you have the merged fields.\n\n190\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.170\nAnd then it's formatted and\nthen the finished product.\n\n191\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.400\nAnd of course, the same thing that\nwe did with change in the sources\n\n192\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.570\nin the letters episode, where hey,\nyou have your merge one,\n\n193\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.930\nthen you want to connect it to a different\nworksheet or a workbook or a different\n\n194\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.980\ndata source, same idea, same thing with\nall the missing sources and everything.\n\n195\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.930\nSo, that, I would say the second half\nof that letters episode definitely\n\n196\n00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.910\napplies to the same thing\nhere with your labels.\n\n197\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.610\nSo, wanted to start off with that and\n\n198\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.670\nthe rest is just notes of how\nwe're going to be doing this.\n\n199\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.070\nBut, I'll just minimize this for now.\n\n200\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.690\nLet's start with a new document, we are,\n\n201\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.770\nwe don't really have any starting files,\ninstead, we're going to have a file new.\n\n202\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.290\nWe are going to kind of make\na little less waiting and\n\n203\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.720\nuse a CSV file this time as\na data source rather than Excel.\n\n204\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.270\nExcel.\nYes.\n\n205\n00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.970\nYou don't want to sit there and\nwait on that converter.\n\n206\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.750\nIt is the same thing anyway, really, so.\n\n207\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.890\nOkay, so here we go.\n\n208\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.860\nGot my start document.\n\n209\n00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.380\nLet go through the steps.\n\n210\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.750\nWe are going to over to mailing list.\n\n211\n00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.260\nNow here you have labels, right here.\n\n212\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.810\nAnd then you have this start mail\nmerge button and then labels there.\n\n213\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.300\nLike which one am I supposed to go to?\n\n214\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.030\nIt's kind of half a dozen which way or\nthe other.\n\n215\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.050\nIt's, [LAUGH] pretty much\ngonna go the same place.\n\n216\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.570\nThe difference here, let me just show you\nif I go to the button that says labels\n\n217\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.098\nyour gonna get this dialogue box\nthat you can create a single layer.\n\n218\n00:10:34.098 --> 00:10:35.190\nLayer, label.\n\n219\n00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.130\n[LAUGH] Next episode.\n\n220\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.030\nAnd down here at the bottom,\nthere's a mail merge, okay?\n\n221\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:45.390\nBut you're still gonna have to choose the\ntype of label, and then merge your fields.\n\n222\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.110\nSo if you go to here and click Merge,\nyou're gonna get to the exact same place\n\n223\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.660\nthat I'm gonna show you that if I go here\nto the Start Mail Merge and click Label.\n\n224\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.830\nIt's gonna end up in the same place\nbecause at this point it's saying,\n\n225\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.270\nall right I know you're\ngonna do a merge so\n\n226\n00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:04.680\nI'm not even gonna give you the options of\ndoing a full page of the same or a single.\n\n227\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.100\nWe're just going straight into merge,\nbut you got to tell me.\n\n228\n00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.980\nWhat type of layout do you have.\n\n229\n00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.430\nWhat label paper do you have?\n\n230\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.620\nAnd all of those different brands they\n\n231\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.280\nare all right here.\n\n232\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.260\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n233\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.250\nI mean there's quite a few of them\nobviously and some I'm sure are not even\n\n234\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.740\nUS, I mean some of these look\nvery not English, so [LAUGH].\n\n235\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.750\nI'm not even gonna try so\nit's just not something that we're\n\n236\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.200\nprobably familiar with but Averie is\na very popular again company here.\n\n237\n00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.670\nAnd even this one says it's\nthe same size as Avery.\n\n238\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.660\nSo, cool we got that.\n\n239\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.840\nTons of numbers, there's so\nmany papers here.\n\n240\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.570\nIt's like, wow really?\n\n241\n00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.140\nAnd I'm just flying through them all, so.\n\n242\n00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.440\nI'm gonna look at the numbers.\n\n243\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.150\nWe're gonna start with the 5160s.\n\n244\n00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.300\nWe'll just go with a straight-up,\nkeep going Vaughn.\n\n245\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.635\nWow, all right.\n\n246\n00:11:53.635 --> 00:11:54.860\n[LAUGH] We're getting there.\n\n247\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.445\n51, 60!\nThere we, it's already selected.\n\n248\n00:11:57.445 --> 00:11:59.850\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] it's okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:00.490\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n250\n00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.530\n&gt;&gt; You didn't know.\n\n251\n00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.320\n&gt;&gt; That's okay,\n\n252\n00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.310\nwell I should have known because I\nalways tell people, see, look over here.\n\n253\n00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.251\nThis is the one that you have\n\n254\n00:12:07.251 --> 00:12:08.934\n[LAUGH] selected.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n255\n00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:10.626\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that yep,\n\n256\n00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:12.572\nthat is the actual width and\n\n257\n00:12:12.572 --> 00:12:17.570\nheight of the label itself on\nthe page size, which is 8.5 and 11.\n\n258\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.030\nWe're good.\nWe click OK, and there you go.\n\n259\n00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.970\nNow what has happened here\nis it's created that table.\n\n260\n00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.380\nThat layout of the rows and\n\n261\n00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.460\ncolumns that associate with that\nparticular paper of how the labels go.\n\n262\n00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.590\nThis is, to me, like a big tip, okay?\n\n263\n00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.050\nThat you could go ahead and\n\n264\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.930\nkeep doing everything that\nwe're going to do past this.\n\n265\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.930\nBut I need, I'm a visual person, okay?\n\n266\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:47.330\nI need to see where the lines are, and\nwhere each one of those labels sit.\n\n267\n00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.470\nThe table, right?\n\n268\n00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.370\nWe have our table tabs up here,\nfor our contextual tabs.\n\n269\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.190\nThis little button right at the top is\nalways where you can select the table.\n\n270\n00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.090\nSo you select the whole table.\n\n271\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.490\nMy trick is I come over\nhere to table design.\n\n272\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.470\n&gt;&gt; Add the lines?\n\n273\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n274\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.060\nJust for\nvisual purposes while I'm designing.\n\n275\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.220\nSo.\nSee\n\n276\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.710\nthis makes me feel better already.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n277\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.300\n&gt;&gt; Like, I see it,\n\n278\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.660\nI can see it on the same pieces of paper.\n\n279\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.230\nYep, this is matching up.\n\n280\n00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.610\nOkay, I'm good.\n\n281\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.610\nWonderful.\n\n282\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.750\nYou don't keep the lines when you're done.\n\n283\n00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.610\nBefore you finish the merge, or\nbefore you print, take the borders off.\n\n284\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.460\nAnd that again is just selecting\nthe table, turning the borders off and\n\n285\n00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.100\nthen you'll be fine.\n\n286\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.880\nOkay.\nThe other thing I always suggest\n\n287\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.410\nkeep your show and hide characters on.\n\n288\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.160\nYou wanna keep the, so\nI have them on almost all the time.\n\n289\n00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.130\nProbably 85 percent of the time I'm\nworking in Word, they're on, okay?\n\n290\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.110\nCuz this is, especially when we\nget into some of these things,\n\n291\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:45.390\nespecially the next episode,\nit makes a huge difference.\n\n292\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.870\nLet's go back over to the mailings, cuz we\nneed to select our recipients, okay, so-\n\n293\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.220\n&gt;&gt; I did lie,\n\n294\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.730\nI used it one other time since that.\n\n295\n00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.018\nI'm having flashbacks-\n\n296\n00:13:55.018 --> 00:13:56.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like,\n\n297\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:56.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n\n298\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.375\nI printed it, I remember because I was\nhaving a party, I printed these labels\n\n299\n00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:09.160\non--it was clear labels because I\nhad like shiny, glittery envelopes.\n\n300\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.440\nAnd it looked really cool\ncuz I did like a font.\n\n301\n00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.675\nI was too lazy to handwrite\nall the addresses.\n\n302\n00:14:13.675 --> 00:14:16.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not lazy, it's efficiency.\n\n303\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:17.468\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n304\n00:14:17.468 --> 00:14:18.734\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:19.310\n&gt;&gt; But, I\n\n306\n00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.660\ndidn't use mail merge at the time.\n&gt;&gt; You typed it all out?\n\n307\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.803\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember how I did that.\n\n308\n00:14:23.803 --> 00:14:24.544\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:14:24.544 --> 00:14:25.537\n&gt;&gt; I probably did.\n\n310\n00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:27.580\nI probably drew squares.\n\n311\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.440\nI did it all like that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n312\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.160\nSo just trial and error.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n313\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Which probably\n\n314\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.930\nI wasted probably hours on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.680\n&gt;&gt; Seriously.\n\n316\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.450\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, cuz I'm talking and\n\n317\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.745\nI can see her face going like, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n318\n00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:40.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.870\n&gt;&gt; Is she having a flashback.\n\n320\n00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.768\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n321\n00:14:43.768 --> 00:14:45.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, party flashbacks.\n\n322\n00:14:45.145 --> 00:14:46.155\n&gt;&gt; Any who, yeah.\n\n323\n00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:47.496\n&gt;&gt; Let's keep going [LAUGH].\n\n324\n00:14:47.496 --> 00:14:48.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:14:48.169 --> 00:14:50.425\n&gt;&gt; So let's choose an existing list here.\n\n326\n00:14:50.425 --> 00:14:52.345\nWe're gonna go back over to our desktop.\n\n327\n00:14:52.345 --> 00:14:55.660\nLet's get that CSV file to\nmake it a little bit easier.\n\n328\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.480\n&gt;&gt; Probably would have been\n\n329\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.945\nfaster to handwrite them all.\n\n330\n00:14:58.945 --> 00:14:59.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n331\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.820\nYeah.\nBut you get so far down you're like,\n\n332\n00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.700\nwell I can't turn back now so-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n333\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.595\nNot gonna let this thing beat me.\n\n334\n00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:08.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I will defeat you.\n\n335\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.580\nSo now once I've selected the data\nfield or the data source and\n\n336\n00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.490\nI've told it to go ahead and\ndo this CSV conversion.\n\n337\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.740\nNow it's like okay, well then go ahead and\ntell me what you want in your label.\n\n338\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.700\nInsert your merge fields right\nin this dialog box, cool.\n\n339\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.250\nLet's address it.\n\n340\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.360\nAnytime we're doing a mailing,\nwe're probably gonna, a mailing label,\n\n341\n00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.810\nwe need a first name.\n\n342\n00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:33.670\nSpace, so click the spacebar,\nlast, and then we enter.\n\n343\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.080\nAnd then we go with the address, enter,\n\n344\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.960\njust like if you were hand\nwriting your letters, right?\n\n345\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.759\nSo we go with city, space,\nstate, space and zip.\n\n346\n00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.416\nLooks good to me,\nyou click okay and there you go.\n\n347\n00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:55.234\nThe cool thing is, notice that this one\nright here where it has next record,\n\n348\n00:15:55.234 --> 00:15:59.900\nand I know that kind of like moves\nthat next label, the first line, over,\n\n349\n00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.050\nthat's not gonna happen in the preview,\nokay?\n\n350\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.313\nLet's actually show you that,\nit's just saying, hey,\n\n351\n00:16:06.313 --> 00:16:09.053\nDo this one, then next record,\nput the fields.\n\n352\n00:16:09.053 --> 00:16:10.820\nNext record, put the fields.\n\n353\n00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.300\nOkay, so we're just seeing that, which\nis kind of the same in the background\n\n354\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.090\nletters they just don't show it as much.\n\n355\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.670\nThere we go.\n\n356\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.307\nThere's Bishop Timothy, there's Mr.\n\n357\n00:16:23.307 --> 00:16:28.440\nFigueo Pants and everybody else down\nthere, so it totally worked, awesome.\n\n358\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.400\nAnd I only have 19 so\nit's I'm gonna fill up the whole sheet of\n\n359\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.140\nlabels that if had 1,900, 19,000 you\nget the idea from our last episode.\n\n360\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.280\nWe could stop right there and be done but\n\n361\n00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.170\nif you're like me, I want it to look a\nlittle different I want a different color,\n\n362\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.180\nI want a different font,\nI want a different spacing.\n\n363\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.420\nSo I'm gonna keep my eyes contained and\njust do a few things\n\n364\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.350\nthat I feel are important to point out so\nI'm turning my preview off.\n\n365\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.060\nCome into here, we've done the idea\nof hey you could go ahead and\n\n366\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.700\nmake it bold you can make it a different\nfont, things you have to consider with\n\n367\n00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.470\nthis is that you don't wanna make your\nfont too big, because think about pants\n\n368\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.050\nthat's not a very long name.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n369\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.400\n&gt;&gt; But if you had Georgia, Whiskers,\n\n370\n00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.810\nMagosh, I mean that's something\nthat's a much longer title or name.\n\n371\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:26.000\nSo you want to try to keep it, basically\ntry to find your largest or longest entry\n\n372\n00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.130\nand then make that the font that fits\nas most and then everything else.\n\n373\n00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:34.060\nThat's just me, cause I like to say that.\n&gt;&gt; Well I mean if you think about like hey\n\n374\n00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.600\nI go ahead and\n\n375\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.840\nhit print, maybe I didn't notice like I\nmean do you get print preview, I didn't\n\n376\n00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.010\neven think about that because you should.\n&gt;&gt; Good okay keep on that thought [LAUGH]\n\n377\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.750\nyes okay we do have a preview here right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n378\n00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.070\n&gt;&gt; But if I see every night\n\n379\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.660\nall of my records, but\nif I had 19,000 I don't know if I, but\n\n380\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.480\nI know I have a really long name and\nwe have a whole episode on this but\n\n381\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.790\nthere is a find.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n382\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.900\n&gt;&gt; I can find a specific recipient\n\n383\n00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.690\nthat I know is really long, and it will\ntake me to that in this preview mode so\n\n384\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.640\nI can kind of judge from there.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n385\n00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's probably the one that I\n\n386\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.200\nwould do the best, and\nkind of go from there.\n\n387\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.795\nAnd really just keep on going through it.\n\n388\n00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:20.910\nBecause this right here, yeah,\nit's gonna keep showing me all of them,\n\n389\n00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.595\nso you can kind of work your way\nthrough that, until you see one.\n\n390\n00:18:24.595 --> 00:18:25.385\nSo either find or\n\n391\n00:18:25.385 --> 00:18:27.195\njust keep on clicking the button.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n392\n00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:28.355\n&gt;&gt; And you can find it, so cool.\n\n393\n00:18:28.355 --> 00:18:31.015\nAll right, so\nwe've got the change in the font.\n\n394\n00:18:31.015 --> 00:18:33.725\nLet's maybe make it a different color.\n\n395\n00:18:33.725 --> 00:18:36.445\nI'm just gonna make it all\na different color for right now.\n\n396\n00:18:36.445 --> 00:18:41.445\nGreat, but notice, and this is\na big one right here, I go preview,\n\n397\n00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:44.285\nand I'm like, well wait,\nwhy is it not doing the rest of them?\n\n398\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.530\nThese are labels you got to update.\n\n399\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.370\nOkay, right there, is all you're\ndoing remember is formatting that\n\n400\n00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.380\nfirst square.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n401\n00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n402\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.390\nall I did, click that button, poof,\nthere we go and it popped it.\n\n403\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.620\nThat's the cool thing, it's just something\nto remember when you're in labels because\n\n404\n00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.190\nyou don't have these any other\nplace when you're doing mail merge,\n\n405\n00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.810\nit's only on your labels.\n\n406\n00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.850\nAnd I preview and that looks good.\n\n407\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:12.420\nAgain, we could stop but,\nI have an alignment issue in my brain.\n\n408\n00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.770\nLike it's too close\nover to this left edge.\n\n409\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.060\nNow, I don't want to center it though.\n\n410\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.280\nI want to keep it left aligned, but\n\n411\n00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.950\nI just want to like just kinda\npush it over a little bit.\n\n412\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.250\nWell, this is indents, okay?\n\n413\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.290\nThis is where you would take.\n\n414\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.870\nOver on your home tab you\nselect all of this and\n\n415\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.640\nthen up on your ruler, you've got to\nmake sure you have your rulers on so\n\n416\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.190\nmake sure you go to view and\nhave your rulers checked on.\n\n417\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.440\nThis is all formatting that we've\ncovered in many many other episodes but\n\n418\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.070\nif I take this bottom square and\nthen just drag it in.\n\n419\n00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.960\nOkay, that's making me\nfeel a little bit better.\n\n420\n00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.240\nBut again, that considered,\nthe text length of your entries and\n\n421\n00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.010\naddresses can get really long.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n422\n00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.865\nYou might start there, and end up nudging\nyour way over, back to that margin.\n\n423\n00:19:55.865 --> 00:19:56.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n424\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.068\nAnd then the other one's gonna wrap and\ndo some weird stuff.\n\n425\n00:19:59.068 --> 00:20:05.150\nBut I like that, since I'm in a merge,\nwhen I go back over to mailings and\n\n426\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.800\nI click update to see what,\neverybody updates.\n\n427\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.030\nYes this is breaking, but again that\nnext record is just showing you there.\n\n428\n00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.790\nAll right, so\nyou're gonna have to play with this.\n\n429\n00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.500\nYou're gonna have to,\nsometimes just typing it,\n\n430\n00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.580\nkeeping it at a ten point font and\ncalling it a day, that's great.\n\n431\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.880\nI tend to just get very specific\nwith some of these things.\n\n432\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.700\nOne other thing about alignment.\n\n433\n00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:33.080\nBe careful about putting an extra\nparagraph on that last line.\n\n434\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.270\nI see, let me turn the preview off.\n\n435\n00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.790\nAnd I hit enter right here, you think\nthere is nothing wrong with it, but\n\n436\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.775\ndo you see how it changes the.\n\n437\n00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:44.566\n[CROSSTALK] And your like, ok well,\n\n438\n00:20:44.566 --> 00:20:50.430\nyou come over here your like I know tables\nso I'll go to tables and I go to lay out.\n\n439\n00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.948\nAnd I want you to all be like this, like\nthis is your vertical justification and\n\n440\n00:20:54.948 --> 00:20:56.415\nit's not going to do it.\n\n441\n00:20:56.415 --> 00:21:00.300\nIt;s because of that extra enter.\n&gt;&gt; Its counting that enter line?\n\n442\n00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, its another line.\n\n443\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:08.560\nSo this end of the cell needs\nto be at the end of your line.\n\n444\n00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.720\nThat's where everything's\ngoing to be okay.\n\n445\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.130\nSo that's why you have your show and\nhides on, they will throw you off, and\n\n446\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.020\nit can be a little misleading.\n\n447\n00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.865\nSome people wouldn't even think of it,\nlike it's fine.\n\n448\n00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:22.219\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n449\n00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:23.780\n&gt;&gt; That's a big thing with me.\n\n450\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.360\nThat's my little OCD right there,\nvertical justification.\n\n451\n00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.510\n&gt;&gt; I'm all about the symmetry,\n\n452\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.605\nVaughn.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n453\n00:21:28.605 --> 00:21:29.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n454\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.320\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it's kind of a big deal to me.\n\n455\n00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.850\nSo let me just update it one more time.\n\n456\n00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:33.820\nEverything looks great.\n\n457\n00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.240\nOkay, cool.\n\n458\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.810\nAnd that's really it.\n\n459\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.710\nI would go ahead and select my table,\n\n460\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.510\ntake off my borders over here,\nback in the table, the design tab.\n\n461\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:50.810\nAnd chose no border right there,\nbecause I'm ready to finish this file.\n\n462\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.770\nThis would be again, you would save\nyour document as your merged file.\n\n463\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.070\nSo labels, merged,\ncome back over to your mailings.\n\n464\n00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.430\nI keep hitting that review tab,\nmailings and then finish and\n\n465\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.010\nmerge, edit the individual records.\n\n466\n00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.070\nOr document,\nwell didn't do anything for me.\n\n467\n00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.235\nAll right well that's interesting,\nlet's not save that one.\n\n468\n00:22:12.235 --> 00:22:17.810\n[LAUGH] Yep preview results we click\nover here, that should look fine,\n\n469\n00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:22.920\nand I'm just gonna try it one more time,\nokay glitch in the matrix.\n\n470\n00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.180\nI am not sure.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n471\n00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Those gremlins are back.\n\n472\n00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.670\nAnd then I would say this is what had\nif I had plenty of other records.\n\n473\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.080\nYou get the kind of\nreoccurring theme going on now.\n\n474\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.650\nWhen you start doing one merge,\nyou can do them all.\n\n475\n00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.310\nLike the letters and now labels.\n\n476\n00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.770\nThe biggest difference again here\nis making sure you do the update.\n\n477\n00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.670\nCheck those enter marks.\n\n478\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.150\nGo ahead and populate your fields.\n\n479\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:54.225\nWhat if for some reason I forgot maybe\nthere was a middle name field, right?\n\n480\n00:22:54.225 --> 00:22:55.485\nOkay, I need to do another field.\n\n481\n00:22:55.485 --> 00:22:56.305\nWell, just like your letter,\n\n482\n00:22:56.305 --> 00:22:59.785\nright, you turn off the preview,\nyou can insert other fields.\n\n483\n00:22:59.785 --> 00:23:03.825\nNow I'm doing a mailing label, so I don't\nthink phone number is really gonna apply\n\n484\n00:23:03.825 --> 00:23:05.155\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n485\n00:23:05.155 --> 00:23:08.035\n&gt;&gt; But I could put in the phone number,\n\n486\n00:23:08.035 --> 00:23:10.500\nupdate the labels,\n&gt;&gt; Okay great.\n\n487\n00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.320\nBecause I'm showing you mailing labels,\nbut\n\n488\n00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.650\nwhat about the name badges, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n489\n00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.850\n&gt;&gt; On my name badges right here,\n\n490\n00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:22.130\nI just went ahead and put in the first and\nlast, I put in their sales,\n\n491\n00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.970\ntheir department, and

Yes.\n\n12\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.250\n&gt;&gt; In the last show,\nwe were introduced to labels, but\n\n13\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.830\nwhat will we be looking\nat specifically here?\n\n14\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.930\n&gt;&gt; This one, we're going to the whole.\n\n15\n00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.380\nIt's not gonna be a merge.\n\n16\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.713\nWe're not doing mail merge\nin this particular episode.\n\n17\n00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:46.515\nShe was like not too much,\nbut the mail merge series.\n\n18\n00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:51.055\nWell, because it's all part\nof mailing in general.\n\n19\n00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:53.593\nOf course,\nthat's usually what mail merge is for.\n\n20\n00:00:53.593 --> 00:00:58.252\n[LAUGH] But in the last episode we did\ntalk about we you could make name badges\n\n21\n00:00:58.252 --> 00:01:00.519\nand table tents, and everything.\n\n22\n00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.045\nSome of that stuff isn't mailing per se.\n\n23\n00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:06.430\n&gt;&gt; We only box ourselves\nin creatively here.\n\n24\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.936\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, we wanna roam free, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:09.568\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:13.013\n&gt;&gt; Free spirits over here, so making a-\n\n27\n00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:14.567\n&gt;&gt; Let's get the incense going guys.\n\n28\n00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:16.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n\n29\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.300\nLet's just breathe it all in.\n\n30\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.468\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yes,\n\n31\n00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:24.750\nwe're going to just go ahead and\nmake a full page of labels.\n\n32\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.500\nOr maybe I just need a single one.\n\n33\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.742\nWe also mentioned something\nabout cost cutting, right?\n\n34\n00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:31.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We wanna make sure that we only\n\n35\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.560\nuse what is necessary within our budget.\n\n36\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.922\nAnd so things like hey,\nI might only do a few envelopes, or\n\n37\n00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:43.917\nin a sense, we're not doing envelopes yet,\na few letters a week.\n\n38\n00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:47.786\nAnd then, I print out the labels, and\nthen I put them on an envelope, and\n\n39\n00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:50.000\nI put a stamp on it, and go on there.\n\n40\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.199\nSo I have something like we showed\nlast time of here's my 5160 labels,\n\n41\n00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:58.679\nand you can see that some\nof them aren't used yet.\n\n42\n00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.583\nOkay, well, I could still go ahead and\nhey, I need to address three labels,\n\n43\n00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:08.280\nand I want to go ahead and just put\nthem right here, maybe just one of them.\n\n44\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.920\n&gt;&gt; So how do I skip that first block?\n\n45\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.315\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n46\n00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:15.071\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hence, I love using the word hence,\n\n47\n00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:16.960\nsingle and full page.\n\n48\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.970\nAnd that's why we have our title of hey,\nI just wanna print this one.\n\n49\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.260\nJust a single one right there, and\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n50\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.927\nAnd then making, hey I wanna make\nmy return address labels, right?\n\n51\n00:02:27.927 --> 00:02:32.368\nWe went ahead and bought the Avery, or\nwhatever brand of return address labels,\n\n52\n00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:36.130\nand there's a specific number,\nand I want my address.\n\n53\n00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.383\nAnd maybe you want another cute little\npicture, that's in another episode.\n\n54\n00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:40.121\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:41.645\n&gt;&gt; But those types of things of kinda\n\n56\n00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:42.410\nfancying it up.\n\n57\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.570\nSo that's what we're\ngonna concentrate here.\n\n58\n00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n59\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.830\nso now, because there's no merge going on,\n\n60\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.740\nwe're not doing a mail merge,\n&gt;&gt; The Update Labels button,\n\n61\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.210\nit doesn't exist.\n\n62\n00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.262\nBecause the only time you update\nthe labels is like, hey, go ahead and\n\n63\n00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.340\nupdate for all the records that\nare going into this particular merge.\n\n64\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.770\n&gt;&gt; So we're like,\nworking on the source itself.\n\n65\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and when you work on the source\nitself, there are some little nuances.\n\n66\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.840\nCuz the cool thing, I mean, when we saw in\nthe last episode, hey, you go ahead and\n\n67\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.790\nformat one, we did some indents, right?\n\n68\n00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.830\nWe changed a font.\n\n69\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.540\nWe changed a color.\n\n70\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.730\nAnd then, you put the update.\n\n71\n00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.410\nAnd then poof,\nit just went ahead and populates.\n\n72\n00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.930\nYou don't have that poof bottom anymore.\n\n73\n00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n74\n00:03:23.798 --> 00:03:26.783\nyou have to just take that in\nconsideration when doing this.\n\n75\n00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:30.500\n&gt;&gt; I have been asking for a poof\nbottom and all sort of sounds effect.\n\n76\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.448\nI wanna a full on sound bar.\n\n77\n00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:34.496\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think they're afraid to\n\n78\n00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:35.206\ngive one to me.\n\n79\n00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:36.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm serious.\n\n80\n00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:38.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I would be too.\n\n81\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.350\n&gt;&gt; Guys, you need to right into\nthe company and be like hey,\n\n82\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.060\nguys, get tea a sound bar.\"\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [SOUND]\n\n83\n00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.141\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would want one too.\n\n84\n00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:51.835\n[LAUGH] And then they would never\nlet us on camera, ever again.\n\n85\n00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:55.344\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway this is exactly why I don't have\n\n86\n00:03:55.344 --> 00:03:56.146\na sound bar.\n\n87\n00:03:56.146 --> 00:03:56.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n88\n00:03:56.795 --> 00:04:02.490\nI do like to make sound effects when I do\nlittle buttons like the poof there we go.\n\n89\n00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.070\nAnd all right, so\nwe're not gonna have any poofs.\n\n90\n00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.034\nBut I will show you little tips and\n\n91\n00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:11.836\ntricks to know about how to make\nyour own sound effects, [LAUGH].\n\n92\n00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:12.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n93\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhy don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n94\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.361\nLet's jump down into the computer.\n\n95\n00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:22.820\nWe're gonna start with a new file.\n\n96\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.650\nWe don't technically need to\nhave this finder open to show\n\n97\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.740\nall the files, honestly.\n\n98\n00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.050\nSo let's just jump down into were,\nwe have our blank document.\n\n99\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.730\nWe'll start there, great.\n\n100\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.910\nWe go over to our mailings tab,\n\n101\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.710\nand this is since we're not\ndoing a mail merge, okay?\n\n102\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.800\nWe're not gonna start here, and\nwe talked about that in the last episode.\n\n103\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.940\nWe're gonna come over here to labels,\njust straight up labels of like hey,\n\n104\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.920\nI wanna go ahead and use this dialogue box\nto print labels or create labels, cool.\n\n105\n00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.050\nSo this is the whole idea right down here,\nyou see Number of Labels,\n\n106\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.730\nby default,\nit is on full page of same label.\n\n107\n00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.732\nSo if we're gonna do that first example\nthat I'd like to do is just printing\n\n108\n00:05:05.732 --> 00:05:09.989\nthat single label on this particular piece\nof paper that I have right next to me,\n\n109\n00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:13.054\nthen I'm gonna need to make\nsure I put this option first.\n\n110\n00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:17.378\nInstead of going down from the top down,\nI always like to concentrate on this one,\n\n111\n00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:20.949\nbecause sometimes I'll get going and\nthen I'll just click OK, and\n\n112\n00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.660\nthen like whoops, I forgot to do this\nparticular option before I started.\n\n113\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.716\nOkay, so whether you do it in step 3 or\nstep 1, I just like to go ahead and\n\n114\n00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:31.192\npoint that out right now.\n\n115\n00:05:31.192 --> 00:05:33.227\nBut since we are doing a single label,\n\n116\n00:05:33.227 --> 00:05:36.925\nthis is were you need to know the type\nof paper that your working with.\n\n117\n00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:40.778\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's cool, cuz I see it now,\njust like okay, there's the wrong call and\n\n118\n00:05:40.778 --> 00:05:41.950\nsome like how they know?\n\n119\n00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.950\nLike how would you,\n[LAUGH] But you tell them.\n\n120\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's the thing,\nwhat am I doing if I'm using the 5160?\n\n121\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.450\nNow, it just so happen that it's\nstill on this isn't it, right?\n\n122\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.670\nRight here, this is the label because\nI was from what I was doing before.\n\n123\n00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.470\n&gt;&gt; You obviously wanna to line up with\nwhatever paper you're on so keep it that.\n\n124\n00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.500\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, but if I was doing let's\nsay here are my other props down here.\n\n125\n00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.860\nThese are like the for the file folder.\n\n126\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.030\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n127\n00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.050\nthis is a completely different\nlayout isn't it, right?\n\n128\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.583\nSo this is going to be,\nthere is a lot, there's only.\n\n129\n00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:15.700\n&gt;&gt; They're pretty-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of hard there.\n\n130\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.330\n&gt;&gt; Probably, thinner to see.\n\n131\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.853\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super thin.\n&gt;&gt; Two columns, and they're thinner, and\n\n132\n00:06:18.853 --> 00:06:21.000\nthere's gonna be a lot more rows on here.\n\n133\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.490\nSo if I was like,\nI really wanted to do these,\n\n134\n00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.560\nyou gotta make sure you\nchange the label option, too.\n\n135\n00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.080\nOkay, so what am I doing, single or full?\n\n136\n00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.100\nWhat type of label am I using?\n\n137\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.330\nAnd how to change that would be\nright here in the options, and\n\n138\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.252\nthen you pick the number.\n\n139\n00:06:36.252 --> 00:06:41.165\nWe're gonna stay on 5160, but again, two\nbig steps that you need to make sure you\n\n140\n00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:43.974\nremember to always look for,\ntype and how many.\n\n141\n00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:47.708\nSo, we'll cancel that and\njust say that we're good here.\n\n142\n00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.333\nNow, you are gonna have to count.\n\n143\n00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:55.431\n[LAUGH] This one's easy, so\nthis one's going to be two\n\n144\n00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:56.055\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, you want to make sure.\n\n272\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.810\nSo this is way less expensive than this.\n\n273\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:13.230\nSo try it out, always print out\na test paper and then go from there.\n\n274\n00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.390\nAnd just like this, hey, go ahead and\nprint it out on regular paper.\n\n275\n00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.310\nDoes it line up?\n\n276\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.080\nYep, okay.\n\n277\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.010\nThen put in the other paper and\ngo from there, cool.\n\n278\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.020\nSo I would just go a head and click Print.\n\n279\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.744\nAnd say, yep, that's what I want\nwanna print, and then we click OK.\n\n280\n00:13:27.744 --> 00:13:29.710\nCheck your printer, and guess what?\n\n281\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.597\nIt's gonna go print on our floor right\nthere, and people are gonna be like,\n\n282\n00:13:33.597 --> 00:13:36.065\nall right,\nVaughn's doing mail merge again.\n\n283\n00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:38.030\n[LAUGH] But look at what it does.\n\n284\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.008\nIt creates a file with that right there.\n\n285\n00:13:42.008 --> 00:13:44.890\nSo that way if it's like, didn't work out,\n\n286\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.250\nyou can come in here cuz\nthis is just regular text.\n\n287\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.220\nI could change the line spacing,\nI could go ahead and format it and\n\n288\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.460\ndo whatever I want.\n\n289\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.860\nI could save it if I wanted to.\n\n290\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.550\nAnd then go for it.\n\n291\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.930\nSo printing does create the file.\n\n292\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.990\nEven though we didn't have that OK button\nlike we had in some other dialog boxes,\n\n293\n00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.820\nit gets a little weird, OK is grayed out.\n\n294\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.780\nThe Print becomes that and\nit makes your document after the fact.\n\n295\n00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.090\nGood thing to know, and you can\nalways go back and change it later.\n\n296\n00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.980\nYou don't need that dialogue box again\ncuz you're already in the space,\n\n297\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.260\nand hey, you know what,\nI put it on the wrong one?\n\n298\n00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.140\nYou can just cut this and\nthen put it over here in another space.\n\n299\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.560\nSo you got the wrong column?\n\n300\n00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.005\nJust cut and paste and\nput it where you need to go,\n\n301\n00:14:28.005 --> 00:14:33.480\ncuz it is in the layout of the labels and\nyou can do whatever you need with it.\n\n302\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.020\n&gt;&gt; Gosh Vonne,\nwhere have you been all my life?\n\n303\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.090\nI'm having another really bad flashback.\n\n304\n00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.289\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\nof this could have been so much easier.\n\n305\n00:14:42.289 --> 00:14:47.544\n&gt;&gt; I was actually tasked with designing a,\nyou know how we have our time clocks here,\n\n306\n00:14:47.544 --> 00:14:50.755\nbut we had badges and\nwe used our badges to scan in.\n\n307\n00:14:50.755 --> 00:14:54.169\nSo I used a barcode font, and\nthen I made all the badges and\n\n308\n00:14:54.169 --> 00:14:56.813\nI ordered all the scanners and\nset it all up.\n\n309\n00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:59.668\nBut I did not do it this nice.\n\n310\n00:14:59.668 --> 00:15:01.562\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n311\n00:15:01.562 --> 00:15:03.055\n&gt;&gt; I did it all manually.\n\n312\n00:15:03.055 --> 00:15:04.875\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; I laminated them and everything.\n\n313\n00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:10.200\n&gt;&gt;

How am I?\n\n9\n00:00:28.623 --> 00:00:29.595\nI don't know.\n\n10\n00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.910\n[LAUGH] I couldn't get the words\nout of my mouth to say, wonderful.\n\n11\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.959\n&gt;&gt; I'm so happy you're wonderful.\n\n12\n00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:38.076\nI think we're gonna have\na lot of fun today and\n\n13\n00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:40.598\nwe're specifically gonna\nbe looking at envelopes.\n\n14\n00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:42.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, you're correct.\n\n15\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.752\nYeah, yeah, there's no colon and\nsomething else after envelopes.\n\n16\n00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:50.685\nBecause what we're gonna do here is we're\ngoing to tackle both making a single\n\n17\n00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:52.660\nenvelope and performing a mail merge.\n\n18\n00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.442\nBecause with the labels,\nwe saw there was two different ways.\n\n19\n00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:57.500\n&gt;&gt; Different ways we could do it.\n\n20\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.715\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and\n\n21\n00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:02.232\nthere was some pretty pronounced\nsteps that were different.\n\n22\n00:01:02.232 --> 00:01:04.495\nWith envelopes, they kinda blend together.\n\n23\n00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:05.068\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n24\n00:01:05.068 --> 00:01:06.761\n&gt;&gt; And they're actually little easier.\n\n25\n00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:07.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n26\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.910\nwe're going to start there and\njust go ahead and do that.\n\n27\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.700\nSo why would we wanna use envelopes?\n\n28\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.240\nNow, I don't know about you but\nprinting on envelopes,\n\n29\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.550\nhave you ever tried to print?\n\n30\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.700\nLike put envelopes in a printer and\nprint them?\n\n31\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.490\n&gt;&gt; No, but I've printed on smaller\npieces of paper for photos before.\n\n32\n00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.107\nAnd it's not my favorite thing.\n\n33\n00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:32.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly, so this is one\nof those, you're gonna have to pick your\n\n34\n00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.150\npoison or pick your level of frustration,\n[LAUGH] and which one is easier.\n\n35\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.880\nOkay, is it easier for me to just take a\nblank envelope, make my labels, and then-\n\n36\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.830\n&gt;&gt; And attach them?\n\n37\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.976\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nstick the labels on the envelope.\n\n38\n00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:49.340\nSo that way you don't have to worry about\nfeeding smaller pieces of paper into your\n\n39\n00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.918\nprinter.\n\n40\n00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:53.472\nNow it also depends on like the level\nof fanciness, I was gonna say.\n\n41\n00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:56.210\n&gt;&gt; And also, yeah, what kind of\nprinter you have to be working with.\n\n42\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some of our printers those\nmaybe higher end printers, you might not\n\n43\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.060\nhave nearly as much problem with-\n&gt;&gt; Without having to hand each one.\n\n44\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.240\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, right, yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.037\nAnd it gets jammmed in there and\nall up in the rollers and everything, so-\n\n46\n00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:11.089\n&gt;&gt; Well, even certain printers,\n\n47\n00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:15.450\nthe actual print rollers can't\nhandle a higher weighted media.\n\n48\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.640\nSo that's something you\ndefinitely need to check,\n\n49\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.950\notherwise you will wind\nup with paper jams.\n\n50\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.105\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz this is basically two pieces of paper.\n\n51\n00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:25.590\nAnd you got this little guy right here,\n\n52\n00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.628\non these envelopes with a sticker-\n&gt;&gt; Oo, which potentially if you were\n\n53\n00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:32.698\nusing a laser printer, you have to be very\ncareful because certain types of media,\n\n54\n00:02:32.698 --> 00:02:36.090\nespecially if you have a really\nnice printer and you're renting it.\n\n55\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.821\nAnd then you put in any kind of media\nthat can fuse to the printer that is\n\n56\n00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:44.750\naffected by heat, like iron-ons and\nthings like that.\n\n57\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.400\nSo there's definitely\nthings to think about here.\n\n58\n00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the heat from this.\n\n59\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.640\nYes, this is a sticker.\n\n60\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.620\nBut even if it wasn't a sticker,\n\n61\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.240\nif the glue, like you're saying-\n&gt;&gt; Anything that would have a chemical\n\n62\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.630\nreaction or\nsome kind of change in composition.\n\n63\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.750\n&gt;&gt; I did not even think of that part, so-\n&gt;&gt; Ink jet.\n\n64\n00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.410\nBubble jet you're fine with, but when it\ncomes to laser, that's a different story.\n\n65\n00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.437\n&gt;&gt; That's why I'm glad I\nhave a techie with me today.\n\n66\n00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:13.019\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That knows all about this stuff,\n\n67\n00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.001\nthis A+ and NetPlus and\nall those other certified things.\n\n68\n00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.145\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n69\n00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:17.829\n&gt;&gt; So it's good to note.\n\n70\n00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.534\nAnd before we even start talking about,\nhey, we can go ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:25.857\nprint directly on envelopes,\nmaybe this isn't the best opportunity, or\n\n72\n00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:29.240\nthe best option,\ndepending on your hardware specifics.\n\n73\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.960\nSo that's something you do need\nto be aware of when doing this.\n\n74\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.307\nYeah, making them merge,\n\n75\n00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:39.010\nit's pretty much the same thing as\nwhat we've been doing the whole thing.\n\n76\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.832\nYou're gonna go ahead an start it off,\nyou're gonna select your recipients, and\n\n77\n00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:45.890\ndo your fields and\nperform a merge and all of that.\n\n78\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.590\nSo those steps aren't really that\nmuch different, it's just the setup.\n\n79\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.150\nAnd I don't have as many props with\nme as I do in the labels, but.\n\n80\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's\n\n81\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.170\njust like the same that\nyou have in labels.\n\n82\n00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.563\nThe world of envelope size, right?\n\n83\n00:03:58.563 --> 00:04:02.162\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I have two, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:03.254\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n85\n00:04:03.254 --> 00:04:05.570\n[LAUGH] It's pretty much just a rectangle.\n\n86\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.730\nBut this is like your\nstandard number 10 envelope.\n\n87\n00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.920\nLike, a regular business letter.\n\n88\n00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.340\nThis is as standard as you can get,\nreally, it's a number 10 envelope.\n\n89\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.730\nBut they have number nines,\nand I think, sevens and fives.\n\n90\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.292\nAnd then they have A5S and A7s and-\n&gt;&gt; I actually got a sheet from\n\n91\n00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:27.399\nthe United States Postal Sevice one time\nwhen I was looking to mail a uniquely\n\n92\n00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:28.169\nshaped item,\n\n93\n00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.295\nwhich was kind of strange because I was\nlooking to mail messages in bottles.\n\n94\n00:04:32.295 --> 00:04:34.760\nAnd you legitimately can\nmail a message in a bottle.\n\n95\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.880\nLike take that information we saw\nin the label show that you did and\n\n96\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.495\nyou could just put a label on\na message in a bottle and mail it.\n\n97\n00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:42.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Did you know that?\n\n98\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.280\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n99\n00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.730\n&gt;&gt; There's something I saw on, I think\nit was Shark Tank, that they were had,\n\n100\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.920\nyou can mail a potato.\n\n101\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.743\nAnd they were writing\nmessages on a potato,\n\n102\n00:04:52.743 --> 00:04:55.348\nand you could put the potato in the mail.\n\n103\n00:04:55.348 --> 00:04:58.873\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As long as it fits it the template\n\n104\n00:04:58.873 --> 00:05:02.530\nareas, yeah, they're pretty open.\n\n105\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.230\nThey're like,\nas long as you abide by these rules.\n\n106\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.350\nAnd I think you can even\ndownload it from their site.\n\n107\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You can mail some strange things.\n\n108\n00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.148\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny cuz my husband works\nat a print shop that they do mailing.\n\n109\n00:05:13.148 --> 00:05:18.240\nAnd I actually created this handbook,\nbasically, for\n\n110\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.490\nall of their users of postage,\ncuz they do all first class and presorted.\n\n111\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.733\nI learned way more about the postal\nsystem than I ever thought I could ever\n\n112\n00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:28.325\nknow about.\n\n113\n00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:29.485\nIt is crazy.\n\n114\n00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:34.539\nBut yeah, it's like the irregular sized\npackages, and what kinda constitute it,\n\n115\n00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.390\nand there are rules upon rules,\nupon rules that are just crazy and there.\n\n116\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.520\n&gt;&gt; And you don't wanna go spending a ton\nof money on some kind of advertising\n\n117\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.650\ncampaign only to get your mail returned or\nsomething.\n\n118\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.120\nThat would not look good on you.\n\n119\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a thing, you don't\nwanna mess with the Post Office either.\n\n120\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.998\nSo I'm gonna show you very standard\nways to do this on regular letters.\n\n121\n00:05:54.998 --> 00:05:57.109\nWe're not gonna be mailing bottles or-\n&gt;&gt; Potatoes.\n\n122\n00:05:57.109 --> 00:06:00.660\n&gt;&gt; Potatoes [LAUGH] but hey,\nat least we know it's out there.\n\n123\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.010\nAnd again, this is like, hey,\nwe're being cost effiicient.\n\n124\n00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.110\nWe are going to go ahead and\ninternally address our envelopes,\n\n125\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.730\nrather than sending it to a service\nprovider, and so on and so forth.\n\n126\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.160\nSo you do have to kind of work within your\nmeans and work within your hardware and\n\n127\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.520\nsee if this is an option.\n\n128\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.480\nSo yeah, maybe just skip the label\naltogether, go straight to the envelopes.\n\n129\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.465\nCool, just have fun feeding\nthat into your printer.\n\n130\n00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:22.977\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:06:22.977 --> 00:06:25.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, so why don't we go ahead and\n\n132\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.120\nget started.\n\n133\n00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.900\nLet's jump down into Justin's computer and\nwe will start up Word.\n\n134\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.150\nI probably could've done this before but\nwhy not?\n\n135\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.068\nLet's go ahead and\nstart with a blank document.\n\n136\n00:06:35.068 --> 00:06:39.177\nBecause just like are labels that\nwe had are different numbers, and\n\n137\n00:06:39.177 --> 00:06:43.070\nhow they're going to change the layout,\nyou could see in a 8 and\n\n138\n00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.914\na half by 11 is not the same\n[LAUGH] size as a letter, envelope.\n\n139\n00:06:46.914 --> 00:06:49.545\n[LAUGH] You know what I'm tying to say.\n\n140\n00:06:49.545 --> 00:06:53.100\nSo we're gonna have to try to change\nthe layout of what we're working with.\n\n141\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.650\nSo let's jump over to the mailings.\n\n142\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.100\nAnd just like the labels,\n\n143\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.320\ndo we want to start here where we have\nstart mail merge and go to envelopes?\n\n144\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.910\nOr we wanna start here and\ngo to envelopes?\n\n145\n00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.580\nIf you know you're going to be doing\na merge, yeah, sure, go ahead and\n\n146\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.590\nstart here.\n\n147\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.180\nBut if you wanted just a single one,\nthen you wanna start here.\n\n148\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.276\nBut of course, just like the other one,\nyou can perform a mail merge right from,\n\n149\n00:07:19.276 --> 00:07:21.274\nor at least indicate from that button.\n\n150\n00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.416\nI just clicked it.\n\n151\n00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:25.725\nBut, yes, I do wanna then do a mail merge.\n\n152\n00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:26.692\nI'll show you where to go.\n\n153\n00:07:26.692 --> 00:07:30.631\nSo I'll just say for\nlack of too many options,\n\n154\n00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:34.425\njust click this button and go from here.\n\n155\n00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:35.251\nSo we'll go with that.\n\n156\n00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:36.144\n&gt;&gt; Tell me what to do, Vonne.\n\n157\n00:07:36.144 --> 00:07:37.925\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, we'll make it easier, right?\n\n158\n00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:40.335\nJust go that way, don't do anything else.\n\n159\n00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:43.378\nSo when we have a envelope and\nwe're addressing it, and\n\n160\n00:07:43.378 --> 00:07:47.090\nI can actually remember this in school,\ndoing lettering lessons.\n\n161\n00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.179\n&gt;&gt; Learning how to do that?\n\n162\n00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:50.237\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember that, but\n\n163\n00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:54.310\nyou know I feel like schools do need\nto incorporate more life activities.\n\n164\n00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.910\nLike why didn't they teach\nme how to do my taxes?\n\n165\n00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.601\nEveryone has to do their taxes.\n\n166\n00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:00.086\nIn high school,\nthey didn't even mention it.\n\n167\n00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:02.118\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n168\n00:08:02.118 --> 00:08:04.781\nWe did this with like pencil and\npaper too.\n\n169\n00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:05.579\n&gt;&gt; That's cute [LAUGH].\n\n170\n00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:07.951\n&gt;&gt; We might be going on a tangent,\nwe should probably get off,\n\n171\n00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:08.671\nright now [LAUGH].\n\n172\n00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:11.950\nBut you can see that I remember like\nwhere do you put the delivery address?\n\n173\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.270\nWhere do you put the return address?\n\n174\n00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, you don't want a lot of\nfrivolous information on here,\n\n175\n00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.820\nbecause you might get that kick\nback from the postal service.\n\n176\n00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.880\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n177\n00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.220\nSo the delivery,\nthat's the one that's going to like,\n\n178\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.500\nwho are we delivering this to?\n\n179\n00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.855\nNow you do have the button over here on\nthe side that I could insert address from\n\n180\n00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:27.660\nmy contacts.\n\n181\n00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.530\nRemember we talked about which\nmail program are you use,\n\n182\n00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.410\nthat's your default one,\nthis is pulling from my Outlook contacts.\n\n183\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.719\nWe talked about this in the data source.\n\n184\n00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:39.174\nSo I could go ahead and address this too.\n\n185\n00:08:39.174 --> 00:08:42.741\nYou know what, let's go with\nJustin Timberlake, let's put him in there,\n\n186\n00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:43.650\nand there we go.\n\n187\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.480\nI've got everything pulled\nfrom my address book.\n\n188\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.770\nYou could physical type it in too,\nthat's totally fine.\n\n189\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.650\nThen what return address,\nthe one at the top.\n\n190\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.670\nBecause if it does get kicked back,\nwe wanna make sure it comes back to me.\n\n191\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.330\nI am using my address that is\npart of my whole outlook context,\n\n192\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.710\nI've got it for myself.\n\n193\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.230\nYou can turn it on or off,\n\n194\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.620\nyou can admit it, you could also\ngrab it from well, there you go.\n\n195\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.160\nIf I turn it off use my own from somebody\nelse because maybe you manage a whole\n\n196\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.090\nbunch of people in the office.\n\n197\n00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:21.032\nYou get the idea, I'm gonna use my\naddress, and we could just say good,\n\n198\n00:09:21.032 --> 00:09:22.988\ndone, you're ready to go.\n\n199\n00:09:22.988 --> 00:09:27.040\nBut of course there's a few other\nparameters we should always double check.\n\n200\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.410\nOne is you can go ahead and\nadjust the font.\n\n201\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.570\nMaybe you want it to be a little bigger,\nmaybe a little bit bolder.\n\n202\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.667\nThis is another thing that,\nyou don't wanna go too fancy, and\n\n203\n00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:42.311\nyou don't wanna make the font so crazy.\n\n204\n00:09:42.311 --> 00:09:43.726\n&gt;&gt; It's to be legible.\n\n205\n00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:48.310\n&gt;&gt; And the post office can't read\nit from what they call a OCR or\n\n206\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.612\nthe character recognition.\n\n207\n00:09:50.612 --> 00:09:52.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Optical character recognition,\n\n208\n00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.720\nbecause this goes through machines.\n\n209\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.430\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; That reads this stuff.\n\n210\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.182\nSo if it's in a font or a color of\nthe font that they can't recognize,\n\n211\n00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:01.606\nthen it gets kicked out and\n\n212\n00:10:01.606 --> 00:10:05.383\nthen it's manually sorted by people\nthat are looking at this stuff.\n\n213\n00:10:05.383 --> 00:10:09.915\n&gt;&gt; But you can slow things\ndown if not thwarted [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:11.987\n&gt;&gt; Thwart, I like that [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:10:11.987 --> 00:10:14.204\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we don't want any thwarting\n\n216\n00:10:14.204 --> 00:10:14.742\n[LAUGH].\n\n217\n00:10:14.742 --> 00:10:17.718\nSo keep it in a very legible sans serif,\n\n218\n00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:21.430\nor serif,\nit doesn't really matter honestly.\n\n219\n00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.350\nBut just something very legible and\nvery common, I woudl say.\n\n220\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.260\nSo you could go ahead and\ndo both of those here.\n\n221\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.890\nAnd the delivery and the return,\nyou also have the position button.\n\n222\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.809\nAnd when you click on this,\nthis is getting into like,\n\n223\n00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:36.158\nokay, well then, where do you want?\n\n224\n00:10:36.158 --> 00:10:39.135\nAnd this is what reminds of like school.\n\n225\n00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:39.703\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n226\n00:10:39.703 --> 00:10:43.130\n&gt;&gt; The middle, yeah, and\nthe return goes up at the top.\n\n227\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.482\nI wouldn't mess with these too much,\nthis is standard.\n\n228\n00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:48.330\n&gt;&gt; This goes back to their formatting.\n\n229\n00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.460\nYou don't wanna go outside of\nthose natural boundaries that they\n\n230\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.330\nhave enforced.\n\n231\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:59.496\n&gt;&gt; Perfect segue, because I actually\npulled up the USPS parameters here.\n\n232\n00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:04.420\nAnd this is just like the 202\nelements of a mail piece.\n\n233\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.343\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n\n234\n00:11:05.343 --> 00:11:10.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but something right here we could\nsee that it's just got this whole like you\n\n235\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.960\ndon't wanna go too far from the OCR,\nwhere it's going to read that.\n\n236\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.377\nSo, and I've seen my own mail, like where-\n&gt;&gt; Calligraphy?\n\n237\n00:11:19.377 --> 00:11:22.670\n&gt;&gt; Calligraphy, yeah, and mean maybe\nit's a little bit more to the left, but\n\n238\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.903\nit's usually pretty much in the center.\n\n239\n00:11:24.903 --> 00:11:25.531\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n240\n00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.190\n&gt;&gt; So, I'd just stay that way, okay?\n\n241\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.230\nAnd so, just go with what they have,\nhonestly, and I think you'll be all right.\n\n242\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.950\nBut if you wanna know more about all\nthe different mailing a bottle and stuff.\n\n243\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.290\nJust check out the USPS and weed through\nall their thousands of pages of rules.\n\n244\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.910\nBut you could change it right here.\n\n245\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.740\nNotice you could move the return address.\n\n246\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.415\nI could move the delivery address.\n\n247\n00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:54.425\nI'm just gonna go ahead and keep it auto\non both of them, and just call the day.\n\n248\n00:11:54.425 --> 00:11:55.445\nSo I have the positions,\n\n249\n00:11:55.445 --> 00:12:01.725\ndown here you could see that I have new\nsettings from your printer, all right?\n\n250\n00:12:01.725 --> 00:12:02.298\nThat's great.\n\n251\n00:12:02.298 --> 00:12:05.221\nBut then what if I didn't\nneed a number ten,\n\n252\n00:12:05.221 --> 00:12:08.565\nI need this envelope whichever\nthis one is [LAUGH].\n\n253\n00:12:08.565 --> 00:12:12.580\nIf you go to the page setup,\nwhen you click the Page Setup button,\n\n254\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.368\nthis is where you can\nchoose your paper size.\n\n255\n00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:18.354\nThis is where I can choose the A5s and\nthe 5 by 7s,\n\n256\n00:12:18.354 --> 00:12:23.950\nand all those different types because if\nI was doing postcards or what have you.\n\n257\n00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.840\nSo, it does default to a #10 envelope,\nand the orientation,\n\n258\n00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.630\nthe scale, and\nwhich printer that you want to choose.\n\n259\n00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.120\nIf I click OK, that's great.\n\n260\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.540\nIf you have a specific custom setting,\nthis is where it's going to let you know\n\n261\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.890\nthe custom size and the different\nways that you can feed the envelopes.\n\n262\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.140\nAnd that's pretty much it of what\n\n263\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.180\nI'm gonna talk to you about\nat this point in time.\n\n264\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.731\nThis insert envelope,\nI'll talk about that in a little bit.\n\n265\n00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:57.538\nBut notice I can just print right from\nhere, send it off, and send it to printer,\n\n266\n00:12:57.538 --> 00:12:58.611\nor I can click OK.\n\n267\n00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.180\nOr I can go ahead and\nsay let's go ahead and do the mail merge.\n\n268\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.043\nAll it's gonna do is the same thing,\n\n269\n00:13:03.043 --> 00:13:06.901\nbut it's gonna put the yellow bar across\nthe top to just change the layouts.\n\n270\n00:13:06.901 --> 00:13:10.391\nLet's just click OK,\nsee what happens, and there we go.\n\n271\n00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:14.868\nIf I zoom out a little bit, yeah,\nthat looks like the layout of an envelope.\n\n272\n00:13:14.868 --> 00:13:17.523\nCool, that's it.\n\n273\n00:13:17.523 --> 00:13:21.320\nBut even if I didn't fill in\nany of those dialogue boxes.\n\n274\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.250\nI could have totally left the return\naddress and the delivery address blank,\n\n275\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.995\nclicked OK, and then came in and\ndid this afterwards.\n\n276\n00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:36.130\nSo, it's not like the labels when we were\ndoing as like you can't go back and edit.\n\n277\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.380\nThis one, there's only so\nmany pieces, right?\n\n278\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.490\nSo you're okay with that.\n\n279\n00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:45.080\nAnd what it creates is\nindividualized text boxes.\n\n280\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.230\nSo see right here,\nwhen I click here, there's a border,\n\n281\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.050\nthis is one text box,\nthis is another text box.\n\n282\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.636\nSince it's a text box,\nI could move it if I really wanted to.\n\n283\n00:13:55.636 --> 00:14:01.320\nIt's not kinda conformed in paragraphs or\n\n284\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.240\na table like some of our other pieces,\nthis is just a text box that I can move.\n\n285\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.640\nI'm gonna undo that a couple time\njust to kind of put it back.\n\n286\n00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.990\nBut that gives you a little bit more\nflexibility in where you wanna put things.\n\n287\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.325\n&gt;&gt; And I mean just thinking back to the\noriginal concept, what we're doing here,\n\n288\n00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:20.277\nto link it back to that data source.\n\n289\n00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:21.238\n&gt;&gt; It will be.\n&gt;&gt; Will be?\n\n290\n00:14:21.238 --> 00:14:22.407\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] but we will be.\n\n291\n00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:23.500\n&gt;&gt; That's the end goal, okay.\n\n292\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but even if I once we get to\nthat step where I perform the merge,\n\n293\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.740\nI can stll move this all over the place,\nokay?\n\n294\n00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.650\nSo whether I have static fields or\nstatic text in here, or\n\n295\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:37.010\nI have dynamic fields of where\nwe're pulling from that mail merge,\n\n296\n00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.390\nthe setup, or\nlayout of the envelope, is the same.\n\n297\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.086\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So that gives you the freedom there.\n\n298\n00:14:44.086 --> 00:14:47.396\nI'm gonna turn my show and hide buttons\non right here just to show you that,\n\n299\n00:14:47.396 --> 00:14:50.342\nall right, there's one thing I'm\ngonna point out right now, and\n\n300\n00:14:50.342 --> 00:14:53.040\nwe'll come back around to\nit in the next episode.\n\n301\n00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.287\nSince this is its own text box,\nremember and\n\n302\n00:14:55.287 --> 00:14:57.730\nthat's where you have\nthe four pointed arrow.\n\n303\n00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.654\nAnd if I move this over,\nyou see how this is by itself but\n\n304\n00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:03.333\nthere's another paragraph right there,\nokay?\n\n305\n00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:04.461\n&gt;&gt; What's up with that?\n\n306\n00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:06.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you later [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n308\n00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.135\n&gt;&gt; But just pointing out that,\nokay, independent text boxes,\n\n309\n00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:15.404\nmoving this text box, but\nthere is a single paragraph up there.\n\n310\n00:15:15.404 --> 00:15:17.202\nIt's gonna come into play when we\nadd some other elements in that.\n\n311\n00:15:17.202 --> 00:15:17.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n312\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.850\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo let's move this around.\n\n313\n00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.760\nI'm just gonna kinda guestimate where\nthat was, okay close enough, wonderful.\n\n314\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.310\nWhat if I didn't want this ITProTV\nin here, I just wanted OfficePro,\n\n315\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.460\nI could take that out.\n\n316\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.784\nI have full editing capabilities,\nI could change the font,\n\n317\n00:15:32.784 --> 00:15:34.551\ndo anything that I want to this.\n\n318\n00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:37.460\nAnd if I had a single envelope I\nwould just go ahead and print this.\n\n319\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.176\nBut let's say, I wanna go ahead and\ndo that mail merge, all right?\n\n320\n00:15:41.176 --> 00:15:43.111\nI wanna connect it to that data source.\n\n321\n00:15:43.111 --> 00:15:46.036\nI can take this right here,\nand just delete it, okay?\n\n322\n00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:48.124\nIt's still a text box, okay?\n\n323\n00:15:48.124 --> 00:15:50.930\nAnd then I'd go through my same steps.\n\n324\n00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:55.402\nI'd go up to mailings,\nI would select the recipients,\n\n325\n00:15:55.402 --> 00:16:00.063\nwe will choose a CSV file to\nmake it easier on our lives, and\n\n326\n00:16:00.063 --> 00:16:02.460\nlet's go with it right here.\n\n327\n00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:07.127\nAnd we will open it, yes, everything's\nfine, we will use our encoding, and\n\n328\n00:16:07.127 --> 00:16:08.950\nthen we insert the fields.\n\n329\n00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.830\nAnd we do the first space last,\nand then we'll do address, and\n\n330\n00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.190\nwhoops, I forgot,\nI forgot to hit the Enter.\n\n331\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.850\nThat's okay, it's just like regular text,\nput my cursor in front of it,\n\n332\n00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:24.900\nhit Enter, and then come over here and\nlet's hit Enter again.\n\n333\n00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.890\nLet's do City and let's go State, whoops,\n\n334\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.000\nI put too many,\nokay well you can totally get rid of it.\n\n335\n00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.630\nYou just backspace it,\njust like if it was a regular word,\n\n336\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.970\ntreat it the same way and\nkeep on going, we're almost done.\n\n337\n00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:46.870\nPerfect, preview, yep working all right,\nturn off the preview, format it.\n\n338\n00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.520\nI'm going really fast, if this is the\nfirst ep that you've ever seen go back and\n\n339\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.020\nwatch the others and there we go.\n\n340\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.539\nSo that's where I feel it's just\na little more streamlined than some of\n\n341\n00:16:57.539 --> 00:17:01.626\nthe other labels, and\nworking with the tables and everything.\n\n342\n00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:04.198\n&gt;&gt; Well and\nyou're omitting steps in this process, so\n\n343\n00:17:04.198 --> 00:17:08.113\nif you did have like the hardware and\na printer that didn't give you a headache,\n\n344\n00:17:08.113 --> 00:17:10.240\nthen this would be such an easier option.\n\n345\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.410\nAnd you know what even,\nI'm not too familiar but\n\n346\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.240\nI think it's like Stamps.com where\nyou can even download digital stamps.\n\n347\n00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.560\nSo imagine if you could somehow\nincorporate that here and\n\n348\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.020\nyou wouldn't even have\nto have extra steps,\n\n349\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.950\nthen you just have them sitting on the\nprinter, ready to be stuffed or whatever.\n\n350\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.060\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah, and\ngood point on like the Stamps.com.\n\n351\n00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:35.559\nThey might even have all of within\ntheir particular application and\n\n352\n00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:38.462\nmaybe the same idea of a mail merge.\n\n353\n00:17:38.462 --> 00:17:43.242\nSo the steps that you're learning here and\nthe concepts of a mail merge in Word, but\n\n354\n00:17:43.242 --> 00:17:47.920\nmaybe you do use another service like\nStamps.com or something like that.\n\n355\n00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.908\nI'm sure they have the same thing right?\n\n356\n00:17:48.908 --> 00:17:53.016\n&gt;&gt; I know because even when you were\nexplaining exactly the logistics of how\n\n357\n00:17:53.016 --> 00:17:57.390\nthis process works I was thinking, wow,\nif you could just develop an API to to\n\n358\n00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.710\nhave some kind of in house CRN system\nto link to a mail merge system.\n\n359\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.905\nThen that would be so helpful for\na lot of companies, so\n\n360\n00:18:03.905 --> 00:18:05.863\nI'm sure there are things\nout there that exist,\n\n361\n00:18:05.863 --> 00:18:09.426\nbecause every time I have an idea, there's\n5,000 others of the same kind of idea.\n\n362\n00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:11.801\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm never unique here, so.\n\n363\n00:18:11.801 --> 00:18:16.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and we are using Word,\nbut there's all the SurveyMonkeys and\n\n364\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.360\nthose other things, I hear on\nthe radio all the time of like those\n\n365\n00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.926\ndifferent online CRNs that manage\nyour contacts and, custom contacts.\n\n366\n00:18:24.926 --> 00:18:25.871\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n367\n00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.686\n&gt;&gt; And all the different flavors of that\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n368\n00:18:27.686 --> 00:18:29.136\nthey probably have all\nthat stuff in there, too.\n\n369\n00:18:29.136 --> 00:18:31.375\nExactly.\n\n370\n00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:32.478\n[LAUGH] It's a good word.\n\n371\n00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:34.585\n&gt;&gt; It's a good like\nmethod to understand and\n\n372\n00:18:34.585 --> 00:18:36.800\nbe able to take with you in your career.\n\n373\n00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, definitely.\n\n374\n00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.000\nSo yeah, I don't know if I want to\nbe sticking on stamps after this,\n\n375\n00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.810\nI probably wanna print the postage and\nall that.\n\n376\n00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.480\nBut yay, at least we know it exists,\nit's great.\n\n377\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.540\nWe would still do our last step of\nediting the individual documents\n\n378\n00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.580\nto where then I now have all of my\nenvelopes next to my data source.\n\n379\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.160\nStick those envelopes in the printer and\nhope for the best.\n\n380\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.470\n[LAUGH] And print out my letters.\n\n381\n00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:06.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you might want to do a test one\nfirst before you hit the Go button on\n\n382\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.042\nlike, 500 copies.\n\n383\n00:19:07.042 --> 00:19:07.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah and\n\n384\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.455\nthen watch your printer in case it jams.\n\n385\n00:19:10.455 --> 00:19:12.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good point there.\n\n386\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Definitely so,\nas you can see pretty cool.\n\n387\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.130\nI'm gonna close this finished file,\nwe don't really need to save the changes,\n\n388\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.482\nI was just going through all the steps.\n\n389\n00:19:19.482 --> 00:19:23.890\nAnd again, because they're\nindependent text boxes it gives me so\n\n390\n00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.460\nmuch more freedom like I said before.\n\n391\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.120\nSo that's pretty neat, so just start\nfrom here and go through the steps.\n\n392\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:38.190\nNow I did want to go ahead and\naddress the check box that was in here.\n\n393\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.960\nInsert this envelope into the active\ndocument, and what that means.\n\n394\n00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.690\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel this,\nand I'm gonna close this file.\n\n395\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.470\nWe don't need to save the changes and\n\n396\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.540\nwell I'll close this file too\nbecause we had to start with it.\n\n397\n00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:57.080\nThank you USPS for\nall of your guidelines and\n\n398\n00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.870\nlet's just,\nI'm gonna pick the letter, right?\n\n399\n00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.690\nThe mail merged start that we've\nseen before that we're doing.\n\n400\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.120\nAll right, so this is an 8.5 by 11.\n\n401\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.350\nWhen it says here in the mailings,\nin the envelopes,\n\n402\n00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:17.690\ninsert this envelope into the active\ndocument, it means exactly that.\n\n403\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.536\nI'll put this to Justin Timberlake for\nnow and\n\n404\n00:20:23.536 --> 00:20:28.590\ncancel, have that check box there,\nI already know it's a number 10.\n\n405\n00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.460\nJust puts it right in front of the letter.\n\n406\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.730\n&gt;&gt; So, Vonne, what does that mean\nwhen it comes time to print?\n\n407\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.150\n&gt;&gt; See, this is the thing\nthat always kind of gets me,\n\n408\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.506\nI'm like,\nthat's really kind of cool, right?\n\n409\n00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:45.103\nSo, in my mind, let me take a little\ndetour and then answer your question.\n\n410\n00:20:45.103 --> 00:20:47.231\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because my mind is like, my gosh, so\n\n411\n00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:51.040\nI got all excited I was like well,\nI don't have to do my letters separate and\n\n412\n00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.840\nmy envelopes.\n\n413\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.310\nI could have them all in line, and\nI could go ahead and select my recipients,\n\n414\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:01.380\njust follow me for a minute,\nI can go ahead and select my recipients,\n\n415\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.500\nand then I will go ahead and\naddress everything all at once.\n\n416\n00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.065\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're basically\nforcing that collation there.\n\n417\n00:21:08.065 --> 00:21:11.310\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, right, and we'll just\ndo first and last for right now.\n\n418\n00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:16.332\nAnd then you put it over here, first and\nlast, ad you're like, awesome.\n\n419\n00:21:16.332 --> 00:21:20.435\nSo I'll finish and merge,\nand now I have, okay,\n\n420\n00:21:20.435 --> 00:21:25.347\nbishop's envelope,\nbishop's letter, fuego, fuego.\n\n421\n00:21:25.347 --> 00:21:28.710\nAnd you're like, this is gonna be great.\n\n422\n00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.120\nBut then, yeah, how do you print that?\n\n423\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.360\nI mean,\nyou have two different paper sources.\n\n424\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.890\n&gt;&gt; It might even be two different printers\nthat you have that can handle one for\n\n425\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:37.730\nthe envelopes or the other.\n\n426\n00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.052\nSo if you have a fancy printer,\nthen I would say try it, take and\n\n427\n00:21:41.052 --> 00:21:44.280\nadvantage of that, but\nmaybe not everyone has that option.\n\n428\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.010\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's where I thought the same thing.\n\n429\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.630\nBut then I'm like,\nI don't know if any printer can be like,\n\n430\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.900\nokay, every other page,\nchange the paper tray source?\n\n431\n00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.810\nI don't know,\nI don't know if that's possible.\n\n432\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.260\nI'm gonna maybe assume since they\nmade this, and it's been around for\n\n433\n00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.840\na long time, you could, but I don't know,\nhonestly, any printer that does this.\n\n434\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.413\nI could be completely wrong, so I know\nI do not have that personal experience.\n\n435\n00:22:08.413 --> 00:22:11.188\nSo yes, it's great that it's in line, but\n\n436\n00:22:11.188 --> 00:22:14.938\non a regular desktop printer,\nno matter how fancy it gets,\n\n437\n00:22:14.938 --> 00:22:19.440\nI'm not sure that you could say page one,\npull from the envelope tray.\n\n438\n00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.990\n&gt;&gt; So theoretically it's possible,\nand I wont get too in depth, but\n\n439\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.160\nwe're working in Microsoft and\nhere's kind of a strange thing Vonne.\n\n440\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.055\nI don't know if you know this,\nbut Microsoft doesn't,\n\n441\n00:22:29.055 --> 00:22:32.495\nokay we call printers those machines\nthat we touch and put the paper in.\n\n442\n00:22:32.495 --> 00:22:35.405\nLike, we call them printers,\nthat's not what Microsoft calls them.\n\n443\n00:22:35.405 --> 00:22:41.085\nIn Microsoft terminology, a printer is\nactually the software on the computer,\n\n444\n00:22:41.085 --> 00:22:45.415\nthe device,\nthe print device is the physical device.\n\n445\n00:22:45.415 --> 00:22:49.680\nSo theoretically, you could,\nthe software, the communication,\n\n446\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.920\nthe way that the operating system is\nprogrammed, you could tell it like it's\n\n447\n00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.940\njust switching that communication back and\nforth to the print device.\n\n448\n00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.110\nSo it could happen, I've just never\nseen a printer that like high end.\n\n449\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n450\n00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.240\n&gt;&gt; But\nmaybe like at your husband's company,\n\n451\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.790\nthey probably have printers like that.\n\n452\n00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:09.510\n&gt;&gt; And that's where I'm,\nmy mind started going like, okay,\n\n453\n00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.720\nwell, you are sending this\noff to a service provider.\n\n454\n00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.030\nSomebody that like, hey,\nthis needs to be this way,\n\n455\n00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.010\nand maybe they can go ahead and pull\nthis out and do all that kind of stuff.\n\n456\n00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.310\nIt's funny cuz I thought about that,\nI'm like, I wonder if you could write.\n\n457\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.500\nThen I'm going way too in depth I'm like,\nyou could write scripts and\n\n458\n00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.780\nall this stuff,\nthat you can tell it to do that stuff.\n\n459\n00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.111\nSo like you said, theoretically,\nprobably possible but I,\n\n460\n00:23:31.111 --> 00:23:34.952\nthis is where if you needed to print\nout envelopes and print up letters,\n\n461\n00:23:34.952 --> 00:23:37.850\none file is your envelopes,\none file is your letter.\n\n462\n00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.382\n&gt;&gt; By the time we're over here\nwriting our scripts or yeah,\n\n463\n00:23:40.382 --> 00:23:42.599\nfinding online the perfect printer for\nthis job,\n\n464\n00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:45.052\nwe could've already probably\nhad it done basically.\n\n465\n00:23:45.052 --> 00:23:47.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just go ahead and\nmake sure they match.\n\n466\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.380\nExactly, that whole like we're making\nmore work for ourselves, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n467\n00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.683\nBut anyways, I just wanted to tell\nyou that that's what it does.\n\n468\n00:23:56.683 --> 00:24:01.024\nAnd, yes,\nyou can use an insert into that document,\n\n469\n00:24:01.024 --> 00:24:04.596\ndo your merge, put everything together But\n\n470\n00:24:04.596 --> 00:24:09.342\ngetting it finalized on to\nthe physical envelope and paper\n\n471\n00:24:11.281 --> 00:24:16.180\nI hate to say you're on your own or\ncuz I really can't go past that.\n\n472\n00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.070\nSo this is funny.\n\n473\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.580\nI wanna go home and\n\n474\n00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.580\nask my husband about this tonight and\nso, how would you do this and\n\n475\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.610\nwhat would you do and so, I'm very curious\nto see what his answer's going to be.\n\n476\n00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.160\nYou can share it with\nus when we come back?\n\n477\n00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n478\n00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I'll go ahead and share that.\n\n479\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.065\n&gt;&gt; That means I'll have\nto remember to ask you.\n\n480\n00:24:35.065 --> 00:24:35.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I will do that.\n\n481\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:40.000\nBut anyways at least you know the command\nof what that check box means,\n\n482\n00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.250\nwhat you potentially could do and, again,\n\n483\n00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.460\nif you're sending it to somebody else it\nmight be a way to keep everything in line\n\n484\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.870\nto make sure your envelopes match your\nletter when you're performing your merge.\n\n485\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.055\nOr just you just want to go ahead and\nprint this off by itself.\n\n486\n00:24:56.055 --> 00:25:00.780\nWhatever you want to do, it does create a\nsection break and it finalizes your merge.\n\n487\n00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.890\nSo let them know that you know that now,\ndouble check you know the whole\n\n488\n00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.270\nway checking to before you do something\nif you have a really large mailing.\n\n489\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.760\nAnd always make sure that you're\nfollowing the right protocol for USPS.\n\n490\n00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.550\nIf you doing anything\nwith different postage,\n\n491\n00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.100\nthat goes into a whole other world.\n\n492\n00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.350\nBut, yeah, sometimes this is where, yes\nyou can do it yourself for small things.\n\n493\n00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.929\nYou go a little bit bigger.\n\n494\n00:25:23.929 --> 00:25:27.267\nYou might wanna call people like,\nwhere my husband works-\n\n495\n00:25:27.267 --> 00:25:27.850\n&gt;&gt;

Well thank you at least for\n\n500\n00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.920\ngetting us started and\n\n501\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.020\ngiving us a lot of options there Vonne,\na lot of things to think about.\n\n502\n00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.870\nSo thank you for your time, as always.\n\n503\n00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.480\nAnd you for your time as well,\nbut stay tuned.\n\n504\n00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.250\nWe have more information heading your way.\n\n505\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:45.880\n&gt;&gt; Hey, everyone.\n\n506\n00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.180\nYou know that last little part that we\nwere just talking about with envelopes and\n\n507\n00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.160\ninserting the envelope in\nline with the document?\n\n508\n00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.100\nAnd we talked a lot about the printing.\n\n509\n00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.740\nI said I would go head and ask about that.\n\n510\n00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.310\nWell, I have an answer for you.\n\n511\n00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.243\nProbably not possible [LAUGH].\n\n512\n00:26:01.243 --> 00:26:04.280\nSo my husband said that\nthey would never actually\n\n513\n00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.650\nuse a file that way of having\nan envelope in line with a letter.\n\n514\n00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.540\nThat they would want and request,\nthat it would be two separate files.\n\n515\n00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:18.170\nYou would have an envelopes as your one\nfile, your mailing letter as another,\n\n516\n00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.430\nand that's how they would\nthen go ahead and print it.\n\n517\n00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.980\nSo that's the answer to that particular\nquestion that I had posed, or\n\n518\n00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.690\nI said that I was going to\nbe posing to somebody else.\n\n519\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:32.790\nI also did a little bit more\nresearch of asking our techies\n\n520\n00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:37.850\nhere at ITProTV and OfficeProTV,\nand our good friend Ronnie said,\n\n521\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.160\nI think it's possible,\nbut I've never done it.\n\n522\n00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.120\nAnd I'm not sure if I would\neven know how to do it.\n\n523\n00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.290\nRuss said the same thing.\n\n524\n00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.680\nEverybody said maybe, and\n\n525\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.600\nI'm sure he was referring to that well\nyou might be able to program it and\n\n526\n00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.020\nmake sure if you had a physical\ndevice that could do it.\n\n527\n00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.280\nSure, it might be possible, but\nwould you ever want to do it?\n\n528\n00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.300\nProbably not sure about that one.\n\n529\n00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.700\nSo I would say that while yes,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n530\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.950\ninsert a envelope in the document.\n\n531\n00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.770\nYou might want to go ahead and\njust keep them separate and let them be.\n\n532\n00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.870\nDo your envelopes separate\nthan your letters.\n\n533\n00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:25.140\nSo that's my little tip for\nthis particular episode.\n\n534\n00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:25.750\nAnd thank you so much.\n\n535\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:32.424\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Yes, the extra paragraph.\n\n89\n00:04:18.744 --> 00:04:21.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly because our envelope\n\n90\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.280\nall have their own individualized text\nboxes which makes it a lot easier for\n\n91\n00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.270\nbeing able to move things around because\nyou're not constricted to your paragraphs.\n\n92\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.520\nBut I wanted to point that because that\nall-important single paragraph that\n\n93\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.920\nyou had to move.\n\n94\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.370\nSo let me just undo that.\n\n95\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.150\nSee it's kind of hidden over there.\n\n96\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.630\nYou had to move this return address\nover enough for it to see, ok.\n\n97\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.260\nThere's that paragraph.\n\n98\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.390\nAnd by the way, that anchor right there,\n\n99\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.050\nthat anchor is just anchoring this\nparticular text box to that paragraph.\n\n100\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.700\nOkay, so\nthat's what that indicates right there.\n\n101\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.040\nSo as long as you can move it over enough\nto where you can see the paragraph.\n\n102\n00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.300\nRemember how I was emphasizing in\nthe labels, put it in its own paragraph.\n\n103\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.060\nPut the picture in its own paragraph so\n\n104\n00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.250\nthat way you could then put the word\nwrap on it and be able to manipulate it.\n\n105\n00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.120\nSame thing here,\nit's just already created.\n\n106\n00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.630\nYou just had to find it.\n\n107\n00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.920\nYou gotta have your show hide\ncharacters on to make sure you see it,\n\n108\n00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.850\nand you gotta move that return\naddress over just a little bit enough.\n\n109\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.510\nAnd then from there,\npretty much easy peasy.\n\n110\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.580\nPut your cursor there into that paragraph.\n\n111\n00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.020\nSo that's where we want it.\n\n112\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.210\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ninsert a picture from file.\n\n113\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.760\nAll right, and\n\n114\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.880\nwe're gonna go over to my images\nfolder and we gotta get little Bishop.\n\n115\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.270\nAnd we'll insert this.\n\n116\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.150\nIt's a little too big.\n\n117\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.210\nSo then we'll go ahead and size it.\n\n118\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.080\nDon't worry about this right now,\njust keep going.\n\n119\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.630\nYou see how it just kind of, it will\nmove itself over the more I size this.\n\n120\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.050\nAnd so, if I'm trying to get it,\nI'll probably get it right there.\n\n121\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.260\nLet me zoom in a little bit, so\nwe could see this a little bit better.\n\n122\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.740\nMaybe push this over just a little bit\nmore and then just size this down.\n\n123\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.825\nThere, that's pretty good.\n\n124\n00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:09.390\n[LAUGH] So you can see that yeah,\nokay, I'm pretty much done.\n\n125\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.030\nI don't even really need\nto put on the word wrap\n\n126\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.220\nbecause it's kind of pushing it over.\n\n127\n00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.230\nBecause right now, I have the picture\nselected and I go over to the wrap text.\n\n128\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.550\nBy the way, I always say word wrap,\nbut it says wrap text.\n\n129\n00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.590\nIt's from going to the Adobe products.\n\n130\n00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.620\nIt's always word wrap and wrap text.\n\n131\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.280\nAnyways, same thing.\n\n132\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.430\nJust click on the dog button.\n\n133\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.700\nI guess they're rainbows now.\n\n134\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, we talked about this before.\n\n135\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n136\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.075\n&gt;&gt; There was a dog there\nat one point in time.\n\n137\n00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nActually if you go into here,\n\n138\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.560\nthere's the dog.\n\n139\n00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.505\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n140\n00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:44.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n141\n00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.660\nso you don't really have to\nchange the word wrap here.\n\n142\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.090\nBecause most of the time,\nit's gonna work just fine.\n\n143\n00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.080\nBut if you need to,\nyou can go ahead and push that,\n\n144\n00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.090\ncuz then you can kinda move\nit around just a little bit.\n\n145\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.265\nBut you see how it's kinda [SOUND].\n\n146\n00:06:58.265 --> 00:06:59.740\nIt is snapping a little bit.\n\n147\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.490\nThat's just gonna happen.\n\n148\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.040\nBut at least, you can take this and\nmove this over a little bit more.\n\n149\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.220\nThis is gonna snap too.\n\n150\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.720\nI probably wouldn't put that too close.\n\n151\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.320\nI want a little bit of white space.\n\n152\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI think you're like me.\n\n153\n00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.520\nWe always like to have like consistency,\n\n154\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.040\nlike a little pica-width\napart from things, right?\n\n155\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.720\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, yes.\n\n156\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Picas.\n\n157\n00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:21.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, sorry, if you haven't watched some\n\n158\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.356\nof our other episodes, and\nyou feel like, what's a pika?\n\n159\n00:07:23.356 --> 00:07:27.480\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] about that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a pica is a unit of measurement.\n\n160\n00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.610\nAnd just like we have our\nfonts are in points, right?\n\n161\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:38.880\nYou have 12 points in a pica,\nand you have 6 picas in an inch.\n\n162\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.010\nBecause that's why 72\npoints equals 1 inch.\n\n163\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.140\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n164\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n165\n00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.770\nI've worked in picas a lot because\nin design that's its default\n\n166\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.380\nmeasuring system.\n\n167\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.200\nYou did it from,\nwhat was it, the newspapers?\n\n168\n00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.334\n&gt;&gt;

I didn't do masking but\nI did manual cropping and\n\n178\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.395\nwe had carbon paper to send one\nto the printer, our publisher and\n\n179\n00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:22.565\nthen keep an original for\nthe layouts, yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:23.065\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We start talking like that, so\n\n189\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.578\nthrowing that out,\n\n190\n00:08:50.578 --> 00:08:53.306\nnow you now have a little bit of\ntrivia about picas, all righty.\n\n191\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.620\nLet's go and zoom out and, okay.\n\n192\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.860\nSo, that was it.\n\n193\n00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.450\nI went ahead and\nput the image in that paragraph.\n\n194\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.350\nI had,\nnow notice that paragraph is still there.\n\n195\n00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.620\nI'm gonna move this over just\na little bit more to show you\n\n196\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.600\nthat that paragraph still exists.\n\n197\n00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.470\nBecause now it's like, all right,\nI normally see photographs or logos.\n\n198\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.240\nBecause you put your company logo\nin there, and what have you there.\n\n199\n00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.610\nBy the return address but\n\n200\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:24.580\nwe were talking about maybe putting some\ntype of graphical element down here.\n\n201\n00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.890\nAnd again, this could be, you could\nbe putting a circle with a little\n\n202\n00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.890\ncoming soon or new product or whatever.\n\n203\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.085\n&gt;&gt;

Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n227\n00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.090\nI took this.\nThis is copy, well not copyrighted,\n\n228\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.155\nbecause it's mine.\n\n229\n00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:37.070\n[LAUGH] So now I've got this.\n\n230\n00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.180\nDon't worry, you do have to be\ncareful about your four-pointed areas.\n\n231\n00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.260\nMake sure you're selecting\nthe right thing.\n\n232\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.590\nGrab this,\nnow if I try to move it down, and like.\n\n233\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.810\nI forgot the step.\n\n234\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.790\nYou gotta make sure you put the square or\ntight text wrap.\n\n235\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.250\nThat gives it it's property to be\nable to move it wherever you want.\n\n236\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.780\nSo once I go with square, and\nthen I can take it, look at that.\n\n237\n00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.590\nNow it becomes it's own piece\nthat I can put down here.\n\n238\n00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.910\nProbably don't wanna get\ntoo close to those edges.\n\n239\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.000\nAnd there we go.\n\n240\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.920\nWe can do our fun stuff like change our\ntransparency and all the same things that\n\n241\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.500\nwe could do with any type of graphical\nelement and just put it right there.\n\n242\n00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.010\nYou just gotta make sure you\nget it right in that paragraph.\n\n243\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.940\nSo return address image\ngoes in that paragraph,\n\n244\n00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.280\nthe envelope image goes in that paragraph.\n\n245\n00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.620\nPut the word wrap on for\n\n246\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.160\nany element that is gonna go any where on\nthe envelope and then move it accordingly.\n\n247\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.950\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; I think the most difficult part\n\n248\n00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.206\nabout this process is actually going to be\ngetting that potato to fit in the printer.\n\n249\n00:11:39.206 --> 00:11:45.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That joke.\n\n250\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.275\nOkay, I feel like I have no idea what,\n\n251\n00:11:47.275 --> 00:11:49.871\nwell watch the other\nepisode it all makes sense.\n\n252\n00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:51.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna leave it at that.\n\n253\n00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.690\nWe're not even gonna explain it.\n\n254\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.125\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do a backwards teaser.\n\n255\n00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:57.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We gotta go back,\n\n256\n00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.240\nnot a forwards teaser.\n\n257\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.270\n&gt;&gt; People are probably shaking\ntheir heads right now.\n\n258\n00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're like those ladies.\n\n259\n00:12:04.287 --> 00:12:05.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n260\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.963\non that other thing it's like whats\ngoing to be the hardest part?\n\n261\n00:12:08.963 --> 00:12:11.710\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Getting the image itself and\n\n262\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.840\nunderstanding a little bit about\nimage formats, because maybe I have\n\n263\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.300\nenvelopes that are blue or light blue\nthat we're going to be printing on.\n\n264\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.480\nIf you have a JPEG file that\nhas that white box around it,\n\n265\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.340\nyou want to make sure you have\nan image that supports transparency.\n\n266\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:34.670\nThis right here, so\nI'm not going to go here, so there.\n\n267\n00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.330\nSee, this is a different color paper,\nright?\n\n268\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.690\nThis has transparency, because it's a PNG.\n\n269\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.700\nIf I insert, messages for\ndemonstration purposes, if I take\n\n270\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:52.450\nthis JPG and put this picture in, that's\nwhat I'm talking about, the white box.\n\n271\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.010\nAnd people are like, yeah, I can't stand\nthat, these are your file formats and\n\n272\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:02.390\nyour file types and what formats support\ntransparency, and so you're gonna have to,\n\n273\n00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.410\nif you're like, well I need my logo\nwith a transparent background.\n\n274\n00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.590\nWell, you're gonna need to go into\nother software to be able to do that\n\n275\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.930\nphoto manipulation, or\nmake sure you talk to whoever is in your-\n\n276\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.490\n&gt;&gt; Designer?\n\n277\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:18.440\n&gt;&gt; Designer that, hey,\nI need a transparent background logo for\n\n278\n00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.490\nour company.\n\n279\n00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.620\nAnd hopefully they'll be able\nto provide that for you.\n\n280\n00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.160\nSo that might be just one of\nthose outside just knowing how to\n\n281\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.250\nput a picture into an envelope or\nany type of graphical element.\n\n282\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:37.480\nUnderstanding the basics of image, formats\nand resolution, if your settings off some.\n\n283\n00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.080\nThey're like that's not high enough\nresolution cuz you have to have it 300 ppi\n\n284\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.640\nfor printing, la la la.\n\n285\n00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.390\nAgain I'm digressing into the world\nthat I love to talk about so\n\n286\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.840\nI need to hold back a little bit.\n\n287\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.180\n&gt;&gt; There are shows on that.\n\n288\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.650\n&gt;&gt; There are, yes, we have done that.\n\n289\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.370\nYeah, because I put them\nin the Word series.\n\n290\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.150\nYeah, okay, so that's why I\nlike to talk about it so much.\n\n291\n00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:00.090\nAll right so just make sure you\nunderstand some of those parameters\n\n292\n00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.400\nof putting in the pictures but\nthat's really, that's really it.\n\n293\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.600\nJust make sure it's not in a space in\nyour envelope that goes into your block.\n\n294\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.210\nI wouldn't put this on top of that or\nbehind it because then you might\n\n295\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.800\nhave a delay in how\nthe Post Office reads your mail.\n\n296\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.110\nYou might not wanna put it underneath\nit cuz they might put bar codes so\n\n297\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:28.970\nI'd say probably this area is most\nlikely safe, so go from there.\n\n298\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.440\nAnd that's really all I have for\nthis episode.\n\n299\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.056\nIt's a little bit of a shorter one,\ncuz' it's a lot easier.\n\n300\n00:14:35.056 --> 00:14:35.614\nSo, you know.\n\n301\n00:14:35.614 --> 00:14:38.100\n&gt;&gt; And you know we've really\nseen from like the beginning and\n\n302\n00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.470\nnow we're going through the steps,\ngetting different types of sources and\n\n303\n00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.820\ndifferent ways we can go ahead and\nperform these merges.\n\n304\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.190\nWe're putting them inside of the envelope,\nwe're mailing them off, and\n\n305\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.360\nI think we're going to\nbe going digital next.\n\n306\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.040\nSo you don't wanna miss out on that.\n\n307\n00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.360\nAnd that's our other\nlittle cliff hanger there.\n\n308\n00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.620\nSo, Vonne, do you have any final thoughts\nor anything before we head on out?\n\n309\n00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.750\n&gt;&gt; No, just make sure,\nlike we said in the other one like,\n\n310\n00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.140\nyou know,\nyou have to kind of pick your battles.\n\n311\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.280\nDo I want to make labels and\nstick them on to my envelopes?\n\n312\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.320\nDo I want to go ahead and design and just\ngo straight on the envelopes and printing?\n\n313\n00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.610\nBut, then you got the fighting\nwith the printer, well,\n\n314\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.665\nI guess you're going to be fighting\nwith the printer with the labels.\n\n315\n00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:18.550\n[LAUGH] Maybe it might be a little easier,\nso that would be the biggest thing,\n\n316\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.040\nit’s just.\n\n317\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.038\nKnow your options and\nknow limitations as well.\n\n318\n00:15:24.038 --> 00:15:26.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Right, but\n\n30\n00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:30.908\njust not the digital version\nof what we've been working on.\n\n31\n00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:31.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n32\n00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:35.025\ncuz we have been concentrating\nvery much on the print aspect.\n\n33\n00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:38.620\nWe're going to be printing these letters\nand stuffing them in to envelopes and\n\n34\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.400\nputting labels on them and\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.950\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nsend it via email.\n\n36\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.290\nSo that's pretty cool, so it's gonna\nbe like I said, the same process of\n\n37\n00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.080\ndoing the letter, it's just that last\nstep of when we're going to finish.\n\n38\n00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.230\nWe're not going to say edit the individual\ndocuments and create a Word file from it.\n\n39\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.371\nWe're gonna say, hey go ahead and\nsend it out through Outlook and\n\n40\n00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:06.790\neverything's going to be very cool.\n\n41\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.793\nAll right, so now the biggest\nthing with this one, though,\n\n42\n00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:14.955\nis you're gonna have to have\nOutlook set up as your default mail\n\n43\n00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:16.190\neditor.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n44\n00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.378\n&gt;&gt; You have to have that.\n\n45\n00:02:17.378 --> 00:02:20.330\nAnd this is actually something\nthat happened to me.\n\n46\n00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.030\nIn this particular account, because I\nhave multiple accounts on this computer.\n\n47\n00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.130\nI have virtual machines for\nmy PC shows and everything like that.\n\n48\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.823\nBut I hadn't gotten to the point here,\nin this particular account.\n\n49\n00:02:33.823 --> 00:02:37.572\nSee I have the Office Pro demo going,\nI have my regular account.\n\n50\n00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:39.910\nAnd then I have all my PC stuff on there.\n\n51\n00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.000\nI hadn't done Outlook yet.\n\n52\n00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.800\nSo when I came to mail, and I went into\nthis Finish and Merge, I don't have it\n\n53\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.616\ncreated just yet, that option that I'm\ngonna show you, it was grayed out.\n\n54\n00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:54.700\nAnd I was like, why is this grayed out?\n\n55\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.520\nSo I did a Googlyoogaly and\nI said, that's why.\n\n56\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.900\nOkay, I forgot I hadn't done this yet.\n\n57\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.615\nSo that was back in our data source\nepisode where we talked about it that you\n\n58\n00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:11.482\nhave to go into your mail application,\ntell it to stop looking at mail as your\n\n59\n00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:16.301\ndefault, you have to set Outlook as it,\nand this was in your preferences.\n\n60\n00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.850\nWhy not just go to it while we're\nat it and talking about it.\n\n61\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.258\nYou had to go into the Preferences here,\nand set that up, OK?\n\n62\n00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:29.406\nSo, all of that, if you haven't done it\nyet, that needs to be established first.\n\n63\n00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:33.010\nAnd this also connects to your\nOutlook contacts as well.\n\n64\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.780\nThat whole thing we've been kinda\nreiterating through some of these episodes\n\n65\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.320\nhere and there.\n\n66\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.436\nThis is [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; So for me I wouldn't even have known,\n\n67\n00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:40.790\nbecause I use Outlook as my.\n\n68\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.970\nI don't use another mail application.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n69\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.440\n&gt;&gt; But that's not the case for\n\n70\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.470\neveryone.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n71\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.390\nI had been using Outlook\nin this particular account.\n\n72\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.364\nBut I was going to the one online.\n\n73\n00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.410\nI was just going and logging in\nthat way and so on and so forth.\n\n74\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.894\nSo and I hadn't established\nit on the desktop client, but\n\n75\n00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:02.260\nthat's what I was going to do.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.970\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, a desktop version, but\n\n77\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.710\nalso that other step of your OS and\nyour mail, knowing it.\n\n78\n00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.321\nThere is a link in the episode\nnotes to the website out there.\n\n79\n00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:15.841\nI didn't pull it up to begin with,\nbut it's the Apple page,\n\n80\n00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:19.030\nit shows how to actually do\nthat in the specific steps.\n\n81\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.297\nSo definitely check that out.\n\n82\n00:04:21.297 --> 00:04:25.585\nSo if I'm gonna start my email,\nwe're gonna connect to a data source and\n\n83\n00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:26.581\nthat's great.\n\n84\n00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:30.860\nSo here is another caveat\nof your datasource.\n\n85\n00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.100\nYou need to make sure\nthat your data source\n\n86\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.550\nhas a field with the people's\nemail addresses.\n\n87\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.890\nI'll show you the one that we're\ngoing to be using in this example.\n\n88\n00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.045\nThey're right in here, and I have my\nemail list, and it is a CSV file.\n\n89\n00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:52.520\nSo I don't wanna mess\nwith the whole stuff for\n\n90\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.880\nyou guys in this picket\nepisode of the transposing.\n\n91\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.700\nAnd so, let's go ahead and\nselect all this.\n\n92\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.450\nAnd to show you that,\nit combined it all together, I'm sorry.\n\n93\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.530\nBut, you know what, let's do this?\n\n94\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.870\nOkay, this is the CSV file,\nbut believe me that when I say\n\n95\n00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.720\nthat this particular Excel file,\nthere we go, let's zoom in on here.\n\n96\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.360\nIt's the same thing, it works, I know, but\n\n97\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.190\nthis is an easier way to\nlook at the information.\n\n98\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.750\nIs that I have a First, I have a Last,\nI have an Email field, and a State, okay.\n\n99\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.900\nI can have as many other fields as I need\nto have when performing the merge, but\n\n100\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.570\nI have to have this because at the end\nof this process, it's gonna say okay-\n\n101\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.830\n&gt;&gt; Who am I gonna send it to?\n\n102\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.860\nAnd so, tell me which ones, and\nso, this has gotta be in it.\n\n104\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.850\nNow this is another way where, I'm using\na CV, well all my Outlook contacts.\n\n105\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.210\nIf I wanna send it to every single one and\n\n106\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.470\nhave my Outlook contacts really organized\nand properly filled out, that's fine.\n\n107\n00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.050\nOr maybe you want to go ahead and\nexport your Outlook contacts get\n\n108\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.060\nthat one field and like copy and\npaste it into your Excel files.\n\n109\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.970\nWith all your other information and\nmix and match it.\n\n110\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:10.560\nHowever you need to organize the data from\nwhatever source, you need an email field.\n\n111\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.610\nOkay so that's, you gotta have that,\notherwise, this-\n\n112\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.770\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, cuz it's probably not gonna end\n\n170\n00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.495\nup looking the way that you see it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n171\n00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:46.352\n&gt;&gt; In the way that that person's email\n\n172\n00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:49.990\nserver is going to translate it and\nturn it into something else.\n\n173\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.090\nSo, just be conscientious about this.\n\n174\n00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.010\nNow, if you're sending to people that\nare within your same organization,\n\n175\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.920\nyou know without a doubt\nare gonna be using Outlook.\n\n176\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.070\nYeah, some of the Microsoft\nspecific things\n\n177\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.720\nare probably gonna come through just fine.\n\n178\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.270\nYou go outside of that, then that's\nwhere you might lose some formatting.\n\n179\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.320\nBut keep that in mind if I'm\ngoing to be sending this out.\n\n180\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.400\nBut how you sent, just wait,\nI'll show you, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.000\nAll right.\n[LAUGH] Here we go.\n\n182\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.580\nLet's go with Finish the Merge.\n\n183\n00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.780\nNow I do not have Outlook open, right?\n\n184\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.560\nOutlook's not here.\n\n185\n00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.508\nOkay we're good.\n\n186\n00:10:26.508 --> 00:10:30.621\nIf I merged email, this was the option\nthat I said if it's grayed out,\n\n187\n00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:34.263\nyou don't have Outlook as your\ndefault editor in your Mac OS.\n\n188\n00:10:34.263 --> 00:10:38.296\nWhen I click this, this is that whole,\nhey, who is it to?\n\n189\n00:10:38.296 --> 00:10:40.410\nYou gotta have an email field.\n\n190\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.550\nSo let's go ahead and\nsend it to this person.\n\n191\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:50.040\nLet's address this, we will say,\nI'm just gonna say email merge for show.\n\n192\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.150\nAnd how do I want to send it?\n\n193\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.820\nThis is what I was about of,\nyou can send it as a text file.\n\n194\n00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:03.560\nThat's probably going to be your\nbest option to make sure everybody\n\n195\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.285\nat least gets the text of your message.\n&gt;&gt; Like the body?\n\n196\n00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:09.270\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, but\n\n197\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.630\nyou can put pictures in here, and\nformat it, it'll still go ahead and\n\n198\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.710\ntake everything down into a straight text.\n\n199\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.380\nIf you send it as an HTML, then that's\ngonna give you a lot more options for\n\n200\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.860\nfonts, colors, pictures,\nany of those things.\n\n201\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.914\nOr, you can send it as an attachment.\n\n202\n00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:30.465\nAnd that's where it's, whatever this\nis gonna look like, it will stay.\n\n203\n00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:33.190\nCuz they're going to be\nreceiving it as an attachment.\n\n204\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.307\nKicker here though because\nI can see Cherokee going.\n\n205\n00:11:37.307 --> 00:11:39.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't like this from\n\n206\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.070\na security, or just even an ease of\naccess, because you may have firewalls and\n\n207\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.020\nthings like that that are going to be\nblocking or moving it to spam because\n\n208\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.807\nit could see it as.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, one step further,\n\n209\n00:11:50.807 --> 00:11:55.515\nthis is going to attach as a docx,\nif somebody that you're sending this\n\n210\n00:11:55.515 --> 00:12:00.075\nto doesn't have Word, they are not\ngonna be able to open it because.\n\n211\n00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:04.971\nNow they might be able to open it through\nlike Google Docs, I know Google Docs will\n\n212\n00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:07.950\naccept docx, or you can open.\n&gt;&gt; Use Office Online.\n\n213\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and other,\n\n214\n00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.260\nI know Gmail will usually\ndo a preview of it.\n\n215\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.870\nEven your phone, my Apple mail,\nit'll even show me a preview of the text.\n\n216\n00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.600\nSo it's probably gonna come through,\nbut yes, docx.\n\n217\n00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.940\nMm, maybe there's some\nloss of translation there.\n\n218\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.770\nAnd yeah, sometimes I just want to see it\n\n219\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.994\nin the body.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n220\n00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:27.557\n&gt;&gt; If it's a message,\n\n221\n00:12:27.557 --> 00:12:29.490\nI don't wanna have to open the attachment.\n\n222\n00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.320\nAnd it's not like you can send a message\nand attachment, it's one or the other.\n\n223\n00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.740\nYou're sending text, or\nattachment option, or HTML option, okay?\n\n224\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.530\nSo just know that.\n\n225\n00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:46.130\nI will go with HTML, and then I\nclicked merge, mail merge to outbox.\n\n226\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.010\nI click it.\n\n227\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.900\nNotice that word, not word.\n\n228\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.470\nOutlook just popped up.\n\n229\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.560\nYou can tell I was doing some tests\nbefore this, and did it go out?\n\n230\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.020\nWell let's go ahead and\nlook at my sent mail, and there it is.\n\n231\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.850\nLook, Renee Bryan, Wes, Ronnie,\nand you can see the results.\n\n232\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.710\nDear Ronnie Wong, you live in Georgia.\n&gt;&gt;

And\n\n313\n00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.681\nI still wanted that personal aspect of-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n314\n00:16:57.681 --> 00:17:00.285\n&gt;&gt; Hey I'm addressing it in the email body\n\n315\n00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:05.580\nto you, and I'm pulling that it\nis your state, it is your city,\n\n316\n00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:10.180\nor whatever my data source is, I'm wanting\nto put those variable fields into.\n\n317\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:16.110\nSo that's why I wanted to use\nthe mail merge part of this in Word,\n\n318\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:20.265\nand then go ahead and send it out.\n&gt;&gt; Instead of just using a distribution\n\n319\n00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:24.385\ngroup, or to other options that\nyou may have for your company.\n\n320\n00:17:24.385 --> 00:17:27.093\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, personalized messages that\n\n321\n00:17:27.093 --> 00:17:32.520\nare in the email, that's the biggest\nreason why you wanna go to Mail Merge.\n\n322\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.200\nSo yeah, I just wanted to make sure\nthat I'm looking at all my notes.\n\n323\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:42.500\nThat yep, just making sure you understand\nthose different formats of emailing.\n\n324\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.320\nAnd when to choose HTML verses text and\neverything.\n\n325\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.224\nIt's really,\nit's just the same thing we've been doing.\n\n326\n00:17:48.224 --> 00:17:52.057\nJust that extra step on the end of okay,\ngo ahead and\n\n327\n00:17:52.057 --> 00:17:56.874\nnow email this digital version\nof my letter through my Outlook,\n\n328\n00:17:56.874 --> 00:17:59.820\nand it's pretty powerful.\n&gt;&gt; It really is,\n\n329\n00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.190\nand we've been talking a lot\nabout like being frugal.\n\n330\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.420\nThe frugality aspect of it.\n\n331\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.580\nAnd if you're starting your own company\nand you don't have a budget for\n\n332\n00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:16.343\nhiring a marketing department, or\na marketing person, or even a third party.\n\n333\n00:18:16.343 --> 00:18:19.847\nYou can Start accumulating when maybe\nyou go to events or something, and\n\n334\n00:18:19.847 --> 00:18:22.015\nhave someone write down their email list.\n\n335\n00:18:22.015 --> 00:18:25.875\nKeep it in an Excel spreadsheet, and then\nyou can see how easy it is to market to\n\n336\n00:18:25.875 --> 00:18:29.930\nthem and get your word out about your\nproducts or services or whatever.\n\n337\n00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.780\nSo this could really help some people out.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great example.\n\n338\n00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.780\nAnd also if you think about just internal.\n\n339\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.460\nYou all there [LAUGH] might have a company\nwhere you have 10,000 employees.\n\n340\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.290\nSo this is all-\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.230\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, we're going to find ways of\n\n28\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.400\nbeing able to, well, sort and filter the\nrecords that we have from our data source.\n\n29\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.470\nBecause sometimes we might\nnot need all of them.\n\n30\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.645\nWe've been working a lot with our data\nsource of our department addresses files,\n\n31\n00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:19.137\nto where we have marketing and\nhuman resources.\n\n32\n00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:23.521\nNow we only have 19 records, so\nI'm trying to keep it easier for us, but\n\n33\n00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:27.976\nwhat if I have that source, but I'm only\nready to go ahead and perform a mail\n\n34\n00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:32.762\nmerge for whatever, letters, envelopes,\n&gt;&gt; Labels, badges, or\n\n35\n00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:34.525\nwhatever.\n&gt;&gt; All of those things that we can do.\n\n36\n00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:36.154\n&gt;&gt; All those things we learned.\n\n37\n00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:37.686\n&gt;&gt; I'm like I forgot the other ones\n\n38\n00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:38.430\nthat we can do.\n\n39\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.500\nBut whatever the end result is,\nI only need the marketing department.\n\n40\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.720\nAnd however many records I had in\nmarketing, that's what I need.\n\n41\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.315\nSo instead of changing your data source or\nmanipulating your data source first,\n\n42\n00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.854\nlike making extra files and\nall that kind of stuff,\n\n43\n00:01:55.854 --> 00:02:00.152\nwhat you can do is you can go ahead and\ndo that in the mail merge.\n\n44\n00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:05.410\nAnd when this merge here, you are telling\nWord to filter out the records.\n\n45\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.130\nAnd so, that finished product is not\ngoing to affect the data source and\n\n46\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.520\nyou can be able to kinda pick and\nchoose what you want.\n\n47\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.720\nPretty awesome.\n\n48\n00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.160\nSo we're gonna go through some\nof those different settings and\n\n49\n00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.730\nhow we can use it to our advantage.\n\n50\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.080\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n51\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.091\nAnd then of course sorting, right,\njust changing alphabetical cuz sometimes\n\n52\n00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:30.724\nin your data source you might not be able\nto sort by last name in ascending or\n\n53\n00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:35.235\ndescending order because of the way\nthat the data source is comprised.\n\n54\n00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:38.095\nIt's like you're just not able\nto do it for whatever reason,\n\n55\n00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:39.960\nyou can do that here in the merge.\n&gt;&gt; I've got\n\n56\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.850\nanother request.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n57\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.390\n&gt;&gt; So in addition to my sound board.\n\n58\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.350\nThis just came to me.\n\n59\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.620\nI really think that my duty as a host is\nunfulfilled without a spinning wheel.\n\n60\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.380\nSo that I could spin it, and say what are\nwe gonna do first, like sort, filter, or\n\n61\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.310\nfind.\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, you know I love props too.\n\n62\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.365\n&gt;&gt; So what's it gonna be, Vonne?\n\n63\n00:02:57.365 --> 00:03:00.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Why don't we spin it and\n\n64\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.190\ngo with filter.\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n65\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH]\n\n66\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.092\nWe're such dorks.\n\n67\n00:03:06.092 --> 00:03:06.733\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:08.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We like to have fun so\n\n69\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.490\nthat's always good.\n\n70\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.678\nSo yes, why don't we go ahead and\nstart with filter.\n\n71\n00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:14.360\nLet's jump down into our computer.\n\n72\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.410\nI've got a data source already up that\nI want to just kind of start off with\n\n73\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.810\nas we have our department and addresses,\nfilter and rules, I just kinda changed\n\n74\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.580\na few things in the dataset specifically\nfor these particular examples.\n\n75\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.650\nSo you can see that it\nstarts with Cheeto Sticks,\n\n76\n00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.060\nand then goes, I know, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.625\n&gt;&gt; And then we go to Fuego, and Mocha, and\n\n78\n00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.771\neverything, so\nit's a little bit different order.\n\n79\n00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:41.533\nBishop Timothy in not the first record,\nlike we've been seeing in some of\n\n80\n00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:44.400\nthe other episodes,\nbecause it is a different source.\n\n81\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.490\nHe's still in there, okay?\n\n82\n00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.120\nSo it's the same list for the most part,\nbut just a little bit different order.\n\n83\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.112\nSo just kinda know it's Cheetos and\nthen Tootsie Paws.\n\n84\n00:03:53.112 --> 00:03:55.871\nI forgot a T down there in Tootsie, but\n\n85\n00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:57.000\nclose enough.\n\n86\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.970\n&gt;&gt; Toosie.\n&gt;&gt; Toosie.\n\n87\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.815\nYeah, it says Toosie.\n\n88\n00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:00.900\n[LAUGH] So\n\n89\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.230\nwe can see the order that's going on\nright now in this particular file.\n\n90\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.230\nLet's go down into Word.\n\n91\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.680\nWe'll start a new document.\n\n92\n00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.030\nWe'll go ahead through the different\nsteps of let's start a mail merge.\n\n93\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.640\nWe'll go to mailings.\n\n94\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.520\nWe'll select that particular file\nin my folder which is right there.\n\n95\n00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.290\nThere's my csv.\n\n96\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.920\nWe say OK.\n\n97\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.850\nAll the things you've\nseen a thousand times.\n\n98\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.780\nWe will insert a few fields and\nlet's enter.\n\n99\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.490\nI'm gonna get the department,\nlet's do the city, and\n\n100\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.970\nthe state, just to get our examples going.\n\n101\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.310\nPreviewing our results, yep,\nCheeto is the first record.\n\n102\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.435\nIf I go to the very last\nrecord Tootsie Paws or Toosie.\n\n103\n00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:50.790\n[LAUGH] Toosie is last and\neverything in between.\n\n104\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.890\nBecause we haven't done anything\nin here to say anything different.\n\n105\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.450\nWhatever is in the data source,\ngo ahead and give that to me.\n\n106\n00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.070\nOkay that's great.\n\n107\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.992\nBut like I said, what if we only wanted\nto do our mail merge for marketing?\n\n108\n00:05:06.992 --> 00:05:12.380\nCuz 19,000, we might have\nthousands of records in marketing,\n\n109\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.210\nand I only want those out\nof out of all of this.\n\n110\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.960\nHere you go, filter, right here.\n\n111\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.460\nI'm gonna keep the preview on so\nwe can see the results as we go through.\n\n112\n00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.550\nSo let's go through the filter recipients\nbecause this is where you can start doing\n\n113\n00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.180\nsome really cool stuff with limiting\nwhat you want to do in this merge.\n\n114\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.852\nSo when you talk about\nfiltering in general,\n\n115\n00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:38.088\nI always say it's like pouring\nthe water out of the spaghetti, right?\n\n116\n00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.804\nYou boil the spaghetti and it's like\na strainer, I always think of a strainer\n\n117\n00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:45.490\nwith filtering and I only went\nthis part and not the rest of it.\n\n118\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.870\nSo that's what you are going to do.\n\n119\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.890\nYour end result,\n\n120\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.770\nyou're not deleting anything,\nyou're just taking the stuff out.\n\n121\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.940\nI guess then, my examples of spaghetti\nyou're actually throwing the water\n\n122\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.334\nout but, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft,\n\n123\n00:05:57.334 --> 00:06:01.460\non a lot of their interfaces,\nthe design, it's a little funnel.\n\n124\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.190\nSo I don't know.\n\n125\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.350\nThat's what their thinking is.\n&gt;&gt; Just like that.\n\n126\n00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.140\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n127\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.010\nThat's what they use, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, there's the funnel.\n\n128\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.210\nIn Excel we do this.\n\n129\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.160\nIt's same type of funnel.\n\n130\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.370\nSo this is where you're saying hey,\nwhat do you want out of this?\n\n131\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.060\nSo you're going to have to pick a field\nthat you're going to want to filter by.\n\n132\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.360\nIn this example that I'm working with\nis I only want a specific department.\n\n133\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.471\nNow the comparison, we're going\nto start with just the equal to,\n\n134\n00:06:29.471 --> 00:06:33.268\nI only want to filter out\nthe departments that equal marketing.\n\n135\n00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:37.371\nBut if you drop this down, notice\nthere are some other comparisons here,\n\n136\n00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.290\nnot equal to like everything but\nmarketing.\n\n137\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.888\nIf you had a field that had numbers,\nmaybe you had sales or whatever.\n\n138\n00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:49.368\nSo you want the sales that's\ngreater than 10,000 because that's\n\n139\n00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:55.125\nthe congratulations email that you're\nmaking or something to that effect.\n\n140\n00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:56.825\nIs blank or is not blank?\n\n141\n00:06:56.825 --> 00:07:01.560\nThat's another one especially if you have\na dataset that does have blank records.\n\n142\n00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.390\nThat might be something you can filter by.\n\n143\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.650\nSo you can see some different\ntypes of comparisons.\n\n144\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.420\nAnd then we're going to type in marketing.\n\n145\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.270\nThere we go, that's it, you click OK.\n\n146\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.450\nAnd did it work?\n\n147\n00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.350\nWell since Cheeto Sticks is still the\nfirst record, and Cheeto's also marketing,\n\n148\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.580\nit looks like hm.\n\n149\n00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.570\nBut look if I click on\nthe last record again.\n\n150\n00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.510\nIt doesn't go to Tootsie,\n\n151\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.400\nit goes to Jasmine.\n&gt;&gt; Jasmine.\n\n152\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.100\n&gt;&gt; And look at what it says.\n\n153\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.150\nThis is my last record cuz I clicked on\n\n154\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.800\nthe N.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh?\n\n155\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.460\n&gt;&gt; There's only five because yeah,\n\n156\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.260\nthat looks like one,\ntwo, three, four, five.\n\n157\n00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.320\nYep.\nThere's only five people in marketing.\n\n158\n00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.760\nSo it did its job.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to start using Excel\n\n159\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.278\nSpreadsheets to save stuff now Vonne.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:07:46.278 --> 00:07:47.980\n&gt;&gt; Because I mean you never know in\n\n161\n00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.579\nthe future it could come up like hey,\nI need to do this on the fly and\n\n162\n00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:55.723\nthen you already have that knowledge\nsitting there teed up ready to shine.\n\n163\n00:07:55.723 --> 00:07:56.398\n&gt;&gt; I love Excel,\n\n164\n00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:58.523\nExcel is the greatest thing ever.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n\n165\n00:07:58.523 --> 00:07:59.174\n&gt;&gt; Word is too.\n\n166\n00:07:59.174 --> 00:08:01.092\n&gt;&gt; I cannot say that Well, you know,\n\n167\n00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:04.808\nI guess since I do teach this and\nI've been doing it for a long time.\n\n168\n00:08:04.808 --> 00:08:06.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's because I don't know it.\n\n169\n00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.141\nAnd when I do have an issue,\nI call you over.\n\n170\n00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:13.319\nHey, Vonne, help me with this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] just like when I'm like,\n\n171\n00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.499\nRonnie, the printer's broken.\n\n172\n00:08:14.499 --> 00:08:15.286\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n173\n00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:15.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.990\n&gt;&gt; Hey, what's going on here.\n\n175\n00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.550\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n176\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.440\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Familiarizing yourself will\n\n177\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.550\nrelieve you of a lot of those headaches.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n178\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.630\nSo now I know that I can go ahead and\n\n179\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:28.610\ntake my mail merge and only get one\nparticular department out if I wanted to.\n\n180\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.636\nCool, I like that.\n\n181\n00:08:29.636 --> 00:08:32.898\nLet's get back into that filter,\nbut before we do,\n\n182\n00:08:32.898 --> 00:08:35.210\nI just wanna go through our records.\n\n183\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.912\nI'm just clicking the forward and\nback button, okay so\n\n184\n00:08:37.912 --> 00:08:39.529\nI have five people in marketing.\n\n185\n00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:45.200\nWe've got Cheeto, Bishop,\nPumpkin, Trouble, and Jasmine.\n\n186\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.920\nBut, the cool thing about\nthe filtering is that you\n\n187\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.285\nnotice that there's multiple levels,\nwhich is, this is neat.\n\n188\n00:08:52.285 --> 00:08:55.665\nSo if you had a huge dataset,\nI mean you could really get into this.\n\n189\n00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:57.615\n&gt;&gt; So it looks like we could add some and\n\n190\n00:08:57.615 --> 00:08:58.205\nors on there.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n191\n00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.595\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; From that drop down,\n\n192\n00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:01.505\ndo we have more than and\nor, or is that it?\n\n193\n00:09:01.505 --> 00:09:02.215\n&gt;&gt;

Accurate parameters.\n\n243\n00:11:48.665 --> 00:11:50.540\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, if I had it comparing to,\n\n244\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.420\nyou gotta make sure it's\nin that particular field.\n\n245\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.605\n&gt;&gt; Comparison operators.\n\n246\n00:11:54.605 --> 00:11:55.340\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yes.\n\n247\n00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.150\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why I\n\n248\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.495\njust said that out loud.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:11:57.495 --> 00:11:58.981\n&gt;&gt; But I meant, instead of parameters,\n\n250\n00:11:58.981 --> 00:12:00.329\nit should say, yeah, comparison\n\n251\n00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:02.450\noperators is the technical term, guys.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n252\n00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.780\nI like technical terms.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.222\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, I don't use them.\n\n254\n00:12:05.222 --> 00:12:06.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.190\n&gt;&gt; So just know that that's where,\n\n256\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.640\nif you have something that's\nlike it's not in there,\n\n257\n00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.880\nyou might have picked the wrong field or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n258\n00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.970\nOr it really just doesn't exist.\n\n259\n00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.820\nSo it's nice that it will give\nyou that particular warning.\n\n260\n00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.810\nI'm gonna clear this and so if I click OK,\nnow all of our records are back in there.\n\n261\n00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.120\nBut right now, the sorting, let's move\non to sorting, cuz we've done filtering.\n\n262\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.245\nSorting, it's just going in the order of\nhow it is entered in the data source.\n\n263\n00:12:32.245 --> 00:12:36.640\nBut I want this to be\nin alphabetical order\n\n264\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.060\nbased on last name.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n265\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's back over here,\n\n266\n00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:41.720\nin the filter.\n\n267\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.830\nWe're going over to\nthe Sort Records button.\n\n268\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.800\nSort by, and\nthen notice you have multiple level sorts.\n\n269\n00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.570\nYou could say sort by department,\nthen by last name,\n\n270\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.290\nthen by first name,\ncuz maybe there's 1500 Smith records.\n\n271\n00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:01.090\nThere's usually quite a few of them.\n&gt;&gt; My mind\n\n272\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.570\nusually goes racing for ways this\nwould be applicable in real life.\n\n273\n00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.100\nAnd let me tell you where\nmy brain just went.\n\n274\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.880\nThis is really sad, but I'm kind of evil,\nI think, because I was thinking,\n\n275\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.630\nwhat if you sorted by department,\nand then maybe by hire date, so\n\n276\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.810\nyou could see who has the tenure.\n&gt;&gt; Or yeah,\n\n277\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.830\nis that what it's called?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n278\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.640\n&gt;&gt; To see who's been there the longest, so\n\n279\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.400\nthat, maybe you're downsizing, and you let\ngo of all the people who've recently been\n\n280\n00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.080\nhired.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.080\n&gt;&gt; Why did I think of that, Vaughn?\n\n282\n00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.645\nWhat does that say about me as a person?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n283\n00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.830\n[LAUGH] I'm kinda scared,\n\n284\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.986\nI don't wanna be on that list with you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:38.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway.\n\n286\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.370\n&gt;&gt; But that's exactly right, you know?\n\n287\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:44.100\nOr maybe we'll turn it around, the person\nthat's been there the longest and\n\n288\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.630\nthey get a prize, a bonus.\n\n289\n00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.020\nYes, there you go.\n\n290\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.970\nThey don't get let go.\n\n291\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.870\nThey get a-\n&gt;&gt; A retirement package.\n\n292\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.506\n&gt;&gt; Yes, or maybe an ice cream party.\n\n293\n00:13:51.506 --> 00:13:52.822\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n294\n00:13:52.822 --> 00:13:55.340\n&gt;&gt; Let's turn that frown upside down.\n\n295\n00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.835\n&gt;&gt; I like my example better.\n\n296\n00:13:57.835 --> 00:13:59.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But again great\n\n297\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.260\nreal world examples of why things might\nneed to be filtered and sorted and\n\n298\n00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.940\nhow you need to to see\nhow everything goes.\n\n299\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.170\nSo let's keep going with our sort.\n\n300\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.170\nWe can go with last name,\nwe can do it ascending or descending, and\n\n301\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.810\nthen we could do it at\na second level sort.\n\n302\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.460\nWe click OK, and\nnow you can see, Jack Bowtie,\n\n303\n00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.500\nSasha Cat, Cut Darling, okay,\nyep looks like its in order, cool.\n\n304\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.260\nThe whole time that we've been doing this,\nnone of this has affected the data source.\n\n305\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.830\nSo that's kinda nice.\n\n306\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.896\nIt's like that stays pristine,\nif you wanna say.\n\n307\n00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:34.960\nAnd then anything that we\ndo with our sorting and\n\n308\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.200\nfiltering is all within\nthe merge within Word.\n\n309\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:44.470\nSo that's nice to know about, and that I'm\nnot messing anything up, and good thing.\n\n310\n00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.710\nOne other pointer.\n\n311\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.800\nIf I had, let's say we'll filter by\ndepartment that equals marketing,\n\n312\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.540\nnot capitalizing marketing, so you're\ngonna have a filter and a sort, okay.\n\n313\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.469\nThey are not mutually exclusive, okay.\n\n314\n00:14:58.469 --> 00:15:01.044\nI wanna do multiple level filters and\n\n315\n00:15:01.044 --> 00:15:05.570\nthen I wanna sort by whatever\nfield alphabetically.\n\n316\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.260\nYou can go that way.\n\n317\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.620\nWe click OK and notice that we still\ngo ahead and have our different ones,\n\n318\n00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.200\nactually that didn't really take, I have\nnoticed this, that sometimes it gets\n\n319\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.510\na little tripped up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n320\n00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.650\n&gt;&gt; Where I put a filter on it and\n\n321\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.450\nthen it goes away.\n\n322\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.073\nGremlins, ghosts,\nI don't know what's going on here, but\n\n323\n00:15:22.073 --> 00:15:23.890\nthis has happened to me a couple of times.\n\n324\n00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.400\nI'm like.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n325\n00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.830\nso maybe you could even save that as\na separate file once you get it sorted.\n\n326\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.310\nWould that be a work around?\n&gt;&gt; You could, yeah.\n\n327\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.780\nI mean,\nwhat I've noticed in my little kind of,\n\n328\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.420\nhow's this, sometimes if I take off\nthe preview, because remember that\n\n329\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.580\na lot of times I always tell you that\nif you're gonna be doing editing,\n\n330\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.460\nyou should take the preview off and\nstay with the field.\n\n331\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.442\nSo, I think it just kind of flipped\na switch, kind of tripped itself up,\n\n332\n00:15:48.442 --> 00:15:50.825\nand stopped applying the filter.\n\n333\n00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:55.288\nSo sometimes when I take off the preview,\ngo back to the first record,\n\n334\n00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:59.146\ncome back to the filter,\nsay I want to filter by department,\n\n335\n00:15:59.146 --> 00:16:03.249\nthat is equal to marketing, and\nthen, let's go over our sort.\n\n336\n00:16:03.249 --> 00:16:05.075\nOkay, it's right there, we click OK.\n\n337\n00:16:05.075 --> 00:16:06.659\nLet's now preview it.\n\n338\n00:16:06.659 --> 00:16:07.431\nAnd it looks like, see?\n\n339\n00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:11.660\nNow it clicked itself back in.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n340\n00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.270\n&gt;&gt; That's my\n\n341\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.600\nlittle trick that I've noticed.\n\n342\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.800\nSo, I mean,\nany product has little bugs here and\n\n343\n00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.693\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; Quirks,\n\n344\n00:16:16.693 --> 00:16:19.410\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's my little thing.\n\n345\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.836\nI am keeping the preview on too long.\n\n346\n00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:25.165\nI don't know if it's really that,\nbut that's what I'm gonna tell you.\n\n347\n00:16:25.165 --> 00:16:26.221\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:16:26.221 --> 00:16:29.142\n&gt;&gt; Now, what I was wanting to say is that\n\n349\n00:16:29.142 --> 00:16:32.913\nyou can have both,\nthe filter and the sort, but\n\n350\n00:16:32.913 --> 00:16:37.020\nthe clear all clears just\nwhen you're on filter.\n\n351\n00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.680\nIt's only gonna clear the filter.\n\n352\n00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.050\nSo if I click Clear All,\nyeah, that's great.\n\n353\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.130\nBut my sort is still applied.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n354\n00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.150\n&gt;&gt; So those are two separate things\n\n355\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.860\nin the way that the clear works.\n\n356\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.130\nIt's not clearing both sort and filter.\n\n357\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.600\nThat's tripped me up a couple times.\n\n358\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.920\nI'm like, wait, I thought,\nI forgot to clear out the sort, or\n\n359\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.730\nI forgot to clear out the filter.\n\n360\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.120\nAnd I just kind of assumed that it was\nboth, and so that's where we go back to.\n\n361\n00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.380\nSee, now we've got everything.\n\n362\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.740\nAnd also notice that you\ntook off all the filters,\n\n363\n00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.240\nyou took off all the sorts, it should\ngo back to the way the data source was.\n\n364\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.980\nRemember, Jack Bowtie\nwas not the first entry.\n\n365\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:20.200\nIt's still remembering the last\nthing that you did within Word.\n\n366\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.980\nThe last thing was go ahead and\nsort by first name,\n\n367\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.650\nno last name, right, so that's why\nJack Bowtie is still number one.\n\n368\n00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:33.950\nSo if you needed to default back to\nits default hey, from the data source,\n\n369\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.890\nI would close the file.\n&gt;&gt; Don't\n\n370\n00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.470\nsave it.\n\n371\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n372\n00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.339\n&gt;&gt; And then kind of refresh that data\n\n373\n00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:41.841\nconnection,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n374\n00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:43.910\n&gt;&gt; From where it started.\n\n375\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.830\nAnd so, little tricks and tips,\njust to know cuz hey, I've done it too.\n\n376\n00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.340\nSo why did I do that?\n\n377\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.830\nBut it worked as well.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n378\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:56.490\nand you mentioned earlier, you said it\nbeing pristine, that original data source.\n\n379\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.530\nAnd if you guys at all\nhave seen any shows,\n\n380\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.890\nespecially CompTIA,\nyou'll hear the CIA triad.\n\n381\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.050\nAnd it's a security staple,\na methodology, super common, I mean,\n\n382\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.860\neveryone in security knows about it.\n\n383\n00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.870\nAnd the I actually stands for\nintegrity, so,\n\n384\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:19.560\nmaintaining integrity is essential,\nit's integral to security compliance.\n\n385\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.600\nSo if you had these datasets and\nsources, this is a great way for\n\n386\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.330\nyou to manipulate and\nplay with that data without actually\n\n387\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.320\naffecting the original file.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we talk about that a little bit\n\n388\n00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:34.300\nin access, in the sense of like, same\nidea, same concept, in the sense of like,\n\n389\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:39.710\nyou try not to ever edit\ndirectly into your tables.\n\n390\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.780\nYou wanna kinda keep that there,\nand you have other ways of\n\n391\n00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.550\ninteracting with the data so\nyou're not touching this in a sense.\n\n392\n00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:51.950\nYou're using the queries and some other\nstuff and reports to pull that from.\n\n393\n00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.970\nSo maybe not exactly the same, but\n\n394\n00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:59.830\nthe whole keep that somewhere separate\nintegrity of it, that's a very good point.\n\n395\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.950\nMore real world examples [LAUGH].\n\n396\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.510\nAll right, so let's just go ahead and\ngo over the find, right?\n\n397\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.602\nBecause our trifecta,\nbecause you were just talking about-\n\n398\n00:19:07.602 --> 00:19:08.405\n&gt;&gt; A trifecta too.\n\n399\n00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:09.749\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was, so\n\n400\n00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:12.530\nwe talked about finding.\n\n401\n00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.890\nWell, what do you do with a find?\n\n402\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.910\nYou find a record.\n\n403\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:16.780\nAll right, so\n\n404\n00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.600\nI'm going to turn on the preview still,\nto find recipient means exactly that.\n\n405\n00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.300\nI need to find,\nlet's go with Mocha, right?\n\n406\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.520\nI know that there's a cat named\nMocha in the first field,\n\n407\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.650\nyou click find first, then there it is.\n\n408\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.208\nAnd the nice thing is by next, well, okay,\n\n409\n00:19:37.208 --> 00:19:40.710\nnow I need to say this is the same thing.\n&gt;&gt; There's only one mocha.\n\n410\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.580\n&gt;&gt; There is only one mocha.\n\n411\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.970\nBut it's saying hey wait a second,\nwherever I was at in the record set,\n\n412\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.540\nI'm going to start back from the beginning\nand see if I can find any others.\n\n413\n00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.950\n&gt;&gt; Nice, I was actually wondering that.\n\n414\n00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.970\nBecause if you do a Ctrl + F to do a find\nand it just goes in the order where your\n\n415\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.440\ncursor is to the end of the document?\n\n416\n00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.110\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n417\n00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the same thing with\n\n418\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.705\nspell checks.\n\n419\n00:20:00.705 --> 00:20:04.690\nWherever your cursor was, or in this\ncase in whatever record it was at or\n\n420\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.600\nit found it, that's what's gonna happen.\n\n421\n00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.940\nSo if I click Yes, and\nthen it's gonna be like okay, find next?\n\n422\n00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.490\nNo, the other thing is,\n\n423\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.950\nthere's no warning that says well,\nI don't have any more results.\n\n424\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.740\nIt's just now you're gonna be in this\nloop that's like well, I went to the end,\n\n425\n00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.610\nyou want me to go back to the beginning,\nyes.\n\n426\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.370\nFind next, well I got to the end,\nyou want me to go back to the beginning?\n\n427\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:29.500\nAll right, so just know that if there's\nno more, if you get that warning twice,\n\n428\n00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.140\nthen you're done.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n429\n00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:31.660\n&gt;&gt; The other thing is,\n\n430\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.740\nwhat if I want to say mocha\nin the department, right?\n\n431\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.663\nNow that's going to say, hey,\nnotice I know that it's not there, right?\n\n432\n00:20:39.663 --> 00:20:43.870\nWait, okay now that one\nis actually not found.\n\n433\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.810\nSo this is a different one because yes,\nthere is Mocha,\n\n434\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.410\nbut it's not in department.\n&gt;&gt; So it's just like a different error\n\n435\n00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.900\nbeing familiar with what kind\nof errors getting returned.\n\n436\n00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.008\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz its like,\n\n437\n00:20:53.008 --> 00:20:55.910\nokay well I've finished but\nI don't see anything now.\n\n438\n00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.390\nThe other one was like I found it,\nI'm going to keep going.\n\n439\n00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.750\nI found it I'm going to keep going.\n\n440\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.750\nThe other one was like, no.\n\n441\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.930\nThere's nothing there, so you click OK and\nnotice that it's in the wrong place.\n\n442\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.060\nLittle other things about the find.\n\n443\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.040\nIf I type in department and\nI just typed in m, right?\n\n444\n00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.780\nAnd click find first, there's marketing.\n\n445\n00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.490\nFind next, human resources?\n\n446\n00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.360\nM does exist in human resources,\ndoesn't it?\n\n447\n00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.180\nSo it's not going to say, I'm gonna\nonly look for it beginning with m,\n\n448\n00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.510\nit's like, does it contain the letter m?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n449\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.160\nI'm also just when you showed\nus that I was thinking,\n\n450\n00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.340\nI wonder if things like quotes to make\nit exact and things like asterisks for\n\n451\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.450\nwild cards, I wonder if those work here.\n&gt;&gt; You know, you just,\n\n452\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.926\nI don't know either.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n453\n00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:52.455\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n454\n00:21:52.455 --> 00:21:54.676\nOkay, well, you know what?\n\n455\n00:21:54.676 --> 00:21:59.668\nI'm going to assume, because this is\nhonestly the first time I've tried,\n\n456\n00:21:59.668 --> 00:22:01.628\nbecause, yeah, of course.\n\n457\n00:22:01.628 --> 00:22:03.314\nThe quotes, what does that mean?\n\n458\n00:22:03.314 --> 00:22:04.969\nIt is a string of text.\n&gt;&gt; It has to be exactly like this.\n\n459\n00:22:04.969 --> 00:22:06.166\n&gt;&gt; In this order.\n\n460\n00:22:06.166 --> 00:22:06.793\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n461\n00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:08.621\n&gt;&gt; This string from beginning to end\n\n462\n00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:09.212\nneeds to.\n\n463\n00:22:09.212 --> 00:22:14.774\nAnd it did work because there\nis no single m in department.\n\n464\n00:22:14.774 --> 00:22:15.498\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n465\n00:22:15.498 --> 00:22:17.908\n&gt;&gt; So that could be kind of interesting.\n\n466\n00:22:17.908 --> 00:22:23.008\nNow if I do ma, it's gonna do the same\nthing, cuz I know there's no ma,\n\n467\n00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:27.598\nbut if you're saying there was,\nlike I only need this that might\n\n468\n00:22:27.598 --> 00:22:30.375\nbe something to consider.\n&gt;&gt; Let's do,\n\n469\n00:22:30.375 --> 00:22:34.988\nalso here, let's do an m*\n&gt;&gt; And see what happens.\n\n470\n00:22:34.988 --> 00:22:37.191\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's do m and then *.\n\n471\n00:22:37.191 --> 00:22:38.994\n* is a wild card.\n\n472\n00:22:38.994 --> 00:22:44.351\nIt starts with M and then anything after\nit, so if I click find next, okay,\n\n473\n00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:50.389\nlet's go ahead and no, it didn't look like\nit liked that one, so it didn't say it,\n\n474\n00:22:50.389 --> 00:22:54.450\nso maybe that didn't exactly work.\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of limitations.\n\n475\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.623\n&gt;&gt; The quotes maybe.\n\n476\n00:22:56.623 --> 00:22:57.695\n&gt;&gt; Play around.\n\n477\n00:22:57.695 --> 00:22:59.580\n&gt;&gt; Try it, exactly, I like that.\n\n478\n00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.890\nBut if we didn't have any quotes or\nasterisks,\n\n479\n00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.300\nit would take any position of that.\n\n480\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.660\nBecause if I did M-A and then said find\nnext, you are thinking, okay that's great.\n\n481\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.538\nThere is Human Resources, because human.\n&gt;&gt;

That's right.\n\n508\n00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.220\nThat's right.\n\n509\n00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.330\nThere we go, okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Gremlins.\n\n510\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.105\nFinish and merge.\nLet's cross our fingers.\n\n511\n00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:53.710\n[LAUGH] If I edit the individual\ndocuments, there should, there we go.\n\n512\n00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.870\nI'm watching this down here,\nthe number of pages.\n\n513\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.208\nAnd when I saw, cuz that's the thing,\nit went to 15, so\n\n514\n00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:02.540\nI'm like wait, you didn't work.\n\n515\n00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.060\nOkay, but\nthis does finally prove my point [LAUGH].\n\n516\n00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.570\n&gt;&gt; Is that I'm half blind, but\n\n517\n00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.710\nit's showing eight records there.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is [LAUGH].\n\n518\n00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just checking.\n\n519\n00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.140\n&gt;&gt; It is very tiny.\n\n520\n00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:19.830\nSo yes, there are now eight records in\nmy finished merged document because of,\n\n521\n00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.930\nI'm not gonna save this,\nmy parameters that I've put in my filter.\n\n522\n00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.790\nSo that will work, and even though,\ncuz it says all, right?\n\n523\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:33.440\nNot all 19,\nall based on what I have filtered out of.\n\n524\n00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.220\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n525\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.079\nAnd then, if you needed to,\n\n526\n00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:40.802\nyou could always say that\nwhole Find Recipient, right?\n\n527\n00:25:40.802 --> 00:25:44.380\nI needed to find Mocha because\nthat's the only one I need.\n\n528\n00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.790\nSo that could be where you\ncould do Current Record.\n\n529\n00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:52.309\nAnd when you do Current Record and\nclick Merge, that should, yeah [LAUGH],\n\n530\n00:25:52.309 --> 00:25:54.700\nI'm like, okay, please work [LAUGH].\n\n531\n00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.740\nYeah, it only gave me one page.\n\n532\n00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.460\nIt's just Bishop Timothy, okay?\n\n533\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.190\nSo that would be why you might need\njust that one for an off-job or\n\n534\n00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.550\nsomething to that effect.\n\n535\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:09.120\nSo the Merge does make a difference\nas to what is current,\n\n536\n00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.770\nwhat the range of all is right\nnow based on the filter.\n\n537\n00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:18.680\nAnd then, if I did have a custom range,\nmaybe I only needed, right here,\n\n538\n00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.950\nneeded records one through three, okay?\n\n539\n00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.770\nIn this particular merged result.\n\n540\n00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:31.910\nIf I say one through three and\nthen click Finish and Merge,\n\n541\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:37.250\nI should have, yeah, one, two,\nI went a little too fast, three.\n\n542\n00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.945\nSo there's three.\n\n543\n00:26:37.945 --> 00:26:42.250\nSo you can see how\ncombining your filters and\n\n544\n00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:48.820\nthen the end result of what you're\nfinalizing into your merged documents.\n\n545\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.990\nAnd then what the find can do for here in\nthe current record or a custom record.\n\n546\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.061\nAll sorts of ways that we can limit and\n\n547\n00:26:58.061 --> 00:27:02.430\nget specifically what we\nwant out of our data merge.\n\n548\n00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:07.587\nNot data source, cuz that data\nsource stays nice and pristine and\n\n549\n00:27:07.587 --> 00:27:12.390\nwe're not messing with that\nparticular beginning result.\n\n550\n00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.095\nAnd there we go.\n\n551\n00:27:13.095 --> 00:27:16.590\nSo Sort, Filter, Find, yay [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, [SOUND] relationship with them.\n\n43\n00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:31.300\n[LAUGH] So\nkind of like rules in general, right?\n\n44\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.230\nSo kind of all comes full circle.\n\n45\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.610\nSo let's start by reviewing some\nof them in the help files, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.510\nLet me jumo down into here,\nand we will pull this up.\n\n47\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.730\nThe URL is in the episode notes, so\nwhen we think of rules in general,\n\n48\n00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.770\nor whatever, yes these are the things\nthat you must adhere to.\n\n49\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.660\nThe law of the land,\nto the letter go with it.\n\n50\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.793\nBut when you think about rules\nin the world of Microsoft and\n\n51\n00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:04.348\nthe Office products,\nI always think of Outlook.\n\n52\n00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:08.676\nWhere I can create rules of, if you go\nahead and get an email from Cherokee,\n\n53\n00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:12.195\nput it into Cherokee's folder,\nand ow you wanna organize.\n\n54\n00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:15.015\nAnd setting rules in Outlook\ncan make it really great for\n\n55\n00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:17.320\nyou to get more organized, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n56\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.051\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so think of it that way, and\n\n57\n00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.198\nit's the same thing as\nwe're setting up conditions\n\n58\n00:03:24.198 --> 00:03:26.850\nas to what needs to be adhered to.\n\n59\n00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.240\nNow with the-\n&gt;&gt; Like if then?\n\n60\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.898\nYes, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n61\n00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:32.041\n&gt;&gt; And that's the good one, okay.\n\n62\n00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:34.030\n[LAUGH] So, what you got here,\n\n63\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.940\nyou do have to start off with\nyou need to perform the merge.\n\n64\n00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.760\nYou have to have at least one mail\nmerge field in a document for\n\n65\n00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.206\nthese rules to show up.\n\n66\n00:03:44.206 --> 00:03:46.940\nAnd I'll tell you that in a minute, but\nI'm just kinda throwing that out there\n\n67\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.220\nnow, because I just saw it in\nmy notes when I looked down.\n\n68\n00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.710\nI was like make sure you mention that,\nI'm like, I'm not there yet.\n\n69\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.670\nWe'll get there, so using our rules\nyou can see right here that this,\n\n70\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.270\nthe drop-down,\nthat is here's what we've got.\n\n71\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.220\nLet me come over here,\nokay, actually I am there.\n\n72\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.190\nSee, this is why I should watch my notes\nis cuz I did this on purpose, hey,\n\n73\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.830\nshow them where they're at.\n\n74\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.833\nSo right here in this drop\ndown I've got all of these.\n\n75\n00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:17.165\nIf these are grayed out it's because\nyou haven't inserted a field, and so\n\n76\n00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:22.007\nthat means you'd have to have a recipient\nlist selected and everything like that.\n\n77\n00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:25.409\nSo yes you have to get to this point\nfirst, and this is the rules start file,\n\n78\n00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.800\nyou have access to this as well.\n\n79\n00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.080\nLet's switch back over here to Safari.\n\n80\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.820\nAnd there we go, all right,\n\n81\n00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.810\nwe'll talk about what this\ncodes means a little bit later.\n\n82\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.250\nSo we have an ask rule,\nif it's asking a question.\n\n83\n00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.300\nThe example they give you doesn't\nreally work in real life, so\n\n84\n00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.630\ndon't pay attention to that.\n\n85\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.419\nThe fill in, I know what they're trying,\nI was like, [SOUND] yeah, but\n\n86\n00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.820\nthat's not how it works.\n\n87\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.995\nFill-in is where you're asking a question,\nand\n\n88\n00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.040\nthen you're actually providing a prompt.\n\n89\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.710\nAgain, we'll go more in-depth\nin this to another episode.\n\n90\n00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.220\nThis is the one I like the best,\nif, then, else, all right, so\n\n91\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.680\nthis is where you can put a condition on\nhow your text is going to change variably.\n\n92\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.930\nBut after the data source,\ncuz the whole variable,\n\n93\n00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.110\nokay, change the first name,\nchange the last name based on my records.\n\n94\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.646\nYou don't have to put this type\nof stuff in the data source,\n\n95\n00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:23.559\nit's in the composing of the message,\npretty neat, all right.\n\n96\n00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:27.697\nSo if you're going to be in town,\ngo ahead and,\n\n97\n00:05:27.697 --> 00:05:33.910\nif the record is equal to the city\nof Gainsville, write this sentence.\n\n98\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.465\nIf it's not equal to Gainsville then\nwrite something completely different.\n\n99\n00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:40.210\nAll sorts of neat things\nthat you can do with that.\n\n100\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.020\nAll right the merge record,\nthe merge sequence,\n\n101\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.360\nthe next record if, and\nthe skip record if,\n\n102\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.260\nthose are the ones that we're\ngonna concentrate on this episode.\n\n103\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.470\nTo give you the examples of why and\nhow this works.\n\n104\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.576\nThe bookmark is part of the ask,\n\n105\n00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:04.800\nwhich just gets really more\nsteps than are needed.\n\n106\n00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.631\nBookmarks are something\nthat you can put more,\n\n107\n00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:08.820\nwe talk about that inthe\nWord expert series.\n\n108\n00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.650\nIt does kinda correlate that in a sense,\nbut it goes into another level with fields\n\n109\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.582\nand codes, and you'll see it and then go-\n&gt;&gt; Not for me, or\n\n110\n00:06:19.582 --> 00:06:21.886\nmaybe like in the future.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n111\n00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:25.723\nmaybe never,\n[LAUGH] let's jut be honest, okay.\n\n112\n00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:29.235\nYeah, just because the program can\ndo it doesn't mean we always should.\n\n113\n00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:32.592\nAnd then next records, the next record is\nsomething we've been seeing in our labels\n\n114\n00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:35.430\nright, when we did the labels and it just-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n115\n00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.590\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those, a lot of this,\n\n116\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.370\nit's ingrained, so\n\n117\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.600\nthis one doesn't really need to be-\n&gt;&gt; Explained.\n\n118\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.100\n&gt;&gt; Part of it, yeah.\n\n119\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.110\nThis is where if you\nget into code writing,\n\n120\n00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.840\nwhich we'll see some of the codes,\nyeah, maybe, but that's automatic.\n\n121\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.410\nSo let's just kind of put that out\nof even trying to demonstrate it.\n\n122\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.203\nSo anyways, check this out.\n\n123\n00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:04.614\nNotice that in each one it says more\ninformation about the merge rec field,\n\n124\n00:07:04.614 --> 00:07:08.401\nmerge seek field, all of these are fields.\n\n125\n00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:12.194\nFields are, you're like we haven't\ntalked about fields this whole time,\n\n126\n00:07:12.194 --> 00:07:15.038\ncuz we're talking about data base or\ndata source field,\n\n127\n00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:17.530\nthis is a different type of field, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:24.290\nThis is something that works in Word to,\nwell, it's almost like a form, right?\n\n129\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.300\nAnd if you put fields in, there's certain\n\n130\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.690\nways that you can write code that can\nbe used to be put into those fields.\n\n131\n00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.360\nAnd it's used with programming and\nreferencing.\n\n132\n00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.710\nThis particular place, go ahead and\n\n133\n00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.371\nput this stuff in.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where a lot of\n\n134\n00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:44.189\nattackers take advantage of those fields\nand do different types of overflow\n\n135\n00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:48.074\nattacks and things like that so.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah because it starts to get into\n\n136\n00:07:48.074 --> 00:07:52.119\nthe whole macros and programming, and\nwhat it's doing in the background.\n\n137\n00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:55.695\nSo there's a little bit of\nsecurity going on in here and\n\n138\n00:07:55.695 --> 00:08:00.904\nagain we're We're trying to stay a little\nsafe in the sense of we're in Word and\n\n139\n00:08:00.904 --> 00:08:05.370\nwe're not going too far out of\nthe realm but they all come into play.\n\n140\n00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.530\nWhen we talk about document properties\nin the advanced, no, the expert series.\n\n141\n00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.630\nThis it's like this is the field,\n\n142\n00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.020\nletters it has a field that is pulling\nout information for the document and\n\n143\n00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.720\ninformation of where I can go into.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n144\n00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.380\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we've got.\n\n145\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah developers that\n\n146\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.290\ngo they do input validation to make sure\nthat they've done that correctly so,\n\n147\n00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.480\nyou don't know how to run input\nvalidation tests then maybe we shouldn't\n\n148\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.990\ncreate these rules.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n149\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.540\n&gt;&gt; Make sure we're safe, maybe?\n\n150\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.070\n&gt;&gt; Exaclty, yeah don't get too scared,\n\n151\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.190\nyou're like gosh I should\nhave never used this.\n\n152\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.190\nI mean we work in a tech industry,\nso I mean.\n\n153\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.970\n&gt;&gt; I know I think I am more paranoid\n\n154\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.090\nprobably they know most of the people.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n155\n00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.980\n&gt;&gt; And I have heard that before.\n\n156\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.767\nPeople have actually told me about it.\n\n157\n00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:47.279\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:47.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n159\n00:08:47.787 --> 00:08:49.857\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everytime I host with someone\n\n160\n00:08:49.857 --> 00:08:52.300\nthat's a techy person like you are,\nis like gosh.\n\n161\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.375\nThere is vulnerability.\n\n162\n00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:59.150\nAnd yes, they are possible but\nyou're not gonna get too crazy from here,\n\n163\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.450\nlet's just go ahead.\n&gt;&gt;

Justify the process.\n\n463\n00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.972\n&gt;&gt; And they don't use Word to do it.\n\n464\n00:23:16.972 --> 00:23:19.529\n&gt;&gt; Right, usually at that higher level,\n\n465\n00:23:19.529 --> 00:23:24.040\nyou might have a system build.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the whole, okay, well,\n\n466\n00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.740\nwhat is this sequence, how is this order,\nand what is this record based on\n\n467\n00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.700\nthe merge, I feel like I'm just gonna pull\nat strings, try to give you an example.\n\n468\n00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:38.360\nBut I wanted to show you how it works.\n&gt;&gt; For sure because here's the thing.\n\n469\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.080\nIt's like if someone says,\ncan you do this?\n\n470\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.899\nAnd I get this sometimes,\ncan you do this with that?\n\n471\n00:23:41.899 --> 00:23:48.320\nAnd I'm like, I will never tell you no\nbecause you may invent a way to do it.\n\n472\n00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.807\nAnd by knowing how to do this, you may\nfigure something out that Von and I, or\n\n473\n00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:56.266\neven the developers at Microsoft\nweren't able to see so.\n\n474\n00:23:56.266 --> 00:23:58.753\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you make the decision of,\n\n475\n00:23:58.753 --> 00:24:03.820\nis this going to work for me, I'm sure\nit does work, it definitely works.\n\n476\n00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.540\nBut you have to be careful, like I said.\n\n477\n00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.520\nLet's get back into this, just to remind\nyou is that some of the things do\n\n478\n00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.670\nnot show up in the preview you\nhave to complete the Merge.\n\n479\n00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.340\nAnd that was the thing that I couldn't,\nlike maybe I was just skimming over\n\n480\n00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.904\nthe directions and I had been like\nthat but I'm like this is not working.\n\n481\n00:24:19.904 --> 00:24:23.500\nI'm Googling, like sequence number\ndoesn't work, all this stuff, and\n\n482\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.910\nit's like wait you have\nto complete the merge.\n\n483\n00:24:27.754 --> 00:24:30.795\nOkay, like they didn't make\nthat very clear either.\n\n484\n00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:37.430\nAll right this does work,\nyou gotta know how to make sure it does.\n\n485\n00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:42.259\nNow the skip record if, okay,\nthere's also that whole why do they\n\n486\n00:24:42.259 --> 00:24:44.427\nhave to word it this way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n487\n00:24:44.427 --> 00:24:48.460\n&gt;&gt; There is another one of next record if\n\n488\n00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:54.834\nmove onto the next record if\nit equals to a specific thing,\n\n489\n00:24:54.834 --> 00:25:00.051\ngo to the next record if\nit equals advertising.\n\n490\n00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:01.940\nAdvertising, is that how you spell that?\n\n491\n00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.927\nYeah, okay, perfect.\n\n492\n00:25:03.927 --> 00:25:07.040\nSo again, the preview's not gonna work,\nwe know that, okay.\n\n493\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.720\nCuz that's the developer,\nbut if I finish and merge,\n\n494\n00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.125\nif I edit my individual documents.\n\n495\n00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:18.195\nOkay, well wait, see go to the next\n\n496\n00:25:18.195 --> 00:25:22.590\nrecord if it's advertising.\n\n497\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.364\nSo guess what,\nthere is no advertisement here as well.\n\n498\n00:25:26.364 --> 00:25:32.170\nYes, if it's advertising go to\nthe next one, this we skip it.\n\n499\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.919\n[LAUGH] See again, just filter it.\n\n500\n00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:37.319\nOkay, just go ahead and\n\n501\n00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:40.504\ndo your filters and be fine with it.\n&gt;&gt; All\n\n502\n00:25:40.504 --> 00:25:43.328\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n503\n00:25:43.328 --> 00:25:46.602\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So lesson learns we do wanna be rebels\n\n504\n00:25:46.602 --> 00:25:50.802\nand not follow the rules,\nthat was our consensus.\n\n505\n00:25:50.802 --> 00:25:52.079\nRemember we said we were gonna talk about\n\n506\n00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:53.251\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n507\n00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:54.585\nthat's why I'm just kinda like.\n\n508\n00:25:54.585 --> 00:25:56.268\n[LAUGH] [SOUND] Yeah,\n\n509\n00:25:56.268 --> 00:26:00.939\nit's kinda one of those weird things.\n&gt;&gt; Do we have anything else\n\n510\n00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:03.573\nwe need to know about rules,\nor, I mean are we done?\n\n511\n00:26:03.573 --> 00:26:06.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're like,\n\n512\n00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.567\ncan we go please stop\ngoing around in loops.\n\n513\n00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.852\nLike I said the, if, then,\nelse, is a good one.\n\n514\n00:26:11.852 --> 00:26:12.448\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n515\n00:26:12.448 --> 00:26:13.440\n&gt;&gt; I do like that one,\n\n516\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.138\nI think that's pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n517\n00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:17.940\nthat's the one we see all over\nthe place too in a lot of development.\n\n518\n00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.835\nAnd other programming and\ncommand line interface options,\n\n519\n00:26:21.835 --> 00:26:25.239\nbecause it has a purpose.\n&gt;&gt; And I can see how this could\n\n520\n00:26:25.239 --> 00:26:29.390\nbe actually applicable to Mail Merge\nwhich can be pretty neat.\n\n521\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.830\nSo that one, we'll see it on its\nown episode so it's like okay,\n\n522\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.532\nthis ones a pretty good one and\nthen we're going.\n\n523\n00:26:35.532 --> 00:26:40.366\nAgain, the sequence numbers, and the merge\nnumbers, and the skip record, and\n\n524\n00:26:40.366 --> 00:26:42.953\nthe next record, they have a purpose.\n&gt;&gt; They\n\n525\n00:26:42.953 --> 00:26:44.641\nhave a specific use case scenario-\n\n526\n00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:45.381\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; Then\n\n527\n00:26:45.381 --> 00:26:45.897\nuse them.\n\n528\n00:26:45.897 --> 00:26:46.858\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n529\n00:26:46.858 --> 00:26:48.254\n&gt;&gt; But for now-\n\n530\n00:26:48.254 --> 00:26:48.929\n&gt;&gt; We'll sign off.\n\n531\n00:26:48.929 --> 00:26:49.798\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we will.\n\n532\n00:26:49.798 --> 00:26:50.313\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n533\n00:26:50.313 --> 00:26:51.105\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a great idea.\n\n534\n00:26:51.105 --> 00:26:53.489\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I've been your host,\n\n535\n00:26:53.489 --> 00:26:55.295\nCherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.750\n&gt;&gt; And how to break them [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.060\n&gt;&gt; I would like to break.\n\n13\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n14\n00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.100\nSo, now and the other-\n&gt;&gt; This one is like the cool rule.\n\n15\n00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.030\nLike if we had to classify all other\nrules, we've talked about that.\n\n16\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd I was about to say,\n\n17\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.380\nthis is our last episode.\n\n18\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.737\nI was kind of like ew.\n\n19\n00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:49.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On some of them.\n\n20\n00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.050\nAnd yeah, the whole merge sequence and the\nmerge record, we showed how it could work.\n\n21\n00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.750\nAnd it was a little convoluted and\nkind of backwards.\n\n22\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.080\nRemember, we talked about the backwards\nlogic in there, and everything like that.\n\n23\n00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.190\n&gt;&gt; Not so easy to understand, or\n\n24\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.130\nas straightforward as you would\nthink a rule should be, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n26\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.290\nThis one is pretty straightforward.\n\n27\n00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.470\n&gt;&gt;

I appreciate your honesty, Von.\n\n34\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was like, I don't like\nthat right now, but you know what?\n\n35\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.430\nI've come around.\n\n36\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.190\nAnd, you'll see that in the next episode,\nso\n\n37\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.165\nlet's concentrate on this particular one.\n\n38\n00:01:46.165 --> 00:01:48.455\n&gt;&gt;

No for loops and\nall of the three different.\n\n53\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.020\n&gt;&gt; For loops,\nthat's kinda I was just like yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.230\nI know with programming that can\nget a little funky there too,\n\n55\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.070\nyeah we're not gonna go that that deep.\n\n56\n00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.680\nAnd honestly, I don't even know if it's\npossible to do nested if statements in\n\n57\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.325\na mail merge, I'm 85% sure you can't, but\nI'm leaving the door open just in case.\n\n58\n00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:45.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; Somebody out there's like,\n\n59\n00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.170\nno, yes you can, and I'm like mm.\n\n60\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.510\nWe're going to save-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n61\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.460\n&gt;&gt; Surface level on this one and\nshow you how it's done.\n\n62\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.010\nNow I have some examples that\nI think we'd start with.\n\n63\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So you can get some ideas.\n\n64\n00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.960\nI have a rules if then example letter\none and an example letter two,\n\n65\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.800\nor I guess letter example,\nsomething like that.\n\n66\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.280\nSo let's open up this first one.\n\n67\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.430\nNow I have all the components that we have\nalready been doing already established.\n\n68\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.620\nI had it connected to this CSV file so\nit just asked me about the encoding.\n\n69\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.260\nAnd then we said yeah,\nwe're good with that.\n\n70\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.560\nAnd then I've already went ahead and\nwritten the letter.\n\n71\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.970\nWe've already got the fields in there.\n\n72\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.110\nSo I'm just gonna scroll just a little\nbit so you guys can see it on the screen.\n\n73\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.820\nLet's come over to our mailing tab.\n\n74\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.250\n&gt;&gt; So this is like pre-merged.\n\n75\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is our merge,\nwhat I refer to as the merge document.\n\n76\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.060\nThis is the one where we've\nput in all our fields.\n\n77\n00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.640\nIt's not the finished version.\n\n78\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n79\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's just the single\npage that we have right now.\n\n80\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.020\nIt's just page one of one.\n\n81\n00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.020\nI've just done all the things that\nwe've done in the other episodes.\n\n82\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To save time.\n\n83\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.790\nSo you could see that we have a first and\na last, we are connected to a file,\n\n84\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.380\nthe department and address filter rules\nCSV file just in case your wondering.\n\n85\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.260\nI didn't really display that cuz we've\nseen it so much out of all these episodes.\n\n86\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.030\nAnd if I preview this, you can see we have\nCheeto Sticks, and he is, this is one of\n\n87\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.330\nthe first ones that we have for our annual\nconference, our Christmas Cats Corral.\n\n88\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.410\nYou know I had fun with that one.\n\n89\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.050\nSo that we're-\n&gt;&gt; I'm just kind of curious,\n\n90\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.550\nhaven't you shot these shows but\nfor PC version with Daniel?\n\n91\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; What does he say about all the cats?\n\n92\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.901\n&gt;&gt; He just kind of passes\nright on over it [LAUGH].\n\n93\n00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:26.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah he doesn't make any comments on\n\n94\n00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.730\nthe cats really.\n\n95\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.315\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was just curious.\n\n96\n00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:31.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\nwe do have some fun with this one.\n\n97\n00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.900\nHe liked this one too, so he was like,\nI can see where this is cool.\n\n98\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.605\nCuz we are expanding the cat play\narea in the Florida Headquarters.\n\n99\n00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:44.022\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he's like mm-hmm that sounds great.\n\n100\n00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:47.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, Frito lives here and\n\n101\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.350\nFuego and\nBishop will be very happy with this.\n\n102\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.510\nAnd then we're gonna\nputting the meeting online.\n\n103\n00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.870\nAnd so, for our employees in Gainesville.\n\n104\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.120\nAnd notice that Cheeto is in Gainesville.\n\n105\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.120\nSo those are, just to show you again,\nthose are our two fields.\n\n106\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n107\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.810\n&gt;&gt; Three fields that I have in here.\n\n108\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.270\nAnd let's just turn the preview back on.\n\n109\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.110\nAnd if I go through the next one,\nokay, Fuego Pants is in Gainesville.\n\n110\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.980\nAnd I go to the next one.\n\n111\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.660\nI have Mocha Cup and\nshe's in Jacksonville.\n\n112\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.330\nBut did you notice something\nhappened from Fuego to Mocha?\n\n113\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Something was removed.\n\n114\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.190\nWhat was that last line of text?\n\n115\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was the Gainesville\nemployees are welcome to attend in person.\n\n116\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.880\nIn the pumpkin squash conference room.\n\n117\n00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.520\nBecause we wanted to go ahead and\nsend it out to everybody, but\n\n118\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.360\nif they're in Gaines,\nwell come on by, stop by.\n\n119\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.530\nBut if you're in Jacksonville,\nor if you're in-\n\n120\n00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.120\n&gt;&gt; It's not really applicable.\n\n121\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo there's that if.\n\n122\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.550\nSo I am matching, hey if this record\n\n123\n00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.090\nin the city equals Gaineseville,\nthen go ahead and put the sentence in.\n\n124\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.730\nIf not, or I guess else we'll say,\n\n125\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.730\nif then else, then just don't\nput anything just keep it blank.\n\n126\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.230\nSo Jacksonville, they can attend the\nmeeting line, but I'm not gonna tell them\n\n127\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.110\nanything about attending in person\ncuz they're not gonna be here.\n\n128\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.390\nAnd so you can see going through,\nBishop, Timothy, Gainesville,\n\n129\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.200\nthere's that sentence, Pumpkin Squash,\n\n130\n00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.949\nStewart, he doesn't get that particular\nsentence, so that's that if statement.\n\n131\n00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.410\n&gt;&gt; Again Von, I'm just thinking of\nall the times this was not in my life\n\n132\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.415\ncould have made it easier.\n\n133\n00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:21.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even when I worked in advertising,\n\n134\n00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.390\ncontacting people for renewals and\njust say hey your ad's about to be up.\n\n135\n00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.930\nAnd only if they met those requirements or\nwhatever.\n\n136\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's equal to\na field in that data source, so\n\n137\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.730\nthat's like okay if the city equals\nGainesville given the sentence.\n\n138\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.910\nSo it could be like if the renewal column\nhas a y in it, than you go ahead and\n\n139\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.900\nput the sentence in.\n\n140\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.040\nSo that's what's so cool about this.\n\n141\n00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.005\nSo it gives it that extra\nlevel of variableness.\n\n142\n00:06:48.005 --> 00:06:50.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that.\n\n143\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.300\n&gt;&gt; To our mail merge that we can go ahead.\n\n144\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.160\nIt's not in our data source so\nthat whole sentence and\n\n145\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.940\neverything isn't in the data source per\nse, but we're connecting it to something.\n\n146\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.590\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n147\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.800\n&gt;&gt; So what I wanted to show you\nin this example is the fields,\n\n148\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.040\nbecause with this preview on, you're just\nseeing the sentence whether it pops up or\n\n149\n00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.440\nnot, I take that very first one.\n\n150\n00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.750\nWhen I take the preview off,\nI can see the merged fields, but\n\n151\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.620\nI'm not seeing the code if you wanna say.\n\n152\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.590\nTo where is that if statement.\n\n153\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:25.570\nSo there's something in word that is show\nfield, reveal field, show field codes.\n\n154\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.610\nI can't remember the exact wording so\nI'm going to show you.\n\n155\n00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.550\nThe keyboard shortcut at\nleast in PC world and\n\n156\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.900\nI believe,\nyeah it is in Mac World too is Alt F9.\n\n157\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.840\nI don't have F9,\nI don't have F keys on this keyboard and\n\n158\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.650\nI don't even have them in\nVirtual Machine so I haven't mapped it.\n\n159\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.039\nBut I do have up here, the very top,\n\n160\n00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:48.663\nup on the Quick Access tool bar,\nI have this View all placeholders and\n\n161\n00:07:48.663 --> 00:07:52.592\nyou see how has like an A with\na little angle brackets on it.\n\n162\n00:07:52.592 --> 00:07:55.700\nWhen I click on that and\nI'll show you how to get that in a minute.\n\n163\n00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.421\nWhen I click on that, there it is.\n\n164\n00:07:57.421 --> 00:07:58.638\nHere's the code.\n\n165\n00:07:58.638 --> 00:08:02.526\nSo it says that if The merge\nfield is Gainesville,\n\n166\n00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:06.770\nthen you see in the quotes,\nwith the sentence.\n\n167\n00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.870\nAnd then when you have something without\nthe quotes then that's just that\n\n168\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.620\nblankness.\n\n169\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.380\nSo you don't really see the then and Else,\n\n170\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.110\nthey're just in quotations,\nif this is true, if it is false.\n\n171\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.110\nAnd so\nthat's where I can see that code field.\n\n172\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.530\nAnd even though we're seeing,\nlike up here, first, last, see,\n\n173\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.360\nnotice they do have some extra code\nin there like the merge field.\n\n174\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.030\nAnd that's part of all of this,\nyou just don't see it unless you have this\n\n175\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.930\nreveal codes, or in this case I forgot,\nin Mac it's called view all placeholders.\n\n176\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So where did I get that button?\n\n177\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.580\nCuz maybe for\nyou you don't have the Alt+F9 either.\n\n178\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.300\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\n\n179\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.530\nAnd I'm looking at your keyboard right not\nVonne, and I've never noticed this before,\n\n180\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.000\nbut you have like an iPad Mini size\ntrackpad Pad, you don't have your keys but\n\n181\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.577\nthat's why.\n\n182\n00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:53.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where all your room is going.\n\n183\n00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n184\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:54.430\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n185\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the narrow Mac books,\nyeah the track pad.\n\n186\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.850\nIt's so funny cuz I kept putting my\nhands on the track pad because it was so\n\n187\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.980\nsmall on the last one, now it's like.\n\n188\n00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.290\nSo I had to train my hands\nto go past the track pad.\n\n189\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.940\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is kinda like a trade-off there.\n\n190\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly it is.\n\n191\n00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.225\nI do love this little machine.\n\n192\n00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:13.560\n[LAUGH] It is pretty cool.\n\n193\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.670\nNow where I found that button for the\ncodes, there is a couple different places.\n\n194\n00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.340\nI put it on the quick access tool bar\nbecause I wanted it to be able to toggle\n\n195\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.640\nit on and off.\n\n196\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.720\nThis is also something\nin your preferences.\n\n197\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.410\nIf you go into Word and go under\npreferences and I have had this happen to\n\n198\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.550\npeople where they are like, I have got\nall this stuff and I can't turn it off.\n\n199\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.520\nIt is almost like code looking stuff,\nI'm like hm,\n\n200\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.660\ngo to your Preferences, go to Advanced,\nand then go ahead and turn this off.\n\n201\n00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.850\nActually I forgot this is in Mac,\nit's in the view, okay, and right there.\n\n202\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:49.080\nField codes instead of values I've had\npeople probably do Alt+F9 by mistake,\n\n203\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.950\nand they turn it on, they turn on\nthis preference, and they're like,\n\n204\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.210\nI don't know how to turn it off.\n\n205\n00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.730\nSo that's where you can\nget it in the preferences.\n\n206\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.490\nI could go in here and turn it on.\n\n207\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.790\nBut then I'd have to go back and\nturn it off, so that's just too much.\n\n208\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.680\nThat's why I add it on\nthe quick access toolbar.\n\n209\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.179\nAnd to do that, at the very end,\nyou can go into the more commands,\n\n210\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.360\nand from here which I could have\ngotten from the preferences too.\n\n211\n00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.940\nI went ahead, I made it easier on\nmyself and I just went to all commands.\n\n212\n00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.910\nBecause I know this as reveal codes or\nshow codes but\n\n213\n00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.780\nI had to kind of go down through here-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n214\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.230\nlike map it to what the title could be.\n\n215\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.465\n&gt;&gt; Hum.\n&gt;&gt; In this format?\n\n216\n00:10:27.465 --> 00:10:31.119\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and that's where I\nkind of was like, where is that?\n\n217\n00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:36.077\nSo I just had to scroll on\nthrough to go ahead and see,\n\n218\n00:10:36.077 --> 00:10:39.275\nwhat is this thing called again?\n\n219\n00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:41.290\n[LAUGH] Come on.\n\n220\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.930\nView all placeholders.\n\n221\n00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:43.880\nI found that.\n\n222\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.630\nI think it's also commands not in ribbon.\n\n223\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.950\nThat might have been\nthe other one I found.\n\n224\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.640\nSo I had to go ahead and look through\nthere and really search for it.\n\n225\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would have never found that.\n\n226\n00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:53.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n227\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.780\nAnd it took me a while.\n\n228\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.050\nBecause you can see that what was in\nthe preferences was different than how\n\n229\n00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.240\nthey're actually saying\nview all placeholders.\n\n230\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.860\nPlaceholders?\n\n231\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.450\nIt makes sense now that I'm like, okay.\n\n232\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.350\nBut yeah so anyways check that out and\nthat way you can go back and\n\n233\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.560\nforth on this.\n\n234\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.960\nSo there you go, there is the code.\n\n235\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.540\nWe didn't really talk about this\nbutton in the last episode because\n\n236\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.540\nwe didn't really need to.\n\n237\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.280\nLike you just saw the field and\nthere we go.\n\n238\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.600\nSo you know that this exists.\n\n239\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.690\nSo this is the first example\njust another quick one.\n\n240\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.210\nSame idea.\n\n241\n00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.860\nBut there's an actual statement,\nit's connected to a data source.\n\n242\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.540\nSo I'm opening up this file.\n\n243\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.780\nWe have our meeting memo, we already\nhave it connected to a data source,\n\n244\n00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.680\nwe have our fields in their\nfirst to last department.\n\n245\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.190\nNotice it says you're department meeting\nis not scheduled for this month.\n\n246\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.460\nIf I preview this and\nI then go through my recipients, okay?\n\n247\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.480\nSales, advertising, well look,\nit seems that if you\n\n248\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.790\nare in the advertising department, then\nyour meeting is going to held this Friday.\n\n249\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.525\nIt's past the 19th right now,\nbut you know, pretend.\n\n250\n00:11:56.525 --> 00:11:59.914\n[LAUGH] And so notice, developer then\nhe's not scheduled for this month.\n\n251\n00:11:59.914 --> 00:12:05.000\nSo that was if you're in advertising,\nso if the department field\n\n252\n00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.520\nequals advertising then, go ahead and\nput this sentence, else, this other one.\n\n253\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Look at the code, there you go,\n\n254\n00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.110\njust like I said,\n\n255\n00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:18.410\nequals advertising, put in this sentence,\nif not, put in that sentence.\n\n256\n00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.930\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n257\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.765\n&gt;&gt; Not too shabby.\n\n258\n00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:20.565\n&gt;&gt; Not too shabby.\n\n259\n00:12:20.565 --> 00:12:22.195\nAnd you can have these all over the place.\n\n260\n00:12:22.195 --> 00:12:26.045\nYou can have it in multiple\nplaces within your document.\n\n261\n00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:28.335\n&gt;&gt; As long as you can keep it\nall straight in your mind.\n\n262\n00:12:28.335 --> 00:12:29.215\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n263\n00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:34.925\n&gt;&gt; And that's where you can have\nmultiple single if statements.\n\n264\n00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:40.795\nIf it's equal to advertisement down here,\n\n265\n00:12:40.795 --> 00:12:43.110\nthere's gonna be another\none about parking.\n\n266\n00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.660\nAnd if it's advertising there's gonna\nbe another one about meeting notes.\n\n267\n00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.450\nSo you can have it still\nconnected to the same field-\n\n268\n00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.380\n&gt;&gt; But not necessarily like,\n\n269\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.040\nif you're in advertising and\n\n270\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.490\nthen if it's going to be in parking lot\nA or B, if it's in parking lot B, then.\n\n271\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.220\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, or like if it's advertising,\nwith this sentence,\n\n272\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.390\nit is marketing with this sentence.\n\n273\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.350\nIt doesn't do that.\n\n274\n00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n275\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.820\n&gt;&gt; You can get pretty creative, but\n\n276\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.650\nthat's where it's like,\nwhere I'm saying a single statement.\n\n277\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.440\nThis is one criteria, this is if\nit's true, this is if it's false.\n\n278\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.010\nDo another one.\n\n279\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.160\nSo you can get as creative\nas you want with this.\n\n280\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.138\nCheck it out and see where you can\nreally spin that wheel around.\n\n281\n00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.630\n[LAUGH] The other thing\nI keep always forgetting\n\n282\n00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.520\nis I'll try to turn the preview off and\nI'm not previewing.\n\n283\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.959\nWhy do I still see everything?\n\n284\n00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:33.950\nYour code.\n\n285\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.380\nJust because you turned the preview off,\nit doesn't mean you've turned the show or\n\n286\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.560\nthe hide of the placeholders.\n\n287\n00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.850\nSo I keep doing that, so\nbe careful about that.\n\n288\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.630\nTurn both of them off if\nyou wanna get to just this.\n\n289\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.820\n&gt;&gt; To view it, okay.\n\n290\n00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect, so\nthat's my other example.\n\n291\n00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.060\nNow, how did you do that?\n\n292\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n293\n00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.360\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty easy.\n\n294\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.400\nI do have to say it's not hard.\n\n295\n00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.150\nLet's go into the start letter,\nthe first one.\n\n296\n00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.630\nAnd I still have the same stuff in here,\neverything is ready to go.\n\n297\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.950\nJust to show you this field\ndoes not exist right now.\n\n298\n00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.030\nYes, the text is in here because\nI was just gonna copy and paste.\n\n299\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.960\nI don't really have to type again [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.420\nSo we've got that.\n\n301\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.530\nSo just remember this is not in here.\n\n302\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:22.320\nWe're going to take this whole\nsentence and we are going to cut this.\n\n303\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.170\nWe are going to do the Command+X and\n\n304\n00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.820\nthen we'll turn the field\nplaceholder thing off.\n\n305\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.910\nWe'll come over here to Mailings and\nthen we're gonna put in our rules, okay?\n\n306\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:42.980\nMy cursor is in the place where I want the\nsentence to show up if the criteria's met.\n\n307\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:48.900\nSo there is the cursor, go with the rules,\nwe go with the If, Then, Else Daniel and\n\n308\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.320\nI were talking about the power of\nthe dot dot dot in our text messages.\n\n309\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.820\n&gt;&gt;

Cool.\n\n339\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.225\n&gt;&gt; And the thing it is, it is so\neasy that if you really did mess up,\n\n340\n00:16:20.225 --> 00:16:22.576\nyou could just delete this and start over.\n\n341\n00:16:22.576 --> 00:16:26.649\nJust remember, you can't see it cuz\nright now, like if I was on a record,\n\n342\n00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:28.577\ncuz yeah, I am not previewing it.\n\n343\n00:16:28.577 --> 00:16:35.992\nBut if I my list started here with\nJack Bowtie it's just gonna be blank.\n\n344\n00:16:35.992 --> 00:16:38.954\nSo you might not even think like,\ndid it work, did it not?\n\n345\n00:16:38.954 --> 00:16:44.780\nIt's just it might have been in the else\nparameter, not the then parameter.\n\n346\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.059\n&gt;&gt; If then.\n\n347\n00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:48.834\n&gt;&gt; Getting myself confused again.\n\n348\n00:16:48.834 --> 00:16:50.346\nSo that's pretty simple.\n\n349\n00:16:50.346 --> 00:16:52.777\nAnd that's really all it is.\n\n350\n00:16:52.777 --> 00:16:59.100\nAnd for the other example, just because\nwe can, we'll start with this one.\n\n351\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.620\nThis is where I have\neverything ready to go,\n\n352\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.877\nyou would just do the exact same thing.\n\n353\n00:17:03.877 --> 00:17:08.580\nI would come into mailings, I would take\nthe rules, I would say the if then else.\n\n354\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:14.598\nThis one we said if the department\nis equal to advertising I believe,\n\n355\n00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:15.963\nAdvertising.\n\n356\n00:17:15.963 --> 00:17:17.566\nI have to do that every time.\n\n357\n00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:18.926\nWe're gonna insert this text.\n\n358\n00:17:18.926 --> 00:17:20.733\nYep, the advertising\nmeeting we held on Friday.\n\n359\n00:17:20.733 --> 00:17:22.832\nI know it's really small to see.\n\n360\n00:17:22.832 --> 00:17:27.767\nOtherwise, we'll say\nno meeting this month.\n\n361\n00:17:27.767 --> 00:17:31.808\nAnd so you think about this is like,\nhey, I have the same data source.\n\n362\n00:17:31.808 --> 00:17:34.755\nSo I have the same first and\nlast name and department.\n\n363\n00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:38.300\nAnd this is maybe an email\nmerge that I do every month.\n\n364\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.351\nAnd so, that way, I'm telling everybody\nin each department whether they have\n\n365\n00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:43.806\na meeting this month or not.\n\n366\n00:17:43.806 --> 00:17:45.614\nJust as kinda of a reminder.\n\n367\n00:17:45.614 --> 00:17:49.220\nCuz maybe it's kinda on\na revolving schedule.\n\n368\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.034\nMaybe marketing will meet twice\nbecause they have a big project, but\n\n369\n00:17:53.034 --> 00:17:57.587\nadvertising doesn't need to be, they might\nhave a meeting four months from now.\n\n370\n00:17:57.587 --> 00:17:59.315\nSo maybe it's not on a set schedule and\n\n371\n00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:01.644\nyou're just kinda throwing\nsomething out there.\n\n372\n00:18:01.644 --> 00:18:07.075\nSo it's kinda like where this becomes\nthe variable part and the fields and\n\n373\n00:18:07.075 --> 00:18:11.554\nthe data source,\nthat becomes almost like the static part.\n\n374\n00:18:11.554 --> 00:18:14.610\nSo, it's just-\n&gt;&gt; Well like you said, just run with it,\n\n375\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:15.377\nroll with it.\n\n376\n00:18:15.377 --> 00:18:20.137\nBecause you can really configure and think\nof it in so many ways that we probably,\n\n377\n00:18:20.137 --> 00:18:21.822\ncouldn't even think of it.\n\n378\n00:18:21.822 --> 00:18:24.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I've seen some\ntutorials where they just put\n\n379\n00:18:24.913 --> 00:18:28.157\nit in multiple sentences,\nthroughout the whole letter.\n\n380\n00:18:28.157 --> 00:18:31.073\nAnd when it reads, it's like yeah, okay.\n\n381\n00:18:31.073 --> 00:18:34.608\nWell if your in this city and\nyou selected this\n\n382\n00:18:34.608 --> 00:18:39.456\nchoice in a survey that we're\ngetting the information back.\n\n383\n00:18:39.456 --> 00:18:41.331\nSo you can really-\n&gt;&gt; Tailor it.\n\n384\n00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:42.949\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty neat, and\n\n385\n00:18:42.949 --> 00:18:46.881\nthat's something that maybe is not\nnecessarily part of your data source.\n\n386\n00:18:46.881 --> 00:18:50.209\nCuz, like the service is perfect but\nI had people go ahead and\n\n387\n00:18:50.209 --> 00:18:54.320\ngive me this information but then all\nthe other pieces I need do through this\n\n388\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.009\nif then else statement\nwhich can be pretty neat.\n\n389\n00:18:57.009 --> 00:18:59.646\n&gt;&gt; And this is just one of the rules\nthat we've talked about and\n\n390\n00:18:59.646 --> 00:19:01.615\nI think we still have\none more to talk about.\n\n391\n00:19:01.615 --> 00:19:04.116\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; So it's just a, yeah.\n\n392\n00:19:04.116 --> 00:19:08.272\n&gt;&gt; I think this is the most applicable\nto that it covers the most bases and\n\n393\n00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.792\nit's the most general if you want to say.\n\n394\n00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:12.665\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I think this can be like,\n\n395\n00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:15.712\nI can find many, many differnt\nreasons of why I wanna do this.\n\n396\n00:19:15.712 --> 00:19:18.570\n&gt;&gt; I could probably work it\ninto this style format if I\n\n397\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.304\nwanted to actually execute or\nhave some setup.\n\n398\n00:19:21.304 --> 00:19:27.583\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the merge sequence and the record\nnumber, we were kind of like okay.\n\n399\n00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:28.886\nAt least we know it can be done.\n\n400\n00:19:28.886 --> 00:19:33.670\n[LAUGH] So that's just the next one.\n\n401\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.401\nI've come around to it, like I've said.\n\n402\n00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:40.299\nBut it was a struggle.\n\n403\n00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:42.749\nThis one's straightforward\nthe next one's not.\n\n404\n00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:45.867\nAnd hopefully I will help you along, and\n\n405\n00:19:45.867 --> 00:19:50.093\nmaybe you won't think it's bad,\neither, so [LAUGH].\n\n406\n00:19:50.093 --> 00:19:52.906\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, so do you have any\nfinal thoughts before we head out on this\n\n407\n00:19:52.906 --> 00:19:54.566\none, or just-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n408\n00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:56.502\n&gt;&gt; Get ready for the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just get ready for the next one.\n\n409\n00:19:56.502 --> 00:19:59.008\nLike you said, just be creative,\nsee what you can do.\n\n410\n00:19:59.008 --> 00:20:01.580\nTest it out, and the field codes,\nthat's the biggest one.\n\n411\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.380\nThat button will make a big difference in\nyour life because you can't really see it\n\n412\n00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:05.994\nwithout it.\n\n413\n00:20:05.994 --> 00:20:09.416\nAnd just remember to turn it off when you\nwant to like not see the code any more.\n\n414\n00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:10.829\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n415\n00:20:10.829 --> 00:20:11.897\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not the preview button.\n\n416\n00:20:11.897 --> 00:20:13.105\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n417\n00:20:13.105 --> 00:20:14.168\nThank you so much, Vonne.\n\n418\n00:20:14.168 --> 00:20:17.043\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut we are gonna sign out.\n\n419\n00:20:17.043 --> 00:20:18.674\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n420\n00:20:18.674 --> 00:20:19.565\n&gt;&gt;

Okay.\n\n21\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.540\n&gt;&gt; And then, once, and everything that\nI was reading wasn't really giving it\n\n22\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.400\nto me straight, or at least straight in my\nhead, and the way my brain was thinking.\n\n23\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.220\nAnd it took me a while to kind of say so\nthis is how this works.\n\n24\n00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.170\nOkay so\nnow that I understand how it works,\n\n25\n00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.340\nI could see the potential and\nthe possibility of using it.\n\n26\n00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.810\nBut it took me a lot of trials and\ntribulations,\n\n27\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.990\nif you wanna say, a lot of me saying,\nwell, what about this way?\n\n28\n00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.010\nWell that didn't work.\n\n29\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.010\nWhy didn't that work?\n\n30\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.140\nGo and try finding the answer.\n\n31\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.000\nHm, I can't seem to find the answer\non this, okay, so let me try again.\n\n32\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.965\nNow I got it.\n\n33\n00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:47.597\n&gt;&gt;

Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go back to that help file\n\n53\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.610\nthat we started with on the rules.\n\n54\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.180\nAnd I think when I got to this one\nI was just like, gosh this one.\n\n55\n00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.900\nSo why don't we jump down in here and\n\n56\n00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.760\nlook at the same URL that we\nhave from that other episode.\n\n57\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.070\nWhere it's just describing\nsetting rules for mail merge, and\n\n58\n00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.070\nthat there's some neat things to do.\n\n59\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.500\nWe have this drop down, and\nthere is our alt nine for our codes.\n\n60\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWe just saw that.\n\n61\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.560\n&gt;&gt; That we talked about\nin our last episode.\n\n62\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.130\nSo ask, and fill in.\n\n63\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.970\nThey are almost the same.\n\n64\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.020\nThey're the same but different.\n\n65\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.100\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say, so\nI thought this was all in one, but\n\n66\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.380\nthese are two separate rules.\n\n67\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n68\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.340\nBut they act the same.\n\n69\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; There's just a slight difference.\n\n70\n00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Same but different.\n\n71\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.290\nOkay, so what these both do,\nis they prompt you for\n\n72\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.370\ninformation and\nthen you type it in and it inserts it.\n\n73\n00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.190\nOkay, this is like input fields or\nany type of user input,\n\n74\n00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.280\nyou get this little dialogue box\nthis little box that comes up and\n\n75\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.410\nsays hey this question, answer, insert.\n\n76\n00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.480\nThe thing is when I read this, the very\nfirst time I started reading this stuff,\n\n77\n00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.150\nit's like okay, ask and\nthen the fill in, okay.\n\n78\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.180\nYour organization is sponsoring an event.\n\n79\n00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.360\nYou know, you have a form that ask for\ninformation like how old are you.\n\n80\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.280\nNow this is where, again, I'm almost\nslightly embarrassed to say this cuz maybe\n\n81\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.700\nit's just my brain and someone is like,\nwhy would you ever read it that way?\n\n82\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.810\nBut I'm thinking, so\n\n83\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.180\nthis is something that I would put into\nmy final merge to ask the recipients.\n\n84\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.510\nAnd again, I think I crossed too\nmany strings and I'm like, wait.\n\n85\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.090\nAnd it wasn't working that way.\n\n86\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.560\nThese are for you,\nas the creator of this mail merge,\n\n87\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.860\nin helping me be able to make my\nfinal product, as to the end result.\n\n88\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.980\n&gt;&gt;
