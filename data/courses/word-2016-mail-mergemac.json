series.\n\n3\n00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:21.115\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and in this course\noverview, we're going to be talking about\n\n4\n00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:24.668\nwhat is in this particular course,\nwhat is our target audience?\n\n5\n00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:28.983\nI guess, I really should say\nwho is our target audience?\n\n6\n00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:31.987\nAnything we need to know\nbefore we get started and\n\n7\n00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:34.707\nany extra tidbits that I might have for\nyou.\n\n8\n00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:38.057\nSo this is really one topic,\nit's Mail Merge.\n\n9\n00:00:38.057 --> 00:00:41.657\nThis is a deep dive into\nthe very popular and\n\n10\n00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:46.260\nvery powerful function within\nWord is the Mail Merge.\n\n11\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.903\nNow if you are thinking mm-hm, why,\nI think I've seen some of this before in\n\n12\n00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:52.270\nthe Word Advanced series,\nwell you are correct.\n\n13\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.950\nWe have a couple episodes in\nthere to get you started.\n\n14\n00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.523\nBut in this series we're gonna really\ndive deep into the data sources.\n\n15\n00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:04.034\nWhat does it really mean to have that\ndata source and those connections.\n\n16\n00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:08.672\nAnd the different types of data\nconnections that you can make, whether\n\n17\n00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:13.787\nwe're using Excel or a CSV file or a TXT\nfile, maybe even like a FileMaker Pro.\n\n18\n00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:18.370\nSo we're gonna cover all of those\nin those particular episodes.\n\n19\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.347\nAnd once we get our data source then\nwe're gonna learn how to connect that or\n\n20\n00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:27.070\ncreate letters and labels,\nand envelopes and emails.\n\n21\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.310\nAnd along the way we'll be talking\nabout how we can add images into that.\n\n22\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.433\nSo really just kinda taking it\na slower look, a really concise and\n\n23\n00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:39.263\nextensive look at how we\ncan perform Mail Merge.\n\n24\n00:01:39.263 --> 00:01:44.637\nSo hope we get into a level of confidence\nwith this particular functionality.\n\n25\n00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:49.888\nFor you to be able to just blow right\nthrough it because once you do understand\n\n26\n00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:55.303\nthe concepts of it it can become very easy\nonce you understand why we think is and\n\n27\n00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:58.260\nwhy it's doing, what it's doing.\n\n28\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.723\nWe'll also be covering some rules that\nwork in Mail Merge, some if, then,\n\n29\n00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:06.378\nelse statements, and\nsome fill-in things, and some asks.\n\n30\n00:02:06.378 --> 00:02:10.510\nSo all sorts of really neat things\nthan can really help you take\n\n31\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.897\nyour Mail Merge to that next level.\n\n32\n00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:14.285\nSo who is this for?\n\n33\n00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:16.565\nAnybody that uses Word extensively or\n\n34\n00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:19.493\nreally just wants to know\nmore about mail merge.\n\n35\n00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:23.948\nThis is something that can really\nhelp you automate your task in,\n\n36\n00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:29.307\nyour role within an office setting or\nin your small business, or in anywhere.\n\n37\n00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:33.366\nAnd so Office users,\nthat's a capital O with Office 365.\n\n38\n00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.619\nSo we will be using that account and\n\n39\n00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:41.590\nall the different pieces\nwithin the Office 365.\n\n40\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.183\nSuite is not necessarily for\n\n41\n00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:46.509\nyou have to be an office person\nwithin a physical building.\n\n42\n00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.047\nYou can be in any field of study or\n\n43\n00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:54.210\nof work that just uses these\npieces of software to help you.\n\n44\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.697\nAnd like I said this is a deep dive into\nthis particular functionality of Word.\n\n45\n00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:05.235\nYes, it's that extensive that we can have\na whole series on just this one part.\n\n46\n00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.314\nSome things that you need to know\nabout before we get started.\n\n47\n00:03:07.314 --> 00:03:11.490\nYou need to have a basic understanding\nof how the operating system works within\n\n48\n00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.810\na Mac, what is your Finder,\nand how to move around it.\n\n49\n00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.237\nBut also a foundational knowledge of Word,\nExcel, and Outlook cuz we are going\n\n50\n00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:25.262\nto be covering and using these other\napplications when using Mail Merge.\n\n51\n00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:28.664\nSo understanding how to format text,\n\n52\n00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:34.100\nhow to format graphical elements\nwithin your document how.\n\n53\n00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.926\nAnd what and\nwhy do we use page layouts in Word.\n\n54\n00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:42.955\nAll of these can be found on\nother series just like the Excel,\n\n55\n00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:47.709\nthis is a show Excel but we will be\nusing that in this particular series.\n\n56\n00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.608\nAnd understanding the CSV file format and\nhow we can export things and\n\n57\n00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:56.175\nwe're just entering in\ndata in Excel in general.\n\n58\n00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:58.196\nAlso some basic inner concepts.\n\n59\n00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.876\nDo you know what the inbox is?\n\n60\n00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:00.978\nDo you know the out box is?\n\n61\n00:04:00.978 --> 00:04:02.135\nDo you know what sent mail is?\n\n62\n00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:05.574\nDo you know that you have\ncontacts within Outlook?\n\n63\n00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:09.816\nSo those are some of the things that we're\ngoing to be kind of covering around within\n\n64\n00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:10.554\nthis series.\n\n65\n00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:15.360\nSo having a base knowledge of some\nother products is really going to hel[.\n\n66\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.757\nFiles and Notes, we have exercise files\nthat accompany these episodes and\n\n67\n00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:24.107\nepisode notes so\ndefinitely check those out.\n\n68\n00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:27.822\nYou can find all of the files and\nthe notes that are for\n\n69\n00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:31.371\nthis entire series within\nthis course overview or\n\n70\n00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:36.037\nin individual episodes,\nyou should be able to find that button.\n\n71\n00:04:36.037 --> 00:04:39.719\nAnd if there's anything missing or\nsomething's not working just go ahead and\n\n72\n00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.793\nlet us know, go ahead and\nshoot us an email.\n\n73\n00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:44.997\nOr type in a help ticket, and let us know\nif something's missing so I know and\n\n74\n00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:46.164\nI can go ahead and fix that.\n\n75\n00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:49.655\nNow a little note about the files, is that\nwith this particular series we are going\n\n76\n00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:52.657\nto be making data connections from\na Word file to an Excel or a CSV file.\n\n77\n00:04:52.657 --> 00:04:55.327\nOr type in a help ticket and let us know\nif something's missing so I know and\n\n78\n00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:56.330\nI can go ahead and fix that.\n\n79\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.678\nNow a little note about the files, is that\nwith this particular series, we are going\n\n80\n00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:02.476\nto be making data connections from\na word file to an Excel or a CSV file.\n\n81\n00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:06.298\nAnd when you do that you're creating\na path to that particular file format.\n\n82\n00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:08.019\nIt's gonna remember it on my computer.\n\n83\n00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:14.277\nSo when you open it it's going to tell\nyou that the data file can't be found.\n\n84\n00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:18.670\nAnd that the link is broken and\nyou're going to need to relink it.\n\n85\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.681\nNow if you're not sure what I'm talking\nabout we do cover this in the letters\n\n86\n00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:25.766\nMail Merge episode where we\ntalk about changing sources.\n\n87\n00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:30.104\nAnd how to do things when\nyou have a missing source.\n\n88\n00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:33.847\nSo definitely check that episode out and\nto be able to relink.\n\n89\n00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:38.137\nAnd that's gonna happen pretty much in all\nof your files that I already have a data\n\n90\n00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.347\nsource established.\n\n91\n00:05:39.347 --> 00:05:42.019\nSo just wanted to give you\nthat little FYI on that one.\n\n92\n00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:45.846\nSome extras, yet\nwe do have other courses on Excel and\n\n93\n00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:50.366\nOutlook that are in this library so\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n94\n00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:52.276\nAnd Word Advanced or Word X, so\n\n95\n00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:55.615\nyou can kind of re-up on\nsome of that word knowledge.\n\n96\n00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:59.269\nThere's always other options in these\nproducts and everything in Microsoft, and\n\n97\n00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:00.324\ncomputers in general.\n\n98\n00:06:00.324 --> 00:06:03.550\nSo if there's other ways to do\nthings it probably does exist,\n\n99\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.357\nI just might not cover all of them.\n\n100\n00:06:05.357 --> 00:06:08.327\nYour updates those updates\nget me every time.\n\n101\n00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:12.218\nSo if you're seeing something in your\nparticular environment that is not\n\n102\n00:06:12.218 --> 00:06:15.982\nbeing displayed in mine, it might be\nthat you're on a higher version of\n\n103\n00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:19.890\nthe software than I'm on at this\nparticular point in the filming.\n\n104\n00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.169\nSo just make sure that\nyou understand that.\n\n105\n00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.072\nAnd you can always go into your help menu\nand check to see if you have updates to go\n\n106\n00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:27.337\nahead and get you to the latest and\ngreatest.\n\n107\n00:06:27.337 --> 00:06:32.340\nThat's kinda the beauty of\nhaving our Office 365 products.\n\n108\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.692\nThere's answers out there and\nyou can search for them.\n\n109\n00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:40.022\nAnd so I encourage you to do that and read\nup on more about these types of topics.\n\n110\n00:06:40.022 --> 00:06:44.865\nAnd different ways to do things, everybody\nuses these products for different reasons.\n\n111\n00:06:44.865 --> 00:06:48.540\nI'm going give you examples as to why\nI use them and examples of how I use\n\n112\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.355\nthe certain functionality of Mail Merge\nbut you might have some others.\n\n113\n00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:56.348\nSo try to correlate into your need and you\nmight not need to use every single piece\n\n114\n00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:58.683\nof this particular service and\nthat's okay.\n\n115\n00:06:58.683 --> 00:07:03.210\nOf course to me always having fun,\nI like to have fun this episodes.\n\n116\n00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.806\nWe like to joke and make things little\nlight and light and airy for you.\n\n117\n00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:10.409\nSo hopefully go ahead and get those\nconcepts across.So you can have fun\n\n118\n00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:14.386\nperforming Mail Merges and maybe it won't\nbe such a daunting task after this.\n\n119\n00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:17.356\nSo definitely have some fun,\nstick around and\n\n120\n00:07:17.356 --> 00:07:20.181\nI hope to see you in\nsome episodes very soon.\n\n121\n00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:25.261\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
