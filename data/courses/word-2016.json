here at IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:17.057\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n5\n00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:20.336\ntoday we're gonna be looking\nat Microsoft Office Word 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:24.348\nAnd I've got with me my good friend\nRonnie Wong, and he's gonna help us out,\n\n7\n00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:26.890\nbecause I've got a problem, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.470\nI got a new job, and I'm going to\nbe helping out this writer, and\n\n9\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.710\nhe expects me to be able to use Microsoft\nOffice Word right out of the box,\n\n10\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.640\nand I'm a little new at this stuff,\nso I'm hoping you can give us a hand.\n\n11\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.570\n>> We surely can.\n\n12\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.490\nWe can actually make sure that you\nunderstand that when you are beginning to\n\n13\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.920\nwork with a Word processor, one of the\nthings that you have to be familiar with,\n\n14\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.790\nof course, is that ability to\njump right in and get started.\n\n15\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.050\nThe problem is Word is actually a fairly\nlarge product and that means what you and\n\n16\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.880\nI have to do is feel\ncomfortable in its environment.\n\n17\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.340\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to take a look around Word.\n\n18\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.490\nI'm going to show you how to get\nstarted by launching a program.\n\n19\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.809\nAnd then explore the interface as well.\n\n20\n00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.240\nSo let me show you what I'm\ntalking about right here.\n\n21\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.725\nSo let's say that what happens is I'm on\nmy office machine which is gonna be this,\n\n22\n00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:15.080\nWindows 10 machine that I'm working on and\nalready installed them is gonna be\n\n23\n00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.030\nMicrosoft Office itself and we're gonna be\nprimarily dealing with Word itself, right?\n\n24\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.530\nWhich is our Word Processor.\n\n25\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.795\nNow if I go ahead and say hey,\nI need to get started with Word,\n\n26\n00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:30.210\none of the very simple things that we\nhave to do is just simply get it started.\n\n27\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.790\nNow most of us are fairly familiar with\nworking with a computer a lot of times,\n\n28\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.630\nand all that we have to do is actually\ngo and find the application itself.\n\n29\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.830\nSo here in Windows 10, I'm gonna\nclick on the Start button, and I'm\n\n30\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.480\ngonna go to All Apps and under all apps,\nit should be listed in alphabetical order.\n\n31\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.880\nSo if I go ahead and\nselect this and I scroll down,\n\n32\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.690\nI'm scrolling down to the Ws,\nand notice Word here.\n\n33\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.240\nSo once it's installed, we should see that\nit also adds in, well, links like this\n\n34\n00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.380\nright into the menu itself, and that way,\nwe can go ahead and get started.\n\n35\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.830\nAnd all I have to do is launch that and\nthere it is.\n\n36\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.300\nWe actually do have Word launched up, and\n\n37\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.930\nnow we are actually ready\nto get started here.\n\n38\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.250\nNow the problem that we have is fairly\nsimple, that that's not the only way for\n\n39\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.350\nus to get started even though this\nis one of the very simple ways.\n\n40\n00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.210\nAnd we're gonna come back to this in a few\nmoments because notice that it doesn't\n\n41\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.502\nlaunch you right away into an old\nWord processor just like what you and\n\n42\n00:02:23.502 --> 00:02:24.270\nI would think.\n\n43\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.710\n>> I was gonna say,\nwhere's my blank document and\n\n44\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.290\nwhy can't I start typing, Ronnie?\n\n45\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.062\n>> Yeah well you can.\n\n46\n00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:30.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But what Word wants to do,\n\n47\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.410\nespecially in Word 2016,\nis it wants to give you multiple different\n\n48\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.600\noptions to be able to\nactually come up with.\n\n49\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.380\nSo you don't have to always\nstart with a blank document.\n\n50\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.850\nNow notice that you can.\n\n51\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.770\nHere's a blank document right here.\n\n52\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.370\nAnd then there's actually\nother what we call templates.\n\n53\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.790\nBut for right now, right?\n\n54\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.570\nJust starting it up is one of the very\nsimple features that we have to be able to\n\n55\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.260\ndo and just get it launched.\n\n56\n00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.480\nYou'll also notice that over\nhere on the right hand side,\n\n57\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.110\nif you've actually already worked with\na bunch of documents, all those documents\n\n58\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.210\nthat you've worked with in Word will\nalso show up in this recent list.\n\n59\n00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.670\nAnd even older lists.\n\n60\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.730\nAnd then you can also open up\nother documents down here.\n\n61\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.420\nNow, even though that might be\nthe way that you actually launch it up\n\n62\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.598\nthe very first time,\n\n63\n00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:13.550\nit's probably not gonna be always\nthe way that you launch it up as well.\n\n64\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.390\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n65\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.926\nSo, if I go ahead and close out of Word\nagain, well, now I have my screen and\n\n66\n00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:21.330\nit's empty.\n\n67\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.770\nAnd most of us are actually used to\nworking with what we call shortcuts\n\n68\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.000\ninstead, and we can also just go ahead and\nsay I want Word to be there.\n\n69\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.830\nIf that's gonna be the primary document\nthat you're working with since\n\n70\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.210\nyou're working with a copy\neditor of some sort, and\n\n71\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.240\nyou go, hey, I need to be able\nto get access to that faster,\n\n72\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.480\nwell the way I showed you took two or\nthree clicks before we ever got there.\n\n73\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.440\nOne of the things we can do right away\nthough, is actually create of course\n\n74\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.390\nshortcuts to help us out, and so\nlet me show you how to also do that and\n\n75\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.270\nthat will get you access to Word\na little bit faster instead.\n\n76\n00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.230\nSo the first time and you're like, man,\nI dont wanna have to keep going to\n\n77\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.570\nthe start and to all apps and\ndown to the Ws and launching Word.\n\n78\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.640\nWell, you only have to do\nit a couple of times and\n\n79\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.240\nyou'll actually be able to do this.\n\n80\n00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.060\nSo what we're gonna do here, is we're\ngonna put an icon down here on the taskbar\n\n81\n00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.340\nso that you can launch Word\nup directly from the taskbar.\n\n82\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.860\nNow Windows 10 really loves this.\n\n83\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.870\nThis is one of the default features that\nit gives you directly from that Word icon.\n\n84\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.720\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n85\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.440\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick on the Windows button, and\n\n86\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.760\nthen I go to All Apps and\nI scroll down to the Ws again.\n\n87\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.940\nWell if I right click on Word 2016,\nnotice that it gives me several options.\n\n88\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.850\nI can pin it to my start\nmenu which is actually\n\n89\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.570\njust the tiles that you see over here.\n\n90\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.720\nI can also pin it to the taskbar.\n\n91\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.372\nSo if I go ahead and click Pin to Taskbar,\n\n92\n00:04:43.372 --> 00:04:46.882\nnotice that puts the icon\nright here on the taskbar and\n\n93\n00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:52.280\nany time that I launch up my Windows 10\nmachine, I have access to it right there.\n\n94\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.468\nThat might be one of the ways that you\nlike because it's always there, it's not\n\n95\n00:04:56.468 --> 00:05:00.719\nactually in the way and you actually have\nit available right there at the bottom of\n\n96\n00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.559\nyour screen, or wherever you choose\nto have your task bar on the screen.\n\n97\n00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:08.588\nAnd of course, if you like using\nthe idea of this start menu,\n\n98\n00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:10.170\nyou also have this too.\n\n99\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.400\nIf you're actually in other versions\nof Word, like Windows 8.1, and\n\n100\n00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.210\nyou have that start screen and\nyou would do the same thing.\n\n101\n00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.924\nLet me show you here All Programs, or\nall apps and then if I right click and\n\n102\n00:05:21.924 --> 00:05:24.125\nnotice it says Pin to Start.\n\n103\n00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:24.920\nWhen you're in Windows 8.1 and\n\n104\n00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.780\npinned it to that Start menu which will\nactually just be full screen and what we\n\n105\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.070\nsee right here I can also pin it to the\nStart menu and I can launch it from here.\n\n106\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.540\nSo any of those ways that\nwe've just showed you\n\n107\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.500\nis actually a way that we can get\nstarted in just launching up Word.\n\n108\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.310\nNow usually the one thing\nthat most people want is\n\n109\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.360\nthat ability to pin it\nright to the desktop.\n\n110\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.980\n>> Yeah, that's what I always look for\nin my favorite programs.\n\n111\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.610\nI'm old school.\n\n112\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.730\nI want it to be there on the desktop, and\nwhen my boss comes to me and says, hey,\n\n113\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.520\nI want you to work on this document\nI need to get to it quick.\n\n114\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.358\nCan I put it there?\n\n115\n00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.230\n>> You absolutely can put it\nright on your desktop but\n\n116\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.440\nthis one's a little bit more difficult.\n\n117\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.210\nAnd it's not difficult\nbecause you can't do it.\n\n118\n00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.980\nIt's just difficult because what\nthey want you to do in the more\n\n119\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.840\nmodern Windows interfaces here is either\nuse that task bar, to use that start menu.\n\n120\n00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.010\nSo they don't like the idea of 60 or\n70 desktop icons on your desktop.\n\n121\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.950\nBut can you do it?\n\n122\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.060\nYou absolutely can.\n\n123\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.370\nAnd everybody does it in different ways,\nbut let me show you the way that\n\n124\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.550\nI think is actually going to be the\neasiest way for you to be able to do this.\n\n125\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.460\nSo if I go ahead and click back on\nthe Windows button and on All Apps.\n\n126\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.660\nAnd then if I scroll back\ndown to that Word, here.\n\n127\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.030\nI'm gonna right click and\nnotice that we don't have that option.\n\n128\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.800\nIt doesn't say send to the desktop\nwhich is what we would expect to see.\n\n129\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.580\nBut what I can do is select\nopen file location and\n\n130\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.270\nthat will automatically open up that\nfolder that the program's listed in.\n\n131\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.470\nAnd that's right here.\n\n132\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.930\nI can right-click, and\nthen select Send To, and Desktop.\n\n133\n00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.380\nAnd that makes it much easier.\n\n134\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.440\nIf you're actually on the first day of\nthat job, and it says hey, we need to be\n\n135\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.640\nable to make sure that you can get access\nto it and get working with it right away.\n\n136\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.870\nAnd now you actually know that\nyou can pin it to the desktop,\n\n137\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.616\nyou can pin it to the taskbar,\nyou can go to the start menu as well, and\n\n138\n00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:21.730\nof course you can actually find\nit inside of the all apps.\n\n139\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.370\n>> All right, Ronnie, so\nwe've got several ways we can launch Word.\n\n140\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.200\nI can pin it on my taskbar, I can pin it\non my start screen, my start menu, and\n\n141\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.610\nof course, if we're old school like me,\n\n142\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.810\nI can still put it on my desktop although\nthey make it a little more difficult.\n\n143\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.260\nI got to go find that executable and\nmake the shortcut from there.\n\n144\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.970\nBut what if somebody sends me a document,\ndo I have to go and open up Word and\n\n145\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.390\nthen go and browse and find this document?\n\n146\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.850\n>> Well no,\nyou really don't have to do that at all.\n\n147\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.136\nThe good thing is Word still works\nlike it always did in the past.\n\n148\n00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:52.376\nIf you go, well Ronnie I've never used\nit in the past, most of us have actually\n\n149\n00:07:52.376 --> 00:07:56.425\nreceived the file exactly like what\nMike said, and instead of going to find\n\n150\n00:07:56.425 --> 00:08:00.115\nthe application or even the shortcut\non our desktop or our task bar.\n\n151\n00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:02.574\nWe just simply double\nclick on the file and\n\n152\n00:08:02.574 --> 00:08:06.310\nthat will also be a way that we\ncan use a shortcut to launch that.\n\n153\n00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.951\nAnd that's probably by\nfar the most popular way,\n\n154\n00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:09.170\nat least that's the way that I do it.\n\n155\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.800\nEvery time that somebody sends\nme a file I don't go and\n\n156\n00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.280\nfind the actually link, what I do is\nI simply go ahead and use that file,\n\n157\n00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.080\nlet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n158\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.290\nSo remember if you are actually unfamiliar\nwith that, when you do receive a file and\n\n159\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.660\nI've got several of them will be working\nwith here I need to go into this folder.\n\n160\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.760\nAnd inside of my exercise files here,\nI'm just gonna bring up one of these.\n\n161\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.880\nAnd notice that I have this little\nicon here that is a Word icon.\n\n162\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.820\nAnd I simply double click on it and\nnotice that Word launches again.\n\n163\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.060\nAnd so\n\n164\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.730\nit's one of those unusual things about\nMicrosoft Word that they've always done.\n\n165\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.065\nAnd some of them they've also kept in\n2016 is death by a thousand paper cuts.\n\n166\n00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:48.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Learning how to do the same thing in so\n\n167\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.970\nmany different ways but\nthis just makes you more efficient,\n\n168\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.820\nmakes you actually be able to work\nwith that document much more quicker.\n\n169\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.840\nSo even if you go,\nno I don't like those desktop icons,\n\n170\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.630\nnotice that you can also do this,\nbut remember, having\n\n171\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.600\nthose icons there especially if you're\nfamiliar with working from desktop icons.\n\n172\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.170\nProbably one of the greatest\nthings that you can do.\n\n173\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.720\nIf you like the task bar down here and\n\n174\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.640\nhaving all those features down there,\nworks great that way as well, and\n\n175\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.240\nof course,\nstraight from the Start menu itself.\n\n176\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.575\nAll those are just features that really\ncan help you feel confident that, hey, I\n\n177\n00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:25.065\nknow that I can get this product launched,\nand then we can actually begin to use it.\n\n178\n00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.317\nBut even though we've\nnow opened up a desktop,\n\n179\n00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:30.375\nnotice the difference though in\nwhat we've done here, right?\n\n180\n00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:34.685\nBy going directly through that link,\nfrom that file,\n\n181\n00:09:34.685 --> 00:09:39.002\nit automatically opened it\nup in this mode right here.\n\n182\n00:09:39.002 --> 00:09:42.748\nWhere now we're actually more comfortable\nbecause this is what you know,\n\n183\n00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:46.317\nwe're fairly used to working with if\nwe've actually worked on any Word\n\n184\n00:09:46.317 --> 00:09:47.332\nprocesses before.\n\n185\n00:09:47.332 --> 00:09:51.321\nWhich is the document open and ready for\nediting or ready for your browsing when\n\n186\n00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:54.707\nyou need to on all of the other\nones that we've actually done here,\n\n187\n00:09:54.707 --> 00:09:58.010\nlet me close that out and\nmake a little bit more streamline.\n\n188\n00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.930\nWhen I open it up,\nnotice it launches me to the default.\n\n189\n00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.450\nIn other words we haven't selected\nwhat we're focusing in on and so\n\n190\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.390\ninstead it gives me multiple options.\n\n191\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.390\nIt gives me the option to open that\ndocument up over here from the side or\n\n192\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.770\nto create one that is blank, or to use\nall these different template options so\n\n193\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.190\nI can get started somehow.\n\n194\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:22.120\nSo depending on your need is how you're\ngonna actually choose to open that up.\n\n195\n00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.270\nAnd then depending on your comfort level\nthat's when you might choose to create\n\n196\n00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.290\nthose different shortcuts\nto feel more confident in\n\n197\n00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.110\ndoing what you need to do with Word.\n\n198\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.102\nThat's really one of the best ways\nthat you can get started and go,\n\n199\n00:10:33.102 --> 00:10:36.800\nlook I know I can launch it, I know\ndifferent ways that this can come about.\n\n200\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.590\nAnd now we really do, we need to now\nget familiar with the product itself.\n\n201\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.450\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n202\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.398\nAll right, now Ronnie, the other thing\nI've gotta worry about because I've dealt\n\n203\n00:10:45.398 --> 00:10:48.565\nwith past versions of Office,\nand I know 2016 is very a stable,\n\n204\n00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.470\nit's got all these great new features.\n\n205\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.520\nBut occasionally things go wrong, right?\n\n206\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.770\nWe get a file that gets corrupted on my\nhard drive, or I accidentally delete one\n\n207\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.930\nof those system files that I\nshouldn't have been messing with.\n\n208\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.200\nAnd all of a sudden Word won't launch.\n\n209\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.210\nNow what do I do?\n\n210\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.990\n>> Yeah, there's a couple of\ndifferent things that you can try but\n\n211\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.420\nthe nice thing is that with Word 2016,\nif something like that happens.\n\n212\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.271\nWord itself tries to repair it.\n\n213\n00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.873\nIt really does which is neat.\n\n214\n00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:15.636\n>> Self repair, I like that.\n\n215\n00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:18.590\n>> Yeah, we call it the idea\nof self healing, right?\n\n216\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.042\nSo when that ends up happening and\nWord says, look I'm not gonna launch,\n\n217\n00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:25.070\nit automatically can launch itself\ninto what we call safe mode.\n\n218\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.770\nIt's called the automatic safe mode.\n\n219\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.740\nAnd that means that Word will detect\nif there's something going wrong.\n\n220\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.028\nAnd instead of you trying to figure out\nand you know, kind of pull your hair out,\n\n221\n00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:38.680\ntrying to figure out what's going on,\nit can launch in a safe mode.\n\n222\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.030\nAnd when it does so, it's trying\nto indicate to you that something\n\n223\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.710\ndid go seriously wrong\nhere with Word itself.\n\n224\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.776\nNow you don't know if it\nactually is with Word or not.\n\n225\n00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:51.570\nBut if it actually launches it\nby itself next time you go and\n\n226\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.860\nopen a document, you're probably pretty\nmuch guaranteed that there is something\n\n227\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.690\nthat needs to be done.\n\n228\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.808\nAnd if Word is able to repair it, it will.\n\n229\n00:11:59.808 --> 00:12:02.748\nIf its not able to repair it,\nwell then you might have to run\n\n230\n00:12:02.748 --> 00:12:06.010\nwhat we call the repair which we\nwill get to a little bit later on.\n\n231\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.016\nBut overall though, it can do that\nautomatically, but what if you're\n\n232\n00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:14.221\nnot sure, what if you're not sure though\nif word is actually the problem or\n\n233\n00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:16.980\nis it that document that is the problem.\n\n234\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.660\nWell, the mode is actually a little\nbit different, so let me go ahead and\n\n235\n00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.650\njust show you kinda the contrast\nin what you'll end up seeing here.\n\n236\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.750\nI'm gonna bring up that doc,\nthat memorandum, that we've just had.\n\n237\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:33.780\nAnd I'm simply gonna launch it this way so\nI know I get access to it right away.\n\n238\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.990\nAnd when we take a look and\n\n239\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.210\nwe see this here,\nyou'll notice that it actually looks nice.\n\n240\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.797\nEverything is nice and bright, and\nhighlighted, and everything is good,\n\n241\n00:12:42.797 --> 00:12:47.168\nand so when you take a look you have\naccess to all of these tools that you see\n\n242\n00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:48.112\nhighlighted.\n\n243\n00:12:48.112 --> 00:12:50.689\nBut notice over here, you have access\nto some of these tools that aren't\n\n244\n00:12:50.689 --> 00:12:53.410\nhighlighted and that means I can click\nover here and it's not going to work.\n\n245\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.200\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nRonnie, why do I care?\n\n246\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.500\nYou care because it can indicate also\nwhat mode that you're in as well.\n\n247\n00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.330\nSo using this document\nright here I'm showing you\n\n248\n00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.050\nthat you can get access to all this.\n\n249\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:10.110\nBut you can also manually\nlaunch Word in safe mode.\n\n250\n00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.470\nNow, depending on what version of Word or\nwhat version of Office you're in,\n\n251\n00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.210\nit really doesn't matter where\nyou can actually do this.\n\n252\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.190\nSo for example here, in Windows 10 I can\n\n253\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:26.680\nsimply type in the executable for\nWord, which is winword.\n\n254\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.690\nAnd then I can do a space and\na forward slash safe.\n\n255\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.912\nNow if you're in let's say WIndows 7, you\nmight have to go to Start and then Run.\n\n256\n00:13:35.912 --> 00:13:40.584\nNow you know, you can type that or\neven directly on that search programs and\n\n257\n00:13:40.584 --> 00:13:44.976\nfiles line, you can type it in there and\nit will also do the same thing.\n\n258\n00:13:44.976 --> 00:13:48.872\nNow, let me go ahead and launch this right\naway and now, when you take a look at it,\n\n259\n00:13:48.872 --> 00:13:52.430\nyou should be able to see, now right here,\nlet me go ahead and accept that,\n\n260\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.587\nthis doesn't matter.\n\n261\n00:13:53.587 --> 00:13:55.980\nIt says Word in safe mode.\n\n262\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.010\nAnd now when you take a look,\neven though I have a document pulled up\n\n263\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.600\nyou can see that you really don't\nhave access to much right away.\n\n264\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.200\nSo if I try to open a recent document,\n\n265\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.780\nnotice it doesn't give me that ability to\nopen up a recent document very easily.\n\n266\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.545\nFor us to be able to do that\nI can pick another document.\n\n267\n00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:16.860\nBut it actually does launch\nWord into a very limited mode\n\n268\n00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.660\ntrying to actually make sure that what\nwe find out is does Word itself launch.\n\n269\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.000\nSo, if all of the sudden you\nhave a file that's opening and\n\n270\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.830\nthen closing right away,\nwhat this actually lets you know\n\n271\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.660\nif there's something really wrong with\nthe programming inside of Word or not.\n\n272\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.930\nIn this mode, you can't actually\nhave any templates that are saved.\n\n273\n00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.910\nToolbars and command bars, they're not\ngonna actually be available very easily.\n\n274\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.630\nAutocorrect, you name it, a bunch of\nfeatures that you might actually see\n\n275\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.490\nare not gonna be available to you.\n\n276\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.430\nAnd it won't get out of safe mode.\n\n277\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.240\nIn other words, if you now launch and\nyou close it back down.\n\n278\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.760\nAnd you try and launch it again,\nand it goes back in the safe mode.\n\n279\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.320\nThen you know that there's probably\nsomething very seriously wrong with Word.\n\n280\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.440\nSo you can see it in two\ndifferent ways here.\n\n281\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.260\nYou open up a file and\nautomatically launches it in safe mode.\n\n282\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.952\nYour pretty much gonna find out that, hey\nsomething else is wrong, close it down,\n\n283\n00:15:04.952 --> 00:15:07.882\ntry and launch it again,\nit'll automatically launches again.\n\n284\n00:15:07.882 --> 00:15:11.749\nYou'll probably toast it up, which means\nyou have to do a repair, or if you try and\n\n285\n00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:15.615\nmanually do it and then you close it out,\nand open it again, still launches in safe\n\n286\n00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:20.040\nmode, that's probably a good indication\nthat there's a problem with Word itself.\n\n287\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.227\nSo this is something that you may see,\nyou may encounter, you might go,\n\n288\n00:15:23.227 --> 00:15:24.387\nI didn't pick safe mode.\n\n289\n00:15:24.387 --> 00:15:27.392\nWell, notice that you can if you\nchoose to, but it's really for\n\n290\n00:15:27.392 --> 00:15:31.178\ntroubleshooting and it's something you\nmight end up seeing especially when you\n\n291\n00:15:31.178 --> 00:15:32.920\nbring an older documents into Word.\n\n292\n00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.030\nEvery once in awhile there's just\nsome glitchiness that happens, and\n\n293\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.420\nit may be the document itself,\nor it may be Word.\n\n294\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.500\nBut you're able to launch it here,\nit's usually saying,\n\n295\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.470\nhey, I've turned off everything else but\njust launching Word.\n\n296\n00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.533\nNow let's see you know,\nnow that you know that Word can launch,\n\n297\n00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:50.020\npick a document and\nsee if you can launch with it.\n\n298\n00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.405\nIf it doesn't give you anything but\nsafe mode, then yep.\n\n299\n00:15:52.405 --> 00:15:54.556\nProblematic with Word itself, probably.\n\n300\n00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:57.793\nAnd reinstall or repair, and\nyou're fine, and ready to go.\n\n301\n00:15:57.793 --> 00:15:59.440\n>> So it sounds a lot like safe mode.\n\n302\n00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.971\nFor my computer,\nwhen I've had trouble with my PC,\n\n303\n00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:05.840\nyou launch it up in this very minimalistic\nmode without all the extra features.\n\n304\n00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.510\nTry to cut all the other stuff out and\nget back to the basics and\n\n305\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.600\njust see if that underlying, in this case,\napplication can even launch,\n\n306\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.390\nto try to troubleshoot,\ntry to figure out where that problem lies.\n\n307\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.890\nAll right, well, Ronnie, let's say,\nWord's okay, I can launch it up just fine.\n\n308\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.610\nBut once I launch it, I mean there\nis a lot of stuff staring at me,\n\n309\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.070\njust as you were hovering over those\ndifferent bars across the top.\n\n310\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.360\nI saw all kinds of icons and\n\n311\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.040\noptions and it seems like navigation\nis gonna be my next big challenge.\n\n312\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.130\nI've got the application open, but\nnow I need to be able to get around,\n\n313\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.070\nwork my way around the application.\n\n314\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.720\n>> You really do.\n\n315\n00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.420\nOne of the best things that you\ncould do is become familiar\n\n316\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.700\nwith the way that the application\nactually does work and\n\n317\n00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.006\nactually just be familiar\nwith where things are.\n\n318\n00:16:49.006 --> 00:16:52.860\nRemember that 50% of just about\neverything that you do right,\n\n319\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.970\nis figuring out just\nwhere stuff is located.\n\n320\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.440\nIt takes so much time when you go I\nknow I can do that but where is it?\n\n321\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.270\nWhere do I actually run that from?\n\n322\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.790\nOr how do I get to that?\n\n323\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.050\nAnd that takes so much time, and\nthen once you click it and you're like,\n\n324\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.510\nwhy isn't it that easy?\n\n325\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.720\nIt always is, but the way that you do\nthat, of course, is by using it daily.\n\n326\n00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.580\nBut what we wanna show you here is\njust some of the different features\n\n327\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.330\nthat you actually will encounter\nwhen you do launch Word and\n\n328\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.390\nsome of that you should be familiar with\nif you're really trying to make sure that\n\n329\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.550\nyou get started on that very first day.\n\n330\n00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.900\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n331\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.980\nI went in and launched the Memorandum\nof Understanding for Services and\n\n332\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.160\nwe want you to just be familiar\nwith what we're seeing right here,\n\n333\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.050\nwhich is what we called the Interface,\nright?\n\n334\n00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.290\nThis is how you and\nI interact with the program itself, and\n\n335\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.410\nso when we picked a document,\n\n336\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.320\nwhen we actually launch it up, you need\nto be familiar with just about everything\n\n337\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.420\nthat you see right in front of you is\nwhat we're really focusing in on here.\n\n338\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.640\nSo for us to be able to do that,\n\n339\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.990\nlet's start up here at the very top\nthat controls the entire application.\n\n340\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.410\nUp here,\nthis is what we call our title bar, right?\n\n341\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.700\nRight up here at the top, it normally has\na name of the file that you're working in,\n\n342\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.420\nand it even showed you some\nextra information such as what\n\n343\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.230\nprogram that you're working in as\nwell as what mode that we're in.\n\n344\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.000\nNow, the mode is something we wanted\nto discuss a little bit later on, but\n\n345\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.690\nwhen you see the term Compatibility Mode,\nit let you know that this document\n\n346\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.420\ncame from a previous version of Word for\nright now.\n\n347\n00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.532\nAnd what it's trying to do is maintain\nthat compatibility, that if I save it in\n\n348\n00:18:23.532 --> 00:18:28.370\nOffice 2016, you can also open it\nup in a previous edition of Office.\n\n349\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.250\nNow if I don't want that,\n\n350\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.020\nI can actually simply override that and\nwe'll see that a little bit later on.\n\n351\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.680\nBut that's just some of the stuff that\nyou can see right here at the top.\n\n352\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.210\nAlso controlling the entire\napplication of course,\n\n353\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.640\nare these buttons that\nwe see on either corner.\n\n354\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.960\nNotice that it gives me this option up\nhere at the very upper left hand corner.\n\n355\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.590\nAnd this is what we call\nthis quick access tool bar.\n\n356\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.810\nThe quick access tool bar is a one click\n\n357\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:59.150\neasy access to a lot of the features that\nyou and I will actually choose to run.\n\n358\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.850\nNow most of the time this is by\nfar the most customizable element\n\n359\n00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.530\nthat we have at the Word screen right\naway and the easiest to customize too.\n\n360\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.000\nSo when you see something like this and\ngo,\n\n361\n00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.550\nyou know, I always use these same\nfive buttons over and over again,\n\n362\n00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.790\ninstead of me trying to look through\neach of these different tabs and figure\n\n363\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.350\nout where they are, you can actually\nuse that quick access toolbar instead.\n\n364\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:25.010\nAnd go ahead and actually have it kind\nof set up here to where it will do so.\n\n365\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.727\nRight now by default, has Save and\n\n366\n00:19:27.727 --> 00:19:32.390\nit also has what we call this Undo and\nalso Redo buttons.\n\n367\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.790\nAnd these two are actually not available\nright now because I've not done anything.\n\n368\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.670\nBut if I come down here and\nI make a change here,\n\n369\n00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.310\nlet me say that I make\na grammatical error and I put,\n\n370\n00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.620\nan A-N, instead of an a, well now notice\nthat these buttons become highlighted for\n\n371\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.520\nus, and then if I want to,\nI can actually remove that fairly simply.\n\n372\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.990\nOver in the other corner of course\ncontrols the entire window itself.\n\n373\n00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.520\nWe have where we can close out\nof the entire application.\n\n374\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.220\nWe can restore it down.\n\n375\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.040\nIn other words,\nI can actually just shrink it down to\n\n376\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.850\njust one of many windows that\nI might be working with.\n\n377\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.360\nNow the point where I can minimize it, and\n\n378\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.840\nessentially park it on my\ntool bar down here, task bar.\n\n379\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.060\nAnd then simply launch it back up.\n\n380\n00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.320\nSo those are fairly easy\nways that we can work\n\n381\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.930\nwith at least the entire window itself,\nand\n\n382\n00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:30.850\nthe other options that you also have is to\nbe able to resize it by using the corners.\n\n383\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.260\nIf you hover your cursor over it, notice\nit turns into a double-headed arrow.\n\n384\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.310\nAnd now I can actually click, and\ndrag, and resize whatever I want to.\n\n385\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.900\nI hover over the side,\nthe same double-headed arrow.\n\n386\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.500\nI can actually stretch it or shrink it.\n\n387\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.000\nAnd of course the same thing\non the top and bottom.\n\n388\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.350\nWe can use all those features available,\nright?\n\n389\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.160\nTo help us to do what we want to.\n\n390\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.670\nThe nice thing about the Office\nis also because it's part of\n\n391\n00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.850\nwhat Microsoft really has worked with.\n\n392\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.850\nNotice that we can actually make this\nsplit the screen in half by parking\n\n393\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.900\nit on one side by using\nthe what's built-in to\n\n394\n00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.210\nthe Windows 10 as well that split screen\nview that we also have available.\n\n395\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.740\nNow on top of all that then, once we\nhave that ready and available to go.\n\n396\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.590\nWe can take a look at, well some of\nthe other features that really involved.\n\n397\n00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.920\nNow editing the document or\nworking with the document.\n\n398\n00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.670\nBut just on the outside of the program\nitself we have all of that\n\n399\n00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.260\nthat's available but there is also one\nother tab that I was about to overlook,\n\n400\n00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.240\nwe're talking about working with Office,\nit's over here where it says File.\n\n401\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.060\nIf I click on file at this point, now,\n\n402\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.090\nthis actually gives me how I\nwork with the program as well.\n\n403\n00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.010\nInfo about the program, notice that\nthere's many different things that I can\n\n404\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.590\ndo here and we'll be going over all these\nin the series on Word 2016, it of course\n\n405\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.680\nleads me back to the very beginning\nwhere I can start a brand new document.\n\n406\n00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.230\nI can open an existing document from right\nhere, I of course can use save, and one\n\n407\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.410\nof the more important features which you\nwould think it would actually be printing.\n\n408\n00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.370\nBut we are living in a day and age in\nwhich printing is becoming less important\n\n409\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:14.340\nthan it was when well, when Mike and I\nfirst started working with Office, itself.\n\n410\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.390\nAnd there's even more features down\nhere as well such as exporting.\n\n411\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.850\nNotice we can create\nin different files and\n\n412\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.340\nthen even closing out\nof documents as well.\n\n413\n00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.320\nYou name it, and there's a.\n\n414\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.200\nI won't say this is not brand-spanking\nnew, but it's pretty close.\n\n415\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.680\nThe ability to share or collaborate\n\n416\n00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.750\non these documents gives us the ability\nto save it some place where both Mike and\n\n417\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.670\nI can gain access to it and\nactually work on that document together.\n\n418\n00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.945\nIn the past,\nnot saying it was totally impossible, but\n\n419\n00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:46.424\nas far as at the same time, it was\npretty difficult to be able to do so.\n\n420\n00:22:46.424 --> 00:22:49.820\nSo here they're even showing that hey,\nthis is part of that integration\n\n421\n00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.970\nbecause they really do want an actually\nintegrating in with things like\n\n422\n00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.550\ncloud services and making sure that we're\nactually able to get access into it.\n\n423\n00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.830\nSo there's a lot that's actually there and\navailable when we talked about\n\n424\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.689\njust making sure that we can get\naround inside of Word itself.\n\n425\n00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.980\nSome other features that we also\nhave is notice there's that\n\n426\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.320\nshare button over here\non the right hand side,\n\n427\n00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.450\nto make it a little bit easier than having\ngoing to the file and find all that stuff.\n\n428\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.200\nBut we have that and then of course if\nyou're logged in to the application,\n\n429\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.930\nthere's a bunch of other features\nwhich we are gonna get to too.\n\n430\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.480\nNow, actually we've got a few minutes and\nlet's go ahead and\n\n431\n00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.060\ntalk about some of those\nextra features for right now.\n\n432\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.191\nNow some of these other features that we\ntalk up may not actually apply to you too\n\n433\n00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:41.194\noften, but a lot of times it is what\nMicrosoft Office really wants you to do.\n\n434\n00:23:41.194 --> 00:23:44.228\nWhen you do invest into,\nwell like Word 2016,\n\n435\n00:23:44.228 --> 00:23:49.100\nmore than likely you might have also\ngotten an investment into Office 365 which\n\n436\n00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.477\nmeans you have access to a stored drive\nsomewhere and for you to have that,\n\n437\n00:23:53.477 --> 00:23:57.078\nthat means you can automatically\nsave it up into the Cloud and\n\n438\n00:23:57.078 --> 00:24:01.145\nthen you don't have to have your laptop or\nyour computer anywhere.\n\n439\n00:24:01.145 --> 00:24:03.686\nAll you have to do is being able\nto go to any other machine.\n\n440\n00:24:03.686 --> 00:24:06.810\nGet access to that same account and\nthen you can work with your documents.\n\n441\n00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.760\nYou don't have to worry if\nyou save here or there.\n\n442\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.500\nIf you've actually got everything ready,\nit means that,\n\n443\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.680\nhey everything is actually now able to\nbe saved to your own cloud storage.\n\n444\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.740\nNow, if I go ahead and\nshow you, I go to file and\n\n445\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.980\nnow let me go to new here, I was trying\nto make sure I was doing the right one.\n\n446\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.630\nNotice up here in the upper\nright hand corner.\n\n447\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.190\nAnd actually it's been on every\nscreen that we've taken to look at.\n\n448\n00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.840\nIt has me signed in.\n\n449\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.710\nAnd this is me signed in so\nthat I have access to\n\n450\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.260\nall those benefits I was just talking\nabout especially the Cloud storage.\n\n451\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.590\nAnd if I do that and\n\n452\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.280\nI automatically save this up in that\nCloud, remember what that means.\n\n453\n00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.830\nI can actually go anywhere.\n\n454\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.080\nBut there's actually couple\nof things that you can do.\n\n455\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.150\nIf you bought this for\nyourself, perfectly fine.\n\n456\n00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.080\nThat means you actually\nhave an account there.\n\n457\n00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.140\nBut what if you're at work?\n\n458\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.705\nJust like what we're talking about here.\n\n459\n00:24:55.705 --> 00:24:59.440\nActually created an account for you,\nwell that's a different storage.\n\n460\n00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.600\nSo usually a lot of times,\n\n461\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.808\nthe first time you sign in,\nit's gonna ask you to sign in.\n\n462\n00:25:03.808 --> 00:25:09.020\nBut then once you do so, let's say that\nyou wanna actually get switched over.\n\n463\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.820\nAnd instead of your personal account,\nyou wanna switch it to your work account.\n\n464\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.370\nWell you can simply do that\nby switching the account and\n\n465\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.720\nthen from that way you add in your\nsecond account and then it would change.\n\n466\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.360\nAnd I'll show you the difference here.\n\n467\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.330\nSo currently, let say, let me get back\nhere so that we can see something.\n\n468\n00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.530\nSo we go to this open,\nyou see all this stuff is listed here.\n\n469\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.290\nIf I sign out, if I go and\n\n470\n00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.780\nswitch accounts,\nlet me see if I can actually do that.\n\n471\n00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.960\nLet me try.\n\n472\n00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.230\nNow works.\nLet me switch account.\n\n473\n00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:42.740\nAnd instead I select sign out,\nand then I sign out here.\n\n474\n00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.280\nAnd notice it actually gives\nme this warning right here.\n\n475\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.690\nSays removing this account will sign\nyou out from all the other Office\n\n476\n00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:53.000\napplications, remove any customization\nthat you had, and everything else.\n\n477\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.910\nSo do I wanna sign out?\n\n478\n00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.180\nI select yes.\n\n479\n00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.330\nNotice that all that stuff goes away,\n\n480\n00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.340\nbecause I'm no longer connected to\nthat account that I was before.\n\n481\n00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.340\nSo if you do have need where you're\ngonna be working on documents\n\n482\n00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.260\nall the time regardless of\nwhat machine you're on.\n\n483\n00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.790\nOne of the best benefits\nthat you can do and\n\n484\n00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.150\nMicrosoft even recommends it,\nto get all the full benefits of Word and\n\n485\n00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.540\nmake sure you sign into that machine and\nthat will keep you connected as well.\n\n486\n00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.660\nSo that's one of the options that you want\nto make sure that you do pay attention\n\n487\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.660\nto when you're also doing that.\n\n488\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.690\nSo use that as your advantage.\n\n489\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:30.220\nEspecially if you do have access to\nthat Office account to be able to do so.\n\n490\n00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.710\nThe other one that we also want to\ntake a look at here just briefly,\n\n491\n00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:38.830\nis the ability to get help fairly easily.\n\n492\n00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.380\nNow I just went ahead and\nclicked on the file.\n\n493\n00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.610\nAnd then over here,\nright on that title bar again,\n\n494\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.440\nyou'll notice that there's\nactually a little question mark.\n\n495\n00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.860\nAnd also it gives you a screen tip and\nit says,\n\n496\n00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.820\nyou can click here for help or\nthe F1 key on your keyboard.\n\n497\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.340\nAnd what that does is it connects\nyou to Microsoft Office Online.\n\n498\n00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.980\nAnd you can see here, Word 2016 Help.\n\n499\n00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.910\nIf I wanted to be able to sign in, let's\nsay for an example, it's not looking for\n\n500\n00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.410\na file right here on my computer,\nwhich is the way that we used to have it.\n\n501\n00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.300\nIt actually connects me all the way\nover to Microsoft Office Online.\n\n502\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.940\nAnd notice it gives me this full featured\nhelp that now we can actually use and\n\n503\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.700\nbe able to say,\nhey I need to be able to switch accounts.\n\n504\n00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.480\nI need to be able to\nsign out of this account.\n\n505\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.780\nI need to be able to do that.\n\n506\n00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.730\nSo, you can always have extra\nhelp inside of Microsoft Office\n\n507\n00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.270\neven when you're not sure.\n\n508\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.830\nSo on your first day, let's say,\n\n509\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.690\nhey, you need to create this, this and\nthis, well go ahead and take a look and\n\n510\n00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.620\nuse some of the help features that you\nalso see available right there as well.\n\n511\n00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:46.820\nThe last one that I wanna talk about here\nright before our time ends up running out\n\n512\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.680\nIs gonna be options.\n\n513\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.200\nSo let me get back to what\nwe're used to seeing here, and\n\n514\n00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.750\nwe're not gonna go over every option, but\nI want you to at least see a few of them.\n\n515\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.730\nThere's a lot of customization that goes\non with Microsoft Office very easily.\n\n516\n00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.690\nAnd so if I go ahead and\nclick on File, and\n\n517\n00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:07.510\nthen in this list down here,\nunder Options, It's right here.\n\n518\n00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.180\nThe Word options that we\nactually are going to see.\n\n519\n00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.840\nNow, throughout this entire series,\n\n520\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.610\nwe'll be coming back here\nto change multiple options.\n\n521\n00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.200\nRight at the very beginning,\n\n522\n00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.550\nthis is how you can set up Word to\nwork the way that you want it to.\n\n523\n00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.220\nNotice, it gives you, like,\ninterface options right here.\n\n524\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:23.740\nRight?\n\n525\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.250\nThe ability to show upon many\ntool bars that actually pop up.\n\n526\n00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.790\nLive preview, I switched the font to,\nyou know, to a different font.\n\n527\n00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.950\nI want to see how it looked without\nhaving to do everything right then.\n\n528\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.730\nIt actually shows me all that.\n\n529\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.710\nAlso, of course, every file, then,\nhas whose actually working on it,\n\n530\n00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:45.170\nincluding initials, themes that you want,\nstart up options right here,\n\n531\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.640\nchoose extensions that you\nwant Word to open by default.\n\n532\n00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.710\nIf you do have different dockets\nyou go look, I wanna make sure that\n\n533\n00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:57.040\nWord launches it and it's right here, and\nthat really leads you into Word, not Word,\n\n534\n00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.890\nWindows itself to say hey, here's what\nthe default programs are going to be.\n\n535\n00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:06.590\nAlso, of course, show the start\nscreen when this menu starts.\n\n536\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.930\nYou name it.\nYou can actually do so\n\n537\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.370\nmany different things.\n\n538\n00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.780\nBut under these two first\noptions right here.\n\n539\n00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.420\nReally this first one is what\nwe just want to take a look at.\n\n540\n00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.620\nAnd we do need to customize\nthe way that we believe that our\n\n541\n00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.890\nuser interface is going on, is going\nto be working for us a little bit.\n\n542\n00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.190\nAnd that will help us to feel a little bit\nmore confident that we know how to get\n\n543\n00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.680\naccess to things.\n\n544\n00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.160\nSo if you want to get started with Word,\npretty good but we still have a lot to do.\n\n545\n00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.830\n>> We do.\n\n546\n00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.260\nI tell you what there's a lot of\ngreat information there Ronnie.\n\n547\n00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.290\nI feel like I could at least get\nWord launched and start to find my\n\n548\n00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.640\nway around and that's a very important\npart of being successful using Word.\n\n549\n00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.000\nI know you got a lot more\ncontent coming our way for us.\n\n550\n00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.950\nMore things you want to teach\nus about the interface and\n\n551\n00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.180\nof course diving in and\nworking with content.\n\n552\n00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.430\nCreating new Word documents.\n\n553\n00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.910\nBut tha's gonna have to wait, cuz we are\nout of time for this particular episode.\n\n554\n00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.780\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n555\n00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.740\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n556\n00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.096\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n557\n00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:07.020\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
