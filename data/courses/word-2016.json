here at IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:17.057\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n5\n00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:20.336\ntoday we're gonna be looking\nat Microsoft Office Word 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:24.348\nAnd I've got with me my good friend\nRonnie Wong, and he's gonna help us out,\n\n7\n00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:26.890\nbecause I've got a problem, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.470\nI got a new job, and I'm going to\nbe helping out this writer, and\n\n9\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.710\nhe expects me to be able to use Microsoft\nOffice Word right out of the box,\n\n10\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.640\nand I'm a little new at this stuff,\nso I'm hoping you can give us a hand.\n\n11\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.570\n>> We surely can.\n\n12\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.490\nWe can actually make sure that you\nunderstand that when you are beginning to\n\n13\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.920\nwork with a Word processor, one of the\nthings that you have to be familiar with,\n\n14\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.790\nof course, is that ability to\njump right in and get started.\n\n15\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.050\nThe problem is Word is actually a fairly\nlarge product and that means what you and\n\n16\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.880\nI have to do is feel\ncomfortable in its environment.\n\n17\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.340\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to take a look around Word.\n\n18\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.490\nI'm going to show you how to get\nstarted by launching a program.\n\n19\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.809\nAnd then explore the interface as well.\n\n20\n00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.240\nSo let me show you what I'm\ntalking about right here.\n\n21\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.725\nSo let's say that what happens is I'm on\nmy office machine which is gonna be this,\n\n22\n00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:15.080\nWindows 10 machine that I'm working on and\nalready installed them is gonna be\n\n23\n00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.030\nMicrosoft Office itself and we're gonna be\nprimarily dealing with Word itself, right?\n\n24\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.530\nWhich is our Word Processor.\n\n25\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.795\nNow if I go ahead and say hey,\nI need to get started with Word,\n\n26\n00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:30.210\none of the very simple things that we\nhave to do is just simply get it started.\n\n27\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.790\nNow most of us are fairly familiar with\nworking with a computer a lot of times,\n\n28\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.630\nand all that we have to do is actually\ngo and find the application itself.\n\n29\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.830\nSo here in Windows 10, I'm gonna\nclick on the Start button, and I'm\n\n30\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.480\ngonna go to All Apps and under all apps,\nit should be listed in alphabetical order.\n\n31\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.880\nSo if I go ahead and\nselect this and I scroll down,\n\n32\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.690\nI'm scrolling down to the Ws,\nand notice Word here.\n\n33\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.240\nSo once it's installed, we should see that\nit also adds in, well, links like this\n\n34\n00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.380\nright into the menu itself, and that way,\nwe can go ahead and get started.\n\n35\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.830\nAnd all I have to do is launch that and\nthere it is.\n\n36\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.300\nWe actually do have Word launched up, and\n\n37\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.930\nnow we are actually ready\nto get started here.\n\n38\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.250\nNow the problem that we have is fairly\nsimple, that that's not the only way for\n\n39\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.350\nus to get started even though this\nis one of the very simple ways.\n\n40\n00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.210\nAnd we're gonna come back to this in a few\nmoments because notice that it doesn't\n\n41\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.502\nlaunch you right away into an old\nWord processor just like what you and\n\n42\n00:02:23.502 --> 00:02:24.270\nI would think.\n\n43\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.710\n>> I was gonna say,\nwhere's my blank document and\n\n44\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.290\nwhy can't I start typing, Ronnie?\n\n45\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.062\n>> Yeah well you can.\n\n46\n00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:30.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But what Word wants to do,\n\n47\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.410\nespecially in Word 2016,\nis it wants to give you multiple different\n\n48\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.600\noptions to be able to\nactually come up with.\n\n49\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.380\nSo you don't have to always\nstart with a blank document.\n\n50\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.850\nNow notice that you can.\n\n51\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.770\nHere's a blank document right here.\n\n52\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.370\nAnd then there's actually\nother what we call templates.\n\n53\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.790\nBut for right now, right?\n\n54\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.570\nJust starting it up is one of the very\nsimple features that we have to be able to\n\n55\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.260\ndo and just get it launched.\n\n56\n00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.480\nYou'll also notice that over\nhere on the right hand side,\n\n57\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.110\nif you've actually already worked with\na bunch of documents, all those documents\n\n58\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.210\nthat you've worked with in Word will\nalso show up in this recent list.\n\n59\n00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.670\nAnd even older lists.\n\n60\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.730\nAnd then you can also open up\nother documents down here.\n\n61\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.420\nNow, even though that might be\nthe way that you actually launch it up\n\n62\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.598\nthe very first time,\n\n63\n00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:13.550\nit's probably not gonna be always\nthe way that you launch it up as well.\n\n64\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.390\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n65\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.926\nSo, if I go ahead and close out of Word\nagain, well, now I have my screen and\n\n66\n00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:21.330\nit's empty.\n\n67\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.770\nAnd most of us are actually used to\nworking with what we call shortcuts\n\n68\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.000\ninstead, and we can also just go ahead and\nsay I want Word to be there.\n\n69\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.830\nIf that's gonna be the primary document\nthat you're working with since\n\n70\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.210\nyou're working with a copy\neditor of some sort, and\n\n71\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.240\nyou go, hey, I need to be able\nto get access to that faster,\n\n72\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.480\nwell the way I showed you took two or\nthree clicks before we ever got there.\n\n73\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.440\nOne of the things we can do right away\nthough, is actually create of course\n\n74\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.390\nshortcuts to help us out, and so\nlet me show you how to also do that and\n\n75\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.270\nthat will get you access to Word\na little bit faster instead.\n\n76\n00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.230\nSo the first time and you're like, man,\nI dont wanna have to keep going to\n\n77\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.570\nthe start and to all apps and\ndown to the Ws and launching Word.\n\n78\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.640\nWell, you only have to do\nit a couple of times and\n\n79\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.240\nyou'll actually be able to do this.\n\n80\n00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.060\nSo what we're gonna do here, is we're\ngonna put an icon down here on the taskbar\n\n81\n00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.340\nso that you can launch Word\nup directly from the taskbar.\n\n82\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.860\nNow Windows 10 really loves this.\n\n83\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.870\nThis is one of the default features that\nit gives you directly from that Word icon.\n\n84\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.720\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n85\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.440\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick on the Windows button, and\n\n86\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.760\nthen I go to All Apps and\nI scroll down to the Ws again.\n\n87\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.940\nWell if I right click on Word 2016,\nnotice that it gives me several options.\n\n88\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.850\nI can pin it to my start\nmenu which is actually\n\n89\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.570\njust the tiles that you see over here.\n\n90\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.720\nI can also pin it to the taskbar.\n\n91\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.372\nSo if I go ahead and click Pin to Taskbar,\n\n92\n00:04:43.372 --> 00:04:46.882\nnotice that puts the icon\nright here on the taskbar and\n\n93\n00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:52.280\nany time that I launch up my Windows 10\nmachine, I have access to it right there.\n\n94\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.468\nThat might be one of the ways that you\nlike because it's always there, it's not\n\n95\n00:04:56.468 --> 00:05:00.719\nactually in the way and you actually have\nit available right there at the bottom of\n\n96\n00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.559\nyour screen, or wherever you choose\nto have your task bar on the screen.\n\n97\n00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:08.588\nAnd of course, if you like using\nthe idea of this start menu,\n\n98\n00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:10.170\nyou also have this too.\n\n99\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.400\nIf you're actually in other versions\nof Word, like Windows 8.1, and\n\n100\n00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.210\nyou have that start screen and\nyou would do the same thing.\n\n101\n00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.924\nLet me show you here All Programs, or\nall apps and then if I right click and\n\n102\n00:05:21.924 --> 00:05:24.125\nnotice it says Pin to Start.\n\n103\n00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:24.920\nWhen you're in Windows 8.1 and\n\n104\n00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.780\npinned it to that Start menu which will\nactually just be full screen and what we\n\n105\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.070\nsee right here I can also pin it to the\nStart menu and I can launch it from here.\n\n106\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.540\nSo any of those ways that\nwe've just showed you\n\n107\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.500\nis actually a way that we can get\nstarted in just launching up Word.\n\n108\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.310\nNow usually the one thing\nthat most people want is\n\n109\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.360\nthat ability to pin it\nright to the desktop.\n\n110\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.980\n>> Yeah, that's what I always look for\nin my favorite programs.\n\n111\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.610\nI'm old school.\n\n112\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.730\nI want it to be there on the desktop, and\nwhen my boss comes to me and says, hey,\n\n113\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.520\nI want you to work on this document\nI need to get to it quick.\n\n114\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.358\nCan I put it there?\n\n115\n00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.230\n>> You absolutely can put it\nright on your desktop but\n\n116\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.440\nthis one's a little bit more difficult.\n\n117\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.210\nAnd it's not difficult\nbecause you can't do it.\n\n118\n00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.980\nIt's just difficult because what\nthey want you to do in the more\n\n119\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.840\nmodern Windows interfaces here is either\nuse that task bar, to use that start menu.\n\n120\n00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.010\nSo they don't like the idea of 60 or\n70 desktop icons on your desktop.\n\n121\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.950\nBut can you do it?\n\n122\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.060\nYou absolutely can.\n\n123\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.370\nAnd everybody does it in different ways,\nbut let me show you the way that\n\n124\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.550\nI think is actually going to be the\neasiest way for you to be able to do this.\n\n125\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.460\nSo if I go ahead and click back on\nthe Windows button and on All Apps.\n\n126\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.660\nAnd then if I scroll back\ndown to that Word, here.\n\n127\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.030\nI'm gonna right click and\nnotice that we don't have that option.\n\n128\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.800\nIt doesn't say send to the desktop\nwhich is what we would expect to see.\n\n129\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.580\nBut what I can do is select\nopen file location and\n\n130\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.270\nthat will automatically open up that\nfolder that the program's listed in.\n\n131\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.470\nAnd that's right here.\n\n132\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.930\nI can right-click, and\nthen select Send To, and Desktop.\n\n133\n00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.380\nAnd that makes it much easier.\n\n134\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.440\nIf you're actually on the first day of\nthat job, and it says hey, we need to be\n\n135\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.640\nable to make sure that you can get access\nto it and get working with it right away.\n\n136\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.870\nAnd now you actually know that\nyou can pin it to the desktop,\n\n137\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.616\nyou can pin it to the taskbar,\nyou can go to the start menu as well, and\n\n138\n00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:21.730\nof course you can actually find\nit inside of the all apps.\n\n139\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.370\n>> All right, Ronnie, so\nwe've got several ways we can launch Word.\n\n140\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.200\nI can pin it on my taskbar, I can pin it\non my start screen, my start menu, and\n\n141\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.610\nof course, if we're old school like me,\n\n142\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.810\nI can still put it on my desktop although\nthey make it a little more difficult.\n\n143\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.260\nI got to go find that executable and\nmake the shortcut from there.\n\n144\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.970\nBut what if somebody sends me a document,\ndo I have to go and open up Word and\n\n145\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.390\nthen go and browse and find this document?\n\n146\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.850\n>> Well no,\nyou really don't have to do that at all.\n\n147\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.136\nThe good thing is Word still works\nlike it always did in the past.\n\n148\n00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:52.376\nIf you go, well Ronnie I've never used\nit in the past, most of us have actually\n\n149\n00:07:52.376 --> 00:07:56.425\nreceived the file exactly like what\nMike said, and instead of going to find\n\n150\n00:07:56.425 --> 00:08:00.115\nthe application or even the shortcut\non our desktop or our task bar.\n\n151\n00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:02.574\nWe just simply double\nclick on the file and\n\n152\n00:08:02.574 --> 00:08:06.310\nthat will also be a way that we\ncan use a shortcut to launch that.\n\n153\n00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.951\nAnd that's probably by\nfar the most popular way,\n\n154\n00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:09.170\nat least that's the way that I do it.\n\n155\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.800\nEvery time that somebody sends\nme a file I don't go and\n\n156\n00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.280\nfind the actually link, what I do is\nI simply go ahead and use that file,\n\n157\n00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.080\nlet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n158\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.290\nSo remember if you are actually unfamiliar\nwith that, when you do receive a file and\n\n159\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.660\nI've got several of them will be working\nwith here I need to go into this folder.\n\n160\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.760\nAnd inside of my exercise files here,\nI'm just gonna bring up one of these.\n\n161\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.880\nAnd notice that I have this little\nicon here that is a Word icon.\n\n162\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.820\nAnd I simply double click on it and\nnotice that Word launches again.\n\n163\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.060\nAnd so\n\n164\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.730\nit's one of those unusual things about\nMicrosoft Word that they've always done.\n\n165\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.065\nAnd some of them they've also kept in\n2016 is death by a thousand paper cuts.\n\n166\n00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:48.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Learning how to do the same thing in so\n\n167\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.970\nmany different ways but\nthis just makes you more efficient,\n\n168\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.820\nmakes you actually be able to work\nwith that document much more quicker.\n\n169\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.840\nSo even if you go,\nno I don't like those desktop icons,\n\n170\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.630\nnotice that you can also do this,\nbut remember, having\n\n171\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.600\nthose icons there especially if you're\nfamiliar with working from desktop icons.\n\n172\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.170\nProbably one of the greatest\nthings that you can do.\n\n173\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.720\nIf you like the task bar down here and\n\n174\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.640\nhaving all those features down there,\nworks great that way as well, and\n\n175\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.240\nof course,\nstraight from the Start menu itself.\n\n176\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.575\nAll those are just features that really\ncan help you feel confident that, hey, I\n\n177\n00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:25.065\nknow that I can get this product launched,\nand then we can actually begin to use it.\n\n178\n00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.317\nBut even though we've\nnow opened up a desktop,\n\n179\n00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:30.375\nnotice the difference though in\nwhat we've done here, right?\n\n180\n00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:34.685\nBy going directly through that link,\nfrom that file,\n\n181\n00:09:34.685 --> 00:09:39.002\nit automatically opened it\nup in this mode right here.\n\n182\n00:09:39.002 --> 00:09:42.748\nWhere now we're actually more comfortable\nbecause this is what you know,\n\n183\n00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:46.317\nwe're fairly used to working with if\nwe've actually worked on any Word\n\n184\n00:09:46.317 --> 00:09:47.332\nprocesses before.\n\n185\n00:09:47.332 --> 00:09:51.321\nWhich is the document open and ready for\nediting or ready for your browsing when\n\n186\n00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:54.707\nyou need to on all of the other\nones that we've actually done here,\n\n187\n00:09:54.707 --> 00:09:58.010\nlet me close that out and\nmake a little bit more streamline.\n\n188\n00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.930\nWhen I open it up,\nnotice it launches me to the default.\n\n189\n00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.450\nIn other words we haven't selected\nwhat we're focusing in on and so\n\n190\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.390\ninstead it gives me multiple options.\n\n191\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.390\nIt gives me the option to open that\ndocument up over here from the side or\n\n192\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.770\nto create one that is blank, or to use\nall these different template options so\n\n193\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.190\nI can get started somehow.\n\n194\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:22.120\nSo depending on your need is how you're\ngonna actually choose to open that up.\n\n195\n00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.270\nAnd then depending on your comfort level\nthat's when you might choose to create\n\n196\n00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.290\nthose different shortcuts\nto feel more confident in\n\n197\n00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.110\ndoing what you need to do with Word.\n\n198\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.102\nThat's really one of the best ways\nthat you can get started and go,\n\n199\n00:10:33.102 --> 00:10:36.800\nlook I know I can launch it, I know\ndifferent ways that this can come about.\n\n200\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.590\nAnd now we really do, we need to now\nget familiar with the product itself.\n\n201\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.450\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n202\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.398\nAll right, now Ronnie, the other thing\nI've gotta worry about because I've dealt\n\n203\n00:10:45.398 --> 00:10:48.565\nwith past versions of Office,\nand I know 2016 is very a stable,\n\n204\n00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.470\nit's got all these great new features.\n\n205\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.520\nBut occasionally things go wrong, right?\n\n206\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.770\nWe get a file that gets corrupted on my\nhard drive, or I accidentally delete one\n\n207\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.930\nof those system files that I\nshouldn't have been messing with.\n\n208\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.200\nAnd all of a sudden Word won't launch.\n\n209\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.210\nNow what do I do?\n\n210\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.990\n>> Yeah, there's a couple of\ndifferent things that you can try but\n\n211\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.420\nthe nice thing is that with Word 2016,\nif something like that happens.\n\n212\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.271\nWord itself tries to repair it.\n\n213\n00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.873\nIt really does which is neat.\n\n214\n00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:15.636\n>> Self repair, I like that.\n\n215\n00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:18.590\n>> Yeah, we call it the idea\nof self healing, right?\n\n216\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.042\nSo when that ends up happening and\nWord says, look I'm not gonna launch,\n\n217\n00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:25.070\nit automatically can launch itself\ninto what we call safe mode.\n\n218\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.770\nIt's called the automatic safe mode.\n\n219\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.740\nAnd that means that Word will detect\nif there's something going wrong.\n\n220\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.028\nAnd instead of you trying to figure out\nand you know, kind of pull your hair out,\n\n221\n00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:38.680\ntrying to figure out what's going on,\nit can launch in a safe mode.\n\n222\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.030\nAnd when it does so, it's trying\nto indicate to you that something\n\n223\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.710\ndid go seriously wrong\nhere with Word itself.\n\n224\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.776\nNow you don't know if it\nactually is with Word or not.\n\n225\n00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:51.570\nBut if it actually launches it\nby itself next time you go and\n\n226\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.860\nopen a document, you're probably pretty\nmuch guaranteed that there is something\n\n227\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.690\nthat needs to be done.\n\n228\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.808\nAnd if Word is able to repair it, it will.\n\n229\n00:11:59.808 --> 00:12:02.748\nIf its not able to repair it,\nwell then you might have to run\n\n230\n00:12:02.748 --> 00:12:06.010\nwhat we call the repair which we\nwill get to a little bit later on.\n\n231\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.016\nBut overall though, it can do that\nautomatically, but what if you're\n\n232\n00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:14.221\nnot sure, what if you're not sure though\nif word is actually the problem or\n\n233\n00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:16.980\nis it that document that is the problem.\n\n234\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.660\nWell, the mode is actually a little\nbit different, so let me go ahead and\n\n235\n00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.650\njust show you kinda the contrast\nin what you'll end up seeing here.\n\n236\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.750\nI'm gonna bring up that doc,\nthat memorandum, that we've just had.\n\n237\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:33.780\nAnd I'm simply gonna launch it this way so\nI know I get access to it right away.\n\n238\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.990\nAnd when we take a look and\n\n239\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.210\nwe see this here,\nyou'll notice that it actually looks nice.\n\n240\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.797\nEverything is nice and bright, and\nhighlighted, and everything is good,\n\n241\n00:12:42.797 --> 00:12:47.168\nand so when you take a look you have\naccess to all of these tools that you see\n\n242\n00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:48.112\nhighlighted.\n\n243\n00:12:48.112 --> 00:12:50.689\nBut notice over here, you have access\nto some of these tools that aren't\n\n244\n00:12:50.689 --> 00:12:53.410\nhighlighted and that means I can click\nover here and it's not going to work.\n\n245\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.200\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nRonnie, why do I care?\n\n246\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.500\nYou care because it can indicate also\nwhat mode that you're in as well.\n\n247\n00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.330\nSo using this document\nright here I'm showing you\n\n248\n00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.050\nthat you can get access to all this.\n\n249\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:10.110\nBut you can also manually\nlaunch Word in safe mode.\n\n250\n00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.470\nNow, depending on what version of Word or\nwhat version of Office you're in,\n\n251\n00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.210\nit really doesn't matter where\nyou can actually do this.\n\n252\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.190\nSo for example here, in Windows 10 I can\n\n253\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:26.680\nsimply type in the executable for\nWord, which is winword.\n\n254\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.690\nAnd then I can do a space and\na forward slash safe.\n\n255\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.912\nNow if you're in let's say WIndows 7, you\nmight have to go to Start and then Run.\n\n256\n00:13:35.912 --> 00:13:40.584\nNow you know, you can type that or\neven directly on that search programs and\n\n257\n00:13:40.584 --> 00:13:44.976\nfiles line, you can type it in there and\nit will also do the same thing.\n\n258\n00:13:44.976 --> 00:13:48.872\nNow, let me go ahead and launch this right\naway and now, when you take a look at it,\n\n259\n00:13:48.872 --> 00:13:52.430\nyou should be able to see, now right here,\nlet me go ahead and accept that,\n\n260\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.587\nthis doesn't matter.\n\n261\n00:13:53.587 --> 00:13:55.980\nIt says Word in safe mode.\n\n262\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.010\nAnd now when you take a look,\neven though I have a document pulled up\n\n263\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.600\nyou can see that you really don't\nhave access to much right away.\n\n264\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.200\nSo if I try to open a recent document,\n\n265\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.780\nnotice it doesn't give me that ability to\nopen up a recent document very easily.\n\n266\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.545\nFor us to be able to do that\nI can pick another document.\n\n267\n00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:16.860\nBut it actually does launch\nWord into a very limited mode\n\n268\n00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.660\ntrying to actually make sure that what\nwe find out is does Word itself launch.\n\n269\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.000\nSo, if all of the sudden you\nhave a file that's opening and\n\n270\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.830\nthen closing right away,\nwhat this actually lets you know\n\n271\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.660\nif there's something really wrong with\nthe programming inside of Word or not.\n\n272\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.930\nIn this mode, you can't actually\nhave any templates that are saved.\n\n273\n00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.910\nToolbars and command bars, they're not\ngonna actually be available very easily.\n\n274\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.630\nAutocorrect, you name it, a bunch of\nfeatures that you might actually see\n\n275\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.490\nare not gonna be available to you.\n\n276\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.430\nAnd it won't get out of safe mode.\n\n277\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.240\nIn other words, if you now launch and\nyou close it back down.\n\n278\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.760\nAnd you try and launch it again,\nand it goes back in the safe mode.\n\n279\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.320\nThen you know that there's probably\nsomething very seriously wrong with Word.\n\n280\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.440\nSo you can see it in two\ndifferent ways here.\n\n281\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.260\nYou open up a file and\nautomatically launches it in safe mode.\n\n282\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.952\nYour pretty much gonna find out that, hey\nsomething else is wrong, close it down,\n\n283\n00:15:04.952 --> 00:15:07.882\ntry and launch it again,\nit'll automatically launches again.\n\n284\n00:15:07.882 --> 00:15:11.749\nYou'll probably toast it up, which means\nyou have to do a repair, or if you try and\n\n285\n00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:15.615\nmanually do it and then you close it out,\nand open it again, still launches in safe\n\n286\n00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:20.040\nmode, that's probably a good indication\nthat there's a problem with Word itself.\n\n287\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.227\nSo this is something that you may see,\nyou may encounter, you might go,\n\n288\n00:15:23.227 --> 00:15:24.387\nI didn't pick safe mode.\n\n289\n00:15:24.387 --> 00:15:27.392\nWell, notice that you can if you\nchoose to, but it's really for\n\n290\n00:15:27.392 --> 00:15:31.178\ntroubleshooting and it's something you\nmight end up seeing especially when you\n\n291\n00:15:31.178 --> 00:15:32.920\nbring an older documents into Word.\n\n292\n00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.030\nEvery once in awhile there's just\nsome glitchiness that happens, and\n\n293\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.420\nit may be the document itself,\nor it may be Word.\n\n294\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.500\nBut you're able to launch it here,\nit's usually saying,\n\n295\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.470\nhey, I've turned off everything else but\njust launching Word.\n\n296\n00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.533\nNow let's see you know,\nnow that you know that Word can launch,\n\n297\n00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:50.020\npick a document and\nsee if you can launch with it.\n\n298\n00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.405\nIf it doesn't give you anything but\nsafe mode, then yep.\n\n299\n00:15:52.405 --> 00:15:54.556\nProblematic with Word itself, probably.\n\n300\n00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:57.793\nAnd reinstall or repair, and\nyou're fine, and ready to go.\n\n301\n00:15:57.793 --> 00:15:59.440\n>> So it sounds a lot like safe mode.\n\n302\n00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.971\nFor my computer,\nwhen I've had trouble with my PC,\n\n303\n00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:05.840\nyou launch it up in this very minimalistic\nmode without all the extra features.\n\n304\n00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.510\nTry to cut all the other stuff out and\nget back to the basics and\n\n305\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.600\njust see if that underlying, in this case,\napplication can even launch,\n\n306\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.390\nto try to troubleshoot,\ntry to figure out where that problem lies.\n\n307\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.890\nAll right, well, Ronnie, let's say,\nWord's okay, I can launch it up just fine.\n\n308\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.610\nBut once I launch it, I mean there\nis a lot of stuff staring at me,\n\n309\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.070\njust as you were hovering over those\ndifferent bars across the top.\n\n310\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.360\nI saw all kinds of icons and\n\n311\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.040\noptions and it seems like navigation\nis gonna be my next big challenge.\n\n312\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.130\nI've got the application open, but\nnow I need to be able to get around,\n\n313\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.070\nwork my way around the application.\n\n314\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.720\n>> You really do.\n\n315\n00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.420\nOne of the best things that you\ncould do is become familiar\n\n316\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.700\nwith the way that the application\nactually does work and\n\n317\n00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.006\nactually just be familiar\nwith where things are.\n\n318\n00:16:49.006 --> 00:16:52.860\nRemember that 50% of just about\neverything that you do right,\n\n319\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.970\nis figuring out just\nwhere stuff is located.\n\n320\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.440\nIt takes so much time when you go I\nknow I can do that but where is it?\n\n321\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.270\nWhere do I actually run that from?\n\n322\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.790\nOr how do I get to that?\n\n323\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.050\nAnd that takes so much time, and\nthen once you click it and you're like,\n\n324\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.510\nwhy isn't it that easy?\n\n325\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.720\nIt always is, but the way that you do\nthat, of course, is by using it daily.\n\n326\n00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.580\nBut what we wanna show you here is\njust some of the different features\n\n327\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.330\nthat you actually will encounter\nwhen you do launch Word and\n\n328\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.390\nsome of that you should be familiar with\nif you're really trying to make sure that\n\n329\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.550\nyou get started on that very first day.\n\n330\n00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.900\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n331\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.980\nI went in and launched the Memorandum\nof Understanding for Services and\n\n332\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.160\nwe want you to just be familiar\nwith what we're seeing right here,\n\n333\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.050\nwhich is what we called the Interface,\nright?\n\n334\n00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.290\nThis is how you and\nI interact with the program itself, and\n\n335\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.410\nso when we picked a document,\n\n336\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.320\nwhen we actually launch it up, you need\nto be familiar with just about everything\n\n337\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.420\nthat you see right in front of you is\nwhat we're really focusing in on here.\n\n338\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.640\nSo for us to be able to do that,\n\n339\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.990\nlet's start up here at the very top\nthat controls the entire application.\n\n340\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.410\nUp here,\nthis is what we call our title bar, right?\n\n341\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.700\nRight up here at the top, it normally has\na name of the file that you're working in,\n\n342\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.420\nand it even showed you some\nextra information such as what\n\n343\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.230\nprogram that you're working in as\nwell as what mode that we're in.\n\n344\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.000\nNow, the mode is something we wanted\nto discuss a little bit later on, but\n\n345\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.690\nwhen you see the term Compatibility Mode,\nit let you know that this document\n\n346\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.420\ncame from a previous version of Word for\nright now.\n\n347\n00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.532\nAnd what it's trying to do is maintain\nthat compatibility, that if I save it in\n\n348\n00:18:23.532 --> 00:18:28.370\nOffice 2016, you can also open it\nup in a previous edition of Office.\n\n349\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.250\nNow if I don't want that,\n\n350\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.020\nI can actually simply override that and\nwe'll see that a little bit later on.\n\n351\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.680\nBut that's just some of the stuff that\nyou can see right here at the top.\n\n352\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.210\nAlso controlling the entire\napplication of course,\n\n353\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.640\nare these buttons that\nwe see on either corner.\n\n354\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.960\nNotice that it gives me this option up\nhere at the very upper left hand corner.\n\n355\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.590\nAnd this is what we call\nthis quick access tool bar.\n\n356\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.810\nThe quick access tool bar is a one click\n\n357\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:59.150\neasy access to a lot of the features that\nyou and I will actually choose to run.\n\n358\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.850\nNow most of the time this is by\nfar the most customizable element\n\n359\n00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.530\nthat we have at the Word screen right\naway and the easiest to customize too.\n\n360\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.000\nSo when you see something like this and\ngo,\n\n361\n00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.550\nyou know, I always use these same\nfive buttons over and over again,\n\n362\n00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.790\ninstead of me trying to look through\neach of these different tabs and figure\n\n363\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.350\nout where they are, you can actually\nuse that quick access toolbar instead.\n\n364\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:25.010\nAnd go ahead and actually have it kind\nof set up here to where it will do so.\n\n365\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.727\nRight now by default, has Save and\n\n366\n00:19:27.727 --> 00:19:32.390\nit also has what we call this Undo and\nalso Redo buttons.\n\n367\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.790\nAnd these two are actually not available\nright now because I've not done anything.\n\n368\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.670\nBut if I come down here and\nI make a change here,\n\n369\n00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.310\nlet me say that I make\na grammatical error and I put,\n\n370\n00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.620\nan A-N, instead of an a, well now notice\nthat these buttons become highlighted for\n\n371\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.520\nus, and then if I want to,\nI can actually remove that fairly simply.\n\n372\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.990\nOver in the other corner of course\ncontrols the entire window itself.\n\n373\n00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.520\nWe have where we can close out\nof the entire application.\n\n374\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.220\nWe can restore it down.\n\n375\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.040\nIn other words,\nI can actually just shrink it down to\n\n376\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.850\njust one of many windows that\nI might be working with.\n\n377\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.360\nNow the point where I can minimize it, and\n\n378\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.840\nessentially park it on my\ntool bar down here, task bar.\n\n379\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.060\nAnd then simply launch it back up.\n\n380\n00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.320\nSo those are fairly easy\nways that we can work\n\n381\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.930\nwith at least the entire window itself,\nand\n\n382\n00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:30.850\nthe other options that you also have is to\nbe able to resize it by using the corners.\n\n383\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.260\nIf you hover your cursor over it, notice\nit turns into a double-headed arrow.\n\n384\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.310\nAnd now I can actually click, and\ndrag, and resize whatever I want to.\n\n385\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.900\nI hover over the side,\nthe same double-headed arrow.\n\n386\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.500\nI can actually stretch it or shrink it.\n\n387\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.000\nAnd of course the same thing\non the top and bottom.\n\n388\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.350\nWe can use all those features available,\nright?\n\n389\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.160\nTo help us to do what we want to.\n\n390\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.670\nThe nice thing about the Office\nis also because it's part of\n\n391\n00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.850\nwhat Microsoft really has worked with.\n\n392\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.850\nNotice that we can actually make this\nsplit the screen in half by parking\n\n393\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.900\nit on one side by using\nthe what's built-in to\n\n394\n00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.210\nthe Windows 10 as well that split screen\nview that we also have available.\n\n395\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.740\nNow on top of all that then, once we\nhave that ready and available to go.\n\n396\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.590\nWe can take a look at, well some of\nthe other features that really involved.\n\n397\n00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.920\nNow editing the document or\nworking with the document.\n\n398\n00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.670\nBut just on the outside of the program\nitself we have all of that\n\n399\n00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.260\nthat's available but there is also one\nother tab that I was about to overlook,\n\n400\n00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.240\nwe're talking about working with Office,\nit's over here where it says File.\n\n401\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.060\nIf I click on file at this point, now,\n\n402\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.090\nthis actually gives me how I\nwork with the program as well.\n\n403\n00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.010\nInfo about the program, notice that\nthere's many different things that I can\n\n404\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.590\ndo here and we'll be going over all these\nin the series on Word 2016, it of course\n\n405\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.680\nleads me back to the very beginning\nwhere I can start a brand new document.\n\n406\n00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.230\nI can open an existing document from right\nhere, I of course can use save, and one\n\n407\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.410\nof the more important features which you\nwould think it would actually be printing.\n\n408\n00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.370\nBut we are living in a day and age in\nwhich printing is becoming less important\n\n409\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:14.340\nthan it was when well, when Mike and I\nfirst started working with Office, itself.\n\n410\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.390\nAnd there's even more features down\nhere as well such as exporting.\n\n411\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.850\nNotice we can create\nin different files and\n\n412\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.340\nthen even closing out\nof documents as well.\n\n413\n00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.320\nYou name it, and there's a.\n\n414\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.200\nI won't say this is not brand-spanking\nnew, but it's pretty close.\n\n415\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.680\nThe ability to share or collaborate\n\n416\n00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.750\non these documents gives us the ability\nto save it some place where both Mike and\n\n417\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.670\nI can gain access to it and\nactually work on that document together.\n\n418\n00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.945\nIn the past,\nnot saying it was totally impossible, but\n\n419\n00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:46.424\nas far as at the same time, it was\npretty difficult to be able to do so.\n\n420\n00:22:46.424 --> 00:22:49.820\nSo here they're even showing that hey,\nthis is part of that integration\n\n421\n00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.970\nbecause they really do want an actually\nintegrating in with things like\n\n422\n00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.550\ncloud services and making sure that we're\nactually able to get access into it.\n\n423\n00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.830\nSo there's a lot that's actually there and\navailable when we talked about\n\n424\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.689\njust making sure that we can get\naround inside of Word itself.\n\n425\n00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.980\nSome other features that we also\nhave is notice there's that\n\n426\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.320\nshare button over here\non the right hand side,\n\n427\n00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.450\nto make it a little bit easier than having\ngoing to the file and find all that stuff.\n\n428\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.200\nBut we have that and then of course if\nyou're logged in to the application,\n\n429\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.930\nthere's a bunch of other features\nwhich we are gonna get to too.\n\n430\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.480\nNow, actually we've got a few minutes and\nlet's go ahead and\n\n431\n00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.060\ntalk about some of those\nextra features for right now.\n\n432\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.191\nNow some of these other features that we\ntalk up may not actually apply to you too\n\n433\n00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:41.194\noften, but a lot of times it is what\nMicrosoft Office really wants you to do.\n\n434\n00:23:41.194 --> 00:23:44.228\nWhen you do invest into,\nwell like Word 2016,\n\n435\n00:23:44.228 --> 00:23:49.100\nmore than likely you might have also\ngotten an investment into Office 365 which\n\n436\n00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.477\nmeans you have access to a stored drive\nsomewhere and for you to have that,\n\n437\n00:23:53.477 --> 00:23:57.078\nthat means you can automatically\nsave it up into the Cloud and\n\n438\n00:23:57.078 --> 00:24:01.145\nthen you don't have to have your laptop or\nyour computer anywhere.\n\n439\n00:24:01.145 --> 00:24:03.686\nAll you have to do is being able\nto go to any other machine.\n\n440\n00:24:03.686 --> 00:24:06.810\nGet access to that same account and\nthen you can work with your documents.\n\n441\n00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.760\nYou don't have to worry if\nyou save here or there.\n\n442\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.500\nIf you've actually got everything ready,\nit means that,\n\n443\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.680\nhey everything is actually now able to\nbe saved to your own cloud storage.\n\n444\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.740\nNow, if I go ahead and\nshow you, I go to file and\n\n445\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.980\nnow let me go to new here, I was trying\nto make sure I was doing the right one.\n\n446\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.630\nNotice up here in the upper\nright hand corner.\n\n447\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.190\nAnd actually it's been on every\nscreen that we've taken to look at.\n\n448\n00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.840\nIt has me signed in.\n\n449\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.710\nAnd this is me signed in so\nthat I have access to\n\n450\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.260\nall those benefits I was just talking\nabout especially the Cloud storage.\n\n451\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.590\nAnd if I do that and\n\n452\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.280\nI automatically save this up in that\nCloud, remember what that means.\n\n453\n00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.830\nI can actually go anywhere.\n\n454\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.080\nBut there's actually couple\nof things that you can do.\n\n455\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.150\nIf you bought this for\nyourself, perfectly fine.\n\n456\n00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.080\nThat means you actually\nhave an account there.\n\n457\n00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.140\nBut what if you're at work?\n\n458\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.705\nJust like what we're talking about here.\n\n459\n00:24:55.705 --> 00:24:59.440\nActually created an account for you,\nwell that's a different storage.\n\n460\n00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.600\nSo usually a lot of times,\n\n461\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.808\nthe first time you sign in,\nit's gonna ask you to sign in.\n\n462\n00:25:03.808 --> 00:25:09.020\nBut then once you do so, let's say that\nyou wanna actually get switched over.\n\n463\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.820\nAnd instead of your personal account,\nyou wanna switch it to your work account.\n\n464\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.370\nWell you can simply do that\nby switching the account and\n\n465\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.720\nthen from that way you add in your\nsecond account and then it would change.\n\n466\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.360\nAnd I'll show you the difference here.\n\n467\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.330\nSo currently, let say, let me get back\nhere so that we can see something.\n\n468\n00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.530\nSo we go to this open,\nyou see all this stuff is listed here.\n\n469\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.290\nIf I sign out, if I go and\n\n470\n00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.780\nswitch accounts,\nlet me see if I can actually do that.\n\n471\n00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.960\nLet me try.\n\n472\n00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.230\nNow works.\nLet me switch account.\n\n473\n00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:42.740\nAnd instead I select sign out,\nand then I sign out here.\n\n474\n00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.280\nAnd notice it actually gives\nme this warning right here.\n\n475\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.690\nSays removing this account will sign\nyou out from all the other Office\n\n476\n00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:53.000\napplications, remove any customization\nthat you had, and everything else.\n\n477\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.910\nSo do I wanna sign out?\n\n478\n00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.180\nI select yes.\n\n479\n00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.330\nNotice that all that stuff goes away,\n\n480\n00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.340\nbecause I'm no longer connected to\nthat account that I was before.\n\n481\n00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.340\nSo if you do have need where you're\ngonna be working on documents\n\n482\n00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.260\nall the time regardless of\nwhat machine you're on.\n\n483\n00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.790\nOne of the best benefits\nthat you can do and\n\n484\n00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.150\nMicrosoft even recommends it,\nto get all the full benefits of Word and\n\n485\n00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.540\nmake sure you sign into that machine and\nthat will keep you connected as well.\n\n486\n00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.660\nSo that's one of the options that you want\nto make sure that you do pay attention\n\n487\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.660\nto when you're also doing that.\n\n488\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.690\nSo use that as your advantage.\n\n489\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:30.220\nEspecially if you do have access to\nthat Office account to be able to do so.\n\n490\n00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.710\nThe other one that we also want to\ntake a look at here just briefly,\n\n491\n00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:38.830\nis the ability to get help fairly easily.\n\n492\n00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.380\nNow I just went ahead and\nclicked on the file.\n\n493\n00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.610\nAnd then over here,\nright on that title bar again,\n\n494\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.440\nyou'll notice that there's\nactually a little question mark.\n\n495\n00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.860\nAnd also it gives you a screen tip and\nit says,\n\n496\n00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.820\nyou can click here for help or\nthe F1 key on your keyboard.\n\n497\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.340\nAnd what that does is it connects\nyou to Microsoft Office Online.\n\n498\n00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.980\nAnd you can see here, Word 2016 Help.\n\n499\n00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.910\nIf I wanted to be able to sign in, let's\nsay for an example, it's not looking for\n\n500\n00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.410\na file right here on my computer,\nwhich is the way that we used to have it.\n\n501\n00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.300\nIt actually connects me all the way\nover to Microsoft Office Online.\n\n502\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.940\nAnd notice it gives me this full featured\nhelp that now we can actually use and\n\n503\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.700\nbe able to say,\nhey I need to be able to switch accounts.\n\n504\n00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.480\nI need to be able to\nsign out of this account.\n\n505\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.780\nI need to be able to do that.\n\n506\n00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.730\nSo, you can always have extra\nhelp inside of Microsoft Office\n\n507\n00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.270\neven when you're not sure.\n\n508\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.830\nSo on your first day, let's say,\n\n509\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.690\nhey, you need to create this, this and\nthis, well go ahead and take a look and\n\n510\n00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.620\nuse some of the help features that you\nalso see available right there as well.\n\n511\n00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:46.820\nThe last one that I wanna talk about here\nright before our time ends up running out\n\n512\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.680\nIs gonna be options.\n\n513\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.200\nSo let me get back to what\nwe're used to seeing here, and\n\n514\n00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.750\nwe're not gonna go over every option, but\nI want you to at least see a few of them.\n\n515\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.730\nThere's a lot of customization that goes\non with Microsoft Office very easily.\n\n516\n00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.690\nAnd so if I go ahead and\nclick on File, and\n\n517\n00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:07.510\nthen in this list down here,\nunder Options, It's right here.\n\n518\n00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.180\nThe Word options that we\nactually are going to see.\n\n519\n00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.840\nNow, throughout this entire series,\n\n520\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.610\nwe'll be coming back here\nto change multiple options.\n\n521\n00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.200\nRight at the very beginning,\n\n522\n00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.550\nthis is how you can set up Word to\nwork the way that you want it to.\n\n523\n00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.220\nNotice, it gives you, like,\ninterface options right here.\n\n524\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:23.740\nRight?\n\n525\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.250\nThe ability to show upon many\ntool bars that actually pop up.\n\n526\n00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.790\nLive preview, I switched the font to,\nyou know, to a different font.\n\n527\n00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.950\nI want to see how it looked without\nhaving to do everything right then.\n\n528\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.730\nIt actually shows me all that.\n\n529\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.710\nAlso, of course, every file, then,\nhas whose actually working on it,\n\n530\n00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:45.170\nincluding initials, themes that you want,\nstart up options right here,\n\n531\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.640\nchoose extensions that you\nwant Word to open by default.\n\n532\n00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.710\nIf you do have different dockets\nyou go look, I wanna make sure that\n\n533\n00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:57.040\nWord launches it and it's right here, and\nthat really leads you into Word, not Word,\n\n534\n00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.890\nWindows itself to say hey, here's what\nthe default programs are going to be.\n\n535\n00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:06.590\nAlso, of course, show the start\nscreen when this menu starts.\n\n536\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.930\nYou name it.\nYou can actually do so\n\n537\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.370\nmany different things.\n\n538\n00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.780\nBut under these two first\noptions right here.\n\n539\n00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.420\nReally this first one is what\nwe just want to take a look at.\n\n540\n00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.620\nAnd we do need to customize\nthe way that we believe that our\n\n541\n00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.890\nuser interface is going on, is going\nto be working for us a little bit.\n\n542\n00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.190\nAnd that will help us to feel a little bit\nmore confident that we know how to get\n\n543\n00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.680\naccess to things.\n\n544\n00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.160\nSo if you want to get started with Word,\npretty good but we still have a lot to do.\n\n545\n00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.830\n>> We do.\n\n546\n00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.260\nI tell you what there's a lot of\ngreat information there Ronnie.\n\n547\n00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.290\nI feel like I could at least get\nWord launched and start to find my\n\n548\n00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.640\nway around and that's a very important\npart of being successful using Word.\n\n549\n00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.000\nI know you got a lot more\ncontent coming our way for us.\n\n550\n00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.950\nMore things you want to teach\nus about the interface and\n\n551\n00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.180\nof course diving in and\nworking with content.\n\n552\n00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.430\nCreating new Word documents.\n\n553\n00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.910\nBut tha's gonna have to wait, cuz we are\nout of time for this particular episode.\n\n554\n00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.780\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n555\n00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.740\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n556\n00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.096\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n557\n00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:07.020\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:20.380\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're going to be looking at Word 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.180\nAnd in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.560\nwe're going to be continuing to\nlook at exploring that interface.\n\n6\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.890\nIt's a relatively complex interface\nwhen you first work with it.\n\n7\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.580\nBut Ronnie's here to explain\neverything and make us feel at ease, so\n\n8\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.540\nwe can navigate around and be successful\nwhen we're working with Word.\n\n9\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.940\nSo Ronnie, I know in the previous episode\nwe started playing around with some of\n\n10\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.000\nthe different options, but\nwe've got to lot more to go, right?\n\n11\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.630\n>> We really do.\n\n12\n00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.920\nWe need to make sure that we feel\nconfident in the tools that are available\n\n13\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.140\nto us as we work inside of Word.\n\n14\n00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.520\nUnderstand that a Word processing\nprogram is really kind of\n\n15\n00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.040\nthe typewriter of the 21st century.\n\n16\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.310\nBut it gives us a lot more flexibility and\na lot more options.\n\n17\n00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.830\nRight?\n\n18\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.770\nThe old typewriter we simply\nhad a piece of paper.\n\n19\n00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.970\nWe had an ink ribbon and then we had\nkeys that we actually got to hit.\n\n20\n00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.740\nWe made a mistake, we had to roll that\nthing up, put a little bit of white out on\n\n21\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.150\nit, roll it back down, but\nthe nice thing is in Word 2016,\n\n22\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500\nwe have that ability to do the same thing\nwithout ever having to waste paper,\n\n23\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.190\nwithout ever having to waste ribbons.\n\n24\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.750\nWe can all do it right here from our\ninterface, but the problem that we,\n\n25\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.130\nnot the problem,\nthe other features that we have,\n\n26\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.580\nI shouldn't say there's problems here.\n\n27\n00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.200\nThe features that we have available are so\nmuch more rich and so much more diverse,\n\n28\n00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.700\nit's something that we have to feel\nfairly confident in when we take a look.\n\n29\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.010\nThere are so many things that\nwe can do in Word it's amazing.\n\n30\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.960\n>> So you're telling me that I can\nstart scratching all the liquid paper\n\n31\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.770\noff of my screen?\n\n32\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.550\n>> You can.\n\n33\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.940\nIf you choose to, if nothing else it'd at\nleast help you to see your screen better.\n\n34\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.620\nBut yes, if you're still putting liquid\npaper right there on your screen, yes,\n\n35\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.120\nyou need to update your\ntechnology right here.\n\n36\n00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.964\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You are now in the 21st century.\n\n37\n00:01:52.964 --> 00:01:57.230\nBut now inside of Word, it is complex\nthe way that Mike described it.\n\n38\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.520\nThere are so many single features\nthat are actually in there.\n\n39\n00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.560\nIt's not just oh there's only ten tools\nand you don't have to worry about it.\n\n40\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.060\nThere's hundreds of tools\nin there to help you out.\n\n41\n00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.530\nNow why might you actually be\ndoing something like that?\n\n42\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.690\nWell, because creating a document is\nno longer just about putting ink to\n\n43\n00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.520\npaper anymore.\n\n44\n00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.960\nIt's about making it look\nthe way they want to,\n\n45\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.190\nit's about making sure that we present\nthe idea that we want to present.\n\n46\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.830\nAnd also about being efficient\nabout it as well and\n\n47\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.180\nstoring electronically, you name it, so\nwhat we want to do is we want to get\n\n48\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.610\nfamiliar with what we\nare going to see here.\n\n49\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.930\nSo remember that most of\nthe tools that we're working with,\n\n50\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.640\nright, help us to create the document,\nhelp us to get that document ready for\n\n51\n00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.450\nits ultimate presentation, whether its\nprint, or whether it's a website, whether\n\n52\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.610\nit's whatever we want electronically, we\nwant it to be, Word is there to help us.\n\n53\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.550\nAnd so let's take a look\nhere on the interface and\n\n54\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.290\nwe'll see what we're talking about.\n\n55\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.080\nNow I'm using an example that we used\nbefore, this memorandum of understanding\n\n56\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.300\nand agreement, as just a reference for us\nso that we can get the tools to show up.\n\n57\n00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.180\nNow when we start taking a look here,\nwe used to deal with things that we called\n\n58\n00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.070\nmenus that would drop down and essentially\nhide everything here on the screen.\n\n59\n00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.960\nBut at some point and time Microsoft said,\n\n60\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.050\nlook that's the problem is that sometimes\nwhen you actually have those menus and\n\n61\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.570\nthey drop down you don't see\nwhat you're actually editing.\n\n62\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.300\nThen you forget and\nyou have to kind of let it go and\n\n63\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.960\nyou have to see it again before you do\nthat, instead Microsoft said, look,\n\n64\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.860\nthe better way to do this, of course,\nis in what we call the RIB install.\n\n65\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.829\nAnd that means all of the actual menu\nitems that we would have instead are going\n\n66\n00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.340\nto be pasted horizontally across\nthis screen right here, and\n\n67\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.300\nthat way it doesn't ever drop down.\n\n68\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.720\nNotice that regardless of what I choose,\nit never drops down to cover\n\n69\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.170\nanything inside of my editing\nwindow that I see down here.\n\n70\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.190\nWhat we call the editing canvas if that's\nwhat you want to technically call it here.\n\n71\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.560\nBut it actually all resides\nup there in the same space.\n\n72\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.740\nAnd as I go through here,\n\n73\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.990\nyou'll actually see that there's\na lot of tools that are available.\n\n74\n00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.020\nRight here the very first tab is\nthe default tab that we call the home tab,\n\n75\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.070\nand they do call it the home tab\nbecause it actually does have the tab.\n\n76\n00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.620\nAnd then of course all of the actual\ntools that we have available here\n\n77\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.950\nare actually underneath that\ntab across this ribbon.\n\n78\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.940\nNow when you start seeing this, notice\nthat they are actually subdivided as well.\n\n79\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.020\nYou see these little vertical\nlines every so often, and\n\n80\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.480\nthese are what are technically\ncalled ribbon groups.\n\n81\n00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.590\nNow these groups really do help us by\ntrying to group together things having to\n\n82\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.220\ndeal with specifically let's say,\nwith the clipboard itself, right?\n\n83\n00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.340\nSo notice paste,\nbecause we're actually copying stuff into\n\n84\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.570\nthat special area in our memory called the\nclipboard and then we can actually cut it,\n\n85\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.650\ncopy it, paste it back down,\nformat painter.\n\n86\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.973\nYou'll notice that they tried\nto group logical tools together.\n\n87\n00:04:42.973 --> 00:04:45.640\nSame thing with the font idea, right?\n\n88\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.659\nIf we want to modify or\n\n89\n00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.290\nmanipulate the fonts,\nwe have everything dealing with fonts.\n\n90\n00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.490\nParagraph options, styles here that\nwe can all use to give us a nice,\n\n91\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.610\nconsistent style throughout our document,\nas well as some editing options that\n\n92\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.500\nwe have to be able to find and replace and\nselect the information that we want.\n\n93\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.970\nNow, when we start seeing that,\n\n94\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.300\njust when you think, wow, that's a lot\nof tools, that's not the end of it.\n\n95\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.410\nSo even though a lot of us are actually\nused to now working in this,\n\n96\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.820\nbecause they've actually changed this for\na while now, they still give us the option\n\n97\n00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.360\nthough, to work with it old school\nif you're actually like me and\n\n98\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.530\nyou're used to working\nwith it a different way.\n\n99\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.830\nIt's not that they give you the menus\nback, but what they do give us though\n\n100\n00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.880\nis what we call these little\ndialogue box launchers as well.\n\n101\n00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.440\nAnd we'll actually see these.\n\n102\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.500\nSo these little things that you\nsee in the corner right here.\n\n103\n00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.100\nYou'll see that we have\nthese little launchers, and\n\n104\n00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.480\neach one has a nice screen tip.\n\n105\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.250\nSo for example, I hovered over the one\ncalled clipboard, and when I do,\n\n106\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.930\nif I can actually get it to show up again,\n\n107\n00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.160\nthere it goes,\nit actually gives me a nice screen tip.\n\n108\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.850\nIt says, clipboard,\nsee all the items you've actually copied.\n\n109\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.610\nSo if I click there, notice it brings up\nwhat we call a nice little task pane for\n\n110\n00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.570\nus that we can now work with items that\nend up getting saved here if we need to.\n\n111\n00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.590\nNow that's not the only one.\n\n112\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.980\nNotice that font now gives us this, and\nof course that little icon right there,\n\n113\n00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.060\nthat's called a dialogue box launcher\n\n114\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.810\nbrings up of course a dialogue box for\nus as well.\n\n115\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.640\nAnd now notice that we have all\nthe specific details instead.\n\n116\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.840\nThe font, the styles, the sizes,\neffects that we can have.\n\n117\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.960\nWe can even go to the advanced and\nactually change the scale.\n\n118\n00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.180\nYou name it, this is all stuff that we\nweren't able to do on a typewriter, and\n\n119\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.060\nnow we have access to it\nthrough this one utility.\n\n120\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.780\nAnd even paragraphs too.\n\n121\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.440\nNotice we can change indents and spacing,\n\n122\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.780\nline breaks, and this is all apart\nof the old style of working with it.\n\n123\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.580\nThe new style gives you the same\noptions that we do end up finding\n\n124\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.180\nin those dialogue box launchers, but\n\n125\n00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.270\nsometimes there's even more details\nin those dialogue box launchers.\n\n126\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.290\nEvery single tool, if you're not sure\nwhat it does, you have the ability to\n\n127\n00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.450\nhover over that tool and notice it\ngives you that screen tip as well.\n\n128\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.020\nAnd it let's you know if you\nwant to create a numbered list,\n\n129\n00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.250\nnotice you can select that and\ndo that as well.\n\n130\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.800\nSo there is a lot of different things\nthat you can do to help out here or\n\n131\n00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.800\nthat helps you out in what you\nare actually trying to do.\n\n132\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.410\nSo every time you actually see there's\nlittle drop down menus that of course\n\n133\n00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.540\ngive you more and more details, and\nthere are plenty of dialogue box launchers\n\n134\n00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.640\nthat will give you access to\nthese tools that are available.\n\n135\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.120\nAnd we'll be hitting the majority\nof these tools in this series.\n\n136\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.740\nSo that home is probably the one\nthat you'll deal with most often\n\n137\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.080\nif you're just doing plain\nediting in a document.\n\n138\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.340\nIf I wanted to highlight\nthis first line for\n\n139\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.270\nexample, then give it a highlight color.\n\n140\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.500\nPerfectly fine.\n\n141\n00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.597\nNotice that we can do that and\nthen we simply leave it alone.\n\n142\n00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:54.502\nIf we simply want to remove that,\nvery simple.\n\n143\n00:07:54.502 --> 00:07:56.018\nI should be able to remove that and\n\n144\n00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:59.114\nnotice I don't have to dive into\nany dialogue box launchers at all.\n\n145\n00:07:59.114 --> 00:08:01.910\nBut if I wanted to change up some things,\n\n146\n00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.230\nnotice I can of course\nuse that right away.\n\n147\n00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.470\nSo the Home tab is probably where most of\nus will spend the majority of our time.\n\n148\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.070\nWe just talked about basic editing,\nis what we'll end up seeing.\n\n149\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.040\nBut there's a lot more tools\nthat are available to us\n\n150\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.980\nin these different things\nthat we see right here.\n\n151\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.400\nInsert gives you that ability to add in\ndifferent things into your document that\n\n152\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.290\nyou may not have actually been able to.\n\n153\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.900\nTables, pictures, you name it, shapes.\n\n154\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.440\nIt tells you add in another blank page,\ncreate links,\n\n155\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.590\nheaders and footers, other text boxes and\nobjects that we have available.\n\n156\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.100\nAnd we'll be doing all of that.\n\n157\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.440\nYou can change the overall design,\nthe entire document formatting,\n\n158\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.520\nparagraph spacing, adding in watermarks,\npage borders, you name it.\n\n159\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.144\nThat's just in three tabs, Mike, and\n\n160\n00:08:50.144 --> 00:08:53.968\nthere's still five to go that\nwe haven't talked about.\n\n161\n00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:57.190\nAnd we're just kind of doing a brief\nreview of each one of these options.\n\n162\n00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.730\nBut if you're actually just working,\nthe majority of the times right away, and\n\n163\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.763\nsomebody says hey, you need to change his,\nyou need to change that.\n\n164\n00:09:03.763 --> 00:09:05.250\nRight here,\nthe Home tab is perfectly fine.\n\n165\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.440\nIf they wanted to add a little bit more,\nhey, I want our company logo to be here.\n\n166\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.200\nThis is where you would\nalso be able to go.\n\n167\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.840\nOr I wanna add in what they call a pull\nbox or a pull quote, you name it,\n\n168\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.133\nit's right here.\n\n169\n00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:22.900\nHeaders, and then, of course, you can\nchange the design and the feel as well.\n\n170\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.820\nThere's plenty of them.\n\n171\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.540\n>> Now, Ronnie, I notice when you're\nhovering over some of these things,\n\n172\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.950\nyour document actually looks like it's\nmoving around or changing down there.\n\n173\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:31.700\n>> It really is, and\n\n174\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.110\nthat's the live preview that\nwe're actually starting to see.\n\n175\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.180\nAs things actually end up getting changed\nby accident, cuz I'm just hovering and\n\n176\n00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.600\nclicking on stuff, you will see that\nit automatically changes for you.\n\n177\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.530\nYou don't have to wait to save and\nfigure out what's going on here.\n\n178\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.340\nIt gives you that live preview so\n\n179\n00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.200\nthat you can see what else is\nhappening at the same time.\n\n180\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.900\nSo there are many different\noptions that are, oops,\n\n181\n00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.940\nsee, I clicked on one too many there,\nthat we wanted to be able to do.\n\n182\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:04.820\nLet's say that I take like Nevada here,\nand I choose to make that red.\n\n183\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.641\nOh, that's not good.\n\n184\n00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:08.100\nLet me do the undo here.\n\n185\n00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.391\nWell, maybe.\n\n186\n00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:13.041\nLet me highlight that and\nmake it red, and then,\n\n187\n00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:17.049\nwell notice again just simple\nthings that we can do and\n\n188\n00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:21.520\nhere's something I wanted to\nshow as well in just a moment.\n\n189\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.440\nAnd you'll see it kind of fading out and\nfading in as I hover over it.\n\n190\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.090\nRight there,\neverybody see that little kind of toolbar.\n\n191\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.930\nThat is your mini toolbar as well.\n\n192\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:37.330\nNow this is very important for people who\nare used to working with word processors.\n\n193\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.380\nThe key goal is simple,\nthe more that you have to reach for\n\n194\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.240\na mouse to do anything else,\nyou're removing productivity.\n\n195\n00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.120\nSo the more that you can keep\nyour hands on the keyboard\n\n196\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.340\nwithout me having to go and\n\n197\n00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:53.090\nfind the same location up here, well this\nis what it gives me that ability to do.\n\n198\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.120\nSo a lot of times when\nyou select something and\n\n199\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.980\nyou want to actually be able\nto do something really quick.\n\n200\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.180\nYou get what this little mini\ntoolbar That will allow you to do\n\n201\n00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.820\neverything that is really possible\nright there at that very moment\n\n202\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.610\nto that little piece of text\nthat you have available to you.\n\n203\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.340\nSo that mini toolbar is also floating\nright there, right next to what you're\n\n204\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.230\nactually editing so that you can feel\nconfident that you can get done what you\n\n205\n00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.360\nneed to, especially when you talk\nabout the ideas of editing and\n\n206\n00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.070\nmodifying hjust a little\nbit of data right away.\n\n207\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.280\nNow, the other option that\nyou also have of course,\n\n208\n00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.170\nis that as you hover over some of these\ntools just like, let me bring it up.\n\n209\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.190\nLet's do this one.\n\n210\n00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.310\nSo here I am, I'm on the Home tab.\n\n211\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.406\nInside of this ribbon I go all the way to\nthe end of where the editing group is,\n\n212\n00:11:40.406 --> 00:11:44.822\nif I hover over all of these icons, one of\nthe other things that they want you to do,\n\n213\n00:11:44.822 --> 00:11:49.366\nof course, is notice that it says Find,\nand then in parenthesis it give you, well,\n\n214\n00:11:49.366 --> 00:11:50.208\nlike Ctrl+F.\n\n215\n00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:52.410\nThose are what we call shortcut keys.\n\n216\n00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.810\nNow shortcut keys do end up working for\n\n217\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.190\nyou fairly well in\nthe majority of the times.\n\n218\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.940\nSometimes in the context that I'm\nworking in inside of a virtual machine,\n\n219\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.350\nit may not work that well, but we'll see.\n\n220\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.700\nSo let's see if I can do a Ctrl+F.\n\n221\n00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.940\nHere, let me try it again.\n\n222\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.662\nLet's see if I can do that.\n\n223\n00:12:08.662 --> 00:12:11.387\nYep, Ctrl+F, notice it brings me to this,\n\n224\n00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:16.070\nthis navigation here where it actually\nallows me to search for what I want to.\n\n225\n00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.278\nIt says, Word can find just about\nanything inside of my document and\n\n226\n00:12:19.278 --> 00:12:23.380\nit can even find special things\ncalled Headings, Pages, and Results.\n\n227\n00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.880\nBut there's another one directly\nunderneath, such as Replace here.\n\n228\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.950\nIf I do the Ctrl, oh let me try it again.\n\n229\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.642\nI have to actually find the Ctrl, Ctrl+H,\n\n230\n00:12:32.642 --> 00:12:36.460\nnotice then that brings me to my Find and\nReplace.\n\n231\n00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.020\nSo this is actually a utility that we can\nuse to search through our document and\n\n232\n00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.150\nfind a specific word and\neven replace that if I want to.\n\n233\n00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.490\nSo you do have access to a lot of these\nshortcuts that are actually available to\n\n234\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:54.110\nyou, that you can now use and come with\nthe keyboard combinations that will really\n\n235\n00:12:54.110 --> 00:13:00.070\nhelp you out to be much more efficient in\nwhat you're needing to access as well.\n\n236\n00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.300\nNow some of the other things of course\nas we start to work a little bit more,\n\n237\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.950\nlet me get into the design here for\na moment.\n\n238\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.400\nNotice that we have, well, this option\nright here and as I hover over this\n\n239\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.990\nyou're actually seeing this live preview\nas it slightly changes the text layout,\n\n240\n00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.140\nthe line layout, and some of\nthe other options that are available.\n\n241\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.850\nAnd then when I click on this\n\n242\n00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.490\nyou're now seeing what we call\nsomething like a gallery, right?\n\n243\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:32.290\nGallery of different ways that we\ncan add in the style or this design\n\n244\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:37.780\nthat we're talking about so that we can\nmodify the entire document at one time.\n\n245\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.790\nAnd notice I can do that.\n\n246\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.830\nI can create my own style which we'll be\ndoing in another episode in the future,\n\n247\n00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.030\nand so you have access to these galleries.\n\n248\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.630\nYou have drop downs that will give you\naccess to more galleries that you can see,\n\n249\n00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.400\nchanging even things\nlike your page colors.\n\n250\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.920\nIt gives you access to little tiny\ngalleries that are also available to you,\n\n251\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:07.270\nso you can see what is happening inside\nof your documents fairly easily, okay.\n\n252\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.760\nYeah, so there's a lot, and\nthere's even more, right?\n\n253\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.110\nAs we go on to larger and\n\n254\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.140\nlarger documents that's where some of\nthese other tools really help out.\n\n255\n00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.170\nDesign, of course,\nit helps you to be fairly consistent.\n\n256\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.820\nI've have to merge multiple documents\ntogether where they've actually come from\n\n257\n00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.940\ndifferent people.\n\n258\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.090\nThey all pick different font styles,\ndifferent things, and\n\n259\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.780\nI can actually just simply\nmerge them all together and\n\n260\n00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.410\npick a simple design style and\nmake them more uniform.\n\n261\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:36.450\nLayout, of course, has to do with the page\nsetup and paragraphs and references.\n\n262\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.260\nIf you've ever had to work on a book,\nor actually a document,\n\n263\n00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.260\nor a paper for college, masters,\ndoctorate, whatever you want to,\n\n264\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.780\nthey have a bunch of these tools that are\nalso available for you right here, too.\n\n265\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.240\nNow, I've actually worked on\na book to help somebody edit and\n\n266\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.720\nput things into format and to create\ntable of contents and search citations.\n\n267\n00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.250\nYou name it, it gives you all of those\nabilities without you having to change\n\n268\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.890\na lot of what you already\nknow how to do or\n\n269\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.420\nwhat you don't know how\nto do is pretty much key.\n\n270\n00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.840\nSo, for example, here on the APA,\n\n271\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:14.600\nthe American Psychological Association,\nI think that's the, yeah that's the one.\n\n272\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.895\nYou might not know\nthe formatting of that paper,\n\n273\n00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:19.340\nyou're supposed to submit it\naccording to that style guide.\n\n274\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.670\nWell the good thing is, Word does.\n\n275\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.400\nAnd all you have to do is\nfill in the blanks and\n\n276\n00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.360\nthen actually format everything for you.\n\n277\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.470\nSo very very good at so\nmany different things.\n\n278\n00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.270\nSo you do want to make sure\nthat you take the time\n\n279\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.210\nto take a look at these\noptions that are available.\n\n280\n00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:38.230\n>> It really seems like these ribbons\nexpose a lot of those features that\n\n281\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.980\nI might not have been even aware\nof in the past menu driven system.\n\n282\n00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.940\nIt puts it all right\nthere at my finger tips.\n\n283\n00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.016\n>> Yeah, it's supposed to, right?\n\n284\n00:15:45.016 --> 00:15:49.609\nIt's supposed to keep it right in front of\nyou, so that you don't have to go, well,\n\n285\n00:15:49.609 --> 00:15:54.007\nI wanna take the time to explore that, but\nif I do, then I'm gonna lose my place of\n\n286\n00:15:54.007 --> 00:15:58.116\nwhat I was doing right then By keeping\nit right there on the ribbon, right?\n\n287\n00:15:58.116 --> 00:16:02.919\nIt makes it much more flexible and much\neasier for you to be able to work with\n\n288\n00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:07.530\nwhen you start to take a look around and\nsee what's going on.\n\n289\n00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.640\nSo, that's really kind of the majority\nof what we tend to see up here in\n\n290\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.790\nterms of the ribbon.\n\n291\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:17.880\nNow, there is a new tool that\nthey've added in in Word 2016\n\n292\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.250\nWhich is this little box right here\nthat has a little light bulb to it.\n\n293\n00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.740\nAnd it says, Tell me what you want to do.\n\n294\n00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.960\nAnd if I hover over it, it says,\n\n295\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.315\nJust start typing here to bring features\nto your fingertips and to get help.\n\n296\n00:16:32.315 --> 00:16:36.475\nSo if I wanted to change something,\nand I couldn't see the feature,\n\n297\n00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:40.805\nso I'm in the middle of working with this\ndocument for an example, and I go, I know\n\n298\n00:16:40.805 --> 00:16:46.675\nthat Ronnie said I could change this\nstrike-through, just to make an example.\n\n299\n00:16:46.675 --> 00:16:49.435\nNotice that it automatically\nfound strike-through, and\n\n300\n00:16:49.435 --> 00:16:53.050\nthen if I select it here, let me see.\n\n301\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.780\nLet me try that again.\n\n302\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.260\nMaybe I'm not selecting what I need to.\n\n303\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360\nThere it goes.\n\n304\n00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.360\nIt actually does bring up another window.\n\n305\n00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.410\nOh I must have clicked\non something else here.\n\n306\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.920\nOh maybe not, okay.\n\n307\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.450\nSo it actually brings up this little\nwindow pane that we can do that, or\n\n308\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.470\ndid I change, it might have been me.\n\n309\n00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.200\nI might have hit split there.\n\n310\n00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.770\nMake sure.\n\n311\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.610\nMaybe strike through is\nnot what I want then.\n\n312\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.045\nUsually what it should do right,\nis bring that tool up for you.\n\n313\n00:17:23.045 --> 00:17:24.590\n[LAUGH] And that way you could do it.\n\n314\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:29.490\nBut right now it apparently is\nchallenging me to be able to do that.\n\n315\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.479\n>> Well I don't know with search\nengines and things like that,\n\n316\n00:17:31.479 --> 00:17:33.240\nyou really have to play with\nyour wording sometimes.\n\n317\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.530\nThe way you say might not be\nthe way the program understands it.\n\n318\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.750\n>> Right, so I was just trying to\nget something to come through here.\n\n319\n00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.390\nSo let's say for an example,\nthis insert bibliography ended up working.\n\n320\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.100\nI can list all your sources\nin the bibliography.\n\n321\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.810\nIf I select insert bibliography,\nnotice it even knows.\n\n322\n00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.770\nAt this point, there are no sources in\nthis document right now that it needs to\n\n323\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.880\nbe able to reference.\n\n324\n00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.170\nBut if we already started to do that,\nwe could do that.\n\n325\n00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.950\nWe could insert that right in\nexactly where I need to so\n\n326\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.020\nlet me see about highlight.\n\n327\n00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.433\nLet's say, this agreement, and\nnow let's say, select strike-through.\n\n328\n00:18:06.433 --> 00:18:08.770\nLet's see if that actually does it for\nme, there it goes.\n\n329\n00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.250\nSo notice that that actually did that for\nme without me having to go back and\n\n330\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.560\nlook or right click on anything.\n\n331\n00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.000\nSo that is a tool that actually is\nkind of specific toward 2016 that\n\n332\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.550\nyou may also want to pay\nattention to as well.\n\n333\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.270\nNow even though that's kind of\nthe majority of the interface that\n\n334\n00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.300\nwe should become familiar with right.\n\n335\n00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.750\nAt the beginning you're probably going\nto stick right here to this home tab.\n\n336\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.750\nAnd then move on through\nsome of the other things.\n\n337\n00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.320\nBut as you work with larger and\nlarge documents,\n\n338\n00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.870\nespecially if you're having to edit it.\n\n339\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:41.350\nYou'll find these other tools more\nuseful is what you'll end up seeing.\n\n340\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.740\nAnd so seeing this interface is\nkinda one of the big things.\n\n341\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.180\nBut it's not the only\nthing that we have left,\n\n342\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.640\nthere's still a bit more\nthat we can go over.\n\n343\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.670\n>> Yeah, and I noticed that there's\nalso some information across\n\n344\n00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.400\nthe bottom of your page that\nmight be helpful to us.\n\n345\n00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.020\n>> There really is, so\nwe take a look at this and probably\n\n346\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.760\nmight need to see this full-screen\na little bit so that way we can tell.\n\n347\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.800\nRight at the bottom we have what we call\nthis status bar down here at the bottom.\n\n348\n00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.780\nAnd this is one of the neat things\nthat are also available to us as well.\n\n349\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.040\nSo we of course have a scroll bar that\nwe can use to control our navigation\n\n350\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.950\nthrough the document, but\n\n351\n00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.220\ndown here at the bottom we also get\ndetails about the document itself.\n\n352\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.780\nNotice it can tell me how many\npages that I have and again,\n\n353\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.140\nI get a screen tip, right.\n\n354\n00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.580\nThe current page number in\nthe document that I'm currently on.\n\n355\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.190\nAnd I can click or\ntap to open the navigation pane.\n\n356\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.050\nSo if I wanted to I could select that and\nthen go to page two.\n\n357\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.470\nAnd I should've selected page two there.\n\n358\n00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.820\nSo I clicked on the wrong result there.\n\n359\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.810\nAnd it can automatically\nnavigate me through there.\n\n360\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.990\nNow, you might be wondering why\nthe heck would I ever do that?\n\n361\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.240\nIn a short document, you wouldn't.\n\n362\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.390\nBut if you're working with 100 page\ndocument, navigating to page number 79,\n\n363\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.200\nI could use the scroll bar and\nscroll all the way through.\n\n364\n00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.110\nYeah, there's a ton of\nscrolling to be able to do.\n\n365\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.080\nAnd we can work with that.\n\n366\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.990\nIt also gives me a nice little word count\nthat actually allows me to see that.\n\n367\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.050\nAnd then, of course, even proofing errors.\n\n368\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.190\nAnd I can click on them and correct them.\n\n369\n00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.670\nAnd that's also a part of Word as well.\n\n370\n00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:13.100\nThere's a lot of editing and proofing\nstuff that is automatically turned on.\n\n371\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:20.640\nSo like for example right here Renaissance\nCenter was ended up with a capital R here.\n\n372\n00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.920\nNotice it gives a squiggly red line and\n\n373\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.580\nthen down here the 30 days notice\nwith a squiggly blue line.\n\n374\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.570\nThese are some of the proofing marks\nthat we also have available and\n\n375\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.180\nwe can correct them as we go through.\n\n376\n00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.290\nWe're not going to do that right now.\n\n377\n00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.500\nThe other feature that I like is\nover here on the left-hand side too,\n\n378\n00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.410\nwhich are some of the different\nviews that we have available.\n\n379\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:45.589\nThis particular one that we have on\nthe right hand, did I say left-hand side?\n\n380\n00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:46.149\nJiminy!\n\n381\n00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:49.473\nMy other left, the right hand side.\n\n382\n00:20:49.473 --> 00:20:52.920\nOn the right hand side we have\nthese different view options.\n\n383\n00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.010\nNotice there's one called reading mode and\nthere's print layout and there's web mode.\n\n384\n00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.530\nThe print layout is by far the one\nthat most of us are gonna work in.\n\n385\n00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.670\nThis is the default editing mode.\n\n386\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.520\nSo if you need to edit,\nthis is probably the one that you'll see.\n\n387\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.410\nBut what if somebody\nsent you a document and\n\n388\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.540\nsaid look, I just want you\nto read over this document.\n\n389\n00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.010\nWell can I do it from this mark?\n\n390\n00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.330\nYeah, I can do it in this view.\n\n391\n00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.540\nNo big deal.\n\n392\n00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.580\nThe problem that I have is all of these\ntools that are highlighted that look\n\n393\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.920\nactive, that means that they are on and\nthey are active.\n\n394\n00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.220\nAnd that means you can make\na mistake if you're like me and\n\n395\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.890\nyou're scrolling through and\nall the sudden let's say for\n\n396\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.790\nan example you select something and then\nyou continue to scroll through and you go,\n\n397\n00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.830\noh, crud-\n>> Oops.\n\n398\n00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.130\n>> What did I just do?\n\n399\n00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.780\nI shouldn't have done that as I'm\njust supposed to read this thing.\n\n400\n00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.920\n>> I've done that several times.\n\n401\n00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.780\nI don't know exactly what I did but\nI just rearranged the entire document.\n\n402\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.110\nI sure wish there was an easy\nway to fix what I just did.\n\n403\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.820\n>> There really is an easy\nway to fix what you did.\n\n404\n00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.789\nAnd the good things is,\nas long as you keep track,\n\n405\n00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:56.069\nwell you notice like this right away.\n\n406\n00:21:56.069 --> 00:21:59.607\nYou're perfectly fine, you can\nalways do what is called Ctrl+Z and\n\n407\n00:21:59.607 --> 00:22:04.120\nthen that brings it back, it's what we\ncall the undo, which really does help us.\n\n408\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.360\nBut the key thing though is to realize\nthat if you have a gigantic document and\n\n409\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.360\nyou start doing this, right,\n\n410\n00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.390\nyou start rearranging stuff\nIs gonna really harm you.\n\n411\n00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.020\nSo the good this is, yes you have this\nwhat looks like a little tiny book.\n\n412\n00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.230\nWe've kind've full screen this again,\nwe can see that.\n\n413\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.510\nAnd now when I bring it in a reading mode,\n\n414\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.990\nnotice Mike that all the tools\nhave disappeared okay.\n\n415\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.420\nSo in this reading mode don't get me\nwrong, the tools are still there but\n\n416\n00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.960\nthey've essentially got hidden at\nthis point And so now, I can read and\n\n417\n00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.160\nI can kind of highlight,\ndo what I want to, but\n\n418\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.970\nnow, I'm not clicking and\ndragging by accident.\n\n419\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.855\nI'm not selecting something and\naccidentally, let's say if I can do it,\n\n420\n00:22:46.855 --> 00:22:49.890\nCtrl+X to cut, oops, try it again.\n\n421\n00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.040\nI'm not cutting anything by accident here.\n\n422\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.510\n>> Nice.\n>> And now I can simple just use\n\n423\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.090\nthis to read.\n\n424\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.680\nNow you may be wondering why the heck\nwould you ever do this on your laptop?\n\n425\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.820\nWell, remember that in today's day in age\nwe have tablets, we have different things.\n\n426\n00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.260\nAnd so they do have this\nwhere it's actually nice and\n\n427\n00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.090\nformatted to form fit\nwhatever size it draw, and\n\n428\n00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.920\nmost of us may not read at a desktop\nas comfortably as we'd like to.\n\n429\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.850\nBut on a tablet,\nI use a tablet all the time,\n\n430\n00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.350\nand I could see that if\nI had Word on my tablet,\n\n431\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.390\nI would simply switch it to reading\nmode and I'd be pretty happy there.\n\n432\n00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.030\n>> Especially if, when you're using one\nof those touch screen interfaces and\n\n433\n00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.330\nyou're just trying to\nscroll up on that page,\n\n434\n00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.950\nand instead of scrolling up\nyou'd delete a paragraph or\n\n435\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.860\nyou'd drag a paragraph around, and\nthat could be a pain in the butt.\n\n436\n00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.250\nGet in that reading mode and\nnow I can just read.\n\n437\n00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.994\nAnd if I've got to make a change I can\neasily flip back into that normal layout,\n\n438\n00:23:37.994 --> 00:23:39.016\nthat print layout and\n\n439\n00:23:39.016 --> 00:23:41.910\nI could make my changes then flip\nback over to reading mode and\n\n440\n00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.744\nnot have to worry about actually making\na whole bunch of changes that document.\n\n441\n00:23:45.744 --> 00:23:49.734\nSo it's a great way to start\nproofing a document probably.\n\n442\n00:23:49.734 --> 00:23:52.680\n>> That is pretty much the way\nthat you want to do this.\n\n443\n00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.988\nSo if you are If you're there on that\nfirst day and that person is saying, hey,\n\n444\n00:23:56.988 --> 00:23:59.630\nI need you to go over\nthis electronic document.\n\n445\n00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.690\nDon't do it in the print mode.\n\n446\n00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.080\nThat's what we're saying, right.\n\n447\n00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.490\nDo it in the reading mode,\nmark down the things that you have to, but\n\n448\n00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.950\nmake sure you do that cuz that way\nyou won't accidentally change things.\n\n449\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.830\nIf you're like me,\nyou accidentally delete a couple of\n\n450\n00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.710\nwords just because you're highlighting or\nnot sure.\n\n451\n00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.670\nYou move a period and\nyou might not think that,\n\n452\n00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:21.730\nthat matters but that happened in the\ndocument I was working on for a friend.\n\n453\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.468\nHe took it to the editor and\nthey were ready to print it.\n\n454\n00:24:24.468 --> 00:24:27.610\nHe said, oh look,\nthere's one of these missing and\n\n455\n00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.855\nit cost them $50 to change that one thing.\n\n456\n00:24:30.855 --> 00:24:33.740\n$50 and even though that's not,\n$50 is no big deal.\n\n457\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.680\nIt is when you actually say,\n\n458\n00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.002\nthey open up the document for\none minute to change one thing.\n\n459\n00:24:38.002 --> 00:24:41.496\n$50 a minute is expensive and\nso I saw that also happened.\n\n460\n00:24:41.496 --> 00:24:45.250\nBut yeah, that's why this\nreading mode is very important.\n\n461\n00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:50.290\nThe other mode they have here is\nwhat we'd call the web page layout.\n\n462\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.500\nThe web layout.\n\n463\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.730\nAnd notice that it actually\nfull margins this thing, right,\n\n464\n00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.510\nall the way across the screen.\n\n465\n00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.330\nNow you may be wondering\nwhy would I ever do this.\n\n466\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.680\nWell, if you're actually\nwriting the text for\n\n467\n00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.280\na webpage, this is why you would do that.\n\n468\n00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.630\nSo [INAUDIBLE] that print is different\nthan the way that text margins would be on\n\n469\n00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.760\nyour web layout.\n\n470\n00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.830\nSo, here they also give you this option.\n\n471\n00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.910\nThe other nice advantage of this is if\nyou're really just focusing on the content\n\n472\n00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.820\nand not so much the appearance of it,\nif you were printing it out,\n\n473\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.770\nthis is probably a great\nmode to also be in as well.\n\n474\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.930\nAnd that way if you're having\nto do editing, or to do some\n\n475\n00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:29.840\nrewriting the copy That you know to go,\nthat's not worded the way that I want to.\n\n476\n00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.930\nThis is probably a better way to do it\ninstead of trying to go, but I do that,\n\n477\n00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.770\nit's gonna make it look kind of funny.\n\n478\n00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.890\nFocus in on the content, and\nthis will also be helpful as well.\n\n479\n00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:39.460\n>> Very good, Ronnie.\n\n480\n00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.000\nWell this is a lot of great information.\n\n481\n00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.850\nI feel like we really learned that\nuser interface when dealing with Word.\n\n482\n00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.615\nI'm reading to dive in and start working\nwith some existing documents and\n\n483\n00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:51.930\nheck creating my own documents, and\napplying all those cool formatting\n\n484\n00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.570\ntechniques that I know\nyou're gonna show us all of.\n\n485\n00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.330\nBut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n486\n00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.970\nAny parting words for our viewers?\n\n487\n00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.240\n>> Well just remember right.\n\n488\n00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.790\nIf you are really needing\nto get familiar with Word,\n\n489\n00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.680\nthe best way to do it right\nis to take a .net and\n\n490\n00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.500\nopen it up just like we showed you and\nstart examining those tools.\n\n491\n00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.780\nAnd notice that every single one of\nthem will give you screen tips try them.\n\n492\n00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.200\nYou don't have to wait until\nthe day that you get into work.\n\n493\n00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.680\nYou can actually start now and\nopen up a document and\n\n494\n00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.270\nbe able to do that, and\nfeel confidant in your navigation around.\n\n495\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.870\nThat is really gonna help you when\nyou do get those documents and\n\n496\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.950\nyou now have to either edit it, or\nyou have to change something in it, or\n\n497\n00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.560\nyou're actually ready to just get started.\n\n498\n00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:35.880\nFeeling like this interface is not\nforeign to me is really gonna be helpful.\n\n499\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.570\nSo jump into it and\n\n500\n00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.440\njust getting to working with it is\npretty much the key right here.\n\n501\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.220\n>> Very good.\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n502\n00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.350\nthat's gonna do it for this

--> 00:00:16.798\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:18.640\nToday we're gonna be looking at Word 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.720\nAnd in this episode, we're going to take\na look at Creating documents, right.\n\n6\n00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.060\nWe've seen how we can navigate around that\nuser interface and get a document open.\n\n7\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.390\nNow we should start working\nwith some documents.\n\n8\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.110\nCreate some, edit some, and who better\nto help us with than Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.220\nHow are you doing Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.970\n>> I'm doing fine,\n\n11\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.662\nit's a great day to be right here as we\n>> Continue to take a look at working\n\n12\n00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:41.043\nwith Word 2016.\n\n13\n00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:43.837\nWe need to be able to feel\nconfident not only, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:46.294\nin navigating around\nthe Word interface itself.\n\n15\n00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:48.730\nBut also in how we can create documents.\n\n16\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.419\nAnd inside of Word there\nare multiple ways that you and\n\n17\n00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:54.030\nI can actually create different documents\n>> So\n\n18\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990\nthat we can be able to work\nwith them inside of Word.\n\n19\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.120\nBe able to edit them, or\neven create blank ones as we need to.\n\n20\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.750\nAnd actually start from scratch.\n\n21\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.120\nNow, when we start\ntalking about that idea.\n\n22\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.087\nThat's really where the key comes in,\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:09.104\nWhat is it that you need\nto do with the document?\n\n24\n00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:10.729\nIs really what we're talking about.\n\n25\n00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.960\nAnd then,\ndo we always need to start from scratch?\n\n26\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.920\nNot a lot of times.\n\n27\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.060\nMost of the time, what you might find out\nis that there are actually tools that\n\n28\n00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.160\nare available, or even existing\ndocuments that are available to you.\n\n29\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.060\nThat you can use to help you get\nstarted instead of just from scratch.\n\n30\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.543\nSo a lot of times when\nwe are working with it.\n\n31\n00:01:28.543 --> 00:01:29.683\nI've done this before we're I've said.\n\n32\n00:01:29.683 --> 00:01:31.077\nYou know I need to write something.\n\n33\n00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:34.550\nAnd I open up word and it sits there,\nand it's just a blank document.\n\n34\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.530\nAnd that's where it can get scary because\nyou don't know exactly what it is\n\n35\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.370\nyou're coming there to do sometimes.\n\n36\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.522\nAnd I didn't say that was true.\n\n37\n00:01:41.522 --> 00:01:43.334\nI have a great idea for a book.\n\n38\n00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:45.597\nAnd I can start it and\nI can type in the title and go.\n\n39\n00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:47.060\nOkay, now I don't know what to do.\n\n40\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.720\nBut the good thing is, there are actually\nhelps available to you in Word 2016 that's\n\n41\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.630\nreally gonna help us out.\n\n42\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.270\nSo let's just jump right into it and\nsee how Word helps us to get started.\n\n43\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.940\nSo when you and I go ahead and start this.\n\n44\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.979\nI just use the taskbar logo, or\n\n45\n00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.046\nthe taskbar logon to help\nto me launch Word up.\n\n46\n00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:10.273\nIt normally brings you of course,\ndirectly into this interface.\n\n47\n00:02:10.273 --> 00:02:14.610\nIf you haven't chosen a document\nto launch it up with right away.\n\n48\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.210\nAnd what you're actually looking for right\nhere are some of the different features.\n\n49\n00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.091\nThat you see.\n\n50\n00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:22.080\nNow, you might be wondering\nwhy blank document is listed.\n\n51\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.091\nBut notice that right next to\nit we have a welcome to Word.\n\n52\n00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:29.697\nAnd then, even a single-spaced\nblank type of document, blog post,\n\n53\n00:02:29.697 --> 00:02:32.420\nbanded, spec design, you name it.\n\n54\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.440\nThere are plenty of\ndifferent online templates.\n\n55\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.241\nAnd what is that about?\n\n56\n00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.843\nA template of course,\nis a structured document for us.\n\n57\n00:02:39.843 --> 00:02:43.610\nThe text, that's actually represented\nin it really doesn't matter.\n\n58\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.790\nSo what you can do is\nsimply replace the text.\n\n59\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.830\nAnd you actually have a document that's\nready kind of been pre-formatted\n\n60\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.120\nin the way that you want it to be.\n\n61\n00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.940\nNow when we start taking a look at that.\n\n62\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.920\nThat's probably one of the simplest\nways that you and I can begin to create\n\n63\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.380\na document is using some of these\ntemplates that are actually available.\n\n64\n00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.293\nAnd we can simply just save it and\ndo that.\n\n65\n00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:02.918\nLet's just go ahead and\nstart with that one.\n\n66\n00:03:02.918 --> 00:03:04.357\nAnd then we'll come\nback to this blank doc.\n\n67\n00:03:04.357 --> 00:03:06.795\nNow notice right here it's\nset position number one.\n\n68\n00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:12.205\nBut the template is a way\nthat my head is going.\n\n69\n00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:17.130\nAnd what I want you to see is that there's\na richness to what we see available to us.\n\n70\n00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.870\nSo notice that it says Search for\nOnline Templates.\n\n71\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.061\nAt one point there was really only\na limited number of templates that you had\n\n72\n00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:25.236\navailable inside of Word.\n\n73\n00:03:25.236 --> 00:03:27.270\nMicrosoft says,\nlook if you're connected online.\n\n74\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.000\nYou might as well get access to our\nentire library of templates that\n\n75\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.720\nare available to you.\n\n76\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.540\nAnd so, instead you can even go ahead and\ntake a look.\n\n77\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.010\nBusiness, Personal, Industry Print,\ndesign, education and event.\n\n78\n00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.600\nLet's say I'm gonna be hosting an event\nhere I can simply select that.\n\n79\n00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.530\nAnd now you'll see that is connecting\nme online to their library of different\n\n80\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.480\ntemplates.\n\n81\n00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.324\nAnd I could even see multiple categories\nthat are actually available depending on\n\n82\n00:03:54.324 --> 00:03:57.342\nwhat I want to actually\ncreate even from an event And\n\n83\n00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:00.661\nyou can see that event has\n233 different templates.\n\n84\n00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:03.467\nAnd people do submit\ntemplates to Microsoft.\n\n85\n00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:05.620\nAnd they might take it and\ntweak it a little bit, or\n\n86\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.810\nMicrosoft themselves\nmay come up with them.\n\n87\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.600\nAnd they just simply add them here.\n\n88\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.447\nDepending on what you actually\nneed to be able to do.\n\n89\n00:04:11.447 --> 00:04:15.021\nSo, Mike, let's say that what we\nwant to do, just briefly here.\n\n90\n00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:20.690\nIs we wanna host a holiday party,\nis what we want to be able to do.\n\n91\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.670\nI'm just looking at all\nthe different ones.\n\n92\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.500\nAnd since we're actually in that\noccasion toward the end of the year,\n\n93\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.520\nwe wanna host a holiday party.\n\n94\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.240\nI take a look at this and\nnotice, there it is.\n\n95\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.410\nI can advertise my holiday\nevent with this one page flyer.\n\n96\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.620\nSnowman, snow flakes.\n\n97\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.330\nWell, we're in Florida.\n\n98\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.110\nWell of course, snowman and\nsnow flakes will actually work.\n\n99\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.610\nAnd I simply go ahead and I download this.\n\n100\n00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.070\nI click create and\nwe'll see here in a moment.\n\n101\n00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.760\nThat, there it is.\n\n102\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.600\nIt goes ahead and\nit brings that document in for me and\n\n103\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.000\nwithout me having to recreate\nthe graphic or even the font size.\n\n104\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.360\nAnd more importantly, I know this doesn't\nsound as important to most of us.\n\n105\n00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.340\nMore importantly even, is the layout tier.\n\n106\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.380\nThe margins are actually automatically.\n\n107\n00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.470\nAnd notice it has custom margins.\n\n108\n00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.140\nThe orientations race up, the size and\npage that I want it to be put on.\n\n109\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.420\nAll that is actually done\ninside of the template itself.\n\n110\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.540\nSo now we simply go ahead and do this.\n\n111\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.924\nAnd we'll put IT ProTV.\n\n112\n00:05:16.924 --> 00:05:17.773\nOops.\n\n113\n00:05:17.773 --> 00:05:23.708\nHoliday party.\n\n114\n00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:30.320\nAll right, so we simply start filling\nin information such as dates and times.\n\n115\n00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.200\nAnd we're even starting to\nsee that they went ahead and\n\n116\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.300\nadded in some extra things in here.\n\n117\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.690\nNow, I can go ahead and\nnotice that there's also this\n\n118\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.550\nidea that gives me the ability to\nhave even something like this.\n\n119\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.590\nSo let's say that the party is gonna\nbe on the 12th here, Saturday the 12th.\n\n120\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.888\nAnd even the time, a lot of times,\n\n121\n00:05:47.888 --> 00:05:52.662\nsometimes you'll actually get those\nlittle fields for you to do that.\n\n122\n00:05:52.662 --> 00:05:58.219\nAnd this particular box is what\nwe call an insert built in\n\n123\n00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:03.906\nfield place holder is what\nthey end up calling this here.\n\n124\n00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:07.009\nAnd that way you can select it without\nyou having to type it all out and\n\n125\n00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.790\nthat actually puts it in\nthe format we want it to be.\n\n126\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.020\nAnd then you simply fill\nout the rest of this.\n\n127\n00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.316\nAnd now you have your basic template and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n128\n00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:17.717\nSo, if you just need something quick.\n\n129\n00:06:17.717 --> 00:06:20.691\nAnd you need it to be themed a lot\nof times, or you need it actually be\n\n130\n00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:23.416\nformatted and you don't have to\nspend a lot of time doing it.\n\n131\n00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.350\nMaybe using a template\nis about the way to go.\n\n132\n00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.083\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah I mean,\n\n133\n00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:29.363\nI could have spent a hour trying to\ncreate that fancy little flyer there.\n\n134\n00:06:29.363 --> 00:06:32.736\nTrying to figure out what my\nmargin should be and my layout.\n\n135\n00:06:32.736 --> 00:06:35.180\nWhat font I wanted to use and\nthings like that.\n\n136\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.330\nYou simply went to their online location\nand found the appropriate template.\n\n137\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.840\nFilled in a couple values and\nbada bing you're good to go.\n\n138\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.850\nThat's pretty impressive.\n\n139\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.800\n>> Yeah.\nIt really is because now you can actually\n\n140\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.050\nsave that again.\n\n141\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.870\nAnd now you can save it,\nand don't worry about it.\n\n142\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.780\nAnd you can leave it up there on\nthe online, which is perfectly fine.\n\n143\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.920\nAnd go and retrieve it again at some other\npoint without you having to recreate\n\n144\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.850\nthe whole thing over again.\n\n145\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.620\nSo by being able to create a document,\njust this quick, get it ready to go.\n\n146\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.850\nYou notice it's already formatted\nperfectly the way we want it to be.\n\n147\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.580\nAnd we do not tend to have to\nworry too often about anything.\n\n148\n00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.910\nBut besides using the idea of\nthe template as one of the big things.\n\n149\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.760\nNow, we talked about this idea of\nthe blank document for a moment.\n\n150\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.970\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose out of this.\n\n151\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.580\nSo I'm gonna go File, Save.\n\n152\n00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.560\nAnd then I'm gonna save it\nto my exercise files here.\n\n153\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.760\nAnd now I'm gonna change\nthis to Holiday Party Flyer.\n\n154\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.530\nAnd I'm gonna save it as a default\nWord document and just click save.\n\n155\n00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.930\nAnd now it's being saved.\n\n156\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.334\nI can see the name of it's actually\nready for us to be able to do that.\n\n157\n00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:45.627\nSo from this point on,\n\n158\n00:07:45.627 --> 00:07:49.452\nif I need to modify it up until\nthe time when I choose to print it out.\n\n159\n00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:51.078\nI don't have to go back and\ndo the whole thing.\n\n160\n00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:53.496\nI simply select what I want and\nthere we go.\n\n161\n00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:55.264\nWe're actually ready to work with that.\n\n162\n00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:57.187\n>> Nice.\n>> So let me go ahead and\n\n163\n00:07:57.187 --> 00:08:02.375\nget to new again And now we wanna\nselect this blank document instead.\n\n164\n00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:07.050\nThis is by far the one that's gonna\ntake the hardest for you to work on.\n\n165\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.845\nNotice that it, I know this sounds strange\nMike, but this is intimidating to me.\n\n166\n00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:11.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It really is,\n\n167\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.310\nit's standing right there and\nit's like go ahead,\n\n168\n00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.250\nI challenge you now to put something down\non the paper that you're really gonna want\n\n169\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.490\nto save, and then work on later\non if you don't have anything.\n\n170\n00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.010\n>> I can feel the writer's\nblock creeping in already.\n\n171\n00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:24.510\n>> Yeah,\n\n172\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.180\nthat is exactly what ends up happening\na lot of times with just a blank document.\n\n173\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.820\nThere's so many other things.\n\n174\n00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.870\nUnless you've already have\ncreated you outline, and\n\n175\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.680\nyou know what you're actually doing,\nhaving this open is about\n\n176\n00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.520\nas intimidating as it gets, at least\nif you wanna start to write something,\n\n177\n00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.450\nunless you really do have great\nwriting notes and you're ready to go.\n\n178\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.460\nThis is it.\n\n179\n00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.130\nNow the good thing is, believe it or\nnot, this is a template.\n\n180\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.190\nI know that sounds strange.\n\n181\n00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.976\nIt's blank, it doesn't do anything.\n\n182\n00:08:50.976 --> 00:08:55.240\nBut it already is a template in the very\nfact that it's already selected the basic\n\n183\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.060\nmargins that we have on hand,\nthe paper size, even the paper color and\n\n184\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.300\nthe background.\n\n185\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.090\nAll that is a foundational template and\n\n186\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.810\nthis is where everything\nin Microsoft really begins.\n\n187\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.550\nIs it starts right here using\nthis foundational template\n\n188\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.980\nat the very beginning.\n\n189\n00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.950\nAnytime you open up Microsoft Word,\nright, it has to start somewhere.\n\n190\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.830\nAnd so it says hey look,\nuse this as a default template,\n\n191\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.280\nat least at the beginning and\nthen you can change and\n\n192\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.990\nchoose whatever template you want to plop\nright on top of that and then you begin.\n\n193\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.470\nNow when you actually\nhave something like this,\n\n194\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.370\nthe only thing you're really looking for\nright, at the very beginning is\n\n195\n00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.150\nyou're not replacing anything,\nyou're just simply starting.\n\n196\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.360\nAnd that's where like I said for me,\nthe writer's block begins right there.\n\n197\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.910\nSo, unless I know what I'm doing, we might\nactually have to kind of do something.\n\n198\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:47.460\nSo, this is my attempt at writing a paper.\n\n199\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.150\nJust to put something down right there.\n\n200\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:54.300\nSo, right there, you can start, but\nremember that that doesn't really mean\n\n201\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.260\nanything until you actually\nstart filling it in.\n\n202\n00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.250\nAnd that's where it becomes a little\nbit more challenging, right,\n\n203\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.610\nis doing all that.\n\n204\n00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.340\nOnce you're actually done\ncreating your document,\n\n205\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.790\nwriting all the stuff that you want to,\nnow you actually start formatting it,\n\n206\n00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.190\nyou start massaging it to make\nit look the way that you want.\n\n207\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.900\nBut clearly the hardest part of it,\nof course is gonna be the writing.\n\n208\n00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.460\nBut for you if you're working with\nMicrosoft Word, right, a lot of times,\n\n209\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.660\nthat document may actually be saved for\nyou, and then you're opening it up, and\n\n210\n00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.720\nthen you're actually having to\nwork with it from that point.\n\n211\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.690\nSo, the good thing is, if you actually\ndo feel comfortable in working along\n\n212\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.200\nthese tabs, which we did talk about\nin our getting started episode, so\n\n213\n00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.610\nmake sure you check that one out.\n\n214\n00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.420\nWhen you do have something like that,\nit actually does make it a lot easier for\n\n215\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.880\nyou to come back in and\nwork with a little bit later.\n\n216\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.830\nBut starting from blank is, to me,\n\n217\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.150\nlike I said, probably the most\nchallenging thing that you can do.\n\n218\n00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.870\nCan you do it?\n\n219\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.665\nAbsolutely.\n\n220\n00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:47.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Should you do it a lot of times?\n\n221\n00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.090\nWell, maybe,\n\n222\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.710\nif that's what you're actually\ntasked to do is to write everything.\n\n223\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.500\nSo, when we start working with Word,\nusually,\n\n224\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.360\nwhat we're tasked to do a couple\nof things right at the beginning.\n\n225\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.280\nOne, business letters, right?\n\n226\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.660\nIs what we normally end up doing.\n\n227\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.234\nWe're writing a letter on behalf of\nmy employer, to some organization,\n\n228\n00:11:04.234 --> 00:11:06.280\nor to confirm something.\n\n229\n00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.200\nA lot of times, it could actually\njust be a simple paragraph.\n\n230\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.140\nCopy that somebody wants\nto be able to see.\n\n231\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.470\nThey read something and they're\nsaying hey look we just need a copy,\n\n232\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.650\nare they worried about formatting at\nthat point, no, use scratch paper.\n\n233\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.730\nSo you can use simple scratch\npeople to be able to do.\n\n234\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.620\nYou might go why would I do that\nwhen I actually have scratch paper.\n\n235\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.384\nBecause this way it's already typed in and\n\n236\n00:11:27.384 --> 00:11:30.000\nthen you can copy and\npaste it to wherever it needs to.\n\n237\n00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.890\nAnd you're ready to go.\n\n238\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.020\nI'd rather keep electronic.\n\n239\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.990\nI know, everybody always is old school,\nand says no, keep a scratch pad on hand.\n\n240\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.430\nThat's probably the quickest.\n\n241\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.800\nNot the quickest when you're actually\nlike me at 2 o'clock in the morning\n\n242\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.060\nsimply scratching in the morning and\n\n243\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.985\ngoing, that didn't make any sense\nat all and having to toss it.\n\n244\n00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:45.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But overall, though,\n\n245\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.780\nthis actually makes it legible, but\n\n246\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.230\nit actually makes it very portable for\nyou too.\n\n247\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:54.190\n>> Now Ronnie, I've got my Office 365\nsubscription, I've got Office 2016.\n\n248\n00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.948\nI'm rocking and rolling, but, I've got to\ndeal with people from other businesses.\n\n249\n00:11:57.948 --> 00:12:01.570\nWe've gotta exchange documents, but not\nall of them have done the upgrade, yet.\n\n250\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.580\nSome of them are still working\nwith these older versions.\n\n251\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.620\nAre they, can we still communicate?\n\n252\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.440\nCan we still share and work together?\n\n253\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.520\n>> You really can.\n\n254\n00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.710\nSo, as long as you have the documents\nthat are actually in previous versions,\n\n255\n00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.960\nthey will come over, but they'll come\nover with a caveat or a warning.\n\n256\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.848\nSo let me go ahead and see if we can get\none of those warnings to show up here.\n\n257\n00:12:19.848 --> 00:12:24.000\nSo I'm gonna close out of this document,\nI simply clicked on the file tab, and\n\n258\n00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.170\nI selected Close this time.\n\n259\n00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.480\nI'm not gonna worry about\nsaving that silly document.\n\n260\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.760\nI'm going close out of this one, too.\n\n261\n00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.620\nThat way we kind of have\na start clear screen.\n\n262\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.140\nAnd if I select File and\nthen Open, and go to this Recent.\n\n263\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.200\nLet me just browse instead.\n\n264\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.980\nBrowse, and I'm gonna select that\nmemorandum of understanding that I had\n\n265\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.810\nbefore, and click here.\n\n266\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.680\nAnd you'll notice a lot of times,\nright away,\n\n267\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.220\nthat if you do pull in the document\nfrom a previous version,\n\n268\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.770\nWord 2016 will accept it, but it will ask\nyou put it up here in compatibility mode.\n\n269\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.650\nAnd that means it will\nkeep all the features,\n\n270\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.940\nthe original features that were\nthere in that original document.\n\n271\n00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.590\nSo it was designed, let's say,\nfor Word 2007, or even Word 2003.\n\n272\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.490\nIt will make sure that it\nkeeps those things that will\n\n273\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.770\nmake it compatible with that version.\n\n274\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.160\nNow that also means, though, that if\nyou try and save something that's only\n\n275\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.920\navailable, let's say, in Word 2016, well\nthat's where the problem's gonna come in.\n\n276\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.630\nCuz when you try and\nsave it as that, it's gonna say,\n\n277\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.700\nlook that feature may not be compatible\nwith the older version of Word.\n\n278\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.460\nSo you may lose that functionality if\nyou wanna still keep that compatibility.\n\n279\n00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.540\nIt will give you the option though to try\nand save it in the new, modern format.\n\n280\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.260\nThat means that maybe that older version\nof Word may not recognize, of course,\n\n281\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.750\nthe newer version.\n\n282\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.540\nAnd that's where you may have issues.\n\n283\n00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.880\nSo as long as you see compatibility mode,\n\n284\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.540\nmy best recommendation at this point is\nleave it in that compatibility mode if\n\n285\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.280\nyou're gonna gonna be interacting\nwith other people like Mike said.\n\n286\n00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.683\nIt could be that you are working with\nanother company and they haven't upgraded\n\n287\n00:14:01.683 --> 00:14:06.164\nto Office 365 or Office 2016,\nthey're still working Office 2003.\n\n288\n00:14:06.164 --> 00:14:09.370\nYou might go, there's no way,\nit's still happening out there.\n\n289\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.340\nSo it is possible, but\nto make sure you do have that ability to\n\n290\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.460\ncontinue to collaborate and work, you may\nneed to keep that compatibility mode,\n\n291\n00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.430\nand that's actually gonna be a benefit for\nthem.\n\n292\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.560\nInstead of them actually trying to\nget a document and saying, hey,\n\n293\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.620\nwe don't recognize this version or format\nof Word and now they have to send it\n\n294\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.260\nback to you and you still have to\nsave it in compatibility mode.\n\n295\n00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.040\nAnd actually that brings\nup a good point as well.\n\n296\n00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.670\nIf you are also working with them in\nan older mode, well, you may want to make\n\n297\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.160\nsure that you know how to save\nthose documents in that older mode.\n\n298\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.530\nSo let me see if I can\nbring up that template.\n\n299\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.250\nThat holiday flier that we were in.\n\n300\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:51.740\nAnd let's say that what I want to do\nis make sure that this was also ready\n\n301\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.990\nfor well somebody that was gonna be\nprinting it off an older machine.\n\n302\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.930\nOr I didn't know what their machine was.\n\n303\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:04.390\nSo I can go to File and then I can go to,\nlet's see here, Save As or Save.\n\n304\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.980\nSorry, I already saved it,\nso I need to Save As.\n\n305\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.805\nSee, forgot already.\n\n306\n00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:13.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm gonna put in my exercise files.\n\n307\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.540\nAnd at this point I select underneath\nwhere it says file name on the file type.\n\n308\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.660\nAnd then I can choose what document\nformat I wanna save it as.\n\n309\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.200\nSo notice there's the 97 to 2003,\n\n310\n00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.870\nand that usually is a fairly\nstandard format if you're not sure.\n\n311\n00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.180\nCuz every version of Word since\n97 should be able to open it,\n\n312\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.660\nand then we can do that and\nthen make sure we save it.\n\n313\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:42.050\nAnd now this is what you get when you do\nsave something newer to an older format.\n\n314\n00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.650\nSo it tells you that some of these\nfeatures are not supported by earlier\n\n315\n00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.380\nversions and it tells you content controls\nwill be converted to static controls.\n\n316\n00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:49.923\nSo it does that.\n\n317\n00:15:49.923 --> 00:15:53.661\nShapes and text boxes converted\nto what was available then.\n\n318\n00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:57.826\nEffects on the text will be removed,\nand you simply select Continue.\n\n319\n00:15:57.826 --> 00:16:00.823\nAnd now you notice it now\nsays Compatibility Mode, but\n\n320\n00:16:00.823 --> 00:16:03.756\nthose earlier versions will\nbe able now to open it up,\n\n321\n00:16:03.756 --> 00:16:07.220\nprint it out at their office,\nand they're ready to go.\n\n322\n00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.060\n>> Nice, very convenient.\n\n323\n00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.355\nSo that gives me that ability to\nbe backwards compatible basically.\n\n324\n00:16:12.355 --> 00:16:16.900\nIf not everybody in the office has the\nlatest version, maybe I'm one of the few\n\n325\n00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.390\nthat's been upgraded or I've got business\npartners that aren't on that cutting edge.\n\n326\n00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.100\nWe can still share documents,\nwe can send documents back and\n\n327\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.840\nforth and I don't have to worry\nabout that compatibility.\n\n328\n00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.100\nThe only thing that'll happen is\nmaybe some of the newer features\n\n329\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.390\nwon't be available if I save it in\nthat Compatibility Mode, very cool.\n\n330\n00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.410\n>> Yeah, the worst one is probably\ngonna be the fonts, right.\n\n331\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.660\nAs Microsoft has added in new fonts,\nsome of those older versions may not\n\n332\n00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.600\nhave the newer font, and\nit may end up substituting a font for you.\n\n333\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.960\nBut besides that though, usually it does\nfairly well, especially on the graphics,\n\n334\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.720\nso as long as everything is okay,\nyou're ready to go.\n\n335\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.610\n>> Now,\nwe talk about compatibility Ronnie,\n\n336\n00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.000\nwhat about people that\naren't even using Office?\n\n337\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.280\nWhat if they're using\nsome other processor,\n\n338\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.950\nthere are other word processors out there.\n\n339\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.260\nI know that's hard to believe, but yeah,\nwhat if they're using one of those but\n\n340\n00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.790\nI'm using Office,\ncan we still work together?\n\n341\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.360\n>> It's a possibility, right?\n\n342\n00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.880\nSo never say never at this point.\n\n343\n00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.790\nBut there's a lot of newer\nfeatures today in which\n\n344\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.090\nmakes Word fairly compatible with just\nabout everything that's out there.\n\n345\n00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.310\nNow it doesn't mean that it always\ncomes in the way that you want it to.\n\n346\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.660\nSo let's say for an example, you use\nsomething like Google Docs and you use\n\n347\n00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.790\nsomething like that, it's a word processor\nprogram that's actually out there.\n\n348\n00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.890\nBut it's not exactly compatible\n100% with Microsoft Word.\n\n349\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.400\nNow can you make it\ncompatible from their end?\n\n350\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.500\nYes, they do have a Download As feature\nthat you can actually do that and\n\n351\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.930\ndownload it as a Microsoft Word document.\n\n352\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.050\nAnd that may give everything\nthat you want to, but\n\n353\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.480\nwhat if you actually just said, here's\nthe document that I'm working with, and\n\n354\n00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.990\nthey didn't save it as that,\ncan Word handle it?\n\n355\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.450\nSometimes it can, and sometimes it can't.\n\n356\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.243\nBut I was just trying this\nright before our show here,\n\n357\n00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:02.216\nI took a Google Doc,\nI saved it as OpenDocument format.\n\n358\n00:18:02.216 --> 00:18:05.730\nI was trying to remember what it was\ncalled here, OpenDocument Text format, and\n\n359\n00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.240\nI was actually able to bring it in.\n\n360\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.281\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n361\n00:18:09.281 --> 00:18:12.834\nSo let me close out of that\ntemplate there, or that file,\n\n362\n00:18:12.834 --> 00:18:15.450\nlet me get out of this memorandum again.\n\n363\n00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.040\nI keep opening both of them up,\n\n364\n00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.910\nthose are just the two documents\nI seem to be able to use.\n\n365\n00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.868\nI can then select Open,\nand then Browse and\n\n366\n00:18:24.868 --> 00:18:29.650\nI actually downloaded a resume example.\n\n367\n00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.006\nAnd so, here on this resume example, if I\nhover over it it says OpenDocument Text,\n\n368\n00:18:34.006 --> 00:18:37.510\nan ODT file is an open standard.\n\n369\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.990\nAnd it may show up, it may not, and\nthis is where you have to be careful.\n\n370\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.840\nIf you know that you actually have that\ndocument that somebody sent to you and\n\n371\n00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.760\nyou put it into your downloads folder,\nand it's still not showing up,\n\n372\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.080\nwell the majority of the time when\nyou open something up in Word,\n\n373\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.380\nit's not only gonna be under\nAll Word Documents, right?\n\n374\n00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.680\nSo you need to select this list\nover here and just choose, well,\n\n375\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.790\nlet's say All Files.\n\n376\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.320\nOr you can choose the file\nformat that you think it is,\n\n377\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.440\nwhich is the OpenDocument Text, and\n\n378\n00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.770\nnow notice it actually filters out\neverything but that one example.\n\n379\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.800\nNow, what is this list about then?\n\n380\n00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.140\nThis list is probably saying,\nhey I think I can open this up.\n\n381\n00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.730\nWord is actually saying, I accept\nthe challenge for all of these things.\n\n382\n00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.910\nSo if it can actually see it,\n\n383\n00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:24.610\na lot of times it can do whatever it\ncan do with that particular format.\n\n384\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.440\nAnd usually it's fairly close to what\nwe have in the original document.\n\n385\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.700\nBut if it's not, you'll actually know then\nthat, hey, they were able to some things,\n\n386\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.180\nthey weren't able to do a lot.\n\n387\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.200\nBut notice that for Word here,\n\n388\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.290\nit actually goes all the way back even\nto WordPerfect 5 and WordPerfect 6.\n\n389\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.170\nI hate to say that I was working on\nWordPerfect 3 when I was doing it during\n\n390\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:43.800\ncollege here.\n\n391\n00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.180\nSo you actually see that there's a lot\nof different ones that are there,\n\n392\n00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.560\neven PDF files, which we're gonna\ntalk about in just a moment here.\n\n393\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.030\nYou name it, it is possible.\n\n394\n00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.820\nSo I'm just gonna select\nthis resume example, and\n\n395\n00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.510\nthen I have the ability to click Open.\n\n396\n00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.060\nNow notice that there's also a drop\ndown arrow next to this Open, and\n\n397\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.010\nI can open it directly so that I can edit\nit and do everything that I need to.\n\n398\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.610\nI could Open as Read Only so\nI'm not editing, in other words,\n\n399\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.450\nI don't want to mess it up.\n\n400\n00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:13.800\nLet's say this is the original document\nand somebody didn't just send me a copy.\n\n401\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.210\nDid you mess up that document?\n\n402\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.839\nI saved it as a Word document,\nis that okay?\n\n403\n00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:19.022\nNo!\n\n404\n00:20:19.022 --> 00:20:22.090\nBut you can do something like that,\nand Open and Repair, you name it.\n\n405\n00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.510\nBut I'm just going to select Open,\nand then when it brings in, and\n\n406\n00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:30.470\nthis is really what the document looked\nlike inside of the Google Docs as well.\n\n407\n00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.566\nAnd you can see they just made a template,\nthey used a Lorem ipsum dolor and\n\n408\n00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:37.240\nactually filled everything in.\n\n409\n00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.681\nBut yeah, this actually looks exactly\nthe way that it did look inside of\n\n410\n00:20:41.681 --> 00:20:46.656\nthe Google Docs, so a lot of times it will\nactually take it and bring it in for us.\n\n411\n00:20:46.656 --> 00:20:50.750\nAnd I think all of that is because, well,\nthe newer file formats that we have do\n\n412\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.534\nmake it where, as long as the\ninformation's there, Word can just bring\n\n413\n00:20:54.534 --> 00:20:58.850\nit in, that XML stuff that they do, it is\namazing, in what they can do with this.\n\n414\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:03.476\n>> Yeah, that XML really does help, even\nthough we still have proprietary formats,\n\n415\n00:21:03.476 --> 00:21:08.103\nthat XML's kind of a neutral format that\nif they're following even similar to it,\n\n416\n00:21:08.103 --> 00:21:11.302\nat least it can figure out what\nit wants to display there.\n\n417\n00:21:11.302 --> 00:21:12.990\nSo that's fantastic Ronnie.\n\n418\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.620\nYou said something about PDFs as well.\n\n419\n00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.020\nPDFs, I get those all the time,\npeople are always sending me PDFs or\n\n420\n00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.880\nI'm downloading PDFs from the Internet.\n\n421\n00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.560\nYou're telling me that Word\ncan work with those as well?\n\n422\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.442\n>> Surprisingly yes and\nsurprisingly no [LAUGH] at the same time.\n\n423\n00:21:27.442 --> 00:21:30.644\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Word's big claim, right,\n\n424\n00:21:30.644 --> 00:21:35.420\nis that you can actually take a PDF and\nedit it inside of Word natively.\n\n425\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.940\nIn other words not needing to convert\nit to any else, it can do it.\n\n426\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.505\nNow the weird thing is this,\nit can do it, it doesn't do it well.\n\n427\n00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:47.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It does some strange things to it,\n\n428\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:52.290\nand that's because a PDF is one\nof those formats that's just\n\n429\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:56.160\nincredibly difficult to crack and\nmake it look like a regular document,\n\n430\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.800\nbecause of the way that things\nare saved in that PDF format.\n\n431\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.020\nSo when you work with it in Word,\nthere are a bunch of caveats.\n\n432\n00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.460\nLet me make sure that I tell you some of\nthese caveats here, I wrote them down.\n\n433\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.420\nWord, if you're trying to work\nwith a PDF and bring it over,\n\n434\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.860\nit cannot handle tables with any\ncell spacing at all, so good luck.\n\n435\n00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.360\nIf you have a nicely formatted looking\ntable inside of a PDF document,\n\n436\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.590\nit can't do it,\nit's not gonna do that, okay.\n\n437\n00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:27.150\nPage colors and page borders, so\n\n438\n00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.260\nany page colors and borders that you\nhave in the PDF, good luck with that.\n\n439\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.950\nThere are always page borders and\ncolors, can't deal with it.\n\n440\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.050\nIt can't deal with track changes so if\nyou actually have track changes inside of\n\n441\n00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.750\nyour PDF document, done,\nit's not gonna do that.\n\n442\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.737\nFrames, footnotes that span more\nthan the page, endnotes, audio,\n\n443\n00:22:44.737 --> 00:22:49.620\nvideo PDFs, and active elements inside of\nPDFs, not able to do anything with those.\n\n444\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.114\nBookmarks, tabs, comments, so\nall the sudden, you're like, okay,\n\n445\n00:22:54.114 --> 00:22:58.500\nmy PDF is essentially a text\ndocument that's saved as a PDF.\n\n446\n00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.608\nThat's the one that we'll deal with.\n\n447\n00:23:01.608 --> 00:23:02.360\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n448\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.916\n>> [LAUGH] So you're telling me you open\nit up, and it's gonna remove a lot of\n\n449\n00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:08.771\nthe features that we might be\ntaking advantage of in a PDF,\n\n450\n00:23:08.771 --> 00:23:12.677\nwhich is something that we typically have\nto deal with when we're talking about\n\n451\n00:23:12.677 --> 00:23:15.565\nopening up proprietary formats and\nother applications.\n\n452\n00:23:15.565 --> 00:23:20.840\n>> Yeah, it's not bad if all you\nneed inside is the content, okay.\n\n453\n00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.820\nBut if you expected to bring it in\nlike the PDF that you're looking at,\n\n454\n00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.870\nit's not gonna do that either.\n\n455\n00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.760\nSo it's kind of unusual, right?\n\n456\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.020\nSo most people are fairly\ndisappointed when they do it.\n\n457\n00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.110\nBut if you're just reflowing the document\nthen you're willing to do that.\n\n458\n00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:41.065\nSo let me see if I can open up that\nPDF here to show you the PDF example\n\n459\n00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:42.067\nthat I have.\n\n460\n00:23:42.067 --> 00:23:47.337\nAnd in the exercise files,\nand I have a couple of them,\n\n461\n00:23:47.337 --> 00:23:51.577\nso, here's one then, I didn't know it but\n\n462\n00:23:51.577 --> 00:23:55.377\nthis is actually in public domain now.\n\n463\n00:23:55.377 --> 00:23:59.380\nThe Art of War is actually in public\ndomain, a fairly nice document.\n\n464\n00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.529\nFairly long, and when you look at it,\nthis looks great.\n\n465\n00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:06.469\nSo the guy did a really good job, and\nhe's put out there, you can download it,\n\n466\n00:24:06.469 --> 00:24:07.790\ndo whatever.\n\n467\n00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.140\nSo it says download it free, and\nyou can see what Word actually says that.\n\n468\n00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.400\nSo there it is.\n\n469\n00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:12.900\nLooks great.\n\n470\n00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.190\nSo I was thinking, hey,\nwhat if we actually try and\n\n471\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.870\nopen that one up in a Word document.\n\n472\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.100\nWell, we can try and do that.\n\n473\n00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:27.980\nSo now if I go to Open Other Documents and\nwe select the same way as we did before,\n\n474\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:34.350\nthis time I click on that drop-down,\nand I select PDF File.\n\n475\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.660\nSo there is that Art of War.\n\n476\n00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.316\nAnd now I click Open.\n\n477\n00:24:39.316 --> 00:24:43.200\nAnd now it says, Word will now convert\nyour PDF to an editable document.\n\n478\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.210\nNotice it says it may take a while,\n\n479\n00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.760\nthe resulting document will be\noptimized to allow you to edit text.\n\n480\n00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.200\nSo it may not look exactly\nlike the original,\n\n481\n00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.990\nespecially if the original\ncontained graphics.\n\n482\n00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.760\nClick OK, and now it's beginning\nthe conversion process, and\n\n483\n00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.690\nit does a fairly good job as long\nas there's actually only text.\n\n484\n00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.540\nSo notice how everything\nactually looks pretty good here.\n\n485\n00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.910\nAnd I picked this one on\npurpose because it can do that.\n\n486\n00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:12.480\nIt can literally bring that in, and you'll\nnotice that I can you know change this,\n\n487\n00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.020\nso it's not that it's a PDF,\nand it's uneditable,\n\n488\n00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.770\nit is something that I can actually edit\nand be able to work with right away.\n\n489\n00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.610\nBut anytime you have\nthose graphic elements,\n\n490\n00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:25.460\nanytime you have all these other things\nthat normally are also associated with\n\n491\n00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.365\na PDF, is probably not going\nto work as well for you.\n\n492\n00:25:28.365 --> 00:25:31.567\nYou'll probably end up also\nseeing little character marks\n\n493\n00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:35.163\nevery once in a while like a square\nthat's faded out or something.\n\n494\n00:25:35.163 --> 00:25:37.580\nIn other words, it was some mark\nit just couldn't interpret.\n\n495\n00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.310\nBut overall though, this is what you can\nhave if everything is actually set up.\n\n496\n00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.476\nBut if it's not, you'll see that it also\ndoes what we call a document reflowing,\n\n497\n00:25:45.476 --> 00:25:47.990\nand that's how Word does this.\n\n498\n00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.690\nWord takes a PDF document, even though\nthat's supposed to be locked in place, and\n\n499\n00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.670\nit'll reflow it to keep\nits reading compatibility.\n\n500\n00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.678\nSo it wants to make sure it actually\nis readable during the whole time.\n\n501\n00:25:57.678 --> 00:26:02.110\nAnd that reflow can work for you,\nit can also work against you.\n\n502\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.635\nWhen you open it up, so\nyou do have to be careful.\n\n503\n00:26:04.635 --> 00:26:08.515\nDon't assume that just because\nthe first 10 pages of your 200 page\n\n504\n00:26:08.515 --> 00:26:11.345\nthing that you've brought\nin is actually fine.\n\n505\n00:26:11.345 --> 00:26:13.205\nYou do need to inspect every page.\n\n506\n00:26:13.205 --> 00:26:17.525\nIf not, you'll find yourself with\nsurprises on 10 to 15, if not even more,\n\n507\n00:26:17.525 --> 00:26:19.885\nof those pages that you're not expecting.\n\n508\n00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:24.045\nAnd that's when it becomes disappointing,\nwhen you take the time to do all that.\n\n509\n00:26:24.045 --> 00:26:26.233\nBut as long as a document is mainly text,\nand\n\n510\n00:26:26.233 --> 00:26:30.613\nyou're willing to deal with the reflow, it\ndoesn't have to look exactly like the PDF,\n\n511\n00:26:30.613 --> 00:26:31.931\nthen you can also do this.\n\n512\n00:26:31.931 --> 00:26:34.932\nAnd bring it in, and at this point,\nyou can save it as a Word document and\n\n513\n00:26:34.932 --> 00:26:36.910\nbe able to actually work\nwith it in editing it.\n\n514\n00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.520\nAnd so large files that you might have\nsaid, oh yeah, that was saved as a PDF.\n\n515\n00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.390\nBut let's say that we wanted to\nrerelease it under my own publication.\n\n516\n00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.014\nI couldn't do that with Ardour.\n\n517\n00:26:46.014 --> 00:26:49.145\nBut let's say that we did have old\nmanuscripts that we wanted to do that\n\n518\n00:26:49.145 --> 00:26:51.530\nwith, but they were all saved as PDFs.\n\n519\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.320\nIt can do it.\n\n520\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.214\nSo it's actually a way that you can\nnow bring those old copies back and\n\n521\n00:26:56.214 --> 00:27:00.130\nbe able to actually edit,\nmodernize the text, get ready to go.\n\n522\n00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.330\n>> And I want to make sure I\nclarify what I said there.\n\n523\n00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:06.440\nI noticed that the Adobe PDF\nsays proprietary.\n\n524\n00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.610\nIt's not really that they released that.\n\n525\n00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.030\nI know that they did finally pass\nthat over to an ISO committee.\n\n526\n00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.541\nThere are still some components within it\nthat are proprietary which is, I think,\n\n527\n00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:20.674\nwhere some of the hang-up comes in where\nwe try to open something like that.\n\n528\n00:27:20.674 --> 00:27:25.399\nBut it's no longer proprietary,\nat least the PDF format.\n\n529\n00:27:25.399 --> 00:27:26.860\nFantastic stuff there, Ronnie.\n\n530\n00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.330\nI feel like we're really\nmaking some headway.\n\n531\n00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.140\nWe've learned about that interface,\nwe're able to navigate around,\n\n532\n00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.510\nnow we're starting to see how\nwe can create these documents.\n\n533\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:38.020\nYou either create it from scratch,\nif I know where I want to go and\n\n534\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.855\nwhat I want to do, or if I need a head\nstart or if I need a starting point,\n\n535\n00:27:41.855 --> 00:27:45.105\nMicrosoft has plenty of templates\nthat I can go out online,\n\n536\n00:27:45.105 --> 00:27:48.752\nand I can search, and I can maybe\nuse that as a jumping-off point.\n\n537\n00:27:48.752 --> 00:27:51.364\nI might find one that fits\nmy needs exactly, and\n\n538\n00:27:51.364 --> 00:27:54.495\nall I have to do is go in there and\nclick on a couple things,\n\n539\n00:27:54.495 --> 00:27:57.980\nreplace their filler text with my text and\nsave it, I'm done.\n\n540\n00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.772\nOr I might use it as a starting point and\nthen go ahead and\n\n541\n00:28:00.772 --> 00:28:02.840\ntweak it a little bit and make it my own.\n\n542\n00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.465\nSo fantastic stuff.\n\n543\n00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:08.310\nHeck, if I do something really cool,\nI can load it back up to the community and\n\n544\n00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.650\nlet other people take a look\nat my template that I created,\n\n545\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.200\nmaybe somebody else will find it useful.\n\n546\n00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.130\nWe saw how Word can open\nup different formats.\n\n547\n00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.370\nWe have older formats from\nprevious versions of Word as well\n\n548\n00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.325\nas formats from other applications,\n\n549\n00:28:23.325 --> 00:28:29.230\nnon-native Word formats is able\nto at least open them up usually.\n\n550\n00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.356\nMaybe not make it perfect,\nbut a good starting point.\n\n551\n00:28:32.356 --> 00:28:33.430\nSo great information there, Ronnie.\n\n552\n00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.550\nAny words for our viewers\nbefore we call this one an end?\n\n553\n00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:42.160\n>> Remember, that Word is kind of now,\nas you see, a fairly universal type\n\n554\n00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.840\nof program that you can use to help\nyou to begin creating your dockets.\n\n555\n00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.300\nSo don't be afraid to try it.\n\n556\n00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.630\nIt's not going to break Word,\n\n557\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.480\nif you happen to bring the document\nthat says it can't do it.\n\n558\n00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.250\nIt'll just tell you it can't do it.\n\n559\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.960\nSo if you're really just starting out,\ntry it.\n\n560\n00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.110\nWhy not, see what ends up happening.\n\n561\n00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:03.080\nIt may actually get you 90% of\nthe way you want to get started, and\n\n562\n00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.760\nthen from that point, you can use\nthe skills that you've already learned\n\n563\n00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.410\nto continue on and to modify, and\nthen to make what you actually need to.\n\n564\n00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.930\nBut this is a great place for us to begin,\nis understanding that we have so\n\n565\n00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.160\nmuch flexibility right\nthere inside of Word.\n\n566\n00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.295\nThat it really is one of most\nhelpful utilities that we can use,\n\n567\n00:29:19.295 --> 00:29:20.725\nif we have to deal with text.\n\n568\n00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:23.640\n>> Fantastic, all right, Ronnie,\nthanks for all that information.\n\n569\n00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.219\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n570\n00:29:25.219 --> 00:29:27.600\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n571\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.140\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n572\n00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.538\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n573\n00:29:29.538 --> 00:29:35.770\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:18.130\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130\nAnd today we're gonna be\nlooking at Word 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.150\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're gonna learn how to\n\n6\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.390\nnavigate around documents,\nuse our different selection tools,\n\n7\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.020\nespecially in these larger documents.\n\n8\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.420\nAnd who better to help us with\nthat than Mr. Ronnie Wong?\n\n9\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.010\nNow, Ronnie I know that the other day we\nstarted to get comfortable with Word and\n\n10\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550\nwe were able to navigate around,\nbut now I've got this really\n\n11\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.760\nlong document that somebody's giving me,\nand I've gotta go in and edit it and\n\n12\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.910\nmake some changes to it,\nfind certain things in there.\n\n13\n00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.590\nSo I'm hoping that maybe some of those\ntechniques that we looked at before\n\n14\n00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.640\ncould apply to this?\n\n15\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.910\n>> They really can.\n\n16\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.830\nInside of Word, remember that\nthe majority of the time when\n\n17\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.450\nyou're working at is not just gonna be\nopening up a document and then writing.\n\n18\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.460\nDon't get me wrong, if your job's\na writer, that maybe all you want to do.\n\n19\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.960\nBut even as a writer, a lot of\ntimes you're opening up things like\n\n20\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.770\nchapters that you're going back through\nand re-editing and rewriting, and\n\n21\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.250\ndoing a lot of things like that.\n\n22\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.420\nOr let's say that you are actually that\nassistant that's given this that says,\n\n23\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.850\nlook, you need to go\nthrough that document and\n\n24\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.020\nbe able to find these instances where I\nactually did something like this, and\n\n25\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.100\ngo through them, and then you look\ndown and you're like, wait a minute,\n\n26\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.285\nthat's a pretty long document,\nlike what Mike was saying.\n\n27\n00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:30.090\nThen now you're actually having to go,\nokay, if I read through this,\n\n28\n00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.980\nit's gonna take me half an hour, and\nthen I'm not finding everything.\n\n29\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.690\n>> Yeah, if it's a 200 page document,\nI'm looking for a word.\n\n30\n00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.340\nThat's like finding\na needle in a haystack.\n\n31\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.150\nThere's gotta be an easier way to do it.\n\n32\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.030\n>> There really are.\n\n33\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.250\nAnd the good thing is, Word has a lot of\ntools that are available that you and\n\n34\n00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.360\nI should at least feel\nsomewhat comfortable with.\n\n35\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.828\nAll of the ways that we\ncan actually go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:49.828 --> 00:01:53.830\nuse those built-in tools to help us\nto find exactly what we need to.\n\n37\n00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.076\nNow, remember, the manual way is pretty\nmuch the way that you probably learned\n\n38\n00:01:57.076 --> 00:02:00.241\nfrom the very beginning as you worked\nwith single-page documents, right?\n\n39\n00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:03.591\nHaving that eagle eye view where you\ncould read just every line, and go, okay,\n\n40\n00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:07.241\nI've proofed that, everything looks good,\nI like the way that it's formatted out,\n\n41\n00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:08.503\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n42\n00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.999\nBut now when you start working with\ndocuments that are, let's say, five pages,\n\n43\n00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.393\nten pages long, and then you start reading\nit and you start going through like,\n\n44\n00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:16.931\nthat doesn't make logical sense.\n\n45\n00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:20.854\nAnd now you have to go back and navigate\nback through it, and you keep scrolling,\n\n46\n00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:23.168\nand that scroll wheel\nworks perfectly fine.\n\n47\n00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:26.860\nAll of us use the scroll wheel to go back\nand forth between a couple of pages.\n\n48\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.650\nBut now when we start talking about 10 or\n20 pages, or a 200 page document that Mike\n\n49\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.530\nis referring to, now, it becomes much more\ndifficult, and most of us are gonna need\n\n50\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.160\nassistance in doing that, and Word really\ndoes help us to be able to do that.\n\n51\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.910\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look, then,\nat a document that I went ahead and\n\n52\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.717\npulled up, a fairly long document.\n\n53\n00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:50.160\nSo, this is a document that I've pulled in\nfrom public domain on the Internet, and\n\n54\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.071\nit's a relatively long document.\n\n55\n00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:55.549\nSo when you start looking at something\nlike this and you're told, hey,\n\n56\n00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.426\nyou need to go through here, and there are\ninstances that what we need to do is find\n\n57\n00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:03.160\na place where the word A appeared and\nwe need to replace it with an N.\n\n58\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.399\nIn other words an AN instead because well,\nif Ronnie had written the document and\n\n59\n00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.500\nlet's say that he just doesn't know that\nyou're supposed to use the N instead,\n\n60\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.310\nthat takes a long time when\nyou're replacing a single letter.\n\n61\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.078\nAnd when you do that, it can be done, but\n\n62\n00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:19.110\nyou do have to use the tools that\nare actually in there to help you out.\n\n63\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.868\nIf not, it means you're manually gonna\ngo through it, and you're just gonna go,\n\n64\n00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.550\nokay, every time I see an A by itself,\nI need to mark that and\n\n65\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.560\nthen make sure I replace it with N,\nbut that slows you down.\n\n66\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.560\nBut there are features and\ntools that are in there.\n\n67\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.020\nBut one of the things we wanna point out,\n\n68\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.810\nthough, is just when you start\ntaking look at this document,\n\n69\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.160\nright, let's make sure we understand\nthe scope of it to take a look here.\n\n70\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.036\nSo on my screen,\nthis is a 26-page document, and\n\n71\n00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:47.930\nI'm gonna try and zoom in here if\nI can to try and show you that.\n\n72\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.880\nRight down here in\nthe lower left-hand corner\n\n73\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.900\nyou can see where says page 1 of 26.\n\n74\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.475\nNow the text is a little bit small.\n\n75\n00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:57.520\nI'm zoomed in here,\ndoesn't look that great, but\n\n76\n00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.060\nI'm gonna actually zoom\nback out here in a moment.\n\n77\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.680\nAnd we want to make\nthis thing look better.\n\n78\n00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.960\nBut right at the beginning,\n\n79\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.790\nI just want to show you the idea\nof working with this long docket.\n\n80\n00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.250\n26 pages, if I had to go through and\nfind stuff, it would be very difficult.\n\n81\n00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.070\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n82\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.950\nI can't imagine going through trying to\nfind every instance of a particular word,\n\n83\n00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.640\ndoing it manually.\n\n84\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.640\nOne, I'm probably gonna\nget tired of doing that.\n\n85\n00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.210\nTwo, I'm probably gonna miss one or\ntwo, right.\n\n86\n00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.260\nAnd that's not gonna be a good thing,\n\n87\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.220\ncuz I think I'm done,\nI turn it in and they're like, nope,\n\n88\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.740\nyou didn't catch all of the occurrences\nof that word and now I'm in trouble.\n\n89\n00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.530\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a lot of this that goes on.\n\n90\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.690\nSo what are some of the tools that you and\nI can use just to find something?\n\n91\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.890\nWell, one of the easiest tools that we\nhave available, if we're not gonna try and\n\n92\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.440\ndepend on our eye sight in going\nthrough a 26 page document, of course,\n\n93\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.690\nis what we call the find tool\nthat's actually inside of Word.\n\n94\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.089\nSo, if I take a look then,\n\n95\n00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:52.600\nacross the top here of Word, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and click on the Home tab.\n\n96\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.530\nAnd then, over here on the right-hand\nside where there's the editing group,\n\n97\n00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.830\nnotice that we have a collection\nof those three tools again.\n\n98\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.370\nAnd I'm gonna kinda zoom in just briefly\nso that you can see it says Find,\n\n99\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.270\nReplace, and Select.\n\n100\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.240\nAnd those are the tools\nthat we are talking about.\n\n101\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.420\nNow, along with this,\nto help you to get more confident and\n\n102\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.610\ncomfortable with working with this,\n\n103\n00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.590\nof course, are those tools also end up\nhaving a shortcut associated with them.\n\n104\n00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.990\nAnd as you hover over each of those tools,\n\n105\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.852\nyou'll see that it also\nprovides you that shortcut.\n\n106\n00:05:23.852 --> 00:05:26.310\nSo for example, for the find tool,\n\n107\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.830\nwhich has a little icon of\na magnifying glass, it say Ctrl+F.\n\n108\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.010\nIf I were just looking for a particular\nword, I can do a Ctrl+F on my keyboard,\n\n109\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.130\nand that brings me to this\nnavigation pane over here.\n\n110\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.850\nAnd then I can type in\nthe word that I'm looking for.\n\n111\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.850\nSo if I wanted to I could type in, and\non this particular document I need to look\n\n112\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.680\nfor the word, and I'm not gonna be able\nto spell it right, is principalities.\n\n113\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.050\nAnd you're probably wondering like,\nwhat the heck did he pull up?\n\n114\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.230\nI pulled up the prints.\n\n115\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.070\nBecause there's actually a document\nthat was either in public domain, and\n\n116\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.410\nI was looking for words.\n\n117\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.140\nAnd now you can see where it\nactually goes through and\n\n118\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.620\nfinds every single one of\nthe words in this results here,\n\n119\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.910\nand shows me all the places where\nthe word principalities appears.\n\n120\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.790\nAnd you might be saying, well,\nhow the heck did you know it was in there?\n\n121\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.901\nCuz I actually read through the document.\n\n122\n00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:18.511\nAnd I said,\nhere's a word that appears over and\n\n123\n00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.240\nover again throughout this document.\n\n124\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.330\nBut if I wanted to,\nI could find that and see that.\n\n125\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.430\nSo a lot of times when you're actually\ntrying to work with something like this\n\n126\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.490\nand they tell you, you need to\nfind every instance of this and\n\n127\n00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.055\nreplace it with a word, and the reason\nwhy I'm not wanting to replace that with\n\n128\n00:06:33.055 --> 00:06:35.770\na word is, Mike, do you know what\nthe term principality means?\n\n129\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.925\n>> I don't.\n>> I did not know.\n\n130\n00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:41.007\nOf all things, I was like, of course\nI know what it means it means, no,\n\n131\n00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:43.905\napparently I don't know\nwhat it actually means.\n\n132\n00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:46.070\n>> [LAUGH] Can you use\nthat in a sentence please?\n\n133\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.496\n>> Yeah, can I use that in a sentence?\n\n134\n00:06:47.496 --> 00:06:49.516\nNot very easily.\n\n135\n00:06:49.516 --> 00:06:52.120\n>> So maybe we could replace\nthat with something that maybe\n\n136\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.070\nmakes a little more sense\nto our current times.\n\n137\n00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.280\n>> It really does.\n\n138\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.995\nSo the good thing is,\nyou might be wondering like I am.\n\n139\n00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:00.940\nOkay, so now I've gotta go and\n\n140\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.400\nfind a old dusty book that's on a shelf\nsomewhere that I used in school one time,\n\n141\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.810\nand I think there's a long\nword called a dictionary.\n\n142\n00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.350\nAnd try and look this out and\nfigure what this thing is about.\n\n143\n00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.970\nBut you really don't have to.\n\n144\n00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.220\nWord even helps you with that, and this is\nwhy it's great for things like editing and\n\n145\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.290\nrevising.\n\n146\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.800\nBecause when you're working\nwith a long document,\n\n147\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.460\ndon't get me wrong, I'm not saying that we\nshould abandon tools like dictionaries.\n\n148\n00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.693\nI'm definitely not saying that.\n\n149\n00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.279\nBut when you're having do this and\nyou're under the gun.\n\n150\n00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.680\nIn other words, they're telling you\nyou've got four hours to do this.\n\n151\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.660\nWell, do you go and\n\n152\n00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.690\ntry to spend 30 minutes in finding the\ndictionary that you lost at some point?\n\n153\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.450\nOr do you do like what most of us do,\ngo out to the Internet and try and\n\n154\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.340\nlook it up there?\n\n155\n00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.230\nYes, you could do that.\n\n156\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.080\nThat's probably the way that\nI would normally do it.\n\n157\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.431\nBut Word has something to\nhelp us out here as well, and\n\n158\n00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.897\nwhen we start to take a look at this one.\n\n159\n00:07:47.897 --> 00:07:49.917\nLet me make sure I'm actually\ntelling you right here.\n\n160\n00:07:49.917 --> 00:07:51.850\nIt is actually that.\n\n161\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.435\nSo notice then I have\nthis word principalities.\n\n162\n00:07:55.435 --> 00:08:00.387\nSo I'm going to select that word right\nthere inside of my doc that I did find it.\n\n163\n00:08:00.387 --> 00:08:04.384\nAnd then I can use\na command to help us out.\n\n164\n00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:09.659\nIf I hold the alt key down and\nthen I click with my mouse,\n\n165\n00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:15.640\nnotice that it brings up for\nwhat I call a research pane.\n\n166\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.490\nThe research pane says\nhey look here it is,\n\n167\n00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.770\nI use bing,\nI'm not going to denegrate that idea.\n\n168\n00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.350\nBut here's a search engine,\nright, that I can use.\n\n169\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.150\nAnd if I click on this drop down,\nI also have other reference\n\n170\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.880\nbooks that it wants me to be\nable to find out if I choose to.\n\n171\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.600\nBut I'm just gonna use the default.\n\n172\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.000\nAnd then it tells me right here,\nwhat is the principality Mike?\n\n173\n00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000\nIt says a state is ruled by a prince,\nokay?\n\n174\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.910\nSo in other words, somebody who's\nactually ruling this nation.\n\n175\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.790\nSo it's not a government based on roles,\n\n176\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:50.850\nit's actually someone who actually\nis a king within their own realm.\n\n177\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.390\nSo that's actually very good because\nthat now helps me to be able to say,\n\n178\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.600\nlook I need to find a work that will\nreplace Sunlight Principalities.\n\n179\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.170\nIf I were,\nactually if this were my document now\n\n180\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.760\nthat's actually a well known work\nI probably shouldn't replace it.\n\n181\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.750\nBut we're gonna do it anyways because well\nwe can and it's a great example for us.\n\n182\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.550\nSo if I were to try and\ncome up with a word,\n\n183\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.030\nthe best one that I could\ncome up I could say kingdom.\n\n184\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.300\nThat might actually work.\n\n185\n00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.750\nI like the term realm.\n\n186\n00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.630\nI like that because that actually\ndoes seem to indicate that somebody\n\n187\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.300\nrules this particular areas\nto be able to do that.\n\n188\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.680\nSo I know that I can find every instance\nof principality which is great but\n\n189\n00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.240\nnow I need to replace\nit with the word realm.\n\n190\n00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.940\n>> So you're going to go everywhere they\nfound it you're going to have to backspace\n\n191\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.200\nover that word and type in the word realm,\nthat sounds like a pain in the butt.\n\n192\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.870\n>> It is not going to be the easiest thing\nin the world but if you want to be safe\n\n193\n00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.470\nthat the safest way to do it as long\nyou can spell the word principality and\n\n194\n00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.000\nas long as you can spell the word realm.\n\n195\n00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.940\nYou are okay.\n\n196\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.850\nThe problem that we have is what\nif that appears so many times.\n\n197\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.790\nIf you are like me it's easy after two or\nthree times, right?\n\n198\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:01.080\nAnd all of a sudden we're on realm,\nR E A L M seems fine.\n\n199\n00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.110\nBut then as I start trying to\ntype that out all of a sudden my.\n\n200\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:09.580\nE and my A start getting, start to\nget switched in it's position there.\n\n201\n00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.180\nAnd that's something I\ndon't want to occur.\n\n202\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.270\nI want it to actually appear perfectly.\n\n203\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.365\nThe good thing is we can also use Word to\nhelp us to do that because not only not\n\n204\n00:10:17.365 --> 00:10:21.700\nonly is there a find tool that we showed\nyou in this upper right hand corner.\n\n205\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.990\nThere's also a replace\ntool up there as well.\n\n206\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.090\nSo what I can do is I can go and\nlook for a word.\n\n207\n00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:28.800\nI'm just gonna highlight.\n\n208\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.080\nI want to show you a different\nway that we can do this.\n\n209\n00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.540\nI can highlight that particular\nword which is principalities.\n\n210\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:42.050\nThen I can use control H, and\nwhen I do that, notice right here.\n\n211\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.950\nLet me see if I can zoom in on that.\n\n212\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.700\nYou can see where it actually\nautomatically put the word principalities\n\n213\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.980\ninside of the find what,\nand now, I can go back and\n\n214\n00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.400\nactually replace it with,\nlet's say, the word realm.\n\n215\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.660\nInstead realm.\n\n216\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.420\nSo if I do that what it should do is\nit should go through the document and\n\n217\n00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.620\nit actually has a search\ndirection that says search down.\n\n218\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.030\nAnd that means it is going to start from\nwhatever point that I actually had it on\n\n219\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.290\nand just look through to\nthe end of the document.\n\n220\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.890\nNow I can have it go ahead if I start\nit at the very top of the document.\n\n221\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.390\nWe could have also done that as well and\nhave it search all the way through.\n\n222\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.550\nAnd notice we have two options here, we\nhave a Replace and we have a Replace All.\n\n223\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.870\nNow whenever we actually do something\nlike that, we do need to be careful.\n\n224\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.410\nHopefully what should end up\nhappening is that we only replace\n\n225\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.130\nwith this one word that we call, realm.\n\n226\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:41.260\nBut this particular type of Find that\nWord if doing is a pattern match.\n\n227\n00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.960\nSo even though it actually says the word\nprincipality and we're actually replacing\n\n228\n00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:52.280\nwith this, Word doesn't see it as actually\na word, as a single isolated word itself.\n\n229\n00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.900\nWord see's it as a pattern.\n\n230\n00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.720\nSo I'm trying to think of a word\nthat might have this in here,\n\n231\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.640\nhopefully there's no\nword that has it in here.\n\n232\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.080\nBut in theory right,\nif I were to go ahead and\n\n233\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.470\nask you type in a word and\nif for some reason this pattern\n\n234\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.320\nwould be R E L M appears right in the\nmiddle of Word it will also replace it.\n\n235\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.240\nLike principality.\n\n236\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.890\n>> Like cat and category if you were\nsearching for cat it would find cat.\n\n237\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.940\nIt would also find category and\nreplace it.\n\n238\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.440\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n239\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.380\n>> So you gotta be\n\n240\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.842\ncareful when you start looking for\nstuff like this.\n\n241\n00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:26.650\nSo normally if I go ahead and\ndo this let's see.\n\n242\n00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.590\nWe've already found that\nprincipalities appear.\n\n243\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.220\nSo if I select replace,\nyou could see where now it says,\n\n244\n00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.460\nhow many kinds of rounds are there and\nnow it's actually going through.\n\n245\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.930\nNow you can do this one at a time,\nand that does take a long time.\n\n246\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.570\nOkay.\n\n247\n00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.050\nOr I could select replace all.\n\n248\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.300\nAnd now you can see where it\nsays 22 replacements were made,\n\n249\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.020\nnow do you continue to\nstart at the beginning?\n\n250\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.900\nAnd, if I select yes, there it is.\n\n251\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.900\nAll 22 replacements were done.\n\n252\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.260\nAnd that always sounds like a great idea.\n\n253\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.100\nUntil that one instance, and\nthen, all of a sudden, you did.\n\n254\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.390\nYou ended up replacing a word\nthat you didn't mean to replace.\n\n255\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.500\nSo, even though it's the fastest and\nquickest way to do something.\n\n256\n00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.860\nI personally don't recommend it.\n\n257\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.740\nI personally recommend that\nactually hit Replace each time.\n\n258\n00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.310\nSo that way you know if you come across\nand go, I didn't want to replace that,\n\n259\n00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.080\nyou simply actually just tell it to\nfind the next one instead and do that.\n\n260\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.620\nNow as long as you know that every single\ninstance of what you're gonna replace and\n\n261\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.370\nyou know that there's no other\nplace that it possibly will appear.\n\n262\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.520\nAnd you can do that perfectly use that.\n\n263\n00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.830\nThat's definitely the way to go but\nif youre not sure right.\n\n264\n00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.710\nIf you were just handed this document\nthat said hey I need to find that.\n\n265\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.010\nI would make sure I only do the replace\none at a time and make sure it fits.\n\n266\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.320\nIf not you're gonna go back and\nfind yourself in words that.\n\n267\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.070\nI didn't even know it\ncould be that word and\n\n268\n00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.210\nthat's because that pattern\nsearch we were talking about.\n\n269\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.730\nSo here's one of the easiest\nmethods that we can use, Mike,\n\n270\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.600\nto what you were talking about and\nsimply replacing it.\n\n271\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.810\nThe tools are out there and available.\n\n272\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.340\nWe can use it in combination\nwith that research and\n\n273\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.460\nwe see how without us\nhaving to do a lot more,\n\n274\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.810\nwe're actually able now to revise and even\nedit that document a little bit better.\n\n275\n00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.140\n>> Fantastic, I can see my\nworkload getting lighter already.\n\n276\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.880\nNow Ronnie, I saw you highlighting\na word before we did that.\n\n277\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.950\nAnd you just kinda clicked and dragged.\n\n278\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.130\nAnd I know there's a few ways we\ncan end up selecting text, right?\n\n279\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.820\n>> There really is, and\nthis is actually very important.\n\n280\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.890\nOne of the concepts that we always used\nwhen we talked about the concept of\n\n281\n00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:20.390\nteaching Word is that there's a three\nphrase method that we always used.\n\n282\n00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.130\nWe talked about, what is it,\nSelect to Effect, Hover to discover.\n\n283\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.340\n>> Hover to discover.\n\n284\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.025\nSee, those are the things that I forget.\n\n285\n00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:30.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hover to discover something especially\n\n286\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.470\nwhen you're using Word.\n\n287\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.410\nAnd then of course right click to fix\nsomething is what we've always said.\n\n288\n00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.180\nSo a lot of times, for us,\nwhen we need to know something and\n\n289\n00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.370\nwe want to affect especially something\nlike text we need to be able to select it.\n\n290\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.030\nNow inside of Word though, we always\nthink that we have this option, right?\n\n291\n00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.620\nThat we can select it very easily.\n\n292\n00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.410\nAnd you can but inside of documents like\nwhat we have there's a lot of words.\n\n293\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.550\nYou actually need to select more\nat times and less at times.\n\n294\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.530\nAnd so you can actually end\nup doing something like I do.\n\n295\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.740\nLet me show you an example\nof what ends up happening.\n\n296\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.380\nLet's say that I wanted to\nactually select the first five\n\n297\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.280\nparagraphs here in this document.\n\n298\n00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.950\nWell, I know that I can click and\ndrag down.\n\n299\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:14.270\nIt was five, hold on,\nfive hold on let me get back.\n\n300\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.180\n>> So that's kinda clunky there.\n\n301\n00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.060\n>> Yeah, it's a little clunky to try and\ndo something like that.\n\n302\n00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.870\nNow don't get me wrong,\nis there a way for me to slow that down?\n\n303\n00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.220\nI can go on and\nchange my settings on my mouse maybe.\n\n304\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.780\nHey it's a little bit slower,\nor I can try and\n\n305\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.990\nbe a very careful as I approach that edge.\n\n306\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.110\nBut you don't have to.\n\n307\n00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.060\nAnd the reason why is Word\nreally does help you up\n\n308\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.260\nwhen you talk about selecting text,\ndepending on what you need.\n\n309\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.600\nSo let me give you and example.\n\n310\n00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.680\nIf I only need to select one\nline of this document at a time,\n\n311\n00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.940\nover here on the left hand margin,\n\n312\n00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.125\nthis is left hand margins out of Word is\nactually a very special selecting area.\n\n313\n00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:51.840\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because all I have to do is click once.\n\n314\n00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.348\n>> And\nnotice that I can actually select that one\n\n315\n00:15:54.348 --> 00:15:56.927\nsingle line if I need to\nby just clicking once.\n\n316\n00:15:56.927 --> 00:16:00.548\nNow, I can do the same thing\nI just need to select.\n\n317\n00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:05.130\nA word, I can actually just double\nclick on a word and do that as well.\n\n318\n00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.490\nBut over here on the left margin though,\nI can't select a single word.\n\n319\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.210\nI can select a line,\n\n320\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.500\nthe other thing that I can do is\nI can select an entire paragraph.\n\n321\n00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.880\nI'm trying to move off so that mini\ntoolbar doesn't keep getting in the way,\n\n322\n00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.700\nbut if I'm needed to select let's\nsay this paragraph right here.\n\n323\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.400\nThis entire paragraph, right down here,\nI know I can click and drag.\n\n324\n00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.750\nAnd that's probably the easiest way.\n\n325\n00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.090\nMost of us have done that.\n\n326\n00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.210\nIt's probably the way that\nwe're more familiar with.\n\n327\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:34.050\nBut I can also use this margin over\nhere on left-hand side and double click.\n\n328\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.100\nWhen I double click, notice that\nallows me select the entire paragraph.\n\n329\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.090\nYou might wanna know, why the heck would\nI need to select the entire paragraph?\n\n330\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.720\nWell, there's things that we can do,\nright?\n\n331\n00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.440\nSo, let's say that we were\nrearranging this document, and\n\n332\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.910\nI'm doing injustice to this document.\n\n333\n00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.990\nI want you all to know, for\nthose of you that have studied this,\n\n334\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.890\nyou're probably like, no,\ndon't do that, but for right now.\n\n335\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:56.910\n>> Promise we'll change it back.\n\n336\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.390\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n337\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.960\nWe'll not save it, is what we'll do.\n\n338\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.580\nThis is how we would normally do it.\n\n339\n00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.180\nLet's say I need to move this\nparagraph to the one before it, right?\n\n340\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.540\nSo, I know I can select it, and\n\n341\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:13.230\nthen I can do my shortcut keys\nhere to control X and cut it.\n\n342\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.760\nAnd then I can click up here\nright after this paragraph.\n\n343\n00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.970\nAnd then do my control >\nV to paste it in there.\n\n344\n00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.480\nAll of us have probably\ndone something like that.\n\n345\n00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.100\nAnd that works.\n\n346\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.360\nAnd that's probably one of the fastest\nways that we can do things.\n\n347\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.790\nBut let me put everything back here,\nand we'll come back to this position.\n\n348\n00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.480\nIf I needed to, because I'm actually\nin the middle of revising or editing.\n\n349\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.030\nThis paragraph,\n\n350\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.770\nI wanna see how it actually looks above\nthe one that we just talked about.\n\n351\n00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.310\nWell, I can simply do\nmy double-click here.\n\n352\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.570\nAnd now that I've selected it,\nI can now click, and\n\n353\n00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.540\nI can drag it to just about\nthat same position here.\n\n354\n00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.450\nAnd then just do that.\n\n355\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.280\nSo notice we can select it to affect\nit like we were talking about here.\n\n356\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.170\nANd instead of us having to control c,\ncontrol x control v,\n\n357\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:06.710\nwe can actually do that, and that's\nwhat makes it a better revision tool or\n\n358\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.380\nediting tool by using some\nsimple things like that.\n\n359\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.510\nSo that left margin and\n\n360\n00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:16.450\nbeing able to click, is actually one of\nthe handiest things we can end up doing.\n\n361\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.990\nAnd also, one of the things that we were\ntalking about here, is remember that if\n\n362\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:26.210\nyou need to select an entire word, we know\nthat we can click and drag just one word.\n\n363\n00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.980\nNow this is actually one of\nthe things that I run into a lot.\n\n364\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.550\nNow Mike, watch what happens here.\n\n365\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.200\nLet me see if I can zoom in so\n\n366\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.090\nthat we can see it just a little\nbit better there, okay?\n\n367\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.760\nSo here it is.\n\n368\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.170\nI wanna select this word although.\n\n369\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.610\nSo I can try and drag, and\nactually that worked that time.\n\n370\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.470\nBut before, it was actually adding in\nthe and, when I was trying to do that, and\n\n371\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.350\nit keeps doing that.\n\n372\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.595\nWell, if I just need to select a single\nword, let me just go ahead and\n\n373\n00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:53.070\ndouble-click on it, and notice that\nallows me to select a single word.\n\n374\n00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.189\nNow what if I wanted,\nbecause let's say that the O and the U.\n\n375\n00:18:58.563 --> 00:19:00.550\nGot turned around.\n\n376\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.020\nAnd I know I can actually\ndo the spell check.\n\n377\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.210\nBut what if I just need to select\nthose two letters in the middle?\n\n378\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.720\nWell we actually have another\nway that we can do this as well.\n\n379\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.290\nInstead of trying to use like a track pad,\nwhich is one of the harder ones to do.\n\n380\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.890\nAnd the mouse,\nwe're getting pretty proficient at it.\n\n381\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.930\nBut inside of here, I instead can\nactually use, well my Shift and\n\n382\n00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.760\nmy right arrow and that actually allows\nme to select both of those instead.\n\n383\n00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.690\nSo I can have incredibly detailed control,\nif I just needed to select\n\n384\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.629\njust those little options with\nsomething like that, if we wanted to.\n\n385\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.590\nYeah, so it's a lot of different\nthings that we can do.\n\n386\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.510\n>> Now Ronnie, another thing that happens\nto me when I'm editing these really long\n\n387\n00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.480\ndocuments is, I'm going through page\nafter page, and I need a break.\n\n388\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.400\nSo I get up, maybe I have to close\nthings down, go to lunch, come back.\n\n389\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.240\nI want to be able to\npick up where I left off,\n\n390\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.890\nbut I can never remember\nwhere I was in that document.\n\n391\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.830\nWas I on page 13, page 25,\npage 200, where was I at?\n\n392\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.580\nThere are so\nmany times when that ends up happening.\n\n393\n00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.900\nThe very fact is we're working on\ndocuments, especially a long document like\n\n394\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.230\nthis, and may be that we can't get\nit done in the time that we believe.\n\n395\n00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.630\nWhat ends up happening, of course,\nis that you forget about it.\n\n396\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.200\nYou go to work on something else.\n\n397\n00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.120\nAnd then you come back, and\n\n398\n00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.520\nyou really can't remember where\nin the world that you left off.\n\n399\n00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.820\nAnd sometimes you do like I do.\n\n400\n00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.660\nLet me kind of show you an example.\n\n401\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.700\nSo let's say that I'm scrolling through\nthis, and I'm doing my revision and\n\n402\n00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.000\nmy editing and\ndoing everything that I need here.\n\n403\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.690\nI'm trying to get down toward the end.\n\n404\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.690\nLet me scroll down.\n\n405\n00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.730\nLet's say it's somewhere about here.\n\n406\n00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.580\nAnd then Mike says, hey Ronnie I\nneed you to work on something.\n\n407\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.408\nAnd I accidentally don't think\nabout it and I don't save.\n\n408\n00:20:38.408 --> 00:20:39.330\n>> Oh, no.\n\n409\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.470\n>> Uh-oh, there we go.\n\n410\n00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.940\nSo now some different issues have now\nhappened, where this document is not\n\n411\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.680\nopening up, because now I've closed it\nout, I didn't save any of the changes.\n\n412\n00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.660\nThe good thing is in Word 2016\nthey have decided to do something.\n\n413\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.090\nEverything that you don't save,\nWord says we're saving it.\n\n414\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.360\nWe're saving it in the background,\nwe're hiding it, and let's all do that\n\n415\n00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.850\ntechnology that we call the idea of the\nshadow copy stuff is all built in there.\n\n416\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.920\nIn other words it's actually saving it,\nand so\n\n417\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.670\nthere's a, you now Ronnie may have\ndone something well fairly idiotic,\n\n418\n00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.400\nsuch as closing out of that\ndocument after working on it.\n\n419\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.080\nAnd he's not gonna remember where he was.\n\n420\n00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.241\nThe good thing is Word says,\nlook let me do this for you okay.\n\n421\n00:21:20.241 --> 00:21:23.382\nWord will automatically\nset a book mark for\n\n422\n00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:23.910\nyou\n>> Hm.\n\n423\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:24.990\n>> Is what it will do.\n\n424\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.570\nA bookmark is exactly what it sounds like.\n\n425\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.760\nIf you read a book and\nyou're like me you read it at night.\n\n426\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.150\nYou just put a bookmark in there,\nthe next day you come back and\n\n427\n00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.620\nsay oh that's where I left off.\n\n428\n00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.670\nYou're able to do that.\n\n429\n00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.790\nSo let me pull that document.\n\n430\n00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.110\nUnless I picked the wrong document.\n\n431\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.760\nThat would be silly.\n\n432\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.340\nLet me do that.\n\n433\n00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.810\nLet me pull that document back up and\nI opened it.\n\n434\n00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.510\nAnd now we need to see\nthe full screen here,\n\n435\n00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.060\nthat way we can see the message\nthat actually appeared.\n\n436\n00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.830\nI'll try and do that.\n\n437\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:47.870\nThere it is.\n\n438\n00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.070\nIt says look welcome.\n\n439\n00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.840\nPick up where you left off.\n\n440\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.480\nNotice that.\nSo automatically it says look there's\n\n441\n00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.340\na chance especially in\na relatively long document.\n\n442\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.580\nThat Ronnie doesn't remember that,\n\n443\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.120\nand so here,\nall I have to do is go ahead and click.\n\n444\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.390\nAnd now it brings me back down, and there\nit was on page 16 of 26, and that actually\n\n445\n00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.400\ndepends on where the cursor left off that\nit's able to be able to find that for us.\n\n446\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.770\nSo we can actually use Words\nown ability to sit there and\n\n447\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.660\ngo, there's chances that the user may not\nhave thought what they were doing, and\n\n448\n00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.510\nit automatically does that.\n\n449\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.145\nAnd even know that works for you,\nyou don't want to depend on it, okay.\n\n450\n00:22:26.145 --> 00:22:27.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now I'm not saying you can't,\n\n451\n00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.940\nbecause it's worked perfectly\nfine every time I've done it.\n\n452\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.510\nYou don't want to depend on that, so what\nyou want to do though, is know that there\n\n453\n00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.790\nis a manual way that you and\nI can set bookmarks is what we want to do.\n\n454\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.420\n>> Yeah, I think a better practice to\nteach everybody would be don't rely\n\n455\n00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.170\non it to autosave, and\n\n456\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.960\nput that bookmark, so you're saying\n>> There's a way that I can make my\n\n457\n00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.140\nown bookmark, and\nthat way I can save it, close it.\n\n458\n00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.990\nWhen I come back, I can jump right\nto that point in the document.\n\n459\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.380\n>> That's exactly what you want to do.\n\n460\n00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.240\nAnd you can do it for many reasons.\n\n461\n00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.140\nAnd the primary reason is\nexactly what we talked about.\n\n462\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.310\nIf we're doing revisions,\n\n463\n00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.370\nand we know that there's a ton\nof revisions that we've done.\n\n464\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:06.230\nAnd that we wanna pick up right there.\n\n465\n00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.330\nManually setting it is\nby far the safest way,\n\n466\n00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:12.660\nbecause this actually gives you the\nability to leave an actual bookmark that\n\n467\n00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.870\nyou can understand, and\nknow where you've actually done things.\n\n468\n00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.460\nSo let me kinda give you\nan example of how you can do that.\n\n469\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.840\nSo let's say that what I wanted to do is.\n\n470\n00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.390\n>> When I finished, you know a portion\nof the chapter, I wanted to go ahead and\n\n471\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.310\nmark something and make it a bookmark.\n\n472\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.440\nSo I'm just gonna select chapter one here.\n\n473\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.340\nAnd that way when I do so,\nI wanna create a bookmark out of that.\n\n474\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:42.354\nThe way that we do that, is once we\nhave selected it I can go to insert, and\n\n475\n00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:47.719\nthen under the links grouping on that\ninsert ribbon, I can select bookmark.\n\n476\n00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:52.094\nAnd now I can go in here,\nand I can type in Chapter 1.\n\n477\n00:23:52.094 --> 00:23:55.975\nSo I'll keep the same format and\nthen click Add.\n\n478\n00:23:55.975 --> 00:23:57.886\nSo we can go in there and we can do that.\n\n479\n00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:00.179\nNow you don't always have to do\nit with something like that.\n\n480\n00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:04.381\nLet's say that you're in the middle\nof looking up something like Milan to\n\n481\n00:24:04.381 --> 00:24:08.955\nFrancisco Sforza, which I can't believe\nI actually tried to pronounce that.\n\n482\n00:24:08.955 --> 00:24:09.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there we go.\n\n483\n00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.800\nSo I can actually select that and\nthen do another bookmark here.\n\n484\n00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.431\nAnd instead just call this one,\n\n485\n00:24:18.431 --> 00:24:22.740\nhey, looking up S-F-O-R-Z-A.\n\n486\n00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, something like that.\n\n487\n00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.190\nNow notice that it doesn't like that.\n\n488\n00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.820\nSo it's not actually allowing\nme to add that in there.\n\n489\n00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.390\nAnd that's because of these spaces,\nI believe, yep.\n\n490\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:36.670\nIt actually wants a single name, no spaces\nin there, and then I can add that in.\n\n491\n00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.654\nAnd just by using something like that,\nthen when we come back to this document,\n\n492\n00:24:39.654 --> 00:24:41.070\nwe can select bookmarks, and\n\n493\n00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:46.340\nthen we can see whether we're looking\nat it by the name or this location.\n\n494\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.860\nAnd I had previously created\nthis other bookmarks in here so\n\n495\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.200\nthat we can see what it does.\n\n496\n00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.610\nCuz I only went like one page in, so let's\nsay that I was working at chapter 10.\n\n497\n00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:59.470\nI simply select Chapter 10, and\nthen I can select Go To, and\n\n498\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.490\nnotice that that automatically\ntakes me down here.\n\n499\n00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.300\nNow that's a great navigation tool,\nespecially on long documents.\n\n500\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.530\nYou may not have to use it.\n\n501\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.070\nAnd you can't use it\nwhen it's printed out.\n\n502\n00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:13.950\nBut you may not use it as a formal way\nto create navigation tools, but you can.\n\n503\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.520\nYou can do this, and that way if somebody\ndoes want to read from chapter 10, and\n\n504\n00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.140\nyou actually set it up as a Word document,\nthey can come back in here and\n\n505\n00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.590\nuse the tools that you've\nautomatically created.\n\n506\n00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.410\nLater on if you don't want those in there,\njust delete them right out and\n\n507\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:27.650\nyou're ready to go.\n\n508\n00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.390\nSo just a simple navigation like that\nwill really help you to focus in\n\n509\n00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.160\non the sections that you really need to.\n\n510\n00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.950\nA great little navigation tool for us.\n\n511\n00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.510\n>> Absolutely.\n\n512\n00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.270\nThe fact that I can set up my\nown bookmarks wherever I want in\n\n513\n00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:38.860\nthat document,\n\n514\n00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.640\nI can have all these basically jump\npoints that I can go to any time I need.\n\n515\n00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.440\nI close the document.\n\n516\n00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.500\nI come back.\n\n517\n00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.670\nI can pick up right where I left off or\n\n518\n00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.530\nany of the other bookmarks\nthat I've created.\n\n519\n00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.660\nAnd the fact that Word will do it for me,\n\n520\n00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.500\nif I have one of those-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n521\n00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.260\n>> Slow moments and\n\n522\n00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:00.532\nI forget to save that document, it's\ngonna hopefully keep my changes for me.\n\n523\n00:26:00.532 --> 00:26:03.460\nWe can get a little recovery, but\nit's gonna make that bookmark so\n\n524\n00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.800\nI can start where I left off,\nand that's a great thing.\n\n525\n00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.270\nI've noticed that, Ronnie, with Word,\nand before I knew even what it was,\n\n526\n00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.980\nI opened up a document and says,\ndo you wanna continue where you left off?\n\n527\n00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.140\nI'm like, huh, that's kinda cool.\n\n528\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.650\nSo really neat feature there.\n\n529\n00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.480\nWe saw how to select text.\n\n530\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.310\nThat's an important part of\nworking with any document.\n\n531\n00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.760\nIf I'm gonna modify something,\nif I'm gonna move something,\n\n532\n00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.790\nif I'm gonna change something,\nI've got to be able to select it first.\n\n533\n00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.550\nSo you showed us a couple really cool\ntechniques to be able to select that text,\n\n534\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.010\nthat left margin, that special\nselection area, double clicking for\n\n535\n00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.940\nan entire paragraph, very cool.\n\n536\n00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.180\nAnd then the fact that I can\njust drag a paragraph around.\n\n537\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.830\nI don't have to go through all\nthe trouble of cutting it and pasting it.\n\n538\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.930\nHeck, I can just click and drag.\n\n539\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:46.030\nYou know some of us prefer using\nthe mouse over the keyboard shortcuts.\n\n540\n00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.035\nAnd Word has given us those choices there,\nwe also saw.\n\n541\n00:26:49.035 --> 00:26:52.000\nHow to go through and\nfind all instances of a word and\n\n542\n00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.620\nmaybe replace it with something\nthat's a little more modern.\n\n543\n00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.600\nI'm thinking of department names change,\nand I've got to go through this entire\n\n544\n00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.020\nhandbook and change the word\npersonnel to human resources.\n\n545\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.410\nAnd I can see where something like\nthat would make that extremely easy.\n\n546\n00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:12.580\nAnd the fact that I can replace\nthem all or I can go one at a time.\n\n547\n00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.410\nFantastic stuff, and\nthen of course those bookmarks at the end.\n\n548\n00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:16.630\nGreat stuff, Ronnie.\n\n549\n00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:17.430\nWell, thanks for all that.\n\n550\n00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.950\nThanks for those great examples there.\n\n551\n00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:23.330\nI feel like I'm able now to work\nwith these larger documents,\n\n552\n00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.110\na little more confidence, and\nmaybe a little less stress,\n\n553\n00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.090\nand be a little more efficient at that.\n\n554\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.580\nAny parting words for our viewers?\n\n555\n00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.960\n>> The key here, right, especially when\nyou start working with longer documents.\n\n556\n00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.540\nI know it seems strange,\ncuz we're so set in our ways, right?\n\n557\n00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.050\nYou have one way of doing it.\n\n558\n00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.660\nBut the more that you're\nwiling to use tools like this,\n\n559\n00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.130\nlike the bookmarks that we talked about,\nthose insertions, and\n\n560\n00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.270\nbeing able to do that,\nit makes you much more proficient, and\n\n561\n00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.920\nespecially when working with large\ndocuments, you want to do this.\n\n562\n00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.630\nThe reason why is that the more that you\nreally do let Word help you with those\n\n563\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:59.700\ndocuments, it's gonna help you in\ncreating more complex things later on,\n\n564\n00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.240\nwhen you start talking about things like\ntable of contents and different things.\n\n565\n00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.500\nYou're actually setting in place those\nstructures instead of you going,\n\n566\n00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.300\nokay, now I need to create that.\n\n567\n00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.910\nOh, I should have created a bookmark.\n\n568\n00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:11.860\nOh, I didn't do that.\n\n569\n00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.330\nWhatever it might be, right?\n\n570\n00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.010\nSo by just getting used to these\ntools that are available to\n\n571\n00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.420\nyou is really gonna help you out.\n\n572\n00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.170\nAnd let me show an example just\nreal quickly of this last little\n\n573\n00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.600\none before we go.\n\n574\n00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.840\nSo there's also something\nthat we call the Go To.\n\n575\n00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.370\nAnd I just showed you kind of an example\n\n576\n00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.210\nof doing that especially\nwith the bookmarks.\n\n577\n00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:34.010\nBut if I do a Ctrl + G, let me see if\nI can click on that, notice that it\n\n578\n00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.500\nactually has these different\nsections that are actually in place.\n\n579\n00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.250\nPage, section, link,\nbookmark, comment, footnotes,\n\n580\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.700\nfield, graphics, tables,\nobjects, headings.\n\n581\n00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.960\nAs you start using more and\nmore of these different tools, right?\n\n582\n00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.970\nThis is what allows you to actually\neven be faster in your navigation,\n\n583\n00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.340\nbecause now these things are set up\nin place for that entire document.\n\n584\n00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.990\nAnd now you can go, I don't know\nexactly what I was looking for.\n\n585\n00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.020\nBut I know that it's\nactually the next table.\n\n586\n00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.430\nWell, now you actually have\nthat ability to do so.\n\n587\n00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.350\nMore headings,\n\n588\n00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.690\nmore anything else, you have that ability\nto use those tools that are available.\n\n589\n00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.925\nAnd that's what you really want to do when\nyou start getting the 100-page documents\n\n590\n00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:10.460\nand 200-page documents.\n\n591\n00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.510\nThese are gonna become\nmore essential to you,\n\n592\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:18.450\nbecause it's structures that Word already\nrecognizes, and that's what you want.\n\n593\n00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.490\nYou want to take advantage of\nthe power inside of Word, and\n\n594\n00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.060\nby you just learning a little bit,\n\n595\n00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.770\ncreating a bookmark didn't seem that\ndifficult using the find and the replace.\n\n596\n00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.300\nLooked like it actually\ndid work fairly well.\n\n597\n00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.300\nBeing able to do just a little\nbit of those shortcuts, right?\n\n598\n00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.160\nAll that goes into helping\nall those efficiencies.\n\n599\n00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.530\nAs small, as tiny as they are,\nthey add up in the end,\n\n600\n00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.981\nand they really do make you more\nof an efficient user of Word and\n\n601\n00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:45.570\nmake you better to work with\nthose longer documents.\n\n602\n00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.250\n>> Very good.\n\n603\n00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.390\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n604\n00:29:49.390 -->

--> 00:00:21.110\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing Word 2016, and specifically,\n\n4\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.400\nwe're gonna be looking at how we\ncan go about formatting a document.\n\n5\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.130\nAnd when we talk about formatting a\ndocument, we're trying to pretty it up or\n\n6\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.380\nmake it look more professional or less\nplain or however you wanna look at it.\n\n7\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.030\nAnd who better to help us with that than\nthe Master of Word, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.740\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.810\n>> It is going well.\n\n10\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.550\nIt's another great day to be right\nhere as we continue to learn more\n\n11\n00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.210\nabout working with Word 2016.\n\n12\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.610\nRemember that there's a ton of\ntools that are in there, and\n\n13\n00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.860\na lot of times the idea of actually using\nWord is not just about creating documents,\n\n14\n00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.820\neven though that's a big,\nimportant part of it.\n\n15\n00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.340\nIt really is.\n\n16\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.490\nIt's about taking the information and\nmaking it look better.\n\n17\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.170\n>> Yeah, you know Ronnie, I've worked with\nWord and I've typed up some big documents\n\n18\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.000\nbefore, and I get done with them and\nthey're just flat, they're plain.\n\n19\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.820\nAnd I see other people's documents,\nthey've got flair to them,\n\n20\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.540\nthey just look polished, and mine don't,\nso I'm hoping you can help me with that.\n\n21\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.510\n>> Well we are, we're going to take a look\nat some of the ways that we can format\n\n22\n00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.020\na document,\nthat will really add a little bit more to,\n\n23\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.340\nwell what we're actually given here,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.900\nSo, a lot of times, when we actually start\nmissing things, it is because our eyes\n\n25\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.250\nare actually getting caught on attention,\nyou know, of some place inside a document.\n\n26\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.860\nIt could be that they added in a nice\ntitle that helps separate those\n\n27\n00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.970\nsections out.\n\n28\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.980\nIt could be that they're doing that.\n\n29\n00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.080\nAnd those are individual formattings\nthat we can do for words but\n\n30\n00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.780\nwhat about the entire document itself?\n\n31\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.550\nHow do we actually make the entire\ndocument flow better, look better and\n\n32\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.140\nactually do what we\nreally want it to do and\n\n33\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.800\nhave a consistent overall style as well?\n\n34\n00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.700\nAnd that's what we're really talking about\nwhen we start taking a look at this.\n\n35\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.230\nSo one of the first things\nthat we wanna take a look at,\n\n36\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.390\nright, is the overall page layout and\nformat that we're taking a look here.\n\n37\n00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.340\nWhich is, of course,\nis setting up the actual pages.\n\n38\n00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.390\nSo here it is,\n\n39\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.480\nwe've actually been working with this\ndocument throughout our show so far.\n\n40\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.650\nAnd this is a long document that\nI actually was able to download.\n\n41\n00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.510\nAnd so, right here let's take a look.\n\n42\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.120\nAnd as you take a look and\nyou see this document,\n\n43\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.540\nit is separated out into paragraphs and\nthere's a little bit of formatting.\n\n44\n00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.540\nYou can see where it looks like\nthe sections have all capital letters,\n\n45\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.660\nand even the title, and\nof course, the chapter.\n\n46\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.560\nSo there's a bare minimal of formatting,\nbut\n\n47\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.490\nit doesn't really attract me if\nI were needing to read this.\n\n48\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.434\nAnd also, there's nothing on the pages\nhere that really helped me out.\n\n49\n00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:46.375\nIf I were to lose this page somehow,\nhow do I know that I needed to start here,\n\n50\n00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:48.240\nor that I need to start here?\n\n51\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.068\nThe pages look almost\nidentical in what we see, so\n\n52\n00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:57.640\nthere's no indication that something\nis actually ready for us to read.\n\n53\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.100\nDon't get me wrong,\nyou can read it perfectly fine.\n\n54\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.750\nBut it really doesn't,\nthere's no attraction to it.\n\n55\n00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.870\nThe formatting itself lends itself\nto not really be appealing.\n\n56\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.370\nAnd that's what we want to change.\n\n57\n00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.040\nSo, one of the easiest\nways to change this,\n\n58\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.820\nof course, is by affecting\nthe overall page format itself.\n\n59\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.890\nAnd the way that we do that,\nis by coming up here to the layout tab.\n\n60\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.380\nAnd I select the layout tab, notice that\nhere we have a string of different tools\n\n61\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.240\nthat we really do want to consider each\nand every one of those as we go through.\n\n62\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.040\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin on that just briefly.\n\n63\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.440\nI don't want to do too much,\nbecause it is kind of broken.\n\n64\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.270\nOh, I keep moving, and\nthat's really where the problem comes in.\n\n65\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.960\nLet me do it one more time, see if I can.\n\n66\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.680\nControl and okay.\n\n67\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.620\nSo in the upper right hand corner we\njust have the regular page set up and\n\n68\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.030\nyou can see where we can change margins,\norientation size, and\n\n69\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.130\neven create columns and even some other\nthings breaks, line numbers, hyphenation.\n\n70\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.230\nIn the center of course paragraphs.\n\n71\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.810\nHow do I want the paragraphs setup do I\nwant to actually add in some indentions,\n\n72\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.740\nsome spacing before and after the\nparagraphs and then we can even go in to\n\n73\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.990\ntalk about arrangements if we\nwanted to add in some other things.\n\n74\n00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.390\nBut let's just start here by just\naffecting the page layout and\n\n75\n00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.590\nsee if that really helps us out any.\n\n76\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.630\nSo one of the first things that we can do\nis just simply affect the overall margin.\n\n77\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.436\nNow, this actually uses\nthe standard margins that you and\n\n78\n00:04:18.436 --> 00:04:20.964\nI would normally use for\na regular business letter.\n\n79\n00:04:20.964 --> 00:04:23.680\nThat sounds great except that\nthis is not a business letter.\n\n80\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.570\nOkay so if it's not a business letter it\nmay not be of course the best format for\n\n81\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.390\na document as long as this.\n\n82\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.900\nLet's say it actually is which\nis what it is a little booklet.\n\n83\n00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.260\nYou know,\nthat Machiavelli actually did write.\n\n84\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.050\nSo, it kind of wasn't designed to\nbe in that business letter format.\n\n85\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.670\nSo, if you and I were to think about it;\nabout what we actually like to see and how\n\n86\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.270\nwe would want to present this, notice that\nwe have these different options, right?\n\n87\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.240\nWhere we can go through and\n\n88\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.870\njust change the actual margins to our\nstandard page that we have, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.730\nNow if I know that I'm going to actually\nbe printing this out in eight by ten,\n\n90\n00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.860\nthat actually works.\n\n91\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.270\nBecause now I can actually adjust those\nmargins to help me out to do what I want.\n\n92\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.590\nBut what if I realize something.\n\n93\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.050\nIf I were to present this for some type of\ndocument, whether it was for printing or\n\n94\n00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.380\nfor reading I would probably instead\nchange the overall page size itself too.\n\n95\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.080\nSo instead of saying,\n\n96\n00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.600\nI want this to be a legal size I might\nchange it down to something else.\n\n97\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.700\nIf I scroll on down through here you\ncan see that we can even do postcard,\n\n98\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.320\nexecutive, double edge,\npost card double long edge.\n\n99\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.980\nYou got me on some of\nthese different things.\n\n100\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.430\nBut you can see that there's envelopes,\n\n101\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.080\nthere's legal size, executive,\nthis A4 here, you name it.\n\n102\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.780\nThere's actually different ways that\nwe can actually pick paper sizes, and\n\n103\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.780\nif we need to, we can even customize and\nchoose even more.\n\n104\n00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.270\nSo, there are a lot of different options\nthat we have the ability to change here.\n\n105\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.030\nSo let's just say this, because I don't\nknow what all the paper sizes are,\n\n106\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.720\nwe're gonna leave it at the eight and\na half by eleven cuz now we're actually\n\n107\n00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.700\ngetting those areas where\nsomebody's keen eye will go, oh no,\n\n108\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.630\nyou'd rather wanna actually make\nsure that it's this way instead.\n\n109\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.080\nThe other thing, of course,\nis, well, orientation.\n\n110\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.500\nSo I can change this to\nactually be a wide format\n\n111\n00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.930\ninstead of the standard portrait format.\n\n112\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.190\nWell as I know the way that the books\ntend to read, I like that kind of long,\n\n113\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.700\nnarrow margin instead, and\nnot in that other layout.\n\n114\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.940\nSo you have that ability to create so\n\n115\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.080\nmany different options here, by just\ntaking a look at the paper size and\n\n116\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.110\nthe margins, as well as this\norientation to make it look better.\n\n117\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.710\nSo let me change these\nmargins a little bit more.\n\n118\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.240\nSo I'm gonna come down here and\ncustomize the margin.\n\n119\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.930\nAnd notice that I do have\nkind of the same thing.\n\n120\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.250\nSo, even though it says page setup and\nyou might go hey look,\n\n121\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.330\nthat paper is right there, each of\nthese is actually part of that little\n\n122\n00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.770\ndialog box launcher in the lower right\nhand corner of the page setup grouping.\n\n123\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.100\nSo this is where you actually get all\nthose details that we were talking about\n\n124\n00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.160\na little bit more before.\n\n125\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.640\nSo let's say that here on\nthe top edge margin, and\n\n126\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.020\nthis actually applies to every single\npage, so you do want to be careful.\n\n127\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.600\nYou can say how much do I want\nas far as the top edge goes?\n\n128\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.690\nPerfectly fine, that worked for me.\n\n129\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.500\nOne inch is probably a good margin for us.\n\n130\n00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.310\nBut let's say that on the left and right\nhand side, though, I wanna increase those.\n\n131\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.594\nSo let's say that on the left hand side I\nwanna increase this to one and a half, and\n\n132\n00:07:22.594 --> 00:07:26.185\nlet's say on the right hand side,\nwe'll do another one and a half,\n\n133\n00:07:26.185 --> 00:07:27.265\njust as an example.\n\n134\n00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:32.090\nOkay, now the other thing that will\nalso help us out is this preview right?\n\n135\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.073\nSo if I wanted to take a look at that idea\nof how those paragraphs should line up,\n\n136\n00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:41.451\nthis is what we're tending to take\na look at and we can see right here,\n\n137\n00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:44.846\nlet me change this back down to a 1 for\njust a moment and\n\n138\n00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:48.433\nthen let me go back to that\nmargin size that I was just in.\n\n139\n00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:51.797\nSo, you can see where it actually\ndoes layout a little bit easier for\n\n140\n00:07:51.797 --> 00:07:53.519\nwhat we're actually looking at.\n\n141\n00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:57.055\nAnd then, what we can also do,\nis have this gutter position,\n\n142\n00:07:57.055 --> 00:07:58.418\nthat's also here too.\n\n143\n00:07:58.418 --> 00:08:00.901\n>> Now what is the gutter position about?\n\n144\n00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:04.183\nThis adds in a little bit\nmore cushion to a margin.\n\n145\n00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:09.002\nLet's say, for example, I select left\nmargin and I realize as I bind this\n\n146\n00:08:09.002 --> 00:08:13.591\nbook up that somebody's asked for\nanother quarter inch of a gutter and\n\n147\n00:08:13.591 --> 00:08:18.611\nthat means that they can bind it up\ninto a book and so I might do 0.25 here.\n\n148\n00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:22.306\nAnd you can see where they now added in\nthis little kind of rough edge over here\n\n149\n00:08:22.306 --> 00:08:23.981\non the left-hand side that says,\n\n150\n00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:26.717\nlook the binder's gonna take\nup another quarter inch.\n\n151\n00:08:26.717 --> 00:08:31.536\nAnd that way, I still keep that 1.5\ninch margin on the left-hand side, but\n\n152\n00:08:31.536 --> 00:08:33.509\nactually create the ability for\n\n153\n00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:37.598\nthem to take all those pages that\nmay not have to be bond together and\n\n154\n00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:41.786\nput the stitch in or put that plastic\nvine drawn, whatever we want.\n\n155\n00:08:41.786 --> 00:08:45.535\n>> I know we've all dealt with a couple of\nbooks or pamphlets where they didn't think\n\n156\n00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:48.957\nabout that and they've bound that book\ndown the left-hand side and to read\n\n157\n00:08:48.957 --> 00:08:52.521\nthose pages, you gotta really stretch\nit to get down into that gutter there.\n\n158\n00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.740\nSo fantastic, they give you\nthe ability to think about that.\n\n159\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.993\nWhile you're working with a document,\nyou can bump that text over a little bit.\n\n160\n00:08:58.993 --> 00:09:00.434\nGive that extra space you need.\n\n161\n00:09:00.434 --> 00:09:03.004\n>> Yeah, so just the spacing\nitself will really help out,\n\n162\n00:09:03.004 --> 00:09:06.186\nespecially if you're dealing with\nthings like print a lot of times.\n\n163\n00:09:06.186 --> 00:09:10.350\nAnd if you are actually gonna be printing\nthis out, you do want to consider things\n\n164\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.717\nlike those gutter positions as well and\nthen previewing, of course, can see that.\n\n165\n00:09:14.717 --> 00:09:18.254\nYou can choose whether you want to\napply it to the whole document or\n\n166\n00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:19.616\nfrom one point forward.\n\n167\n00:09:19.616 --> 00:09:22.366\nSo it might be where you are actually\ncreating this document, but\n\n168\n00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:24.777\nyou want to actually have\nthe regular standard margins.\n\n169\n00:09:24.777 --> 00:09:26.577\nLet's say, on the first page, but\n\n170\n00:09:26.577 --> 00:09:29.824\nthen every other page is actually\noffset the way that we have it.\n\n171\n00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:34.505\nOnce again, Word is really helpful in\nwhat it is that we choose to do with at\n\n172\n00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.173\nleast margins like that.\n\n173\n00:09:36.173 --> 00:09:37.613\nIf that's what we want.\n\n174\n00:09:37.613 --> 00:09:44.196\nOf course, you do want to be\ncareful on how you choose that.\n\n175\n00:09:44.196 --> 00:09:49.433\nPlay around and just choose how wide that\nyou want the margins to actually be when\n\n176\n00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:54.841\nyou're just talking about the idea of just\nplain formatting on the pages itself.\n\n177\n00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:56.722\nSo now you see that wide margin.\n\n178\n00:09:56.722 --> 00:10:00.736\n>> Yeah, I've seen situations where I take\na document and the thing was 30 pages, but\n\n179\n00:10:00.736 --> 00:10:03.934\nit had those default margins and\nI wasn't planning on printing it.\n\n180\n00:10:03.934 --> 00:10:06.342\nSo by narrowing those\nmargins up a little bit,\n\n181\n00:10:06.342 --> 00:10:09.384\ngive me a little more space on\nthe printed part of the page.\n\n182\n00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:12.317\nI took a 30 page document and\ndrop it down to a 25 or\n\n183\n00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:16.727\n20 page document, because you're getting\na little more text on each page.\n\n184\n00:10:16.727 --> 00:10:18.283\n>> And\nyou do have to worry about that too.\n\n185\n00:10:18.283 --> 00:10:20.654\nSo just by changing that margin up.\n\n186\n00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:25.333\nNow this was originally a 26 page\ndocument without any real addition.\n\n187\n00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:26.991\nNow it's become 28 pages,\n\n188\n00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:31.117\nbecause I've added in another half\ninch to each 1 of these margins here.\n\n189\n00:10:31.117 --> 00:10:34.556\nSo, it might be something like\nthis that you choose to do.\n\n190\n00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:36.171\nIf this was let's say, a paper and\n\n191\n00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:39.303\nyou were just trying to make sure\nit was readable, you may do that.\n\n192\n00:10:39.303 --> 00:10:42.143\nYou may even add in other margins,\ncuz you wanna take notes on the side.\n\n193\n00:10:42.143 --> 00:10:43.974\nYou name it,\nthere's different things you can do.\n\n194\n00:10:43.974 --> 00:10:47.256\n>> Ronnie, another thing I like to do with\nthese documents is I need to make it look\n\n195\n00:10:47.256 --> 00:10:48.023\na little better.\n\n196\n00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:51.271\nSo, I want my headers to be a little\nbit bigger than the rest of the text.\n\n197\n00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:54.971\nI want maybe to change up the font and\nis there a quick, easy way to do that or\n\n198\n00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:57.564\ndo I have to pick all those\nelements individually?\n\n199\n00:10:57.564 --> 00:11:01.515\n>> [LAUGH] Well, you can pick all those\nelements individually if you choose to,\n\n200\n00:11:01.515 --> 00:11:04.617\nbut it just really depends on\nhow much time you really have.\n\n201\n00:11:04.617 --> 00:11:06.327\nBut the good thing is Word said look,\n\n202\n00:11:06.327 --> 00:11:08.874\nthat's silly if you have to\ndo that every single time.\n\n203\n00:11:08.874 --> 00:11:13.255\nWhat you can do instead is you can end up\ncreating what we call a style or you can\n\n204\n00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:17.931\nactually use built-in styles to help you\nout and do what you want to do, as well.\n\n205\n00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:24.275\nSo for example, let's take this dedication\nhere or let's do the chapters instead.\n\n206\n00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:26.367\nSo let's say that these chapter titles,\n\n207\n00:11:26.367 --> 00:11:29.250\nwe want to set something like\nthose off a little bit more.\n\n208\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.207\nWell, there's a couple more\nways that we can do that.\n\n209\n00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:35.732\nSo, I'm just using that left hand\nmargin and I'm just going to click and\n\n210\n00:11:35.732 --> 00:11:39.661\ndrag and notice that it allows me\nto select on those two lines And\n\n211\n00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:43.889\nwhen I hover over what I've selected,\nthe mini toolbar comes up and\n\n212\n00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:46.954\nnow I also have access to\nwhat we call the Styles.\n\n213\n00:11:46.954 --> 00:11:51.652\nThe Styles essentially are prebuilt,\nStyles like they're talking about,\n\n214\n00:11:51.652 --> 00:11:55.710\nthey allow us to change the size of\nthe font, the color of the font.\n\n215\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.126\nThey allow us to change whether we want\na bold, italic, italicize, you name it.\n\n216\n00:12:00.126 --> 00:12:02.888\nYou can actually create\nwhatever you want to here and\n\n217\n00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:05.226\nautomatically apply all that formatting.\n\n218\n00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:07.650\nNow before I do so something like that.\n\n219\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.553\nSo let me do this.\n\n220\n00:12:08.553 --> 00:12:13.534\nLet me go ahead and change this,\nlets do it to Heading 2.\n\n221\n00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:15.903\nI'm just trying to pick something here.\n\n222\n00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:17.366\nYeah, lets do Heading 2.\n\n223\n00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:20.413\nI'm just gonna select Heading 2 and\nyou might be wondering, well, big deal.\n\n224\n00:12:20.413 --> 00:12:25.138\nIt looks like it turned it blue and\nit capitalized everything.\n\n225\n00:12:25.138 --> 00:12:31.703\nBut if I go back in and I select,\nlet me see if I can tell you right.\n\n226\n00:12:31.703 --> 00:12:34.578\nApply the style, Modify,\nthat's what I wanted to do.\n\n227\n00:12:34.578 --> 00:12:35.623\nI wanted to take a look at.\n\n228\n00:12:35.623 --> 00:12:40.933\nSo if I select Modify, you can see right\nhere in this little grey box underneath,\n\n229\n00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:42.662\nall the stuff that it did.\n\n230\n00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:45.236\nAnd so this is actually fairly impressive.\n\n231\n00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:51.018\nIt took the font and it made it a heading,\nchanged it to Calibri Light,\n\n232\n00:12:51.018 --> 00:12:54.654\n16-point font, font color accent one.\n\n233\n00:12:54.654 --> 00:12:58.939\nLine spacing single space,\ntwo points before,\n\n234\n00:12:58.939 --> 00:13:03.757\nzero after to keep with the net for\norphan protection.\n\n235\n00:13:03.757 --> 00:13:09.891\nIt did all of this and added all that in\nthere just by me selecting one option.\n\n236\n00:13:09.891 --> 00:13:12.055\n>> And those are all things\nI can do individually, but\n\n237\n00:13:12.055 --> 00:13:13.981\nthat would've been like\nsix to seven steps.\n\n238\n00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:18.014\nAnd instead, I picked that style and\nit puts them all in there.\n\n239\n00:13:18.014 --> 00:13:20.196\n>> And the nice thing is it's reusable.\n\n240\n00:13:20.196 --> 00:13:24.816\nSo even though I've just selected Chapter\n1 and did that, notice I can scroll\n\n241\n00:13:24.816 --> 00:13:28.958\ndown here and select Chapter 2 again and\nthen select that same style.\n\n242\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.419\nLet me see if I can find which one I did.\n\n243\n00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:33.138\nHeading 2 I think, yep.\n\n244\n00:13:33.138 --> 00:13:37.012\nAnd so notice I can go through and\nactually select all those options and\n\n245\n00:13:37.012 --> 00:13:41.227\nit actually implies it consistently and\nthat's the point about the style.\n\n246\n00:13:41.227 --> 00:13:45.454\nIf you're like me, every once in a while\nwhat ends up happening is that you\n\n247\n00:13:45.454 --> 00:13:47.650\nget documents from multiple places.\n\n248\n00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.473\nOr if you're like me, you've actually\ngot documents from multiple years and\n\n249\n00:13:52.473 --> 00:13:54.823\neven though back in 1995, Mike.\n\n250\n00:13:54.823 --> 00:13:59.521\nI thought the comic sans was\nthe way to go for everything.\n\n251\n00:13:59.521 --> 00:14:04.060\nNow that it's 2015 and\nI merged those two documents in,\n\n252\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.641\nI'm like, why did I choose that?\n\n253\n00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:10.510\nWell, believe it or not styles can really\nhelp us out, because it allows me to apply\n\n254\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.017\nthat consistent formatting across all\nthat stuff without me having to go.\n\n255\n00:14:14.017 --> 00:14:17.254\nOh, my gosh, I can't believe I\nhave to reorganize everything.\n\n256\n00:14:17.254 --> 00:14:21.068\nYeah, just using styles like this is\nreally helpful on element set that we\n\n257\n00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:24.525\nactually need to be consistent all\nthe way through our documents.\n\n258\n00:14:24.525 --> 00:14:28.951\n>> And so we got styles and then we\nalso have something we called Themes.\n\n259\n00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.506\nHow are those different from Styles?\n\n260\n00:14:30.506 --> 00:14:35.228\n>> Now Themes actually do take the entire\ndocument is what they end up doin and\n\n261\n00:14:35.228 --> 00:14:39.722\ntry to apply consistently things\nlike what we're talking about, but\n\n262\n00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:44.616\nas well as color coordination and some\nother things that we can put in place.\n\n263\n00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:48.131\nAnd so when you start using this,\nit might mean the entire document go.\n\n264\n00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:50.615\nWhoa, that is so many different elements.\n\n265\n00:14:50.615 --> 00:14:53.039\nRonnie, you should've never\ndone something like that.\n\n266\n00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:57.524\nBut you were young then,\nthis is relatively young.\n\n267\n00:14:57.524 --> 00:15:02.477\nYou were younger then and what we need is\nwe need everything, so multiple elements.\n\n268\n00:15:02.477 --> 00:15:03.748\nSo throughout the years,\n\n269\n00:15:03.748 --> 00:15:07.923\nI've had documents where I've been working\non my own sort of attempt to write books.\n\n270\n00:15:07.923 --> 00:15:09.836\nAnd I do, I pull up those\ndocuments every once in a while.\n\n271\n00:15:09.836 --> 00:15:12.690\nI'm like,\nwhy did I ever choose something like that?\n\n272\n00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.406\nIt's cuz my style,\nmy tastes have changed over the years.\n\n273\n00:15:15.406 --> 00:15:19.123\nAnd now I look back over them it's like,\nman, I should have never done that, but\n\n274\n00:15:19.123 --> 00:15:22.854\nnow I can merge all those things together\nand pull them all in and then use themes.\n\n275\n00:15:22.854 --> 00:15:25.966\nSo let me show you about\nthe use of themes here.\n\n276\n00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:30.468\nSo if we wanted to, instead of actually\nhaving to put in individual elements,\n\n277\n00:15:30.468 --> 00:15:34.903\nand say, look, we need just an overall\ntheme, something that will actually\n\n278\n00:15:34.903 --> 00:15:38.110\nhelp us out faster is I can\nclick back up here on Design and\n\n279\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.931\nI just went up to the top\nof this particular page.\n\n280\n00:15:40.931 --> 00:15:45.044\nAnd now you notice that there is\nactually this whole group here from\n\n281\n00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:49.891\nthe left-hand side all the way up to\nabout, I guess 80% of that entire bar,\n\n282\n00:15:49.891 --> 00:15:53.440\nabout 90% is under what we\ncall document formatting.\n\n283\n00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.850\nSo a theme includes colors, fonts,\nspacings, effects, you name it.\n\n284\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.217\nIt includes all of that\nthat we can actually apply.\n\n285\n00:16:02.217 --> 00:16:04.747\nBut if you want one just,\nbecause you do need one,\n\n286\n00:16:04.747 --> 00:16:08.940\nnotice that over here on the left-hand\nside you also have these themes.\n\n287\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.150\nThese themes include an Office theme,\nwhich is by far the default and\n\n288\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.560\nas I hover over them,\nyou can see what is happening to my doc,\n\n289\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.290\nat least I think you can let\nme zoom in a little bit more.\n\n290\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.070\nMaybe that'd make it\na little bit easier for\n\n291\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.880\nus to see, no now I just\nhovered over one called Facet.\n\n292\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.400\nAnd what that's actually is notice\nit changes the default font\n\n293\n00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.490\nin my entire document.\n\n294\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.840\nI go through there.\n\n295\n00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.230\nI can see that, and\nif I start adding in color elements,\n\n296\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.050\nit will also allow me to line those up.\n\n297\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.700\nSo if we scroll down here,\nlet's see what happens now.\n\n298\n00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.500\nSo notice that because we used those\nelements and those styles, and\n\n299\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.200\nI now go to retrospect, notice it changes\nthat color without me having to do it.\n\n300\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.800\nSo if I am using those elements of style\nand I add them in there, I could say,\n\n301\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.710\nlook, I want it to all match with\neverything that we have, so now we can\n\n302\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.330\nactually go here to themes, and you can\nsee that it will apply those elements.\n\n303\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.650\nAnd use that color coordination,\n\n304\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.900\nwhich I probably don't have cuz I'm silly\nwhen it comes down to color coordination.\n\n305\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.010\nAnd so it really is kind of neat\non what you can do very easily and\n\n306\n00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.140\nvery quickly to make your\ndocument look better.\n\n307\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.720\n>> Yeah, it sounds like a great use, too\nand if you're working on a document where\n\n308\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.220\nyou've had multiple people helping out,\nright?\n\n309\n00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.550\nIt's a collaboration, everybody may\nbe working on a chapter that they're\n\n310\n00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.780\ngood at and\nit's gonna be combined into one paper.\n\n311\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.470\nEach person uses a different style,\na different font,\n\n312\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.340\na point font, color, things like that.\n\n313\n00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.888\nWe start combining those together,\nit doesn't make a very cohesive document.\n\n314\n00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:40.956\nWell now we can simply go in and\nchoose and a theme then.\n\n315\n00:17:40.956 --> 00:17:43.682\nAnd that theme will go and\nfind all those heading ones and\n\n316\n00:17:43.682 --> 00:17:46.524\neven if everybody used a different\ncolor for heading one,\n\n317\n00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:50.010\nthis is gonna change it to where all\nthe heading ones are the same color.\n\n318\n00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.610\nAnd I get consistency through my document.\n\n319\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.330\nSo that's a really cool quick I mean and\nyou got a live preview,\n\n320\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.570\nheck it doesn't get much better than that.\n\n321\n00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.110\n>> Yeah,\nI mean what else can you actually do?\n\n322\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.130\nThis is actually the fastest way to make\nsure that the document at least looks\n\n323\n00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.300\nlike somebody spent some time and\nactually cared about it and\n\n324\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.560\nI'm not trying to pick on anybody\nthat's taken a ton of time to do this.\n\n325\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.000\nBut if you want everything to look\nconsistent all the way through,\n\n326\n00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.700\nusing themes, using styles,\nthis is the way to go about doing that.\n\n327\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.650\nAnd this is where I mentioned\nin another episode,\n\n328\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.480\nas you really do get yourself\nacclimated to using more and\n\n329\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.520\nmore of the stuff built into word,\nit really does help.\n\n330\n00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.090\nBecause now you start seeing,\n\n331\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.980\nman just because I added in that\nstyle It was able to change all that?\n\n332\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.590\nYeah, that's all it was.\n\n333\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.120\nso we actually do use those\nelements that are built in.\n\n334\n00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.130\nWe see Word really works with us to help\nus to make it better all the way around.\n\n335\n00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.040\n>> Very good, all right.\n\n336\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.675\nNow Ronnie, another thing\nthat I think makes a document\n\n337\n00:18:45.675 --> 00:18:50.125\nlook really professional is they'll have\ntext across the top of every page, or\n\n338\n00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:52.875\nthey'll have text across\nthe bottom of every page.\n\n339\n00:18:52.875 --> 00:18:53.845\nIs that something?\n\n340\n00:18:53.845 --> 00:18:55.675\nIs there a cool tool we can use for\nthat as well?\n\n341\n00:18:55.675 --> 00:18:56.705\n>> There really is,\n\n342\n00:18:56.705 --> 00:18:59.505\nof course what we're talking about\nhere are headers and footers.\n\n343\n00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:02.975\nNow depending on the document that you're\nusing, you will actually use these,\n\n344\n00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.195\nespecially in long documents.\n\n345\n00:19:04.195 --> 00:19:06.665\nSo if you're preparing a paper for\ncollege,\n\n346\n00:19:06.665 --> 00:19:09.400\nyou'll probably have to add in headers and\nfooters.\n\n347\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.380\nYou're doing this for books, it's very\nimportant that you do something like this\n\n348\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:17.210\nas well, because it helps people\nkeep on track of where they read and\n\n349\n00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.220\nwhat they're actually in and\nseeing and looking at.\n\n350\n00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.300\nSo these are really nice, little elements\nthat we can actually use to enhance\n\n351\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.300\nthe way that the document looks and to\nmake the document feel like it's a unified\n\n352\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.800\ndocument overall, and\nthat's what we want to focus in on.\n\n353\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.900\nThe nice thing is, when we start\ntaking a look at adding in headers and\n\n354\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.970\nfooters, it's relatively easy in\nWord to get those things to work.\n\n355\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.090\nSo up here on top, where I have that\none-inch margin, which appears on top\n\n356\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:47.900\nof every page, all I have to do is double\nclick on that particular element, and\n\n357\n00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.480\nwhen I do so, you'll notice\nthat everything changed here.\n\n358\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.910\nSo it now actually has this\nkind of perforated line and\n\n359\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.740\nit actually indicates header\non the left hand side.\n\n360\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.580\nWe also now end up with what\nwe call a contextual tab.\n\n361\n00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.720\nNow even though the ribbon constantly\ngives us all the stuff that we've seen\n\n362\n00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.340\nhere, File, Home, Insert and Design.\n\n363\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.410\nThese are the majority of the tools\nthat we have in place but\n\n364\n00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:16.380\na contextual ribbon or a contextual tab\nhere says, header and footer tools.\n\n365\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.140\nAnd this actually expands\nout an even deeper tool box\n\n366\n00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.340\nto give us the elements that we need\nto actually add in that element.\n\n367\n00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:29.290\nNow once I click off this you may find\nout that, there it goes, it disappears.\n\n368\n00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.450\nAnd that is because that contextual tab\n\n369\n00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.160\nis actually there only in\nthe context of that ribbon.\n\n370\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.460\nSo if you actually do click off of it,\n\n371\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.040\nit's actually gonna disappear,\nvery easy to bring it back.\n\n372\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.470\nNow, let's say, for\nan example here on this particular page,\n\n373\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.110\nwhat we wanted to do is, we wanted\nto actually make sure that we could\n\n374\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.720\nadd in what we called\nelements here in our header.\n\n375\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.050\nSo let's say that on this very page here,\nokay, I can click on\n\n376\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.180\nheader in the upper left-hand corner and\nthen notice it already gives me,\n\n377\n00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:06.250\nwell, some previews to what I can\nactually make that header look like.\n\n378\n00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:10.220\nNow this is actually part of one\nof those elements that we call\n\n379\n00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.810\nthe built-in elements there that\nactually already does that.\n\n380\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:18.900\nSo It allows me to say hey\nhere's some pre formatted ways\n\n381\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.620\nthat we can go ahead and\nhave inside of the header.\n\n382\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.600\nSo here it adds in another graphical\nelement along with some of the text and\n\n383\n00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.970\nyou can see that depending\non what you're doing.\n\n384\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.640\nSo like here they have it for\n\n385\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.850\nthe facet which is part of that\ntheme that we were talking about.\n\n386\n00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:40.620\nBut let's say that what I want is\ngoing to be the, not the page header.\n\n387\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.710\nI want, I'm trying to pick one out now,\n\n388\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.670\nI'm gonna do this three blank column\nhere is what I'm going to do.\n\n389\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:53.510\nSo at the top of every page,\nwhat is it that I want to appear and\n\n390\n00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.310\nwhere do I want it to appear?\n\n391\n00:21:55.310 --> 00:22:02.290\nI can put whatever elements that I want\nhere but let's just call it the print,\n\n392\n00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:08.710\noops, like this, because that's\nwhat this document is about.\n\n393\n00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:13.380\nAnd I can also add in some other\nelements depending on what we need.\n\n394\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.100\nNow I could add in\nthe page number up here,\n\n395\n00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.960\nI like the page number really\ndown at the bottom of the page.\n\n396\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.260\nBut notice that there's some inserts\nof different things that we can add in,\n\n397\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.810\nsuch as the date and time.\n\n398\n00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.420\nNow, this is not the greatest element,\nnot something you may choose to do this.\n\n399\n00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.290\nBut if you were doing this for yourself,\nthat way you could actually say,\n\n400\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:35.020\nhey, I worked on this document from these\ndates you can add in elements like that.\n\n401\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:40.440\nPictures if you want to, you name it and\nthis is what's called quick parts too and\n\n402\n00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.880\nthese quick parts are again pre\nformatted elements that we can add, but\n\n403\n00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.840\nlet's say that that's all I\nreally want is right here.\n\n404\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.020\nNow, if I go ahead and add that in and\nthen I click off of it.\n\n405\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.130\nNow, as I scroll down\nthrough to the second page.\n\n406\n00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.590\nNotice that it also gives\nme that element up here.\n\n407\n00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.120\nNow these type here should not appear,\nas you actually do print them out, but\n\n408\n00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.820\nbecause I chose a three column header, is\nexpecting me to type in some other stuff\n\n409\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.110\nbut it shouldn't show up when I go\nto print this if I were to do that.\n\n410\n00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:13.840\nSo a header element should be there,\nbut what about the idea of the footer.\n\n411\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.070\nSo let's say down here, if I scroll\ndown to the bottom of that first page,\n\n412\n00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:23.410\nI can double click within that\nlast inch on that page as well and\n\n413\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.050\nit's here that I can also add in,\nwell like page numbers.\n\n414\n00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.380\nSo let's say at the bottom of the page\nhere, I want to add in just a page number.\n\n415\n00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.900\nAnd so I can choose, of course,\n\n416\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.720\nfrom these built-in elements,\nthese quick part elements as we call them.\n\n417\n00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.440\nAnd I'm just gonna select a plain\nnumber and add that in as well.\n\n418\n00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.078\nSo we can do stuff like\nthis to help us out.\n\n419\n00:23:46.078 --> 00:23:48.818\nNow the other things,\nof course, is customizing this,\n\n420\n00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:52.697\nnotice that if I don't want something up\nhere on the first page, so if this were,\n\n421\n00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:56.633\nlet's say a paper that I was submitting,\nI may want the very first page to actually\n\n422\n00:23:56.633 --> 00:24:00.204\nappear but without the header,\nI can actually add that element in there.\n\n423\n00:24:00.204 --> 00:24:03.084\nAnd now that first page doesn't\nhave that header element anymore.\n\n424\n00:24:03.084 --> 00:24:07.143\nBut now it begins with a second page,\nand we can see that, and\n\n425\n00:24:07.143 --> 00:24:10.660\nactually add that element\nin there as well.\n\n426\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.610\nSo, it's very easy for us to simply add\nin these elements to really help us\n\n427\n00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:20.130\nto modify the appearance of\nour documents very easily.\n\n428\n00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.800\nAnd to make it easier to navigate.\n\n429\n00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.930\nSo, if I scroll down it doesn't\nmatter where I am and there it is.\n\n430\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.070\nI'm on page five of this document.\n\n431\n00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.060\nI know that the book that I'm\nlooking at is the prints.\n\n432\n00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.310\nI could have either have added in\nthe author on the left hand side, or\n\n433\n00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.170\nright hand side.\n\n434\n00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.520\nYou name it, we could do that,\nand even more element than that.\n\n435\n00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.210\nRight?\n\n436\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.670\nYou can do it where you can do\ndifferent headers and footers.\n\n437\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.520\nEven for odd number pages,\nor even number pages.\n\n438\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.080\nYou name it.\n\n439\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.940\nThere's so\nmany different elements in here.\n\n440\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.820\nAt least the basics will help you out\nas far as headers and footers go.\n\n441\n00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.520\n>> Very good.\n\n442\n00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.123\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n443\n00:24:54.123 --> 00:24:57.940\nanother thing Ronnie that I love\nto see on documents is watermarks.\n\n444\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.550\nI mean, there's several uses for\nthese guys.\n\n445\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.140\nI like to use them,\nlike your book that you're writing.\n\n446\n00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.830\nYou'd want to put draft across there, so\nthat nobody accidentally picks that up and\n\n447\n00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.840\ngoes oh, this is the final copy and\nsends that off to the printer.\n\n448\n00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.630\nOr confidential, so\n\n449\n00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.140\npeople know immediately that hey,\nI shouldn't be looking at this, or\n\n450\n00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.660\nI can't just leave this laying out on my\ndesk because it's sensitive information.\n\n451\n00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.180\n>> Right.\n\n452\n00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.480\n>> Can we do that in Word?\n\n453\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.980\n>> You definitely can, and this has\nbeen an element that's been around for\n\n454\n00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.150\na long time in whatever version of Word.\n\n455\n00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.420\nThey didn't take it out of Word 2016.\n\n456\n00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.550\nAnd these are elements that you can\nadd in that really do help to mark and\n\n457\n00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.040\nidentify that document.\n\n458\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.660\nSo, a lot of times it might be that\nyou're actually passing around just\n\n459\n00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.270\ninternal documents inside your company\nthat's not supposed to go outside.\n\n460\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.600\nYou want to make sure that\neverybody understands that.\n\n461\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.810\nYou can add the element in the background\nand that essentially makes it\n\n462\n00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.520\npart of the background and\nnot actually covering any of your text.\n\n463\n00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.800\nSo, we do have some built-in\nelements to help us out.\n\n464\n00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.340\nSo, if I go ahead here and\nselect insert actually it's design.\n\n465\n00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.840\nI always get insert and\ndesign differently, but so,\n\n466\n00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.570\nright to the right of document formatting,\nI can go to where it\n\n467\n00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:08.910\nsays page background and notice that I\nhave an element here called watermark.\n\n468\n00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.579\nSo, if I go ahead and\nselect here watermark.\n\n469\n00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.090\nLet's say that what I want to do,\n\n470\n00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:17.570\nis that I want to insert in this\nconfidential here, and so I can do that.\n\n471\n00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.330\nAnd once I do that, notice it that\n[INAUDIBLE] does insert it in, and\n\n472\n00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:25.310\nyou can barely see it in the background,\nbut it's right here to do so.\n\n473\n00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.620\nNow, what if you said hey,\nI wanna actually create my own.\n\n474\n00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.550\nCan you do that as well?\n\n475\n00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.980\nSure you can.\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n476\n00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.240\nControl Z and undo that.\n\n477\n00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.180\nAnd then I'm going to select watermark,\nand notice that there's more\n\n478\n00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.680\nelements that are also added down here\nwhere it says customer watermark.\n\n479\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.630\nSo if I select custom watermark,\n\n480\n00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.090\nit gives me this ability now to\ncreate either a picture watermark.\n\n481\n00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.920\nSo let's say, I had my company logo if\nI had my own little printing company,\n\n482\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.050\nI could also insert that in there.\n\n483\n00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.820\nOr, I can insert in my own text watermark,\nand\n\n484\n00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.740\nnotice they already have\na few of them built in.\n\n485\n00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.060\nSo here it is, urgent,\nsecret or sample original.\n\n486\n00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:05.410\nIt might be something like this,\nor do not copy draft.\n\n487\n00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:12.813\nSo let's say, that what I want here\nis instead internal document only.\n\n488\n00:27:12.813 --> 00:27:16.890\nAnd I can change the font to actually\nbe whatever I want it to be.\n\n489\n00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.670\nAnd leave it at Calibri,\n'cuz I don't know what that's gonna be.\n\n490\n00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.880\nAnd I can even change the size of it.\n\n491\n00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.700\nAuto seems good.\n\n492\n00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.860\nAnd of course, you can change\nthis transparency if you need to.\n\n493\n00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.510\nSo here are sets of\nthese semi-transparent.\n\n494\n00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.990\nI guess if I un check that,\nthat's gonna make it opaque.\n\n495\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.340\nWell if I click Apply,\nand now I click Close,\n\n496\n00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.840\nyou can see where it barely says internal\nonly, and that will also print out.\n\n497\n00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.260\nLet's see what happens if I take that,\nand actually do semi-transparent.\n\n498\n00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.660\nLet's change it also to make it\nlook a little bit darker there.\n\n499\n00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.340\nApply, there we go.\n\n500\n00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.790\nThat makes it easier for\nus to see on the screen here.\n\n501\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:57.569\nSo, that way on every single page we\nhave that ability where this actually\n\n502\n00:27:57.569 --> 00:28:01.747\ngets out in the open we can say,\nlook this was for internal only.\n\n503\n00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:05.030\nAnd that will also allow us to\nbe able to see stuff on that.\n\n504\n00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.940\nBut usually the picture a very light\nwatermark is something that you\n\n505\n00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.800\ndo want to see.\n\n506\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.720\nAnd it does really help control\nas far as where is this for,\n\n507\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.470\nwhether we're actually going to copy it or\nwhat's supposed to be happening with this.\n\n508\n00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.200\n>> Fantastic.\n\n509\n00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.440\nA lot of really cool things we can\nuse to spice up our documents from\n\n510\n00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.630\napplying styles to individual elements,\n\n511\n00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.820\nor applying themes that would\naffect the entire document.\n\n512\n00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:31.360\nWe've got Headers and Footers that we\ncan apply, and the control that we get,\n\n513\n00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.220\nthe ability to not put it on\nthe first page, or alternating pages.\n\n514\n00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.080\nReally makes it easy to work with.\n\n515\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.730\nAny other cool features you wanna show us?\n\n516\n00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.550\n>> Just one more.\n\n517\n00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.460\nAnd I just saw this, and\nthat's why I wanna bring it up.\n\n518\n00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.760\nAs I was looking over\nwhere the watermark was,\n\n519\n00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.150\nI also saw the ability\nto add in page borders.\n\n520\n00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.110\nAnd if you wanna add in an element\nthat will really help spice things up,\n\n521\n00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.370\nis the page border.\n\n522\n00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.770\nSo at least let's show you that.\n\n523\n00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.600\nIt's fairly easy to do.\n\n524\n00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.350\nSo, in the same element where you see\ndesign and over here under page background\n\n525\n00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.210\nif I select page border, I can go ahead\nand create if I wanted to a let's say,\n\n526\n00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:06.840\na box here and then I can select my\nline style and depending on what we\n\n527\n00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.310\nwanted here to edit just a little\nbit of line style to this thing.\n\n528\n00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:15.060\nThen we'll make it a little\nbit wider than normal and\n\n529\n00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.170\nlet's set this off with\nthat nice blue color.\n\n530\n00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:23.030\nAnd I'm gonna apply it to the,\nlet's just do first page only, and\n\n531\n00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.450\nthat will make it easier for us to see.\n\n532\n00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.490\nAnd now you can see that we can\nalso add in elements like this.\n\n533\n00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.622\nNow, this may not be for\nevery single document that you put in.\n\n534\n00:29:31.622 --> 00:29:32.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n535\n00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.820\nif this were going off to printer, right?\n\n536\n00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.500\nI might choose to create a title page,\nwhere an element like this really does\n\n537\n00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.896\nhelp set it off, adding a page border is\nanother effective way that we can use\n\n538\n00:29:42.896 --> 00:29:47.340\nformatting to really emphasize what we\nwant happening inside our document.\n\n539\n00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.970\nSo getting it pretty is part of the job.\n\n540\n00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.680\n>> I've use those when I was printing up\nsome certificates and some awards you know\n\n541\n00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.200\ndo that whole, as you showed us to\nflip it to that landscape mode.\n\n542\n00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.620\nAnd put a nice fancy border around it.\n\n543\n00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.790\nYou can come up with some pretty\nimpressive documents, if you just get in\n\n544\n00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.420\nthere, and take advantage of all\nthe tools that Word gives us.\n\n545\n00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.580\nAnd play around with it.\n\n546\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.370\nLearn.\nGet comfortable with it.\n\n547\n00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.860\nAlright, Ron, well great information,\nwe appreciate all that help.\n\n548\n00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.350\nOur document is spice enough.\n\n549\n00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.000\nWe're able to navigate through\nthat big old long document.\n\n550\n00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.300\nAnd now we can.\n\n551\n00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.490\nMake it professional looking.\n\n552\n00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.130\nMake it something that we can turn over\nto the boss, or send off to the printers,\n\n553\n00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.300\nor send out to the rest of the employees,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n554\n00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.920\nFantastic.\n\n555\n00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.925\nThanks for all that Ronnie.\n\n556\n00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:26.730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>>

--> 00:00:20.648\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're gonna be looking at Word 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:24.650\nAnd specifically, we're gonna look at\nways that we can customize our views.\n\n5\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.440\nMake it easier when we're working\nwith these big old documents\n\n6\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.210\nin our word processors.\n\n7\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.720\nSo, Ronnie,\nwe've got Ronnie Wong here with us,\n\n8\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.200\nhow do we go about changing\nup some of our views?\n\n9\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.390\n>> A lot of times when we take a look at\nWord, right, we're used to working in this\n\n10\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.186\ndefault view, and\nwe think that there's all that there is.\n\n11\n00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:44.200\nBut the good thing this is Word actually\ngives us multiple different views that we\n\n12\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.130\ncan use, depending on what we need,\nlet me show you what we're talking about.\n\n13\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.511\nSo, here it is, I've actually pulled up\nthe same document that we've been using\n\n14\n00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.402\nthroughout our episode and series,\na little bit more formatted, but\n\n15\n00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:56.228\noverall though, still the same document.\n\n16\n00:00:56.228 --> 00:01:00.558\nAnd if I am working with this to edit\nthis document, this default view,\n\n17\n00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:05.188\nthat we also call the Print Layout view,\nis by far the one that we want to use.\n\n18\n00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:08.572\nNotice all of the actual tools\nthat we have available for\n\n19\n00:01:08.572 --> 00:01:13.328\nus to be able to modify, change the\nlayouts, add in references, you name it.\n\n20\n00:01:13.328 --> 00:01:17.370\nEverything that we have available is\nright here available for me to modify and\n\n21\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.150\nwork with that document.\n\n22\n00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.390\nAnd that's something\nthat we're used to doing.\n\n23\n00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.650\nThe problem though is a lot of times it\ncan actually give us more than we need.\n\n24\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.930\nAnd when I say more than we need, if I\nnow start trying to read this document,\n\n25\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.770\nthat means all those tools\nare actually in effect.\n\n26\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.380\nAnd I can accidentally select text,\nmove it around,\n\n27\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.650\nI can accidentally delete elements,\nI do not want to be able to delete.\n\n28\n00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.340\nSo it actually helps that Word gives\nus multiple ways that we can view\n\n29\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.560\nthe information.\n\n30\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.670\nAnd the way that we do that is\nby selecting on the View tab.\n\n31\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.450\nAnd then over on the left-hand side you\nactually do see where it shows you,\n\n32\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.570\nwell, views.\n\n33\n00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.250\nAnd so you'll actually notice that there's\na Read Mode, Print Layout, Web Layout.\n\n34\n00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.030\nThese are the ones that we normally\nsee also on the status bar cuz these\n\n35\n00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.740\nare the default ones,\nthat we're normally used to seeing.\n\n36\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.410\nBut notice that there's an additional\nOutline and Draft view, as well.\n\n37\n00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.980\nSo if I wanted to change my views, and\nthis is something you should try to do.\n\n38\n00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.860\nEspecially if you're working with\nthe newer tablets and devices.\n\n39\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.010\nThis is not the mode you wanna\nbe reading a document in.\n\n40\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.448\nInstead, you wanna make sure that\nyou select this Read Mode instead.\n\n41\n00:02:22.448 --> 00:02:27.191\nAnd even though it doesn't look like it's\nmuch of a difference, notice that you no\n\n42\n00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:31.440\nlonger have access to those tools\nto change anything very easily.\n\n43\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.290\nSo if I accidentally selected that,\nbecause I was like, oh,\n\n44\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.500\nI like that quote, even though I don't.\n\n45\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.360\nIf I wanted to, notice I can't click and\ndrag it to another location,\n\n46\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.040\nI can't accidentally move it.\n\n47\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.430\nI can't even delete anything,\nI just hit the delete key,\n\n48\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.900\nif you're wondering what that loud\nclick was, that's what I did.\n\n49\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.890\nSo, I can't delete anything,\nand this makes it nice.\n\n50\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.250\nCuz with a touchscreen, right,\nand you're using your thumbs and\n\n51\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.880\nyou're holding that thing,\nyou're selecting,\n\n52\n00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.650\nyou're grabbing, that's something you\nreally don't want to be able to do.\n\n53\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.308\nSo this Read Mode gives you that ability.\n\n54\n00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:01.370\nNow, it doesn't mean\nthat you're out of tools.\n\n55\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.440\nNotice that if you select Tools,\nit gives you these tools.\n\n56\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.930\nIf I'm looking for a particular word and\nhere's also a Smart Lookup.\n\n57\n00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.370\nBefore, in a previous episode,\nwe had used a research pane.\n\n58\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.296\nThis thing also works as the same way so\nlet me say I select, like,\n\n59\n00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.456\nLorenzo Di Piero De Medici.\n\n60\n00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:22.256\nI'm massacring someone's\nItalian name there [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:25.795\nI can also select Smart Lookup and\nnow it'll load up this Insights and\n\n62\n00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:28.481\nit'll give me the connection\nout to the Internet and\n\n63\n00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.280\nit'll actually give me even more\ninformation that I can look it up.\n\n64\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.773\nAnd so\nthis Read Mode is a very good mode for\n\n65\n00:03:34.773 --> 00:03:38.189\nus to be in that will help us to\nbe able to find out more about\n\n66\n00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.918\nthe content that we're really\nfocusing in on reading about.\n\n67\n00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:45.945\nBut at the same time, it prevents us\nfrom accidentally editing anything, and\n\n68\n00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:49.378\nthat is really important,\nthe majority of what we're seeing.\n\n69\n00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:52.721\n>> That's fantastic, cuz I know I've\ndone that a few times, where you're,\n\n70\n00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:54.458\ndid I just move something on this page?\n\n71\n00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:57.135\n[LAUGH]\n>> And so, now I can go to that mode and\n\n72\n00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:00.943\nI don't have to worry about accidentally\ndragging a paragraph to the beginning or\n\n73\n00:04:00.943 --> 00:04:02.620\ndeleting an entire page.\n\n74\n00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.600\n>> Yeah, it really is, and they really\ndid think about the reader in general.\n\n75\n00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.208\nNotice that there's actually other view\nmodes that we can also customize too.\n\n76\n00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:14.488\nI can add in a Navigation Pane to\nactually get me around that document.\n\n77\n00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:21.096\nOr, I can even change the page color\nif I want it to be more like this.\n\n78\n00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:25.811\nThe white is too harsh on my delicate\neyes cuz I have special eyes,\n\n79\n00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:27.456\nwhatever it might be.\n\n80\n00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:30.468\nAnd then, of course, if you're reading\nat night, there you go, you have that.\n\n81\n00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:35.268\nAnd so they really did kind of think\nabout the reader when they started to\n\n82\n00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:37.108\ntake a look at these modes,\n\n83\n00:04:37.108 --> 00:04:41.290\nwhen we start talking about\nthe idea of the reading mode.\n\n84\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.050\nSo let me switch back, I just went\nahead and clicked on those buttons that\n\n85\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.638\nallowed me to switch back to\nthe standard Print Layout.\n\n86\n00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:50.114\nOf course, there's the Web Layout\nmode that is designed for\n\n87\n00:04:50.114 --> 00:04:54.558\nus to be able to see how it would normally\nlook on just a static webpage as well.\n\n88\n00:04:54.558 --> 00:04:58.505\nUsing those same margins that we\nwould normally see on a webpage,\n\n89\n00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:02.538\nwe can actually see that information\nas well and be able to do that.\n\n90\n00:05:02.538 --> 00:05:05.020\nAnd so those things make sense, right?\n\n91\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.880\nDepending on what we need,\nthose views really do help.\n\n92\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.453\nBut if you are now talking about\nsomeone that's gonna be revising and\n\n93\n00:05:11.453 --> 00:05:14.418\nediting, that's where these\nother modes also come in.\n\n94\n00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:18.380\nWe have Outline and we have Draft too.\n\n95\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.880\nSo if I select Outline,\nwhat it does is it changes this into,\n\n96\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.040\nwell, a way that allows me,\nat least to a point and\n\n97\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.690\nI mean this to a point, to be able to see\neven the logical flow of the document.\n\n98\n00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.086\nI know that when I was young\nI was a terrible writer.\n\n99\n00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:37.420\nYou could read it and go, man, that was\njust a string up bunch of paragraphs\n\n100\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.220\ntogether that made no sense of all.\n\n101\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.813\nWell, if something like that happens,\nyou can actually come here to this Outline\n\n102\n00:05:43.813 --> 00:05:47.341\nmode instead and now,\nnotice if I hover over one of these dots,\n\n103\n00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:49.888\nit gives me that four\npointed compass arrow.\n\n104\n00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:53.365\nAnd normally with that four pointed\ncompass arrow it means I can move that\n\n105\n00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:54.448\nentire thing around.\n\n106\n00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:58.266\nSo, without me having to go is this\nactually going to make sense, I can\n\n107\n00:05:58.266 --> 00:06:02.688\nactually click, and now notice I can move\nit to another location and there it is.\n\n108\n00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:07.388\nSo now I can see those entire paragraphs\nin that Outline mode viewed together.\n\n109\n00:06:07.388 --> 00:06:11.348\nAnd that way I can see how I wanna\nmove it, where I wanna move it.\n\n110\n00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:16.421\nAnd even begin to use those outlines by\ninserting in sub-points if I need to,\n\n111\n00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:17.288\nyou name it.\n\n112\n00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:19.808\nThere's a bunch of different options here.\n\n113\n00:06:19.808 --> 00:06:23.408\nLet me see if I can get back to that,\nI didn't want to change that.\n\n114\n00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:26.851\nBut you can see why this Outline\nmode is actually very important,\n\n115\n00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:31.234\nespecially if you're having to consider\nthe flow or if you remove something, go,\n\n116\n00:06:31.234 --> 00:06:34.910\ndoes this make logical sense as\nit kind of comes together here.\n\n117\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.480\nSo Outline mode, very great.\n\n118\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.772\n>> Yeah, I like using that especially\nwhen I have chart elements or tables and\n\n119\n00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:40.618\nthings like that.\n\n120\n00:06:40.618 --> 00:06:44.410\nMaybe I decide, hey, this table would\nwork better before this paragraph.\n\n121\n00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.645\nOr this chart needs to\nmove below this one.\n\n122\n00:06:46.645 --> 00:06:49.323\nGives me that, really, you're focusing-\n>> Compact, yeah.\n\n123\n00:06:49.323 --> 00:06:52.455\n>> As you said, on that and not having to\nscroll as much to see how the different\n\n124\n00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.763\nparagraphs are lined up and\nhow they all fit together.\n\n125\n00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:55.635\nThat's fantastic.\n\n126\n00:06:55.635 --> 00:06:59.683\n>> Yeah, now if you're actually, let's\nsay, a copy editor at this point, right?\n\n127\n00:06:59.683 --> 00:07:04.075\nIn other words, you don't really care\nhow it looks in the document, but\n\n128\n00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:08.899\nyou wanna make sure that everything is\nactually the way that it's supposed to be\n\n129\n00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:10.920\nas far as the editing goes.\n\n130\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.000\nWell, you have this Draft mode as well.\n\n131\n00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.790\nWith the Draft mode, your concentration\nis 100% fully on just the text,\n\n132\n00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.968\nyou're not worried about\nany other element here.\n\n133\n00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:25.014\nThis is what the Draft mode is\nsupposed to be designed for,\n\n134\n00:07:25.014 --> 00:07:28.448\nis that what you're actually doing\nis just being able to do that.\n\n135\n00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.600\nAnd that way, notice it doesn't show up\nlike if I had headers and footers and\n\n136\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.940\nthat's what it's telling me.\n\n137\n00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.790\nAll those extra elements that normally\nwould be added into the Word document,\n\n138\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.897\nyou don't really worry about it too much.\n\n139\n00:07:38.897 --> 00:07:43.734\nBut overall though, if you're saying,\nlook, all that other stuff it's fine,\n\n140\n00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:47.799\nit's fluffy, but what I really need\nis just a plain text itself, and\n\n141\n00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:49.790\nI need to focus in on that.\n\n142\n00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.421\nThat's what these modes\nare actually designed to do.\n\n143\n00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:55.378\nAnd so you can see where\nit's actually designed for\n\n144\n00:07:55.378 --> 00:07:57.797\nthis modern Word element and processor.\n\n145\n00:07:57.797 --> 00:08:00.799\nAnd they've actually designed it\nbecause they really wanted to be\n\n146\n00:08:00.799 --> 00:08:04.080\non every device whether it's a tablet,\nwhether it's even your phone.\n\n147\n00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.680\nNow I know that sounds strange but\n\n148\n00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.420\nyou can actually get Word 2016\non your handheld smartphone.\n\n149\n00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.990\nAnd so they really want it to be\nthat way so they give you that mode,\n\n150\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.609\nthat reading mode.\n\n151\n00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.920\nI know that even on my phone which is\na fairly nice phone it's still small and\n\n152\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.450\nI can accidentally select elements and\n\n153\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.180\nmove them around if I'm not\ncareful inside that word document.\n\n154\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.063\nSo changing it to reading mode or\ndraft mode or\n\n155\n00:08:26.063 --> 00:08:29.532\nanything like that is probably going to be\ndefiantly more helpful then just looking\n\n156\n00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:31.728\nat it in standard mode which\nwe normally do editing.\n\n157\n00:08:31.728 --> 00:08:34.917\nNow Ronnie, you mentioned something\nthere you said small, and\n\n158\n00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:38.284\nI've been working with documents\nthat I've gotten from people and\n\n159\n00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:41.414\nthat their eyes are either bionic or\nI'm just getting old, but\n\n160\n00:08:41.414 --> 00:08:45.400\nI open that document up, and the font is\nso small that I have trouble reading it.\n\n161\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.790\nEspecially, if you take that on one of\nthose little portable devices that already\n\n162\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.920\nhas a small screen.\n\n163\n00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.790\nSo what does Word give us\nto do to help with that?\n\n164\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.630\n>> Well, the nice thing is Word, of\ncourse, has built into it the zoom element\n\n165\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.690\nthat you have available and it's\nrelatively easy to get access to as well.\n\n166\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.760\nLet me show you a couple\nof ways to do that.\n\n167\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.870\nSo let's take, for example,\n\n168\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.180\nthat my document is looking small as I\nam doing editing, as I'm doing reading.\n\n169\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.050\nWell, if I select view, I do have access,\nof course, to zoom, and\n\n170\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.300\nthis zoom grouping here,\nis actually quite extensive.\n\n171\n00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.540\nNow, I can actually say, hey,\nI want to see that whole page on one.\n\n172\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.300\nWell, that's way smaller.\n\n173\n00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.550\nI'm probably not gonna want\nto do anything like that but,\n\n174\n00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.420\ndepending on my element that I have,\nI can also have these other options.\n\n175\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.860\n>> Yeah, sometimes I really\nlike that overview of the page.\n\n176\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.658\nI'm not trying to read it.\n\n177\n00:09:29.658 --> 00:09:33.400\nI just wanna see how it looks and\nyou can see the whole page at once.\n\n178\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.600\nThat's fantastic.\n\n179\n00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.690\n>> It really is and then you have\nmultiple pages where, of course,\n\n180\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.130\nyou can now take a look and\nthe overall flow.\n\n181\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.410\nDoes it actually look the way that you\nwant to if you're just doing something\n\n182\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.100\nlike that?\n\n183\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.450\nAnd, of course, if you're really trying to\nread, you might do the ideal page width,\n\n184\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.580\ndepending on your device,\ncan actually be able to pull that in.\n\n185\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.350\nAnd each one of those are actually\nelements of what we call zoom.\n\n186\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.830\nSo at this point if we take\na look at my full screen here,\n\n187\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.830\non the lower-right hand corner.\n\n188\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.148\nSo let me see if I can\nget that popped up there,\n\n189\n00:10:04.148 --> 00:10:06.536\nyou'll see that right now it's at 147%.\n\n190\n00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:09.426\nNow, I didn't bring that mode up,\nthat was because\n\n191\n00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:13.520\nI chose to use one of these predefined\noptions that are available.\n\n192\n00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.630\nAnd I ask doing this really changing that,\nso if I select one page\n\n193\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.460\nYou can now see down in the lower right\nhand corner it says 46% multiple pages,\n\n194\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.070\nit's still at 46% with multiple pages.\n\n195\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:30.520\nThis brings me up to 147% and\nthen I can put it back into its default.\n\n196\n00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:36.190\nBut if I need custom anywhere in between,\nI can select this larger magnifying\n\n197\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:41.660\nglass and notice that I have the ability\nto go from 1 to 200% if I need to.\n\n198\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.658\nThese are the defaults, but\nnotice I can change the percentage.\n\n199\n00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:48.182\nLet's say I wanted a 117%, I can do that.\n\n200\n00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:51.060\nNow that's not the only\nelement that we can do.\n\n201\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.800\nWe can also use this toggle here to\nallow us to zoom in and out as well.\n\n202\n00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:02.030\nSo, there we go, there's 244%,\nand I think the max is 500%.\n\n203\n00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:07.480\nSo I can actually use that and\ndepending on your graphics processor and\n\n204\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.640\nyour CPU on your machine, like mine,\nmine just kind of stuttered for\n\n205\n00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.955\na moment but now you actually\nsee where it's actually up.\n\n206\n00:11:13.955 --> 00:11:17.380\nKinda a very live preview where\nI can actually zoom in and\n\n207\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.260\nout very easily as I'm\nworking with that document.\n\n208\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.640\nBut sometimes you might see it\ntakes a little bit of element\n\n209\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.070\nto bring that back in.\n\n210\n00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:30.030\nSo the zoom mode is actually better when\nyou actually need something like that.\n\n211\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.190\nBut it really does help if you're\nreally focusing in on an element and\n\n212\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.080\nwhether or not you've got alignment and\nagain, for\n\n213\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.577\nreading, perfectly good,\nI use it all the time.\n\n214\n00:11:38.577 --> 00:11:41.050\n>> [LAUGH] That's gonna be a big help for\nme, I know.\n\n215\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.170\nAnother neat place that we can customize,\nRonnie,\n\n216\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.780\nis that good old quick access toolbar.\n\n217\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.800\n>> Right, so,\nwhen we talked about quick access toolbar,\n\n218\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.330\nwe mentioned it in one of\nour earliest episodes.\n\n219\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.970\nJust to try to get us familiar with the\nvery fact that there are multiple options\n\n220\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.280\nthat that we have available to us.\n\n221\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.460\nAnd one of those ways that we can\naffect the entire operating or\n\n222\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.520\nthe entire Word here is by using what\nwe call the quick access tool bar.\n\n223\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.990\nHere in 2016, it really is, it's\na blended in element into the title bar.\n\n224\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.750\nIn previous editions, it kind of tried\nto set it off a little bit more but\n\n225\n00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.040\nnow when you take a look at it,\nit just looks like hey,\n\n226\n00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.940\nthey just added in a couple\nof extra tools up here.\n\n227\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.190\nBut this quick access tool bar is\ndesigned to be one click easy access\n\n228\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.470\nto the elements that you\nreally need to access.\n\n229\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.990\nSo that way you don't have to go and\nsearch for it inside your ribbons,\n\n230\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.060\nyou don't have to actually look for\nit anywhere else but you can actually\n\n231\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.810\nsimply have the tools ready and\navailable right up here in your title bar.\n\n232\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.560\nNow, to be able to customize this,\nit's again easy as well.\n\n233\n00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.100\nSo if you take a look at the title bar,\n\n234\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.330\nyou'll notice that here's three of these\nquick access tool bar features up here.\n\n235\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.160\nMine by default is save, the re-do and\nof course the, or excuse me,\n\n236\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.500\nthe undo and the redo.\n\n237\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.270\nBut then there's a little drop down\nelement that gives us well it says\n\n238\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.228\ncustomized quick access tool bar.\n\n239\n00:13:01.228 --> 00:13:06.255\nIf I select that with this\nshortcut menu I can add in things\n\n240\n00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:11.595\nlike print preview if I wanted to or\ngo ahead and add in open for\n\n241\n00:13:11.595 --> 00:13:16.548\nanother document or\neven new if I wanted to create that.\n\n242\n00:13:16.548 --> 00:13:18.280\nAnd the whole goal behind this is so\n\n243\n00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.480\nthat I don't actually have\nto do two clicks, right?\n\n244\n00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.710\nIf I needed to open up a new document,\nI'd normally have to go to File and\n\n245\n00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.750\nthen here in this back stage area,\nI could then select Open and\n\n246\n00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.100\nthen get access to these\nfiles that I need to.\n\n247\n00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.830\nBut from this one I simply select here\non the Open, and notice that that\n\n248\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.240\nautomatically brings me there without me\nhaving to actually do multiple clicks.\n\n249\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.770\nSo that's the idea behind that.\n\n250\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.568\nNow, if you go, well is there\nmore that I can add in there?\n\n251\n00:13:46.568 --> 00:13:47.848\nYou definitely can.\n\n252\n00:13:47.848 --> 00:13:50.059\nI can select down and go to More Commands.\n\n253\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.850\nAnd of course from here, notice we\nhave the quick access tool bar and\n\n254\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.700\nthen we can add in any of these elements.\n\n255\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.550\nNow there comes a point when, all of the\nsudden, you can have every element that's\n\n256\n00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.420\nout there, but at that point it\nmight be more difficult to find and\n\n257\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.260\nsearch what you're looking for, so\nnormally you want to keep it of course to\n\n258\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.250\nthose elements that you go hey these\nare the ones that I always end up using.\n\n259\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.860\nYou don't like those,\n\n260\n00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.120\nyou simply go ahead and uncheck those\nelements you do not want to show up.\n\n261\n00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.310\nAnd that, of course,\nmakes it a lot easier from what you need.\n\n262\n00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.860\nSo some people like this element,\nI really don't like it that much, and\n\n263\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.400\nI don't know why.\n\n264\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.820\nI just never have taken to it but,\nsometimes you want it up here.\n\n265\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.780\nBut if you wanted to relocate\nit to underneath the ribbon\n\n266\n00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.010\nyou of course can do that and\nhave it now inside your document.\n\n267\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.640\nLet's say that for one reason or\n\n268\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.820\nanother you're actually in that particular\nelement where you're saying hey,\n\n269\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.130\nwhat I really don't like is the unevenness\nof everything that's going on.\n\n270\n00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:51.140\nSo you can bring that back up as well, if\nI select that, I can simply show above and\n\n271\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.402\nnow look everything's balanced and\nnow you're back and ready to go.\n\n272\n00:14:55.402 --> 00:14:59.000\nThe other element that's also appear of\ncourse is the show and hide the ribbon.\n\n273\n00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.140\nSo if I wanted to make sure that I auto\nhide that ribbon I can do that and\n\n274\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.350\nthen I can bring it back as well.\n\n275\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.060\nSo it just depends on what\nyou're needing to do.\n\n276\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.550\nI like leaving that up there even though\nit takes a little bit more screen space.\n\n277\n00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.340\nSmaller screens you may wanna\ntake that option away as well.\n\n278\n00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.940\n>> Yeah, it kind of frees up\nsome of that resolution there\n\n279\n00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.770\nif you do have one of those small screens.\n\n280\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.480\nNow the ribbons themselves, Ronnie,\nwe can customize those also.\n\n281\n00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.550\n>> We really can, the idea here of\ncustomizing the ribbons is fairly simple.\n\n282\n00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:33.160\nThe majority of us only really use,\nlet's say, 20 or 30 tools, okay?\n\n283\n00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.890\nThere are so many tools up here and the\nproblem is that I have even though I've\n\n284\n00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:42.130\nworked with this say since Word\n2002 as far as I remember.\n\n285\n00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.800\nI did own Word 97 but\nI don't think I really worked with it.\n\n286\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.319\nI just used it, but since 2002,\nyou have elements that and\n\n287\n00:15:50.319 --> 00:15:54.338\nthen you kind of realize you\nonly use a hand full of them.\n\n288\n00:15:54.338 --> 00:15:57.046\nThe problem that you have is where\nthe heck are they all located.\n\n289\n00:15:57.046 --> 00:16:02.376\nSo what you can do instead is you can\ncustomize your ribbon Essentially gather\n\n290\n00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:07.218\nup elements that you want to actually\nshow that may not be showing one.\n\n291\n00:16:07.218 --> 00:16:11.077\nOr, you actually say I wanna actually\ngroup all those things that I use all\n\n292\n00:16:11.077 --> 00:16:14.500\nthe time together, and\nthen I can customize the ribbon as well.\n\n293\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.560\nAnd you can even create your own\ncustomized tab if you choose to.\n\n294\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.150\nNow I'm gonna click on file,\nand then go down to Options.\n\n295\n00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.140\nAnd it is under Options here,\n\n296\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.060\nunder the Word options on the left hand\nside you see this navigation pane.\n\n297\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.076\nYou can select customize ribbon.\n\n298\n00:16:32.076 --> 00:16:37.024\nAnd it's right here that you have a chance\nto take the current ribbon that you have.\n\n299\n00:16:37.024 --> 00:16:40.879\nAnd if you wanted to add in another\nelement, let's say to the Home tab,\n\n300\n00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:42.210\nyou can do that.\n\n301\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.500\nSo let's say, and\nI don't even know what to add in.\n\n302\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.400\nI'm gonna come down here and\nsay, view whole page.\n\n303\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.601\nI can add that.\n\n304\n00:16:48.601 --> 00:16:52.590\nOh, it has to be in a group first, so\nlet me add that to the editing here.\n\n305\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.590\nI can add that element in, or maybe not.\n\n306\n00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.290\nOh, I have to create a new\ngroup if I'm going to do that.\n\n307\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.010\nIt doesn't want me just adding\nin elements to the end.\n\n308\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.177\nSo I can add in a new group.\n\n309\n00:17:01.177 --> 00:17:04.130\nAnd I can call this one, oops.\n\n310\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.290\nApparently, I'm creating\nmultiple groups here instead.\n\n311\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.609\nLet me not try to do that instead.\n\n312\n00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:17.050\nLet me rename that one, and\nI'll this one Ronnie's tools here instead.\n\n313\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.460\nSo now if I select that,\ncan I add that in there?\n\n314\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.067\nThere we go.\n\n315\n00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:25.742\nSo now I can just select\nwhatever tool that I want and\n\n316\n00:17:25.742 --> 00:17:30.950\nadd that in, and let's just say I'm\ngonna add in save and text box.\n\n317\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.460\nSo I'm just adding in multiple ones, but\n\n318\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.010\nif I was smarter I would actually add\nin the tools that I use all the time.\n\n319\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.390\nFrom there, I can actually just\ncreate my own little grouping there.\n\n320\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:47.387\nSo now if I click OK and I go to Home,\nwell now notice there it is.\n\n321\n00:17:47.387 --> 00:17:50.907\nHere's Ronnie's Tools in\nthe upper right hand corner.\n\n322\n00:17:50.907 --> 00:17:55.070\nAnd you can see that I've added\nin my own little grouping there.\n\n323\n00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.684\nNow we can actually make it better, right?\n\n324\n00:17:56.684 --> 00:17:59.870\nI could add in a new tab,\nit gave me that feature, but\n\n325\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.086\nit really does work the same way\nwhen we talk about customizing that.\n\n326\n00:18:04.086 --> 00:18:07.990\nInstead, notice I have a new tab.\n\n327\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:12.230\nApparently, I'm doubling everything here.\n\n328\n00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.580\nI don't know why.\n\n329\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.080\nLet's just do that and\nI'll rename this one.\n\n330\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.793\nWe'll call it Ronny.\n\n331\n00:18:22.197 --> 00:18:24.242\nAnd then, click OK.\n\n332\n00:18:24.242 --> 00:18:26.562\nAnd so from here, I might go ahead.\n\n333\n00:18:26.562 --> 00:18:32.229\nLike I said easiest things for\nme, I like to copy.\n\n334\n00:18:32.229 --> 00:18:38.034\n>> Oh, I won't [LAUGH]\n>> Oh Jimmy, see I don't remember now.\n\n335\n00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.390\nHere's my new group, and\nI'll just call this one tools\n\n336\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.658\n>> See I find these so\n\n337\n00:18:41.658 --> 00:18:45.390\nadvantageous because those\nribbons make it great.\n\n338\n00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.583\nBecause all the tools are out\nthere on one of those ribbons, so\n\n339\n00:18:48.583 --> 00:18:50.496\nMicrosoft has done a good job there.\n\n340\n00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:53.741\nBut I typically find myself using\na couple tools off this ribbon,\n\n341\n00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:57.460\na couple tools off that ribbon,\na few off of this other ribbon.\n\n342\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.810\nIt would be nice if we could\nput them all in one ribbon.\n\n343\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.110\nAnd that's what Ronnie's\nshowing us how to do.\n\n344\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.877\nHe's making his own ribbon.\n\n345\n00:19:01.877 --> 00:19:05.800\nYou can go get tools, all the tools\nthat are available are listed there.\n\n346\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.350\nTo get the ones that you use most,\nput them on your own ribbon,\n\n347\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.390\ncreate your own groups,\nand you're good to go.\n\n348\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.160\nSo here it is, where I just showed that,\njust adding in just a few elements.\n\n349\n00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.150\nAnd if I do that, that means I no longer\nhave to actually worry about going to all\n\n350\n00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.360\nthese different places to find\nthose different utilities.\n\n351\n00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.710\nI can just have my own tab and\nready to go.\n\n352\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.660\nYou don't like the way that\nit's actually ordered here,\n\n353\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.340\nyou can simply go back into the Options.\n\n354\n00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.210\nAnd then you could, of course,\ncan move that around.\n\n355\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.739\nIf I wanted to move that\nto the very first element,\n\n356\n00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:41.859\nI simply make it move up and\nthen click okay.\n\n357\n00:19:41.859 --> 00:19:45.523\nAnd now, notice it's right after Files,\nand right before Home,\n\n358\n00:19:45.523 --> 00:19:47.880\nand that way it just sits right there.\n\n359\n00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.640\nI no longer have to go and explore.\n\n360\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.730\nSo, there's a lot of elements right here,\nbut\n\n361\n00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.590\nthis is some of the easy ways that you\ncan do that and really help yourself out.\n\n362\n00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.657\nEspecially if you're trying to\ncustomize and make it work for you.\n\n363\n00:19:58.657 --> 00:19:59.447\n>> Very good.\n\n364\n00:19:59.447 --> 00:20:00.496\nAll right.\nAnd now Ronnie,\n\n365\n00:20:00.496 --> 00:20:03.250\nanother thing that I really need\nto be able to do in my document.\n\n366\n00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.607\nSometimes, I need to look at two different\nparts of a document at the same time.\n\n367\n00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:10.123\nI might have a table or\na list somewhere, and\n\n368\n00:20:10.123 --> 00:20:12.641\nthen a paragraph that's talking about it.\n\n369\n00:20:12.641 --> 00:20:15.700\nAnd it would sure be great if I could\nsee both of those at the same time.\n\n370\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.430\n>> Yeah, it really would.\n\n371\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.507\nAnd the way that I used to do this so\nsimple, I used to open up two different\n\n372\n00:20:19.507 --> 00:20:23.080\ndocuments, and then park them side by\nside and be able to scroll and do that.\n\n373\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.890\nBut one of the elements\nthat's always been in Word,\n\n374\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.210\nand I didn't realize that it always\nbeen there until I got, oh look.\n\n375\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.380\nIt was there in earlier editions,\nis what we call the split view.\n\n376\n00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.307\nAnd so,\nlet me see if I take a look at view here.\n\n377\n00:20:34.307 --> 00:20:37.980\nAnd now, notice that there's\na grouping called Windows, and\n\n378\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.250\nI have what's called split.\n\n379\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.170\nSo now, if I go ahead and\nselect that, you might be going,\n\n380\n00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.580\nwell whats the big deal here?\n\n381\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.790\nNotice it allows me to be able to\nscroll on one part of the document.\n\n382\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.370\nAnd then if I wanted to focus in.\n\n383\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.130\nLet's say that I think that I misspelled\nsomething, and I didn't know, and\n\n384\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:59.060\nI knew that I spelled it\ncorrectly earlier, right?\n\n385\n00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.270\nI can now use the second half of\nthis document to now through and\n\n386\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.830\ncompare and go all right.\n\n387\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.010\nSo now that's actually compared.\n\n388\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.130\nOr if you're like me, you read two\nparagraphs in different parts, and\n\n389\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.330\nyou're like wait that sounds familiar.\n\n390\n00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.400\nDid I duplicate that by accident?\n\n391\n00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.223\nWell notice that you can actually\ncompare it right there, and\n\n392\n00:21:18.223 --> 00:21:20.143\nbe able to make it work for you.\n\n393\n00:21:20.143 --> 00:21:22.883\nAnd do that line by line if you need to.\n\n394\n00:21:22.883 --> 00:21:26.866\nSo this split view really does\nhelp out that tremendously.\n\n395\n00:21:26.866 --> 00:21:30.037\nNow, you know you can also\narrange it to where it stops and\n\n396\n00:21:30.037 --> 00:21:34.050\nthat doesn't work very well on mine,\ncreate a new window instead.\n\n397\n00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.430\nI'll remove that then\nI'm ready to go again.\n\n398\n00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.670\nThis view right here is very important,\nright?\n\n399\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.990\nBecause it does.\n\n400\n00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.000\nIt allows you to double check,\nespecially if you have references, right?\n\n401\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.112\nDid you accidentally use that same\nreference again when you didn't need to?\n\n402\n00:21:47.112 --> 00:21:48.610\nIt allows you to compare.\n\n403\n00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.144\nDid you duplicate a sentence because you\ndidn't realize that that's what happened?\n\n404\n00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:56.994\nThese are really neat elements to help you\nto take the effective use of what Word\n\n405\n00:21:56.994 --> 00:21:59.211\ncan do, and make it more powerful.\n\n406\n00:21:59.211 --> 00:22:01.527\nBecause now,\nyou don't have to actually try and\n\n407\n00:22:01.527 --> 00:22:05.100\nfigure out where those elements came from,\nyou know in the long document.\n\n408\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.413\nIf it happened the first half,\n\n409\n00:22:06.413 --> 00:22:08.744\nyou can actually compare it\nto second half right away.\n\n410\n00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:09.835\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n411\n00:22:09.835 --> 00:22:10.426\nNow Ronnie,\n\n412\n00:22:10.426 --> 00:22:13.667\nanother thing that I find myself\nstruggling with is repetitive tasks.\n\n413\n00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:15.574\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Things that I have to do over and\n\n414\n00:22:15.574 --> 00:22:16.220\nover again.\n\n415\n00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.792\nLike when I'm reviewing\na document they send to me, and\n\n416\n00:22:19.792 --> 00:22:25.270\nlet's say that they've got their chapter\ntitles, but the font needs to be changed.\n\n417\n00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.617\nOr I have to do several things.\n\n418\n00:22:26.617 --> 00:22:30.650\nI have to increase the font and the color,\nand the case and things like that.\n\n419\n00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.190\nThen I gotta go down and find the next\ninstance of a chapter title and\n\n420\n00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.530\ndo that all again.\n\n421\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.614\nCan Word help me with that?\n\n422\n00:22:36.614 --> 00:22:40.818\nIt really can, and what we're talking\nabout here is the idea of creating, well\n\n423\n00:22:40.818 --> 00:22:45.296\na simple macro that can help out what you\nneed to do, especially on repetitive task.\n\n424\n00:22:45.296 --> 00:22:48.933\nWe wanna reduce repetitive tasks,\ncuz as fun as it sounds,\n\n425\n00:22:48.933 --> 00:22:53.806\nit's not fun on a 20 page paper when you\nhave to go through every element here,\n\n426\n00:22:53.806 --> 00:22:56.450\nand try and figure out, did I do that?\n\n427\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.710\nAfter about the fifth time, I can't\nremember if that was a 14 point font that\n\n428\n00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.250\nwe were changing it to or a 12 point.\n\n429\n00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.170\nWas it Ariel, or was it Ariel black.\n\n430\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.495\nAnd now, it actually starts to look\nconsistent throughout your document\n\n431\n00:23:08.495 --> 00:23:10.420\ncuz you think that you remember\nall of these elements.\n\n432\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.560\nThe good thing is you can\nactually create it once and\n\n433\n00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.870\nthen have word repeat it for you.\n\n434\n00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.021\n>> Nice.\n>> And that's the way that we can do that\n\n435\n00:23:16.021 --> 00:23:18.272\nis by creating what we\ncall a simple macro.\n\n436\n00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:22.142\nNow you do need to be careful with macro's\nbecause it is actually coding that you\n\n437\n00:23:22.142 --> 00:23:22.737\nare doing.\n\n438\n00:23:22.737 --> 00:23:26.061\nAnd that means that that coding\ncan get manipulated and changed.\n\n439\n00:23:26.061 --> 00:23:30.244\nWell, it can actually change it instead to\nsay hey, delete all these files instead,\n\n440\n00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:31.881\nand it can go in there and do that.\n\n441\n00:23:31.881 --> 00:23:33.808\nBut that's what you have to be aware of.\n\n442\n00:23:33.808 --> 00:23:37.200\nBut overall though,\ncreating a macro can be fairly simple.\n\n443\n00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.551\nLet me show you how to do that.\n\n444\n00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:42.920\nLet's take for an example now\nthat I have all these chapters.\n\n445\n00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:47.752\nNow divide it up with another graphical\nelement here, another theme or\n\n446\n00:23:47.752 --> 00:23:49.047\nstyle that I have.\n\n447\n00:23:49.047 --> 00:23:53.883\nI wanna make sure that at the beginning of\neach chapter here that what we take is we\n\n448\n00:23:53.883 --> 00:23:57.504\ntake, let's say, the first word and\nwe create a drop cap.\n\n449\n00:23:57.504 --> 00:24:00.795\nIn other words, that first letter is\nactually larger than it needs to be.\n\n450\n00:24:00.795 --> 00:24:05.444\nAnd I want to change the first letter\nto be that same shade of blue, or\n\n451\n00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.415\nclose to that shade of blue.\n\n452\n00:24:07.415 --> 00:24:11.640\nCuz I don't think I'm going to remember\nthat exact blue accent element.\n\n453\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.550\nSo I want to do something like that.\n\n454\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.950\nWell, manually, right?\n\n455\n00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.250\nRemember what we're saying here is that\nwhat we'd have to do is we'd select that.\n\n456\n00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.435\nAnd then I have to go and find,\noops I keep clicking on that.\n\n457\n00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:25.110\nI'd have to go and\nfind that drop cap element.\n\n458\n00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.260\nNow let me see,\nwhere was that drop cap element?\n\n459\n00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.643\nIt was here, under insert.\n\n460\n00:24:29.643 --> 00:24:31.481\nAnd then I've selected that word.\n\n461\n00:24:31.481 --> 00:24:36.780\nThere it is at drop cap and\nI'll drop in A in the margin.\n\n462\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.430\nLet me do it here.\n\n463\n00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.200\nSo I need to select that first word,\nor that first letter, don't IZ?\n\n464\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.124\nSo not the entire word.\n\n465\n00:24:42.124 --> 00:24:46.106\nLet me select that, and then, oops.\n\n466\n00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:46.826\nFuck.\n\n467\n00:24:46.826 --> 00:24:47.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Darn, I'm not gonna pick, there we go.\n\n468\n00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.140\nI'll do something like this.\n\n469\n00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.210\nSo that's what I want to do.\n\n470\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.886\nAnd so I can do it in dropped,\nand the margin none.\n\n471\n00:24:57.886 --> 00:24:58.849\nSo let me select that.\n\n472\n00:24:58.849 --> 00:25:01.496\nAnd I can even pick how\nmany lines I wanna drop.\n\n473\n00:25:01.496 --> 00:25:04.549\nSo let me say I'm gonna do two lines here.\n\n474\n00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:05.246\nCuz three, oops,\nI think I went up to five.\n\n475\n00:25:05.246 --> 00:25:08.633\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so\n\n476\n00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:11.340\nthree and we'll do something like that.\n\n477\n00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.205\nWe'll make it funky.\n\n478\n00:25:14.205 --> 00:25:16.645\nConstantina, I don't know what\nthat actually looks, there we go.\n\n479\n00:25:16.645 --> 00:25:18.223\nSo we'll make it look something like that.\n\n480\n00:25:18.223 --> 00:25:24.590\nAnd then I would need to normally,\nI want to say red or blue.\n\n481\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.479\nLet's say I wanted blue, okay.\n\n482\n00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:29.176\nThat's a lot of elements right.\n\n483\n00:25:29.176 --> 00:25:31.590\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> That was a lot of clicking.\n\n484\n00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:36.480\n>> And if you've got 30 chapters\nyou'd do that 30 different times.\n\n485\n00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.900\n>> Yeah, that's something you\ndon't really want to do too often.\n\n486\n00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.480\nBut let me just show you, okay.\n\n487\n00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.130\nSo let's say that that's\nwhat we want to do.\n\n488\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.900\nNow, I still have to do that.\n\n489\n00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.920\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n490\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.390\nI still have to get that done.\n\n491\n00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.040\nBut this time if I select, where are we?\n\n492\n00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.760\nView, and then here it is on Macros.\n\n493\n00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:01.600\nI can go ahead and record a macro from\nhere, and we'll just call it drop cap.\n\n494\n00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.300\nAnd then we can assign\na keyboard shortcut to it.\n\n495\n00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.320\nAnd so this keyboard shortcut,\n\n496\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.935\nI'm just going to do an alt shift six,\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n497\n00:26:11.935 --> 00:26:15.790\nCuz normally I don't use\nthe caret symbol for anything.\n\n498\n00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.820\nSo that's actually a good way\nto do something like that.\n\n499\n00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.590\nAnd select a sign.\n\n500\n00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.280\nNow, when I do that, and I click close,\n\n501\n00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.340\nnotice that now I have a little\ntape recorder to my cursor.\n\n502\n00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.830\nCouldn't really have called it.\n\n503\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.620\nAnd so,\nnow I can select a letter just like that.\n\n504\n00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:38.890\nAnd, if I wanted to,\nI can then go to insert, and then.\n\n505\n00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.400\nOn drop cap here and do this.\n\n506\n00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.062\nI want to drop it in.\n\n507\n00:26:44.062 --> 00:26:47.717\nWe'll change it to three, or two.\n\n508\n00:26:47.717 --> 00:26:51.556\nAnd I said I'm going to\nchange it to constantina.\n\n509\n00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:52.778\nClick OK.\n\n510\n00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:58.482\nAnd then I want to change\nit to I keep looking for\n\n511\n00:26:58.482 --> 00:27:01.711\nthat same element there.\n\n512\n00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:05.940\nSo I want to change it to this\ncolor right here, all right?\n\n513\n00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.820\nSo if everything is fine there.\n\n514\n00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.850\nThen I can go back in the mac rows and\nstop the reporting.\n\n515\n00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.410\nSo I can use something like that and\n\n516\n00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.030\nthen I can go down to let's\nsay this chapter here.\n\n517\n00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.110\nAnd then I could do my,\nif I remember right.\n\n518\n00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.289\nAlt+6, and\nnow you'll see see it actually has an.\n\n519\n00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:29.023\nOh, it didn't actually change the color,\ninteresting.\n\n520\n00:27:29.023 --> 00:27:30.810\nHuh, that's a little bit more unusual.\n\n521\n00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.450\nI don't know why it\ndidn't change the color.\n\n522\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.470\nBut that's what you can do.\n\n523\n00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.336\nYou can actually use that instead of\nyou having to go back through and\n\n524\n00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:37.250\ndo everything here.\n\n525\n00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.835\nYou can see and\nselect those elements here.\n\n526\n00:27:40.835 --> 00:27:45.290\nApparently it did not like\nme doing the color save.\n\n527\n00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.910\nSo I can't explain why it didn't do that.\n\n528\n00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.480\nBut that's what you're\nnormally talking about.\n\n529\n00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.240\nYou can do this for elements and you don't\nhave to be consistent all the way through.\n\n530\n00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.020\nLet's say it's your company name and logo.\n\n531\n00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.980\nAnd it's just typed in there, but\nit's normally supposed to be that way.\n\n532\n00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.020\nIt should help you change that.\n\n533\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.540\nAnd then you can go through and\nsearch for that entire element.\n\n534\n00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.280\nAnd be able to do that.\n\n535\n00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.370\n>> Yeah so\nit's basically recording your steps.\n\n536\n00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.240\nWhatever it is that you're doing,\nit's keeping track of that.\n\n537\n00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.700\nAnd everything that we can\ndo in Word obviously is done\n\n538\n00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.240\nprogrammatically in the background through\nwhat, Visual Basic for Applications.\n\n539\n00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.710\nSo it's remembering what you did and\nyou hit stop recording and you're just.\n\n540\n00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.630\nPlaying the tape back.\n\n541\n00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:22.990\nI've seen people creating\nmacros that take a document in.\n\n542\n00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.480\nYou start with a document.\n\n543\n00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.470\nThey run their macro.\n\n544\n00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.250\nAnd it dumps in a header, a footer.\n\n545\n00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.290\nIt changes the font.\n\n546\n00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.250\nIt changes the color.\n\n547\n00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.410\nIt puts an order on there.\n\n548\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.970\nIt applies a style, a theme.\n\n549\n00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.800\nI mean, it does everything.\n\n550\n00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.120\nAnd all they did was\none keyboard shortcut.\n\n551\n00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.830\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm like, wow.\n\n552\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.460\nYeah, that would have\ntaken me two hours to do.\n\n553\n00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.960\nBut they have to do it every\ntime they get a new document.\n\n554\n00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.330\nSo, they've taken the time\nto record the macro.\n\n555\n00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.570\nAnd now they can do it as\nquick as they need to.\n\n556\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.210\nFantastic.\n\n557\n00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.710\n>> Yeah.\nThe only other element you need to\n\n558\n00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.980\nworry about, of course,\nis you need to go in and\n\n559\n00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.050\ncheck how your particular document is\nnow going to be working with it too.\n\n560\n00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.940\nSo, let me bring you to the options here.\n\n561\n00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.050\nI'm gonna click on File,\nand then go into Options.\n\n562\n00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:04.490\nAnd what we're looking for\nhere is under Trust Center.\n\n563\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.350\nSo you want to be careful here,\nbecause this is where we go about\n\n564\n00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.620\nthe idea of making sure that we\nunderstand some of the macro settings.\n\n565\n00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.590\nSo remember, Word Options, Trust Center\nand the Trust Center Settings.\n\n566\n00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.710\nAnd it's right here,\nnotice it's highlighted by default right?\n\n567\n00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.025\nSo when you open up a Word document,\n\n568\n00:29:23.025 --> 00:29:27.050\nbecause how this can actually\nend up being really bad for you.\n\n569\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.815\nIs that they can take that coding that\nwe're talking about and modify it and\n\n570\n00:29:30.815 --> 00:29:32.600\nreally do some damage here.\n\n571\n00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.130\nThat by default all macros\nare normally disabled.\n\n572\n00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.241\nAnd then when you open\nup a document it says.\n\n573\n00:29:38.241 --> 00:29:42.829\nHey, here's macros in here,\nand it says default macros, or\n\n574\n00:29:42.829 --> 00:29:46.230\ndisable all macros with notification.\n\n575\n00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:47.910\nIt'll tell you there's macros in there.\n\n576\n00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.130\nAnd then it says, look,\nwe don't really want this running.\n\n577\n00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.210\nAnd if you don't trust that\ndocument that you had.\n\n578\n00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.310\nIt's saying look, let's just go ahead and\ndo that and make sure that we turn it off.\n\n579\n00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.960\nBut notice that you can disable\nall of them without notification.\n\n580\n00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.180\nYou can enable all of them if you want to.\n\n581\n00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:06.230\nThis is something they don't recommend\nif you just wanna leave it enabled.\n\n582\n00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.880\nBut then you can disable\nall of them accept for\n\n583\n00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.280\nthe ones that are digitally\nsigned by whoever.\n\n584\n00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.148\nSo just just kind of make sure that you\nunderstand that those are settings that\n\n585\n00:30:14.148 --> 00:30:14.810\nyou may see.\n\n586\n00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.610\nIf all of a sudden you create a macro,\nyou save it.\n\n587\n00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:20.603\nAnd then you open that document back up,\nit goes no, I don't like this.\n\n588\n00:30:20.603 --> 00:30:23.060\nYou may have to go in here\nto the Trust Center and\n\n589\n00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.223\ntake a look at those settings and\nmake sure you change them.\n\n590\n00:30:26.223 --> 00:30:29.232\n>> Yeah that VVA, that code that it's\nusing can access the file system,\n\n591\n00:30:29.232 --> 00:30:30.254\nthe operating system.\n\n592\n00:30:30.254 --> 00:30:32.973\nSo can definitely be used for\nmalicious purposes.\n\n593\n00:30:32.973 --> 00:30:36.426\nGotta make sure you're trusting\nthe document if you're gonna allow those\n\n594\n00:30:36.426 --> 00:30:37.650\nmacros to run.\n\n595\n00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.074\nLast thing you want to talk about\nthere Ronnie, is document properties.\n\n596\n00:30:41.074 --> 00:30:45.743\n>> Yeah there's a few different\nthings that can also help you out.\n\n597\n00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:50.440\nAs you're starting to\nwork with word documents.\n\n598\n00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.650\nLet me go ahead and show you here.\n\n599\n00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.955\nIf I go ahead and click on File,\n\n600\n00:30:53.955 --> 00:30:58.310\nnotice on the right hand side\nwe have the file properties.\n\n601\n00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.370\nNow this is not affecting\nthe content inside of word.\n\n602\n00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.440\nThis is actually affecting\nthe file itself.\n\n603\n00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.600\nSo whatever document that you create,\nthis is the properties of that file.\n\n604\n00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.620\nAnd notice it gives us the size\nof that currently, pages,\n\n605\n00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.640\nnumber of words, editing time.\n\n606\n00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.930\nBut then directly underneath it, and\nnotice I can add in things like a title,\n\n607\n00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.410\ntags, comments right here.\n\n608\n00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.850\nSo what we can do is we\ncan add these elements in.\n\n609\n00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:28.110\nAnd that allows for easier searches\nto go on for your document as well.\n\n610\n00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:31.610\nSo, if you want to, that is also another\nelement that really helps you out.\n\n611\n00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.149\nBy adding in keywords,\nby adding in some comments,\n\n612\n00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:37.455\ninstead of someone actually needing\nto open up the document and go.\n\n613\n00:31:37.455 --> 00:31:40.866\nI wonder what this is about, well add\nin a brief description right here.\n\n614\n00:31:40.866 --> 00:31:43.050\nAnd that way when they\nhover over that file.\n\n615\n00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.890\nThey go, oh yeah, this is something\nRonnie's working on right now.\n\n616\n00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.450\nAnd it says, do not modify.\n\n617\n00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.890\nWell, then that means I\nprobably shouldn't modify it.\n\n618\n00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:53.660\nNow if you wanted to, of course, you can\nalways go toward the bottom where it says,\n\n619\n00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.140\nshow all properties of that document.\n\n620\n00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.900\nAnd then it goes ahead and\nthen actually gives you a little bit more,\n\n621\n00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.030\nlike who's actually the author.\n\n622\n00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.320\nWho's the manager.\n\n623\n00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.970\nYou can add in a lot of elements that\nreally do help out with the search.\n\n624\n00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.560\nEspecially if you are working with\nan organization where there's hundreds and\n\n625\n00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.790\nthousands of documents.\n\n626\n00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.210\nSomething like this can\nreally help you out.\n\n627\n00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:13.710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n628\n00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:16.330\nI can see where that would\nbe a really big benefit.\n\n629\n00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.420\nAll right Ronnie,\nwell great information there.\n\n630\n00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.640\nI feel like we got a lot covered,\na lot of really cool\n\n631\n00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.600\nthings we can do with the views to make\nit easier to work with that document.\n\n632\n00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.080\nIf I'm on that tablet and\nI don't plan on making any changes.\n\n633\n00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.360\nI could flip over that reading view,\nfor example.\n\n634\n00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.560\nWe've got our zoom capabilities.\n\n635\n00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:37.620\nWe saw how we could customize the\ninterface and make it more to my liking.\n\n636\n00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.560\nWe can customize that\nquick access tool bar.\n\n637\n00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.370\nWe can customize those ribbons.\n\n638\n00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.530\nAnd then, macros, of course.\n\n639\n00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.520\nWho doesn't like macros?\n\n640\n00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.260\nThe ability to automate things.\n\n641\n00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.220\nThings that we have to do\nRepeatedly over and over again.\n\n642\n00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:49.960\nWhy bother?\n\n643\n00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.470\nWhy not do it once, record it,\n\n644\n00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.240\nand then you can just play\nit back anytime you need it.\n\n645\n00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.790\nThanks Ronnie for those great examples and\nall that information.\n\n646\n00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.200\nAny parting words for our viewers?\n\n647\n00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.030\n>> Well, just remember.\n\n648\n00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.980\nWork with the tools that\nare available inside.\n\n649\n00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.870\nDon't always try and\nfigure out the way around it.\n\n650\n00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.552\nLearning how to use the tool is\nactually gonna be much more effective.\n\n651\n00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:11.127\nAnd you using the tools is just gonna\nhelp you out as you actually become more\n\n652\n00:33:11.127 --> 00:33:13.413\ncomfortable and\nbecome more proficient at it.\n\n653\n00:33:13.413 --> 00:33:15.129\nThose tools will become your best friend,\nand\n\n654\n00:33:15.129 --> 00:33:17.350\nsay I can't believe I have\nto learn another tool.\n\n655\n00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.660\nSo, when you actually use\nthe application it will help\n\n656\n00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.130\nyou out in the future\nmore than you realize.\n\n657\n00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.380\n>> Very good, all right well ladies and\ngentlemen that's gonna do it for this one.\n\n658\n00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.750\nSigning off for IT pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n659\n00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:32.140\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n660\n00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.167\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:21.502\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're gonna be looking at Word 2016 and\n\n4\n00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:24.755\nspecifically how to print and\nsave our documents.\n\n5\n00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:27.984\nAnd I've got with me my good friend\nRonnie Wong who's gonna help us and\n\n6\n00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:30.180\nat this point, I need some help, right?\n\n7\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.430\nWe've learned our basic skills of getting\nstarted with Word and being able to\n\n8\n00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.510\nnavigate around a document and do some\nselection and some editing there, but.\n\n9\n00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.360\nNow it's time to print some of these\ndocuments, I've got all of this work\n\n10\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.470\nstacking up on my desk and\nmy bosses want a hard copy of this stuff.\n\n11\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.330\nThey want me to be able to\nprint out the entire document.\n\n12\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.730\nNow I've got another guy that's on me to\nprint out just a section of the document.\n\n13\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.770\nSo, I've got some challenge ahead of me,\nRonnie, can you help us out.\n\n14\n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.280\n>> We really can, the good thing is\nWord is actually right there ready for\n\n15\n00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.290\nyou to be able to use and be able to\nprint exactly what you're looking for.\n\n16\n00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.870\nA lot of times we don't realize that\nthere's so many different options.\n\n17\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.850\nAnd the reason why is that we tend\nto print out things without ever\n\n18\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.440\nlooking at them.\n\n19\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.560\nIf you ever done that, like I have,\nthen you go and print it out and\n\n20\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.620\nyou look at it and go,\noh my gosh, that looks terrible.\n\n21\n00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.170\nAnd then you go back and you're like,\n\n22\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.410\nwhy did it only print that last little\nline or one line on that one page?\n\n23\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.930\nAnd then you take a look, and then you\nrealize that there's gaps in the middle.\n\n24\n00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.470\nYou name it, prints actually a little\nbit harder for you to fix, right.\n\n25\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.940\nAnd then you print out like 30 or 40\npages, realizing that you kept missing it.\n\n26\n00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.800\nSo you go back and you need to\nmassage it a little bit better.\n\n27\n00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.650\nSo the good thing is,\n\n28\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.982\nWord really can help you in whatever\nprint options that you need and you do.\n\n29\n00:01:41.982 --> 00:01:45.040\nYou wanna be familiar with at\nleast a majority of these options\n\n30\n00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.390\nbecause there are so many different things\nyou can do that can really help you one,\n\n31\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.760\nsave paper, if nothing else.\n\n32\n00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.165\nIf you're like me and just print happy.\n\n33\n00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:55.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Two is to make it look exactly the way\n\n34\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.550\nthat you need to.\n\n35\n00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.250\nSo, that's what we want to start off with,\n\n36\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.850\nis just a simple idea of just a print\nfunction that will help us out.\n\n37\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.590\nSo let's go in and take a look at\nthe document that I have in place.\n\n38\n00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.880\nNow during this series, we've been\nreally using this same document here.\n\n39\n00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.630\nIt's THE PRINCE by Machiavelli and at this\npoint we've added in some formatting.\n\n40\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.070\nEverything is beginning to look good.\n\n41\n00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.670\nIt's not exactly complete, but\nlet's say exactly what Mike said,\n\n42\n00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.660\nis that here it is.\n\n43\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.940\nWe're at this point, and now when we're\nactually ready to do some printing,\n\n44\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.740\nsomebody says let me just see it on paper,\nbecause I really need to see it.\n\n45\n00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.230\nLooking at it on the screen, it looks\ngreat, but I wanna see how it actually\n\n46\n00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.350\nlooks on pages, and\nhow it actually prints out here.\n\n47\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.590\nSo, we might go ahead and\nbegin this idea of printing it.\n\n48\n00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.230\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.740\ntake a look at some of the options that\nwe do have available for printing.\n\n50\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.600\nSo when we talk about printing this\ndocument, there are multiple ways, but\n\n51\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.450\nthe easiest way to see every feature and\n\n52\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.910\nfunction, is once we actually are inside\nof Word, we can click on File.\n\n53\n00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.610\nWhich will bring us to\nour backstage area and\n\n54\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.430\nnotice over on the left hand side we of\ncourse have the link here that says print\n\n55\n00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.890\nand when we do this you notice that it\nbrings us into this nice print area\n\n56\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.880\nfocusing in on everything that we\ncan deal and do with printing.\n\n57\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.090\nNow if I take a look over here on\nthe right-hand side you can see this is\n\n58\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.690\na preview area and\n\n59\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.430\ndown at the bottom it gives me navigation\nwhere I can now actually scroll through.\n\n60\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.540\nAnd see it in Print Preview and this\nis what we're really going to be using.\n\n61\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.350\nI don't want to print out 34 pages just\nto make a demo here for us to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.290\nBut we can actually see how the pages end\nup looking if we were to go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.250\nprint this.\n\n64\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.490\n>> So when we look at that print preview,\nthat's the same thing we would see if\n\n65\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.790\nwe actually printed it and\nwent and picked up the paper.\n\n66\n00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.880\n>> That's exactly what we're\nsupposed to be able to see.\n\n67\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.120\nSo it's at this point that if you\nwere actually trying to do this.\n\n68\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.210\nInstead of printing it out and\nthen realizing something was missing.\n\n69\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.880\nLet's say that you go, all right, there\nare my page headers up here, is it right?\n\n70\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.121\nAnd you'll see that I have a different\neven page header than an odd page header,\n\n71\n00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:57.337\nis that what I wanted?\n\n72\n00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:00.300\nYou also have the page numbers\ndown here at the bottom edge so\n\n73\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.754\nyeah you're looking for those elements and\nthen how does it lay out.\n\n74\n00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:06.778\nYou're also looking for\nthose weird things like a single line or\n\n75\n00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:09.270\na single word being\nprinted on a single page.\n\n76\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.120\nBut these are some of the options that\nyou can have in that print preview\n\n77\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.890\nis incredibly handy for\nyou to be able to do so.\n\n78\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.650\nThe other problem that you might\nalso end up having, of course,\n\n79\n00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.980\nis the number of copies.\n\n80\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.050\nBy default it sets itself to\none copy which is always great,\n\n81\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.050\nespecially with a super long document.\n\n82\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.520\nAlways great to have it by one copy and\nso, you can, of course, change this up to\n\n83\n00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.900\nas many copies as you need and\nthen there's just this Print button.\n\n84\n00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.962\nNow, when you say Print button, It takes\neverything that you see right here, right?\n\n85\n00:04:36.962 --> 00:04:40.688\nThe printer, the settings, everything\nthat's actually set down here, and\n\n86\n00:04:40.688 --> 00:04:43.461\nit says use all these settings and\njust give me a hard copy.\n\n87\n00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:48.060\nAnd that's normally what we want, unless\nyou're really wanting something different.\n\n88\n00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.670\nAnd this is where it becomes\na little bit more important for\n\n89\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.160\nwhat you're actually tying to do.\n\n90\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.960\nLet's say that somebody says, look,\nI really want a copy of this, but\n\n91\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.580\nI don't wanna spend 34 pages cuz\nit's gonna print out on one side.\n\n92\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.510\nWell you can change those settings\nto actually say print it on double\n\n93\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.860\nsided if you wanted to.\n\n94\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.830\nYou of course can collate the pages or\n\n95\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.840\nyou can stake them up if you were making\nmultiple copies at the same time.\n\n96\n00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.530\nSo there's many options, so let's go\nahead and take a look at some of them.\n\n97\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.190\nAnd I'll try and\n\n98\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.730\ndo the best that I can to do a little\nbit of zoom-in features as we do so.\n\n99\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.310\nNow, the key thing for\nwhat we have to deal with a lot of times\n\n100\n00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.300\nis actually gonna be right\nhere underneath Printer and\n\n101\n00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.080\nyou'll see it's actually got its\nown separate little heading here.\n\n102\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.990\nNow let me see if I can zoom in and\n\n103\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.000\nthat way we can take a look\nat it a little bit better.\n\n104\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.550\nNotice it says printer and\nit says Studio Printer#5.\n\n105\n00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.410\nNow Mike, I know that we only\nhave one studio printer.\n\n106\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.970\n>> Where are the other four Ronnie\nbecause I only know of one.\n\n107\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.680\n>> This can be problematic.\n\n108\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.520\nWhere you end up seeing something like\nthis where is says Studio Printer#5.\n\n109\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.230\nYou click on this drop down.\n\n110\n00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.100\nYou can actually see that\nthere's a lot of other printers\n\n111\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.850\nthat we also have in place that\nwe can choose and select from.\n\n112\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.320\nNow mine is just because I've unplugged\nand plugged it back in multiple times and\n\n113\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.730\nit's created different copies of\nthese things inside of Word but\n\n114\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.400\nyou'll notice that there's only actually\none studio printer even though it says\n\n115\n00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.000\nnumber five here.\n\n116\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.570\nThat's one of the things you do want\nto make sure you do pick correctly\n\n117\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.780\nis of course the right printer.\n\n118\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.550\nI know I've worked in an environment\nwhere there's been multiple printers.\n\n119\n00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.340\nAnd I come here and\nI go and click Print, and\n\n120\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.150\nthen all of a sudden it goes away, right?\n\n121\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.230\nIt just goes to a different,\ngoes back to my regular print layout view.\n\n122\n00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.190\nI go, which printer did I print that to?\n\n123\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.580\nSo it's very easy if you're\nnot paying attention and\n\n124\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.480\nyou don't realize what your\ndefault printer is going to be.\n\n125\n00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.280\nAnd so you always want to make\nsure that before you print,\n\n126\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.050\nexactly what printer\nyou're going to see here.\n\n127\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.600\nNow that's not your only\noptions that are left, right?\n\n128\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.490\nSo with our studio printer, if there's\nactually other functions that the printer\n\n129\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.490\ncan do, of course you can click on this\nlink that says, printer properties and\n\n130\n00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.630\nit's in here, that you can even see\nsome more stuff that you can do,\n\n131\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.610\nthat's specific to that\nparticular printer.\n\n132\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.240\nSo like here,\n\n133\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.310\nI can even choose what particular paper\ntray I want to print from, if I wanted to.\n\n134\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.600\nSo there are actually a lot of\noptions just inside of that.\n\n135\n00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.950\nSometimes you end up saying that if you\npick a different printer, let me take for\n\n136\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.830\nan example, we'll do this one,\nthe Ricoh Class Driver.\n\n137\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.780\nI have access to a Ricoh printer as well.\n\n138\n00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.200\nWell, notice that some of this stuff\nactually ended up disappearing.\n\n139\n00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.020\nAnd so if I change it back to that studio\nprinter, let's see if I can find it again.\n\n140\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.480\nYou'll now notice that some of\nthe stuff actually went away.\n\n141\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.030\nSo if I choose that Ricoh one again, it\nactually is able to pick up on the driver\n\n142\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.750\nthat's actually that printer,\nand notice it says no staple.\n\n143\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.230\nSo even this printer apparently\nhad the ability to staple or\n\n144\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.300\neven sometimes to fold\nthe paper if we need it to.\n\n145\n00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.824\nSo you do wanna make sure that you\nunderstand that when you print, you do\n\n146\n00:07:48.824 --> 00:07:53.056\nneed to select the printer that's actually\ngonna give you what you actually want, or\n\n147\n00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:56.462\nif it's the one right beside your desk,\nmake sure you pick that one,\n\n148\n00:07:56.462 --> 00:07:57.671\nif you're doing that.\n\n149\n00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:01.837\nSo let's take a look at these available\nsettings that we see right here.\n\n150\n00:08:01.837 --> 00:08:05.238\nRemember that we can actually print\nnot only the whole thing, which is,\n\n151\n00:08:05.238 --> 00:08:08.805\nas she says it, which is neat,\nprint all pages, the whole thing, right.\n\n152\n00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:11.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm assuming that at some point,\n\n153\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.660\nMike, what ended up happening is that when\nthey said print all pages, that Microsoft\n\n154\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.091\nactually got a number of requests saying\ndoes that mean we print the whole thing.\n\n155\n00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:21.962\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or not.\n\n156\n00:08:21.962 --> 00:08:24.855\nThey decided that they'd\ninclude that in as a subtitle.\n\n157\n00:08:24.855 --> 00:08:26.942\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's gotta be pretty funny, right?\n\n158\n00:08:26.942 --> 00:08:27.455\n>> Right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n159\n00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:29.770\n>> When you give them print all pages, and\n\n160\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.060\nthere's enough,\nyou know feedback that comes back and\n\n161\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.097\nsays, does all pages mean the whole thing?\n\n162\n00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:36.490\n[INAUDIBLE] yeah let's go back and\n\n163\n00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.550\nadd that in there-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.850\n>> The whole thing,\n\n165\n00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.790\nnotice that we could of course\nactually print what we choose to print\n\n166\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:42.740\ninstead\n>> So\n\n167\n00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.560\nlet's say that I only\nwanted to print one page.\n\n168\n00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.980\nWell, we can do that.\n\n169\n00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.900\nWe can even go down and just print info,\nmarkups that we have, styles, you name it.\n\n170\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.630\nIf you were actually inside\nof the printing business,\n\n171\n00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.710\nthat's the stuff that you like.\n\n172\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.770\nBut if you're like me,\nyou just want a copy of it.\n\n173\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.010\nSo it's no big deal.\n\n174\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.700\nSo you might choose the whole thing or\neven just that one page.\n\n175\n00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.350\nIf I select that, perfectly fine.\n\n176\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.000\nI know that's my limitation in doing that.\n\n177\n00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.790\nNow you'll notice that this one\nthat says print selection here\n\n178\n00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.830\nis actually grayed out.\n\n179\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.350\nIt doesn't give me that option right now.\n\n180\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.850\nBut can I make that option appear?\n\n181\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.080\nSure.\nLet me show you how to do that.\n\n182\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.380\nSo let's say that what I needed though\nwas just this particular dedication\n\n183\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.360\nsection instead.\n\n184\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.490\nSo, I can highlight by using\nthis special left margin area.\n\n185\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.930\nI'm trying to get that stupid,\nI say stupid,\n\n186\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:38.730\nthat silly mini toolbar out of the way and\njust drag down.\n\n187\n00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.430\nLet's say I want just that\nsection right here until there.\n\n188\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.490\nSo, if I select that, now,\nif I go back to File.\n\n189\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.650\nAnd I go back to print.\n\n190\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.300\nNow, I might just be able, look at that,\nI can print just that selection instead.\n\n191\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.180\nAnd that way, when we print,\nit doesn't take that whole 34 pages.\n\n192\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.290\nIt just allows me to\nprint that one section.\n\n193\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.860\nAnd we may do something like this\nif we're trying to re-edit that\n\n194\n00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.270\none paragraph or we've got.\n\n195\n00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.180\nSomething's funny about it.\n\n196\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.800\nI don't know what it is.\n\n197\n00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.060\nLet me let you read it.\n\n198\n00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.100\n>> Yeah.\nSomebody asks for a.\n\n199\n00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.635\nHey, I need a copy of\nyour table of contents.\n\n200\n00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:09.490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I don't have to print\n\n201\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.370\nthe entire document.\n\n202\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.450\nI can.\n\n203\n00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.070\nSelect just that table of contents,\nand print just that out, and\n\n204\n00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.120\nI guess that's the key then is in order\nto print just a portion of the document,\n\n205\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.660\nyou have to select that portion of\nthe document you want to print.\n\n206\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.820\n>> And it's going back to that\nphrase that we've been using,\n\n207\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.180\nright, select to effect, and those\nare some of the options that you will see.\n\n208\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.120\nRemember that one that does grey out,\nright,\n\n209\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.950\nits saying right now you can't do it.\n\n210\n00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.290\nBut, clearly is saying,\nselect the document first, and\n\n211\n00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.330\nthen you'll notice it highlighted, and\nyou now have that ability to do so.\n\n212\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.360\nNow, here's some of the other\nthings that I also like, right,\n\n213\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.480\nyou can also select what page you want to.\n\n214\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.310\nSo, notice that I can say pages 33 and,\nlet's\n\n215\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.720\nsay, 27, or 27 and 28,\nI think I just do a comma.\n\n216\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.830\nAnd I can even print those\npages if I want to as well.\n\n217\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.700\nAnd you can see it actually\ngives you what you can do here.\n\n218\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:04.350\nAnd see, so one comma, three,\nIt won't let me do it while it's,\n\n219\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.110\nlet me see if I can get it while it's that\nmight be a really good feature where,\n\n220\n00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.490\nlet's say somebody wanted just Chapter 3.\n\n221\n00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.440\nWell, trying to select Chapter 3 might\nbe challenging because it's going to\n\n222\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.080\nspread across multiple pages, so instead\nof trying to do the print selection,\n\n223\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.580\nI can come here and say, hey,\nI need page 45 through 52.\n\n224\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.710\n>> Yeah, and so\nit's really nice because it really does,\n\n225\n00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.140\nit give you that ability to\njust print what you want.\n\n226\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.740\nThe key, of course, is making sure\nthat when you take a look at it,\n\n227\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.160\nyou used the numbers that are down here.\n\n228\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.850\nNow, they should correlate with what you\nhave in the page numbering, but Mike and\n\n229\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.410\nI, we've both seen that, right,\nwhere you're like, it says 56 pages, but\n\n230\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.100\naccording to the page numbering,\nwe're on page 35.\n\n231\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.680\n>> Yes.\n>> And so, you choose page 35 like,\n\n232\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.540\nno, I needed\n>> The one.\n\n233\n00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.120\nSo use the print preview numbers instead.\n\n234\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.020\nI can't tell you why it does that,\nMike might be able to.\n\n235\n00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.220\n>> I want to say, if you have a table\nof contents those don't count\n\n236\n00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.000\ntypically in your page numbers.\n\n237\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.170\nThey might be roman numerals\n>> I don't know if\n\n238\n00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.090\nyou have a glossary in the back.\n\n239\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.190\nThose don't count.\n\n240\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.670\nSo, yeah, definitely use\nthe numbers in the print preview\n\n241\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.270\nto figure out which pages you wanna print.\n\n242\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.160\nDon't look at your book page numbers.\n\n243\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.330\n>> I have been tripped up by that so\nmany times,\n\n244\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.360\nMike, it\n>> It is frustrating, because once\n\n245\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.030\nI print, it's immediately gone, and then I\nhave to go and then I have to go back and\n\n246\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:27.300\nfind that exact page again, and it does,\nit becomes a little bit frustrating.\n\n247\n00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.250\nBut learn from our mistakes\nis what we're telling you.\n\n248\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.810\nSo make sure you also\npay attention to that.\n\n249\n00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.790\nOf course, if your printer has\nthe ability to do double sided printing\n\n250\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.100\n>> You can also, of course,\n\n251\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.820\nselect these as well.\n\n252\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.000\nPrinting one sided is\nthe default of course.\n\n253\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.700\nOne side of the paper and\n\n254\n00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.480\nthat means you do have that of course\nyou can also print on both sides.\n\n255\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.310\nNow here's a little bit tricky right?\n\n256\n00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.310\nWe have long edge as well as short edge.\n\n257\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:57.130\nSo when you talk about the idea of the\nlong edge of the paper and you're actually\n\n258\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:02.910\nonly going to let's see if I say print\nboth sides on long edge we can do that,\n\n259\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.290\nand what that will actually do is\nit will make it print like this,\n\n260\n00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.390\nbut just on that long edge on both sides.\n\n261\n00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.300\nAnd so in other words it's doing\nforward and backward here and\n\n262\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.620\nyou actually think that it looks like\nthe landscape printing, but it's not.\n\n263\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.380\nThis is actually the way\nit's gonna print out,\n\n264\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.020\nit's gonna be sideways is what\nwe would end up seeing there.\n\n265\n00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.900\nI've seen where I've needed to\nmake most books we open them and\n\n266\n00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.530\nwe read them by turning the pages left to\nright but what if you got one of those\n\n267\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.910\nbinders that binds across the top\nof the document and you flip it up.\n\n268\n00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:40.410\nWell when you flip it up if you want the\nback side of that paper you just flipped\n\n269\n00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.040\nup to be printed on all right, now you're\nnot flipping it along the long edge.\n\n270\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.890\nYou're flipping it across that short edge,\nso you can make a different layout for\n\n271\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.660\nyour document, but you're not\nchanging the layout of the paper.\n\n272\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.230\n>> Yeah.\n\n273\n00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.250\nAnd so, it really is like landscape or\nthis way is what we're talking about.\n\n274\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.750\nWe can either print,\nwe can do it on the long edge.\n\n275\n00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.620\nGonna print one side on this\nside Now I'm holding a blank\n\n276\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.230\nsheet there\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.190\n>> Print one side here and\n\n278\n00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.230\nthen of course on the back side\nwe would also print that way.\n\n279\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.690\nOr if you say on the short edge flip\nit like this and print this way and\n\n280\n00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.720\nthen of course that way aswell.\n\n281\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.940\nSo you do need to figure some of this out.\n\n282\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.710\nCause it does take a little\nbit of practice to do this.\n\n283\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.580\nIf not you'll kinda print mistakenly but\njust kinda realize you do have that.\n\n284\n00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:27.080\n>> Then sometimes if your printer does\nnot support the ability to print on\n\n285\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.920\nboth sides, it doesn't have a machine\nthat flips it over and that's neat if you\n\n286\n00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.480\nhaven't seen one like ours you actually\nhear it kind of flipping it and\n\n287\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.660\nyou see it kind of almost come out and\nthen it actually flips it back through.\n\n288\n00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.520\nThe big ones you never know what\nits actually doing but it even\n\n289\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.850\ngives you this ability to manual print\non both sides as well In other words,\n\n290\n00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.370\nyou can feed it in, and then it waits for\nyou to re-feed the paper back in to print.\n\n291\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.000\nSo it's kind of neat that word said, look,\nwe're gonna put that feature in there\n\n292\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000\nas part of Word, not just part of that\nprinter, so that you can do this.\n\n293\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.530\n>> That's a great thing for\nSoho's and things like that.\n\n294\n00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.370\nI can't afford a printer\nthat has one of those little\n\n295\n00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.730\ninternal motors that flips it around.\n\n296\n00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.180\nI remember I had one printer\nthat had an attachment\n\n297\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.310\nthat popped on to the back of it that\ngave you the dual sided printing but\n\n298\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.580\nIf you've got a standard printer\nthat won't do both sides and\n\n299\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.710\nyou want to print something on both sides,\nnow you've got that option.\n\n300\n00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:18.130\nYou just print out all the top sides,\ngrab your paper, flip it over,\n\n301\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.290\nfeed it back in, print it again.\n\n302\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:25.320\n>> It really is kind of neat when you do\nstuff like that cuz the first time you try\n\n303\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.360\nit, this is not gonna work and\nthen when it does, it is it's like\n\n304\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.220\nWord was smart enough to actually say\n>> Your printer can't do this,\n\n305\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.135\nbut I can do it.\n\n306\n00:15:32.135 --> 00:15:32.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can do it, yeah.\n\n307\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.620\nThe other thing, of course, is collation.\n\n308\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.970\nIf I printed, let's say, two copies of it,\ndo I want to print the first 34 pages and\n\n309\n00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.830\nstack them the way they need to and\nthen, of course,\n\n310\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.800\nhave them printed out like that?\n\n311\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.120\nOr I can do un collated.\n\n312\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.760\nIn other words, all the first pages.\n\n313\n00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.340\nBoth copies number ones would be there and\nthen two and three.\n\n314\n00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.399\nAnd yeah, that just depends\non what you really need, and\n\n315\n00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.837\nyou also have letter size here,\nand normal.\n\n316\n00:15:56.837 --> 00:15:59.087\nNow I didn't want to go through,\nI did, I went through every option.\n\n317\n00:15:59.087 --> 00:16:00.921\nBut you just kind of know-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:01.479\n>> That yes,\n\n319\n00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:05.199\nyou do need to check some of this stuff\nout When you do print or you will get\n\n320\n00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:09.830\nthings that are mistakenly printed the way\nthat you don't want them to be as well.\n\n321\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.060\nSo make sure you check out those\nprint options that are available.\n\n322\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.610\nOnce you get use to printing the way that\nyou're use to doing it you'll probably\n\n323\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.150\njust set it and forget it.\n\n324\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.990\nBut at the beginning if you're unfamiliar\nwith what you're printing to check that\n\n325\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.110\nprinter and then verify it's printing the\nway that you believe it's going to print.\n\n326\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.273\nSo that's really gonna be helpful,\nat least in just printing a document.\n\n327\n00:16:28.273 --> 00:16:30.146\n>> And, Ronnie, well,\na lot of good options there,\n\n328\n00:16:30.146 --> 00:16:31.901\nnow I can print the entire\ndocument if I want to.\n\n329\n00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:34.930\nI can print a selection of the document.\n\n330\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.400\nI could print just certain pages.\n\n331\n00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.220\nI can staple it.\n\n332\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.530\nI can collate it.\n\n333\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.410\nDo two-sided.\n\n334\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:44.630\nFlip it on the edge, all depending\non what my printer supports but\n\n335\n00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.190\nnow I've got one I'm\ngonna throw at you here.\n\n336\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.370\nI've got a document that is,\nwhen it was designed,\n\n337\n00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.080\nit was designed to go on legal papers.\n\n338\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.860\nSo I've got, what is it,\n8.5 by 14, I believe?\n\n339\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.660\nBut the problem is, my little printer\ndoesn't have any legal paper.\n\n340\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.530\nI need to be able to print this out.\n\n341\n00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.720\nIs it just gonna flop\nover to the next page?\n\n342\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.960\nWhat's going to happen there?\n\n343\n00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.620\n>> Well, depending on your printer, right?\n\n344\n00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.900\nIf you have a document\nthat's already formatted for\n\n345\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.200\nlet's say legal size paper, and your\nprinter only supports the 8.5 by 11, and\n\n346\n00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.110\nit does happen, well what normally happens\nis it re-flows the document, right?\n\n347\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.387\nSo whatever pages that you had,\nyou're gonna see,\n\n348\n00:17:21.387 --> 00:17:24.717\nyou're gonna end up with more pages\nthan what was in the original document.\n\n349\n00:17:24.717 --> 00:17:27.677\nAnd that may work for\nthe majority of what we have to do.\n\n350\n00:17:27.677 --> 00:17:33.240\nBut let's say that what we needed to see\nthough was that very same print out.\n\n351\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.840\nIn other words, whether it's actually\non legal paper and you only have\n\n352\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.200\nletter size paper, but you need to see\nthe exact copy that you need to see.\n\n353\n00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.600\nBecause we're actually producing this,\nlet's say for a customer, and\n\n354\n00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.370\nwhat they wanted was they liked\nthe way that everything flowed.\n\n355\n00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.270\nThey didn't want it reflowed, they didn't\nwant something to be at the bottom,\n\n356\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.070\nthey didn't want something to be at\nthe top, they want it exactly like that.\n\n357\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.170\nWell, can Word help you out in doing that?\n\n358\n00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.680\nYou better believe it can.\n\n359\n00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.840\nWe can actually use what we call\nscaling to help us out here.\n\n360\n00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.920\nSo let me give you an example.\n\n361\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.600\nSo I do have a document that I pulled\nin again from public domain here, for\n\n362\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.470\nlegal size here, and\n\n363\n00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:13.050\nit's actually the whole book of\nThe Art of War translated by someone.\n\n364\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.693\nAnd so they were able to do this and\n\n365\n00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:17.349\nlet's say that this was\nactually done on legal size.\n\n366\n00:18:17.349 --> 00:18:20.667\nBut my my printer only had\nletter size paper in it,\n\n367\n00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:24.073\nand if I wanted to print this out,\nI can't, okay?\n\n368\n00:18:24.073 --> 00:18:27.452\nThe problem is, or not the problem,\nif I go ahead and do this.\n\n369\n00:18:27.452 --> 00:18:29.662\nSo do the file, and I select print,\n\n370\n00:18:29.662 --> 00:18:34.307\nI can see now that these pages are long\nbecause they're on a legal size, and\n\n371\n00:18:34.307 --> 00:18:38.860\nyou can see the wide and top margins and\nbottoms and stuff like that.\n\n372\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.010\nBut let's say that that's\nexactly what we needed.\n\n373\n00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:45.050\nWe didn't want it any different, we wanted\nit to be laid out exactly the same here,\n\n374\n00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.930\nand we needed a hard copy to go through\nbecause that's exactly what we needed.\n\n375\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.460\nWell, down here at the bottom,\n\n376\n00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.800\nunderneath where it says\nCustom Margins under Settings here.\n\n377\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.280\nNotice that we have a scale option.\n\n378\n00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.040\nNow it doesn't say scale right away, okay.\n\n379\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.300\nWhat it shows us is one page per sheet.\n\n380\n00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.280\nSo right now, even though it actually\nsees that this is legal size paper,\n\n381\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.710\nlet me show you what\nhappens if I change this.\n\n382\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:10.650\nIf I select legal and\nthen I go to letter size.\n\n383\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.000\nNow notice that things change over here,\nright?\n\n384\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.530\nIt reflowed the document\nto do what it needed to.\n\n385\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.300\nInstead of actually leaving\nit exactly the same.\n\n386\n00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.940\nIn my instructions from my boss said,\n\n387\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.220\nI need it printed out\nexactly as it would appear.\n\n388\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.920\nWell that's not what I want to do,\nI don't want to change the paper size,\n\n389\n00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.170\nlet me close this out make sure I get\na good clean copy of that instead.\n\n390\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.840\nFile open and then, there it is.\n\n391\n00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.800\nLegal size here, okay?\n\n392\n00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.140\nSo if I bring this up and\nI'm told that here's my requirement.\n\n393\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.710\nIs exactly the way that it appears\nas it's actually done there.\n\n394\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:53.450\nI come down here to this one page per\nsheet and I click on that drop-down,\n\n395\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.370\nand then what I can do is\nI can two pages per sheet.\n\n396\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.370\nThat's not exactly saying what we need but\n\n397\n00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.840\nwhat I need right here is where\nit says scale to paper size.\n\n398\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.750\nSo my original paper size is legal size,\nbut\n\n399\n00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.690\nthe paper that I'm gonna\nprint on is letter.\n\n400\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:12.840\nAnd so now when I select that and\nscale it, it does\n\n401\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.730\nreduce the size of everything that we see,\nbut it keeps the formatting, and it\n\n402\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:21.960\nkeeps the page and all the content exactly\nthe same as it was on the legal size.\n\n403\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.630\n>> Yeah, I noticed when you selected that,\nnothing shifted around.\n\n404\n00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.760\nWhat was on page one,\nwas still on page one.\n\n405\n00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.750\nWhat was on page two,\nwas still on page two.\n\n406\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.550\nSo it did some other magic.\n\n407\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.530\nMade the font a little smaller,\nwhatever, or scaled it down so\n\n408\n00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.270\nthat as you said, you're gonna\nget exactly what you would get\n\n409\n00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.410\nif you were printing it on legal paper.\n\n410\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.750\nAnd this is stuff that you may\njust have to be able to do, right?\n\n411\n00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.990\nSo, notice that there's tons of different\nprinting options that are available\n\n412\n00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.760\nto us inside of Word and it just makes it\n\n413\n00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.560\neasy if we actually will take a little\nbit of time to explore those options.\n\n414\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.310\nPrinting will become a lot easier for\nus and\n\n415\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.488\nwe'll see some dynamicism that it offers.\n\n416\n00:20:58.488 --> 00:21:02.150\n>> Fantastic, all right, well I feel like\nnow Ronnie I can do whatever I need to do\n\n417\n00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.930\nas far as printing goes.\n\n418\n00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.775\nThe next thing I really want to ask\nyou about is saving my doocument,\n\n419\n00:21:07.775 --> 00:21:11.195\nbecause I do a lot of work, a lot of\nediting to these things, and obviously,\n\n420\n00:21:11.195 --> 00:21:12.305\nI don't want to have to do it again.\n\n421\n00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:14.705\nSo I've gotta make sure I'm saving it and\nsometimes,\n\n422\n00:21:14.705 --> 00:21:17.955\nI need to save it where other people\ncan get to it like, saving it on my\n\n423\n00:21:17.955 --> 00:21:21.235\nlocal hard drive is great if I'm\ntaking it home with me on my laptop.\n\n424\n00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:23.295\nBut what if other people\nneed to get to it?\n\n425\n00:21:23.295 --> 00:21:24.165\nWhat do I do there?\n\n426\n00:21:24.165 --> 00:21:27.515\n>> Right, so when we actually talk\nabout saving the document, right?\n\n427\n00:21:27.515 --> 00:21:29.365\nWe're saving whatever\nchanges we may have made,\n\n428\n00:21:29.365 --> 00:21:31.350\nwhatever modifications\nthat we may have done.\n\n429\n00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.330\nAnd we're saving electronically and\n\n430\n00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.230\nnormally, of course, if we used\na built-in tool like right here in word.\n\n431\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.230\nIf I go up to my quick access toolbar\nin the upper left-hand corner,\n\n432\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.880\nI can just click there,\nI don't have a clue where it's saved.\n\n433\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.990\nReally don't, I'm lying to you,\nbut I know where it's saved.\n\n434\n00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.730\nBut let's just say this, it doesn't\nindicate to me exactly where it was saved.\n\n435\n00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.470\nSo, if I wanted to save it, right,\nI could also go to File, and\n\n436\n00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.030\nI have both of these options\nthat are available to me.\n\n437\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.750\nSave, if I've already given it a name,\nis just gonna go ahead and\n\n438\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.760\noverwrite whatever the original\nfile was and save those changes.\n\n439\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.530\nSave As, if I haven't given it a name, or\nif I want to rename that document as well.\n\n440\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.890\nWhen I select the idea here of Save As,\n\n441\n00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.470\nnotice it gives me options\nof where I can save it to.\n\n442\n00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.990\nNow, I can add a place,\nI can browse here, I can select this PC.\n\n443\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.770\nIf I wanted to put it into\na network location and\n\n444\n00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:28.670\nI was on a network, I could click Browse,\nand I can use my navigation pane over on\n\n445\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:33.330\nthe left-hand side to select my\nnetwork share if I have one available.\n\n446\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.627\nAnd mine's actually not turned off and\nI do have one,\n\n447\n00:22:36.627 --> 00:22:40.700\nmine's actually inside of the,\n[INAUDIBLE] to this PC.\n\n448\n00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.250\nAnd then I actually have it mapped as a\nnetwork drive, there it is shared folder.\n\n449\n00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.890\nI can save it directly in here.\n\n450\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.830\nSo I can use those\nnavigation to help us out\n\n451\n00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.920\nif we are connected to a network\nlocation where we need to save it.\n\n452\n00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.270\nMore beneficial than that though,\nis if I have the ability,\n\n453\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.940\nis to save it to this OneDrive.\n\n454\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.310\nOneDrive is, again, stored on the cloud\nand this means regardless of where I go,\n\n455\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.800\nas long as I have access to Word 2016,\nactually I don't even need that.\n\n456\n00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:12.180\nI can just use a web browser,\nget access to my Office 365 account,\n\n457\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.220\nI can still gain access to my file\ndirectly from right there as well.\n\n458\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.760\nSo I simply would sign in here and\n\n459\n00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.440\nthen I would paste in my username and\nmy password.\n\n460\n00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.640\nAnd then once I do that I\ncan save in that location.\n\n461\n00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.120\nI can go anywhere on this planet\nthat has internet access and\n\n462\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.050\naccess to a browser and also be able\nto access that document right there.\n\n463\n00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.170\nNot only that, though from there,\nif I wanted to,\n\n464\n00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.370\nI could even share it out with Mike.\n\n465\n00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.370\nAnd Mike could get access to it even\nthough it's actually on the cloud as well.\n\n466\n00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:44.500\nSo, it is amazing on some of\nthe different ways that you can do this.\n\n467\n00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.240\nNow, the Save As though,\nis not only for that, right?\n\n468\n00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.828\nWe can also use this to change the\ndifferent document types that we can save\n\n469\n00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:54.754\nit in, in different formats.\n\n470\n00:23:54.754 --> 00:23:59.899\nSo a lot of times we may choose to save\nit, let's say as the 97 to 2003 document,\n\n471\n00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:03.629\nfor backward compatibility,\nfor earlier versions of Word.\n\n472\n00:24:03.629 --> 00:24:04.796\nNow when we do something like that.\n\n473\n00:24:04.796 --> 00:24:08.530\nIf we've created things like macros,\nwhich we've done in a previous episode.\n\n474\n00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.370\nWe may find out like the newer 2016 Macro.\n\n475\n00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.610\nIt doesn't work as well with the 2003,\nor Office 97.\n\n476\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:20.050\nSo you may lose some things that you\nmight have had very feature rich in 2016.\n\n477\n00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:25.410\nBut it is very possible that we can do\nsomething like this to help us out.\n\n478\n00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.930\nAnd now I click Save, and\nnow I'm back in compatibility mode.\n\n479\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.860\nAnd it shows me that, here it is.\n\n480\n00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.820\nI'm in that document mode where we\ncan save it in different ways too.\n\n481\n00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:39.700\nSo, it is has the ability to, of course,\ngive you that idea of being able to\n\n482\n00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.884\nsave it as PDF all the way\nup to earlier versions.\n\n483\n00:24:42.884 --> 00:24:45.944\nAnd even to other document formats,\nmakes it really handy.\n\n484\n00:24:45.944 --> 00:24:51.935\nEspecially when people don't have\nthe same Word that you have.\n\n485\n00:24:51.935 --> 00:24:54.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now Ronnie, great, I can save it now.\n\n486\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.973\nI can share it out with other people.\n\n487\n00:24:56.973 --> 00:24:59.813\nOne of the problems I have with making\nit available to other people, though.\n\n488\n00:24:59.813 --> 00:25:02.017\nIs sometimes they end up opening it up.\n\n489\n00:25:02.017 --> 00:25:05.151\nAnd maybe they haven't had the same\ntraining with Word that I've had.\n\n490\n00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:09.058\nAnd they accidentally select a pair that\nI've been dragging around, or delete\n\n491\n00:25:09.058 --> 00:25:12.870\nsomething, or maybe even intentionally\ntry to do something to my document.\n\n492\n00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.730\nIs there a way I can share it out?\n\n493\n00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.200\nMake it available to other people and\nmake it safe?\n\n494\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.490\n>> There is a basic protection mechanism\nTtat Word actually has built-in.\n\n495\n00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.440\nAnd it's been there forever and a day.\n\n496\n00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.070\nBut you may not exactly have\nseen where it's located.\n\n497\n00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:31.580\nAnd they've tried to make\nthis actually more prominent.\n\n498\n00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.720\nI was trying to think of the proper word.\n\n499\n00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.330\nMore prominent so\nthat we actually know it can be used.\n\n500\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.280\nYou can password protect\na document as well.\n\n501\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.879\nBy password protecting a document.\n\n502\n00:25:42.879 --> 00:25:46.721\nWhat this actually allows me to do is\nif I choose to put it in, let's for\n\n503\n00:25:46.721 --> 00:25:48.690\nexample in my OneDrive.\n\n504\n00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:53.514\nAnd I wanna make sure that Mike is the\nonly one that can gain access to it, okay?\n\n505\n00:25:53.514 --> 00:25:55.792\nI can share that out\nfrom my OneDrive to Mike.\n\n506\n00:25:55.792 --> 00:25:59.280\nAnd just send an email that says hey,\nthis document has been shared with Mike.\n\n507\n00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.929\nBut then when he gains access to it,\nMike could also, when he downloads it or\n\n508\n00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:04.883\nworks with it.\n\n509\n00:26:04.883 --> 00:26:09.096\nHe could just leave it up on his desktop,\nor save a copy of it.\n\n510\n00:26:09.096 --> 00:26:10.731\nAnd now anybody that walks by might.\n\n511\n00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:13.580\nOh, let me double-click on that and\nsee what's going on.\n\n512\n00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.770\nWell, instead, we can password-protect it.\n\n513\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.990\nAnd the way that we do\nthat is fairly simple.\n\n514\n00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.070\nNow, you do wanna be careful\nhere when you password-protect.\n\n515\n00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.360\nThe key, of course,\nis remembering the password, right?\n\n516\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.970\nAnd then how do we get our\npassword securely over to Mike is\n\n517\n00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.800\nalso the other key.\n\n518\n00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.030\nAll I have to do on that document that I\nwant to protect is simply go ahead and\n\n519\n00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.450\nclick on File.\n\n520\n00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.363\nAnd when I do, inside of my backstage\narea, make sure I'm in that info group.\n\n521\n00:26:37.363 --> 00:26:38.166\nAnd when I do this,\n\n522\n00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:40.787\nthis is how they actually have\nmade it more prominent, Mike.\n\n523\n00:26:40.787 --> 00:26:43.970\nNotice they have a nice\nbig button right here.\n\n524\n00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.270\nBack in 2003,\nI was like okay let me hunt for\n\n525\n00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.740\nit and I'll find it at some point,\nbut here it is.\n\n526\n00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.730\nProtect the document and\n\n527\n00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.670\ncontrol what types of changes\npeople can make to this document.\n\n528\n00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.610\nAnd it's just as easy,\nI select that right there.\n\n529\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.630\nAnd I do have the ability to\nmark this as being final.\n\n530\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.100\nIf I want Mike to know that,\nhey, I made all the changes.\n\n531\n00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.070\nI want you to look at it, but I'm trying\nto let you know don't change anything.\n\n532\n00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.510\nI can put a mark there.\n\n533\n00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.270\nIt doesn't stop Mike\nfrom changing anything.\n\n534\n00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.090\nBut it at least lets him know I\nbelieve that this is finished.\n\n535\n00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.880\nAnd that he shouldn't actually\nbe messing with it overall.\n\n536\n00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.310\nWe can also, of course, restrict\nthe editing that we want to have in there.\n\n537\n00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.690\nAnd I can even add in\na digital signature as well.\n\n538\n00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.734\nAnd that makes sure that Mike knows\nthat what this is from me and\n\n539\n00:27:27.734 --> 00:27:28.914\nnot from anybody else.\n\n540\n00:27:28.914 --> 00:27:31.072\nSo we do have that ability to do so.\n\n541\n00:27:31.072 --> 00:27:34.921\nBut since Mike just really\nmentioned the idea of protecting.\n\n542\n00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:38.423\nWe're going to go ahead and\nencrypt with a password.\n\n543\n00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:41.279\nAnd now, if I do this.\n\n544\n00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.045\nNow the hard part is.\n\n545\n00:27:42.045 --> 00:27:43.970\nDid I remember my password?\n\n546\n00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.260\nMike knows my typing\nabilities is not a good.\n\n547\n00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.870\nThere's a 50/50 chance at this right now.\n\n548\n00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.640\nBut there it is.\n\n549\n00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.640\nIt says, if you lose this\npassword it cannot be recovered.\n\n550\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.340\nIt's advisable to keep\na list of passwords and\n\n551\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.830\nthe corresponding document\nnames in a safe place.\n\n552\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.105\nWow!\nThat's a great idea.\n\n553\n00:27:58.105 --> 00:28:00.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Accept that now I've already forgotten\n\n554\n00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.200\nmy password.\n\n555\n00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.230\nSo now if I click OK,\nit's asking me to reconfirm it.\n\n556\n00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.820\nThere it is.\nIt says Protect Document.\n\n557\n00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.476\nThe password is required\nto open this document.\n\n558\n00:28:13.476 --> 00:28:16.910\nSo now if I go ahead and\nclose out of this.\n\n559\n00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:21.890\nNot, let me see here.\n\n560\n00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:22.840\nI'm not gonna save that.\n\n561\n00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.850\nLet's see [LAUGH] what happens here.\n\n562\n00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.480\nI don't know if I need to save that or\nnot.\n\n563\n00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.355\nWe'll know here in a moment.\n\n564\n00:28:28.355 --> 00:28:31.032\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me open that up and\n\n565\n00:28:31.032 --> 00:28:32.296\nI select this one.\n\n566\n00:28:34.424 --> 00:28:37.045\nSo I probably needed to save that,\ndidn't I?\n\n567\n00:28:37.045 --> 00:28:39.190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That was my fault.\n\n568\n00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.990\nSo I was like, I chose the wrong one.\n\n569\n00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.300\nLet me do that.\n\n570\n00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.200\nLet me password protect it again.\n\n571\n00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.380\nI was trying to remember\nwhat I was trying to do.\n\n572\n00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.639\nThat's what I need to do, is encrypt it.\n\n573\n00:28:54.641 --> 00:28:55.499\nAnd we'll do it again.\n\n574\n00:28:55.499 --> 00:28:58.566\n>> So now, I'm assuming,\nonce this is in place.\n\n575\n00:28:58.566 --> 00:29:01.770\nIf you don't know the password, you;re not\ngoing to be able to open up that document.\n\n576\n00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.350\n>> That is what is supposed to happen.\n\n577\n00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.667\nSo this is what I need to do, and I should\nhave remembered this, but I didn't.\n\n578\n00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:10.498\nThis document is encrypted with\na password, and protected.\n\n579\n00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:11.704\nAnd so, there we go.\n\n580\n00:29:11.704 --> 00:29:12.239\nAnd it says.\n\n581\n00:29:12.239 --> 00:29:16.180\nDo you want to increase the security of\nthis document by converting to an open\n\n582\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.050\nOffice format?\n\n583\n00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:22.970\nI'm not going to worry about\nconverting it to an OpenOffice format.\n\n584\n00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.620\nAnd that should save it.\n\n585\n00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.000\nVerify and make sure I saved it.\n\n586\n00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.545\nAnd now lets see if I can\nopen that document again.\n\n587\n00:29:29.545 --> 00:29:32.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Art of war and\n\n588\n00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.280\nthis is that 97 to 2003, and there we go.\n\n589\n00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.160\nSo now you can see where it\nsays hey I need a password.\n\n590\n00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.330\nSo Mike accidentally doesnt\nknow what the password is.\n\n591\n00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.410\nIt tells that he can't open it from that\nnetwork location, which would be normal.\n\n592\n00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.040\nUntil Mike actually does\nget the password from me.\n\n593\n00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.180\nThen he's not gonna be able to open it.\n\n594\n00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.290\nSo, by being able to password protect it.\n\n595\n00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.700\nAnd by being able to do all\nthose different options and\n\n596\n00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.610\nfeatures that are available.\n\n597\n00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.520\nPrinting and saving can be easy.\n\n598\n00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.760\nAnd you might be wondering,\nman, that took a long time.\n\n599\n00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.590\nBut there are.\nThere are so\n\n600\n00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.990\nmany options that we may not even\nconsider that really can be helpful.\n\n601\n00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.010\nIt really is something that we needed to\ntake a little bit of time to go over.\n\n602\n00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.140\n>> Absolutely.\nLot of great information there, Ronnie.\n\n603\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.780\nHelping us out, being able to print\nthat document, portions of the document.\n\n604\n00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.697\nBeing able to scale it down if I need to.\n\n605\n00:30:18.697 --> 00:30:20.978\nIf I don't have the right paper size,\n\n606\n00:30:20.978 --> 00:30:25.350\nbut I wanted to see how it would look\neven if it was on the right paper.\n\n607\n00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.927\nSaving it, changing formats, cuz not\neverybody upgrades at the same time.\n\n608\n00:30:29.927 --> 00:30:31.854\nOur office is up to 2016.\n\n609\n00:30:31.854 --> 00:30:35.583\nBut the department downstairs that I\ngotta work with, maybe their not yet.\n\n610\n00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:38.095\nMaybe they're still on 2013 or 2007,\n\n611\n00:30:38.095 --> 00:30:42.520\nor an external partner that I gotta\nwork with, they haven't upgraded yet.\n\n612\n00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.613\nAnd then, when you bring in sharing and\n\n613\n00:30:44.613 --> 00:30:47.283\nmaking this document\navailable to other people.\n\n614\n00:30:47.283 --> 00:30:51.133\nI do have to worry about people making\nunauthorized changes to the document, or\n\n615\n00:30:51.133 --> 00:30:52.746\nmaybe even controlling access.\n\n616\n00:30:52.746 --> 00:30:56.420\nIf it's sensitive information I don't\nwant to open up the document at all.\n\n617\n00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.920\nSo being able to put that\npassword on there and\n\n618\n00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.620\nseeing that it's built into Word.\n\n619\n00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.920\nIt might not be the most robust\nsolution to protect those documents.\n\n620\n00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.060\nBut it's definitely a starting point and\nit's how easy is it.\n\n621\n00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.620\nYou go to your back stage and\nyou click protect document, and\n\n622\n00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.920\nyou type in a password.\n\n623\n00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.880\nI mean, I can even do that.\n\n624\n00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.460\nSo great stuff Ronnie.\n\n625\n00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.530\nI appreciate all those fantastic examples.\n\n626\n00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.780\nI am ready to move on to the next step.\n\n627\n00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:23.260\nBut for that we're gonna have to come\nback, because this episode is out of time.\n\n628\n00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.970\nSigning off for IT PRO TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick\n\n629\n00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:26.780\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n630\n00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.150\n>>

00:00:16.343\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:21.470\nin today's episode we're gonna be\nmoving through Microsoft Word 2016, and\n\n5\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.391\nwe're gonna be looking at specifically\ntoday, order and group paragraphs.\n\n6\n00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.583\nAnd who better to help us out with this\ntopic but none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:31.620\nHow do you doing Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.850\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.790\nWhen we start to take a look\nat working with Word,\n\n10\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.970\nwe've already been through multiple\nepisodes where it's got us familiar\n\n11\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.880\nwith the way that we can\nactually interact with Word.\n\n12\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.730\nAnd of course, even format our\ndocuments to make them look good.\n\n13\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.140\nBut remember that that's not the end.\n\n14\n00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.755\nA lot of times, when we start talking\nabout working with Word 2016,\n\n15\n00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:55.386\nit really goes beyond just\nthe idea of typing in a letter or\n\n16\n00:00:55.386 --> 00:00:58.130\njust typing in stuff for word processing.\n\n17\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.034\nA lot of it comes back to when you're\nactually reviewing the information and\n\n18\n00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:06.068\nthen you're beginning to see other things\nthat have happened inside of Word.\n\n19\n00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:09.203\nAnd that is because of the way that\nWord actually flows the text and\n\n20\n00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:10.461\ndocuments a lot of times.\n\n21\n00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.814\nAnd when we start talking about that,\n\n22\n00:01:12.814 --> 00:01:15.910\nit's really where the pages\nend up printing out.\n\n23\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.574\nAnd so let's go ahead and take for\n\n24\n00:01:17.574 --> 00:01:22.020\nan example the document that we've been\nusing throughout this entire series.\n\n25\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.310\nWe've got it ready.\n\n26\n00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.070\nWe believe that it's almost\nin its final format.\n\n27\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.860\nBut when we printed it out we saw some\nthings that are a little bit more unusual.\n\n28\n00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.430\nAnd these are things that\nwe can actually correct.\n\n29\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.450\nUsing some of the tools that\nare actually available to us in Word.\n\n30\n00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.960\nSo let me show you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n31\n00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.797\nSo here it is on my computer screen,\nand let me go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:42.584\nzoom that in just a little bit more.\n\n33\n00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:46.255\nWe've been using this document\npretty much through the series here.\n\n34\n00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:49.330\nAnd we're actually taking a look at\nare things that are normal, right?\n\n35\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.310\nEverything looks good, and when I printed\nit out, I thought everything looked good.\n\n36\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.300\nBut then somebody handed it back to me and\n\n37\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.290\nthey showed me some mistakes\nthat have actually gone on here.\n\n38\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.010\nAnd it's not mistakes due to things that\nyou and I have actually had mistaken,\n\n39\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.270\nin other words, it's things that actually\nappeared in the manuscript itself.\n\n40\n00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.840\nBut these are things that may\nhave been caused by Word and\n\n41\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.540\nalso by the format that\nWord is actually in.\n\n42\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.540\nSo, right now as you're\ntaking a look here.\n\n43\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.570\nAnd I'm gonna try to use a tool\nthat Wes showed me back here.\n\n44\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.811\nWe'll just zoom it here.\n\n45\n00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:29.030\nAnd I'm actually gonna highlight\nthis here for a moment as well.\n\n46\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.653\nNow, Wes, when you take a look at this,\nand I'm not trying to pick on you for\n\n47\n00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:34.315\ngrammar.\n\n48\n00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:35.606\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in 1500,\n\n49\n00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:39.790\nhe was sent to France to obtain terms for\nLouis XII for continuing the.\n\n50\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.600\nOkay?\n\n51\n00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.992\nThat looks a little bit strange.\n\n52\n00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:45.169\n>> Now, one of the things,\npicking on my grammar,\n\n53\n00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:50.129\nthat I can say is in putting text in Word,\none thing I've noticed, Ronnie,\n\n54\n00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.640\nis anytime I print in Word\nit's all garbled, right?\n\n55\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.536\nIt doesn't print the [INAUDIBLE] now.\n\n56\n00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:58.593\nI think it looks good on the paper or\nin the document itself, but\n\n57\n00:02:58.593 --> 00:03:01.780\nwhen I print it out, the output\ndoesn't really look like I want.\n\n58\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.420\nSo we're gonna help me out with that?\n\n59\n00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.760\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what\nwe're having here, right?\n\n60\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.364\nThe very fact is that this output,\nif we were to print it out right now,\n\n61\n00:03:08.364 --> 00:03:09.170\nwe would leave that.\n\n62\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.565\nAnd the good thing is,\neven though we have page numbers,\n\n63\n00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:17.021\nit still looks a little bit silly,\nthe very fact that I have the beginning,\n\n64\n00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.589\nthe very first line in the paragraph\noff at the end of a page.\n\n65\n00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.896\nI couldn't remember what\nI was gonna say there.\n\n66\n00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:26.030\nAt the end of a page [LAUGH]\nthat I would print out.\n\n67\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.840\nAnd then the rest of that paragraph\nis actually beginning down here.\n\n68\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.000\nNow technically that is what\nwe call a widowed line.\n\n69\n00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.510\nAnd it makes sense here.\n\n70\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.300\nThe very fact that that line is left by\nitself and the rest of its paragraph or\n\n71\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.460\nlines that go along with that\nparagraph are now on that second page.\n\n72\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.950\nNow you may also continue out, like what\nwe did as we started to see this printout,\n\n73\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.270\nthat we started noticing\nthat happen multiple times.\n\n74\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.790\nNow we didn't do that on purpose.\n\n75\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.750\nI didn't do it on purpose.\n\n76\n00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.315\nThe reason why that happened is because,\nwell, Word,\n\n77\n00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.838\nevery page is formatted\nthe way that it's formatted.\n\n78\n00:04:03.838 --> 00:04:06.690\nAnd it says, look I can only fit so\nmuch text on here.\n\n79\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.959\nAnd according to the way that this is\nbroken up, this is what's going to happen.\n\n80\n00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.230\nAnd that ends up happening\na lot of times too.\n\n81\n00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.170\nNow the other one that you'll see\nis actually exactly like this.\n\n82\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.540\nBut just a little bit different than\nthe very fact that we can leave\n\n83\n00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.210\na line at these and\nof a paragraph on a page.\n\n84\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.750\nAnd let me show you that one too.\n\n85\n00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.900\nNow the good thing is,\nI went ahead and bookmarked these so\n\n86\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.870\nthat I could find them easily.\n\n87\n00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.035\nSo on Insert, and\nI go here to the Links Group.\n\n88\n00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:36.840\nI'm gonna select Bookmark, and I'm gonna\nselect this orphaned line and then Go To.\n\n89\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.010\nAnd I found one as well,\nright before the show, as we did this, and\n\n90\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.400\nthis is what you'll also\nend up seeing as well.\n\n91\n00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.430\nSo, here we are.\nWe're at the top of this page.\n\n92\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.725\nAnd when we see this,\nthere it is, that of princes.\n\n93\n00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:51.920\nIt needs to be of the people.\n\n94\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.540\nIt really doesn't make sense by itself.\n\n95\n00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.800\nWe understand that what we would\nnormally do, of course, is come up here.\n\n96\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.020\nBut now take a look at how\nstrange that actually looks.\n\n97\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.670\nIf this were actually printed out for\n\n98\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.045\nlet's say a book format, what you'd\nhave of course then is that this page\n\n99\n00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:10.490\n9 right here would be on one side, let's\nsay on the left-hand side of the page.\n\n100\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.910\nAnd then at the beginning of page 10,\n\n101\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.590\nyou would have, well,\nthe end of really page 9.\n\n102\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.430\nAnd that is what we call an orphaned line.\n\n103\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.914\nSo you see over here where\nthe beginning of the line by itself and\n\n104\n00:05:23.914 --> 00:05:26.197\nthen the rest of that grouping or\n\n105\n00:05:26.197 --> 00:05:30.863\nthe rest of that paragraph is\nactually all above on another page.\n\n106\n00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:33.684\nSo it's really about what\nwe call line projection,\n\n107\n00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:36.070\nis what we're really dealing with.\n\n108\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.760\nWe need to be able to keep lines together,\nespecially when things like this happen.\n\n109\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.160\nOr we need to make sure that it actually\nat least feels like it's identified as\n\n110\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.250\npart of that.\n\n111\n00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.140\nAnd the way that we do that,\n\n112\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.260\nis by preventing widowed lines and\norphaned lines from happening.\n\n113\n00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.505\n>> Sure, so one of the thing I'm\nthinking about is let's say that you got\n\n114\n00:05:54.505 --> 00:05:55.392\na school, right?\n\n115\n00:05:55.392 --> 00:05:58.980\nAnd you're gonna have a few\nkids reading this back.\n\n116\n00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.030\nYou hand them that page, and\nthey see that first line.\n\n117\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.300\nAnd they're like,\nwhere's the rest of this paragraph?\n\n118\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.430\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n119\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.280\nSo, it breaks up the context\nof the document itself.\n\n120\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.140\n>> That's exactly what ends up happening.\n\n121\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.401\nSo, that's what we wanna show you,\nis that Word can help us out here.\n\n122\n00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:14.660\nNow remember that this is\na relatively long document.\n\n123\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.883\nAt this point it's about 42 pages long.\n\n124\n00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:21.450\nAnd so, I could go on through and\nI could manually try to do this.\n\n125\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.390\nAnd it's fairly easy.\n\n126\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.410\nI could go up here to page 9 and\nthen put my cursor at the beginning here.\n\n127\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.720\nAnd just hit Enter.\nAnd that would make it seem like a part.\n\n128\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.600\nSo I'd have two lines at the beginning.\n\n129\n00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.840\nI know that I might be able\nto adjust the margins.\n\n130\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.980\nBut when I do that, I don't know what\nelse is actually going to break.\n\n131\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.460\nFix or break, either one.\n\n132\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.838\nIt's gonna end up re-massaging\nthe document where it may cause even more\n\n133\n00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:45.790\nissues.\n\n134\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.128\nBut there are some protections\nthat we can put in place.\n\n135\n00:06:48.128 --> 00:06:50.620\nAnd what we're actually looking for\nis exactly that.\n\n136\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.290\nSo let me show you where those happen.\n\n137\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.380\nSo I'm gonna leave it right here so\nthat we can see this and\n\n138\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.320\nwhat it does to fix something like this.\n\n139\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.780\nSo I'm gonna click on File,\nactually not File.\n\n140\n00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.705\nHome, I always get that confused.\n\n141\n00:07:01.705 --> 00:07:02.330\nNow, you might be saying, why?\n\n142\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.790\nIt's just because they're\nright next to each other.\n\n143\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.357\nBut it's on the Home grouping,\non the Home tab.\n\n144\n00:07:07.357 --> 00:07:11.353\nAnd then under the Home tab, I'm gonna\nlook for the Paragraph grouping over\n\n145\n00:07:11.353 --> 00:07:15.000\nhere and I'm going to select\nthis dialogue box launcher.\n\n146\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.522\nSo do remember, oh,\nI hit the wrong one here.\n\n147\n00:07:16.522 --> 00:07:17.782\nDo remember that.\n\n148\n00:07:17.782 --> 00:07:21.543\nAnd there it is, that paragraph\ngrouping that we're looking at.\n\n149\n00:07:21.543 --> 00:07:25.280\nSo I'm gonna select the dialogue\nbox launcher from here.\n\n150\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.752\nAnd then inside of that dialogue box,\nwhat we're looking for\n\n151\n00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:34.790\nis gonna be on the second tab where\nit says Line and Page Breaks.\n\n152\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.790\nIf I select that,\nI'm looking for the information\n\n153\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.890\nright up here toward the top of this\nthing, where it says pagination.\n\n154\n00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.050\nAnd now you see where it says Widow and\nOrphan Control.\n\n155\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.930\nKeep with next.\n\n156\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.390\nKeep lines together.\n\n157\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.038\nBreak page before.\n\n158\n00:07:50.038 --> 00:07:54.311\nNow, when we talk about widow and\norphan control, what I'm telling Word is,\n\n159\n00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:58.222\nuse your power inside of Word when\nyou see something like this, right?\n\n160\n00:07:58.222 --> 00:08:00.588\n>> At the top of the page or\nat the end of the page.\n\n161\n00:08:00.588 --> 00:08:05.118\nAt the end of the page when we have that\none line that is actually left as a single\n\n162\n00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:06.527\nline, that is a widow.\n\n163\n00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:09.773\nWe're telling Word to go through and\nmake sure that that doesn't happen.\n\n164\n00:08:09.773 --> 00:08:12.642\nWhen we actually see a single\nline at the top of the page,\n\n165\n00:08:12.642 --> 00:08:16.003\nthat's considered the orphaned line and\nwe're telling, hey,\n\n166\n00:08:16.003 --> 00:08:18.831\nuse your powers,\nyour magical powers inside of Word.\n\n167\n00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.010\nThat's actually just some\nalgorithm that they use.\n\n168\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.296\nDon't get me wrong,\nit knows how to identify that.\n\n169\n00:08:23.296 --> 00:08:25.586\nAnd we're saying,\ndon't allow that to happen as well.\n\n170\n00:08:25.586 --> 00:08:27.119\nSo that's very possible.\n\n171\n00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:30.647\nYou can also select, keep with next.\n\n172\n00:08:30.647 --> 00:08:32.967\nNow you might wonder what\nthe heck is that about.\n\n173\n00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:37.622\nWell, you might have a single line that\njust breaks naturally the way that it does\n\n174\n00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:40.976\nand what you're telling is I\ndon't care how it breaks up,\n\n175\n00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:45.167\nbut I wanna always make sure that it\nappears with whatever follows next.\n\n176\n00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:46.387\nSo that way, it doesn't matter.\n\n177\n00:08:46.387 --> 00:08:49.257\nYou actually just giving it super\nstrong directives here that\n\n178\n00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:52.023\nyou wanna ensure that that\nactually stays with something.\n\n179\n00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:55.201\nAnd you might do this,\nlet's say, for an example,\n\n180\n00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:59.679\nif you had some type of image that you\nwanted to keep that line attached to,\n\n181\n00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:02.514\njust to make sure it\nappears on that same page.\n\n182\n00:09:02.514 --> 00:09:05.606\nSo that way, it always happens,\nespecially if it follows that line.\n\n183\n00:09:05.606 --> 00:09:08.101\nYou can always keep lines together, so\n\n184\n00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:11.513\na quote is actually a perfectly\ngood example of that.\n\n185\n00:09:11.513 --> 00:09:14.525\nYou wanna make sure that\nif do some type of quote,\n\n186\n00:09:14.525 --> 00:09:18.571\nI don't like some of the motivational\nquotes that are out there.\n\n187\n00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:24.550\nBut if it breaks apart a page, you kind of\ndon't get the impact and the sense of it.\n\n188\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.849\nSo instead you may say look, I wanna make\nsure that we keep l ine together that\n\n189\n00:09:28.849 --> 00:09:31.010\nalways appeared together to do that.\n\n190\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.047\nAnd then of course,\n\n191\n00:09:32.047 --> 00:09:35.707\nyou can insert in a page break before\nsomething like this could happen.\n\n192\n00:09:35.707 --> 00:09:39.352\nSo you can actually mark all\nof those if you choose to and\n\n193\n00:09:39.352 --> 00:09:43.166\nit gives you that square box\nto actually let you see that.\n\n194\n00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:46.753\nSo if you actually just have radio button\ninstead, you might pick only one or\n\n195\n00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.671\nthe other, but you can mark all of them.\n\n196\n00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:52.872\nNow I don't necessarily need to mark all\nof them, so I'm not gonna do that, because\n\n197\n00:09:52.872 --> 00:09:56.737\nI don't know what the combination of all\nof that would actually end up doing.\n\n198\n00:09:56.737 --> 00:10:00.770\nWhat I'm telling it to do right is\nactually affect the text itself,\n\n199\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.751\nthe least amount it can affect and\n\n200\n00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:07.440\nthat's really what you wanna do when it\ncomes back to editing and formatting.\n\n201\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.950\nRemember, the more step that you\nallow Word to do automatically,\n\n202\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.846\nthe more it also takes liberties to\nreadjust other things that you may go.\n\n203\n00:10:14.846 --> 00:10:17.264\nNo, I really like the rest\nof the document, but\n\n204\n00:10:17.264 --> 00:10:19.634\nhere's something I really\ndo need to effect.\n\n205\n00:10:19.634 --> 00:10:21.505\nNow when you effect this, remember,\n\n206\n00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:23.854\nit could actually end up\nadding in extra pages.\n\n207\n00:10:23.854 --> 00:10:28.246\nProbably it's not gonna take away\ntoo many pages, but overall though,\n\n208\n00:10:28.246 --> 00:10:33.151\nit could affect the overall page layout as\nfar as the number of pages that you get.\n\n209\n00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:36.933\nSo that is a very rare possibility and you\nmight think, well, why does that matter?\n\n210\n00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:40.399\nWhat matter is that if you actually set a\nlimit on the number of pages that you have\n\n211\n00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.026\nand then you might have to go back in.\n\n212\n00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:46.327\nNow, I'm actually readjust other things\nto make it fit within that limit.\n\n213\n00:10:46.327 --> 00:10:48.423\nNow, I've actually had\nto deal with that and\n\n214\n00:10:48.423 --> 00:10:50.474\nworking with the editing of a publication.\n\n215\n00:10:50.474 --> 00:10:53.406\nWhereas like it's only\nsupposed to be 49 pages,\n\n216\n00:10:53.406 --> 00:10:57.504\nbecause we need that natural page\nbreak somewhere else that she occur.\n\n217\n00:10:57.504 --> 00:11:00.654\nAnd so all of a sudden,\nI did something like the widow and\n\n218\n00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:04.418\norphan protection here and\nthen that's coming out to 51 pages.\n\n219\n00:11:04.418 --> 00:11:06.801\nWell, that was something\nI couldn't afford to do,\n\n220\n00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:08.805\nso that she kinda take\nthat thing back off and\n\n221\n00:11:08.805 --> 00:11:12.070\nthen readjust some of the other things\nto make it appear in the same way.\n\n222\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.533\nNow those are all problems,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n223\n00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:17.896\nSo this is not a fix or\nit's not a care of for everything, but\n\n224\n00:11:17.896 --> 00:11:19.724\nit at least help fix this issue.\n\n225\n00:11:19.724 --> 00:11:23.969\nSo, I'm just gonna select that widow and\norphan control then and\n\n226\n00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:25.755\nthen go ahead and click OK.\n\n227\n00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:28.640\nAnd when I do so,\nnotice what ended up happening.\n\n228\n00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.571\nIt ended up adding in an extra\nspace of line up here, but\n\n229\n00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:35.654\nthen just added that extra line down here.\n\n230\n00:11:35.654 --> 00:11:39.657\nAnd that's really important, because now\nit actually looks like that single line is\n\n231\n00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:43.280\nactually a part of a paragraph that\nis not just left off somewhere.\n\n232\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.226\nNow if I go back and\nlet me go back to the widowed line here.\n\n233\n00:11:49.226 --> 00:11:51.410\nMake it easier for me to do so.\n\n234\n00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.044\nI do love these tools\nthat are actually here.\n\n235\n00:11:54.044 --> 00:11:56.273\nSo notice that on this one here.\n\n236\n00:11:56.273 --> 00:11:58.571\nOh, I know what happened here.\n\n237\n00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:01.696\nThis one actually got\na unusual thing right here.\n\n238\n00:12:01.696 --> 00:12:05.450\nThere it goes.\nThat's actually why it did that normally.\n\n239\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.960\nFor one reason or another,\nthis also ended up happening where I\n\n240\n00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.130\naccidentally had hit let's say, an Enter\nat some point and I didn't realize it.\n\n241\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.994\nAnd so this was not originally\nan orphaned line or a widowed line here.\n\n242\n00:12:18.994 --> 00:12:22.592\nThat was actually just me accidentally\nhitting Enter as I was going through\n\n243\n00:12:22.592 --> 00:12:23.344\nthe document.\n\n244\n00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:26.104\nSo you might see why it\nmight have affected it, but\n\n245\n00:12:26.104 --> 00:12:28.881\nif it didn't affect it and\njust left it like this.\n\n246\n00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:33.431\nIt's saying, no, I see it as actually\nreally not orphan that way and\n\n247\n00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:38.466\nyou just have to do this and now you're\nactually done and you are ready to go.\n\n248\n00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.513\nSo you can see where this\nidea of really preventing or\n\n249\n00:12:41.513 --> 00:12:45.807\nusing the paragraph tools that are there\nto help prevent these widowed and\n\n250\n00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:49.548\norphan lines can really help\nthe appearance of your document and\n\n251\n00:12:49.548 --> 00:12:53.320\nthe reading flow of your\ndocument much better, as well.\n\n252\n00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.605\nSo that's at least one of the tools that\nwill help you as you go through doing some\n\n253\n00:12:56.605 --> 00:12:57.941\nrevision and some editing too.\n\n254\n00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:01.092\n>> Now Ronnie, one of the things that\nyou had mentioned is don't make too many\n\n255\n00:13:01.092 --> 00:13:04.798\nmodifications, because Word does have some\ndefaults and you're showing us how to move\n\n256\n00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:07.421\naway from some of the defaults\nto get the format that you want.\n\n257\n00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:10.634\nBut If you put in a couple of those\noptions you're gonna have to go\n\n258\n00:13:10.634 --> 00:13:14.267\nthrough and probably proof check that\ndocument again to see if it didn't\n\n259\n00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:18.214\nmodify other things just by doing a little\nbit of formatting in certain areas.\n\n260\n00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.967\n>> There is always gonna be that key\nissue, that just because you turned it on,\n\n261\n00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:24.501\nit doesn't mean it didn't\naffect anything else.\n\n262\n00:13:24.501 --> 00:13:28.903\nSo you do wanna make sure that you go back\nand you see exactly what has happened or\n\n263\n00:13:28.903 --> 00:13:32.238\nwhat has changed in your document\nwhen you need it as well and\n\n264\n00:13:32.238 --> 00:13:33.989\nthat's actually kind of key.\n\n265\n00:13:33.989 --> 00:13:36.730\nI was trying to get back to that document,\nso that we could see here.\n\n266\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.492\nThe good things is I'm checking over\nhere on the lower right-hand corner of\n\n267\n00:13:40.492 --> 00:13:44.161\nthe screen and I see that I didn't affect\nit as far as the page number goes.\n\n268\n00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:48.470\nSo, I'm pretty much happy with at\nleast what is done for me so far.\n\n269\n00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.140\nNow we still need to actually take a look\nat several other things that we actually\n\n270\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.126\nneed help with.\n\n271\n00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:58.661\nA lot of times it comes down to other\nformatting that may actually need to\n\n272\n00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:03.270\nhappen and so what we wanna do is wanna\nalso take a look at creating section\n\n273\n00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.331\nbreaks in documents, as well.\n\n274\n00:14:05.331 --> 00:14:07.471\nSo let me show you an example\nof a section break here.\n\n275\n00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:11.216\nI'm gonna get out of this document and\nlet me close that out and\n\n276\n00:14:11.216 --> 00:14:15.406\nI'm not gonna worry about,\nlet me save those changes for right now.\n\n277\n00:14:15.406 --> 00:14:22.855\nAnd then I'm gonna do a File > Open and\nI'm gonna bring out this pirate code here.\n\n278\n00:14:22.855 --> 00:14:25.396\nSo Bartholomew Roberts's Pirate Code,\n\n279\n00:14:25.396 --> 00:14:30.259\nwe have already done an episode where we\nformatted this particular document and\n\n280\n00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:34.994\nI mentioned it, but I didn't actually\ntell you why I did it the way that I did.\n\n281\n00:14:34.994 --> 00:14:38.488\nSo we talked about making sure that\nwe can actually take a document and\n\n282\n00:14:38.488 --> 00:14:41.680\nformat it the way that we want to,\nbut look at all of the elements\n\n283\n00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.467\nthat are actually appearing\nhere in this formatting.\n\n284\n00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:49.711\nWe have a border around the outside edge,\nwe have the title right in here.\n\n285\n00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:52.647\nAnd now,\nwe have Bartholomew Roberts Pirate Code.\n\n286\n00:14:52.647 --> 00:14:55.671\nAll 11 statements in his pirate code.\n\n287\n00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:59.712\nActually, formatted in there and\nactually appearing as one page and\n\n288\n00:14:59.712 --> 00:15:03.694\neven a little icon down here for\na little pirate symbol that we have.\n\n289\n00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:06.264\nEverything looks good\nthe way that we want to.\n\n290\n00:15:06.264 --> 00:15:10.652\nThis is a relatively, I should say,\nmodestly complicated document in the very\n\n291\n00:15:10.652 --> 00:15:13.993\nsense that there's actually\na lot of formatting going on and\n\n292\n00:15:13.993 --> 00:15:17.877\nthe formatting actually needed to\nonly affect a part of the document.\n\n293\n00:15:17.877 --> 00:15:20.411\nNow you may wonder like,\nwhat am I talking about?\n\n294\n00:15:20.411 --> 00:15:22.630\nWell, it's right here at the very top.\n\n295\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.215\nI have Bartholomew Roberts Pirate Code\nall one one sheet of paper,\n\n296\n00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:30.270\nbut notice how it's not appearing\nas one of these two columns.\n\n297\n00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.966\nSo the way that we do that is we actually\ncreate different sections that we can\n\n298\n00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:37.319\nformat and modify and the formatting\nwill only affect those sections\n\n299\n00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:39.364\nis what we're actually taking a look at.\n\n300\n00:15:39.364 --> 00:15:43.148\nSo the way that we do that is by creating\nsections is what we wanna do and\n\n301\n00:15:43.148 --> 00:15:45.513\nthat way I can actually\naffect it this way.\n\n302\n00:15:45.513 --> 00:15:49.257\nSo let me show you how I\ndid that briefly here.\n\n303\n00:15:49.257 --> 00:15:51.857\nSo I'm gonna take this document instead.\n\n304\n00:15:53.749 --> 00:16:00.878\nAt least all of it that I can and I'm\nsimply going to remove All the formatting.\n\n305\n00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:05.000\nSo we can clear out\nthe formatting of everything.\n\n306\n00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.070\nI can go up here to Font and\n\n307\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.120\nI can clear out all the formatting of all\nthat text that's actually inside of here.\n\n308\n00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.166\nAnd now take a look, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:11.770\nSo there it is.\n\n310\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.953\nSo I'm leaving the border because I don't\nwant to actually reformat everything\n\n311\n00:16:14.953 --> 00:16:16.620\nthat's actually out there.\n\n312\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.030\nSo right now, if I were to go about\ntrying to do this, where I said,\n\n313\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:26.650\nhey I want this to appear in two columns,\nokay.\n\n314\n00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.610\nSo let me just go ahead and\naffect the top here.\n\n315\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:37.320\nAnd I'll pick what I picked before just\na little bit and give it a size like that.\n\n316\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.390\nAnd then, I decide, hey, I'm gonna go\nahead and also we'll put in paragraphs.\n\n317\n00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.765\nSo, if I go to Layout,\nI can select Columns.\n\n318\n00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:49.537\nAnd now I have, oops.\n\n319\n00:16:49.537 --> 00:16:50.558\nWhere does it go?\n\n320\n00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:52.613\nWhere's my paragraph marks here?\n\n321\n00:16:52.613 --> 00:16:54.494\nSo I select all the text.\n\n322\n00:16:56.734 --> 00:16:58.960\nGo to Columns and I select two.\n\n323\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.690\nAnd it's not.\n\n324\n00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.400\nWell it's because of\nthe size of my text here.\n\n325\n00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.060\nLet's see if I can actually\ndo it correctly this time.\n\n326\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.240\nLet me change the font size.\n\n327\n00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.250\nI'll change it, there we go.\n\n328\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:15.090\nSo now you can actually see where it's\nactually going into 2 paragraphs.\n\n329\n00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:20.160\nNotice how Bartholomew Roberts Pirate Code\nappears as it's one of these columns.\n\n330\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.790\nOkay?\n\n331\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.270\nSo, this is something I\nreally don't want to happen.\n\n332\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.620\nI want Bartholomew Roberts Pirate Code\nto be across the top.\n\n333\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.560\nWell, the way that I have to\ndo that is I need to say, hey,\n\n334\n00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.010\nwhere I have these two columns over here,\nI wanna make sure that that\n\n335\n00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:40.680\nonly affects that particular amount of\ntext and not this one up here at the top.\n\n336\n00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.960\nso let me see if I can get that\nall the way back across here.\n\n337\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.950\nAnd that I am only in one column.\n\n338\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.840\nI have to kind of make sure I remember\nwhere things are is what I wanna do.\n\n339\n00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.500\nSo there we go.\nSo\n\n340\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.410\neverything's in one column\nnow is what I want.\n\n341\n00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.220\nSo here it is.\n\n342\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.960\nThe list in the original\nway that it appeared.\n\n343\n00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:04.640\nAnd now, if I want to affect this, I just\nclick where I want my new section to be.\n\n344\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.600\nAnd once I select that new section,\nI can now come up here into the same\n\n345\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.170\nLayout tab, Page Setup and\nI am now looking for where it says Breaks.\n\n346\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.120\nBreaks are how we create sections and\n\n347\n00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.320\nyou can see that there's a couple of\ndifferent ways that this happens here.\n\n348\n00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.100\nNotice that I have Page Breaks\nup here at the top.\n\n349\n00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.100\nSo, it actually allows me to say hey,\nhere's what I want to insert a page,\n\n350\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.690\nhere's how I wanna do columns,\nhere's where I can do text wrapping.\n\n351\n00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.010\nAnd then,\nwe have Section Breaks as well, okay.\n\n352\n00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.950\nThe Section Break is really\nwhat I'm looking for right now.\n\n353\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.100\nSo I wanted to be actually on\nthe same exact page where I want\n\n354\n00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.150\na different formatting to be able\nto occur in only affect that text.\n\n355\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.530\nSo, I've clicked right here in\nfront of the roman numeral one.\n\n356\n00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.180\nAnd I select Break.\n\n357\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.000\nAnd what I want is right here\nwhere it says Continuous and\n\n358\n00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.460\nit says Insert a Break right here.\n\n359\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.880\nAnd now,\nI've actually inserted that break.\n\n360\n00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.720\nNotice that Bartholomew Robert's\nis actually still right here.\n\n361\n00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.230\nOops, see I keep clicking on\nthat I need to click on home.\n\n362\n00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.774\nI'm going to center that.\n\n363\n00:19:07.774 --> 00:19:10.907\nAnd now notice it didn't center\nthe rest of the document, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:10.907 --> 00:19:16.471\nBut if I click down here and\nI select the rest of this text here,\n\n365\n00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:23.009\nI'm gonna change the font size,\ni'm going to change it to this MV Boli.\n\n366\n00:19:23.009 --> 00:19:25.280\n[LAUGH] I can't pronounce it.\n\n367\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.923\nAnd now I'm gonna actually change it to,\nlet's say 14 point font.\n\n368\n00:19:27.923 --> 00:19:30.390\nWell, now notice it's on two pages, right?\n\n369\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.490\nWell, I wanna affect this by\nadding in the extra column now.\n\n370\n00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.770\nIf I select Insert, or actually Layout.\n\n371\n00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.760\nLayout, Column and two.\n\n372\n00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.630\nNow notice that the two columns\nactually just fit right there.\n\n373\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.370\nAffected that.\n\n374\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:55.700\nAnd even within that section, notice that\nI centered it in that column as well.\n\n375\n00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.060\nSo by creating breaks what we can do\nis we can actually do that where we can\n\n376\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:04.370\nmodify and actually every single section\ncan have things like its own header and\n\n377\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.230\nfooter if we wanted to.\n\n378\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.580\nOrientation, do I want a portrait or\nlandscape, spacing,\n\n379\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.080\nformatting, you name it.\n\n380\n00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.290\nI showed you exactly right\nhere how that can be done.\n\n381\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.630\nSo you can take that and\n\n382\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:21.620\nyou can make your particular document\nlook however you want it to.\n\n383\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.000\nAnd that way, you're only affecting\nthat one section if you need to.\n\n384\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.390\nAnd then, when everything's going back,\n\n385\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.390\nif you wanted to make a nice little\ndisplay in the middle of a long document.\n\n386\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.930\nYou can format just that one area and\nhave it not affect the entire document.\n\n387\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.440\nAnd we would actually use section\nbreaks like that to really help us out.\n\n388\n00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.580\nAnd that's something you also wanna\nbe able to at least understand.\n\n389\n00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.620\nThat's why it says oh, I really like to\nactually see it this way or that way but\n\n390\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.560\nI don't want it to actually\naffect to whole document.\n\n391\n00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.440\nYou're gonna be creating sections and\nthat's what we want.\n\n392\n00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.280\n>> Well it's interesting too because you\njust mentioned a few minutes ago that\n\n393\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.530\nif you do modify a certain setting.\n\n394\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.120\nHow you have to go, you got to go forward,\nyou have to check over the document again\n\n395\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.490\nand make sure that it does make\nthe modification that you want and\n\n396\n00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.420\ndoesn't adjust other things.\n\n397\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.090\nCuz it was interesting when you\ndidn't have that font size bumped up.\n\n398\n00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.640\nIt kept it in a single column and\nit really did look much better.\n\n399\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.740\nNow when you talk about\nthings like sections and\n\n400\n00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.240\nseparating those sections out.\n\n401\n00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.135\nWhy not just hit the space bar,\na couple of times and\n\n402\n00:21:18.135 --> 00:21:20.530\nthat's how Wes is doing his documents.\n\n403\n00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.990\nYou don't want to print my documents,\nyou're gonna run out of paper.\n\n404\n00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.940\nBut why not just do something like that\nwhere you hit a couple of space bars,\n\n405\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.500\nyou hit an Enter, return to the next line.\n\n406\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.310\n>> Yeah,\nthat actually does make sense, right.\n\n407\n00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.260\nThe first time that you ever\ncreate documents like that,\n\n408\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.650\nthat's probably how you might think.\n\n409\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.260\nWell, that's how you would create\ntwo different column's here\n\n410\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.840\nis by doing it manually.\n\n411\n00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.310\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nyou can do that manually.\n\n412\n00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.240\nBut remember that when you start inserting\nin other things like what we were\n\n413\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.990\ndoing before, right?\n\n414\n00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:49.240\nLike the pagination stuff about\nthe orphan and widow control and\n\n415\n00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.350\nkeeping lines together and making sure\nthat these things are actually doing that.\n\n416\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.560\nYou never know that that's also going to\naffect the rest of what you're doing.\n\n417\n00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.040\nSo if you actually end\nup doing that right,\n\n418\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.340\nthat's why you wanna use section breaks.\n\n419\n00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.660\nBecause now, you can control\nthe formatting within that one section and\n\n420\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.480\nallow the rest of the document to\nessentially flow around it and\n\n421\n00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.520\ndo whatever else you need to.\n\n422\n00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.170\nAnd that way you're not actually\naffecting the entire document.\n\n423\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.990\nSo, by using the tools that\nare available to you inside of Word,\n\n424\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:22.520\nyou become much more effective, and\nit becomes much more powerful of a tool.\n\n425\n00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.910\nAnd all of a sudden, you're not surprised\nby formatting changes that you make.\n\n426\n00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.710\nAnd you go,\nI only wanted to affect this section.\n\n427\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.550\nAnd now it's actually affected\nthe entire rest of the document for\n\n428\n00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.500\nthings that you didn't realize\nwould end up happening there.\n\n429\n00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.340\nSo it does take a little bit of time and\n\n430\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.930\neffort but once you actually learn how to\ndo it, this is the way that you want to.\n\n431\n00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.340\nThe way that Wes is talking about doing,\ndon't get me wrong, it can be done.\n\n432\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.610\nBut it takes so much more time,\nso much more effort, to do that.\n\n433\n00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.050\nThen you add in an extra character and\n\n434\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.200\nall of a sudden everything\nelse shifts along it.\n\n435\n00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.470\nWell, those are things that\nyou do have to worry about.\n\n436\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.290\nBut by keeping it in this section,\nit doesn't actually shift or\n\n437\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.880\nit doesn't actually do anything, and\n\n438\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.890\nmodify the rest of the document\nas far as your formatting goes.\n\n439\n00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.650\nAnd that's what makes\nthis really powerful.\n\n440\n00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.620\n>> Very cool, very cool.\n\n441\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.705\nAll right.\nSo we've looked at a few things.\n\n442\n00:23:07.705 --> 00:23:10.020\nRonnie, what's next on our list here?\n\n443\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.260\n>> We only have really one other\nthing that we want to talk about.\n\n444\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.490\nWhich is the idea of\ncontrolling page breaks, and\n\n445\n00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.530\nthis is more important in longer documents\nthat you have to actually affect.\n\n446\n00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.180\nSo let me go and\n\n447\n00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.260\nswitch back to the document that\nwe were using previously here.\n\n448\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.070\nSo, I'm close out of this document and\n\n449\n00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.240\nI'm not gonna worry about\nsaving these changes.\n\n450\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.790\nAnd then, I'm gonna do a File > Open and\nthen, I'm gonna go to my recent and\n\n451\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.760\nselect the document that I've been\nworking with most recently here.\n\n452\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.170\nSo, when we start talking about the idea\nof controlling page breaks, right?\n\n453\n00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.620\nWhat we're saying is here's what\nwe want to see on these pages.\n\n454\n00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.390\nNo more than that, no less than that.\n\n455\n00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:52.398\nThis is actually very important because\nit does help you to control that.\n\n456\n00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:55.391\nif you are actually doing things for\na print out,\n\n457\n00:23:55.391 --> 00:23:59.771\nthe idea of actually doing page breaks\nlike this is really helpful to you\n\n458\n00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:05.220\nBecause it really does effect the way that\nthings get printed out and displayed.\n\n459\n00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.690\nSo, there may be times when you end up\nseeing that it's an important subject that\n\n460\n00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:14.190\nyou do have, and you wanna make sure\nthat it all stays on the same page, and\n\n461\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.900\nnot divide it up into two pages.\n\n462\n00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.410\nIt could be where, an element that\nyou added in, such as a chart.\n\n463\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.280\nI couldn't get what was I gonna\ncall it a chart or a table.\n\n464\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.780\nAnd you go and print it out and half of\nthe table is printed out on one sheet.\n\n465\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.360\nAnd the other half is printed\nout on the other sheet.\n\n466\n00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.490\nAnd you don't want something like that.\n\n467\n00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.800\nIf something like that does happen, right?\n\n468\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.930\nIt's frustrating.\n\n469\n00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:40.430\nBut the good thing is you\ncould always things like that\n\n470\n00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.630\nby making sure that they\nappear on different pages.\n\n471\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.100\nSo let me give you an example.\n\n472\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.960\nSo here it is.\n\n473\n00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.780\nHere is the introduction by the guy\nthat translated this particular edition\n\n474\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.040\nof the prints and so he has this but\nhe also has divided it out.\n\n475\n00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.670\nSo if I wanted to, I could actually say,\n\n476\n00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:01.430\nlook I want the very beginning here\nto actually be on a separate page.\n\n477\n00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.860\nWell what I could do is\nprobably the way that Wes,\n\n478\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.370\nI don't know if you do it this way, but\n\n479\n00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.670\nI could just simply go to the end of where\nit says office there where my cursor is.\n\n480\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.610\nAnd just go ahead and hit Enter\nuntil I go down to the next page.\n\n481\n00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.090\nWell look at what's happening.\n\n482\n00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.190\nIs that it's actually gonna do what?\n\n483\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:23.010\nShift the entire document down the way\nthat and that's not what I wanna do.\n\n484\n00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.500\nSo I'm going to get rid of\nthat instead and come back up.\n\n485\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.280\nHopefully I'm not going to delete out\neverything that I don't want to do.\n\n486\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.290\nSo what can I do?\n\n487\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.980\nIf I want all of this stuff here, and\n\n488\n00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:38.260\nthe introduction to only be on one page,\nI can enter in just a flat page break.\n\n489\n00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:44.890\nSo I go back to layout,\nunder the page setup grouping,\n\n490\n00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:49.030\nI can select break, and then right\nhere at the top, where it says page,\n\n491\n00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:53.880\nmark the point at which one page ends and\nthe next page begins.\n\n492\n00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.940\nThen I can select that, and there we go.\n\n493\n00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.080\nNow I know that if I print this out,\nI'm expecting to only see this\n\n494\n00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.850\ninformation on that page only.\n\n495\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.890\nThen I can come back over here and I can\ndo this for every section if I wanted to.\n\n496\n00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:16.830\nIf I wanted to see the next part of this\nas well, we can go back and do that.\n\n497\n00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.930\nNow the only other things that\nI really want to show you here,\n\n498\n00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.700\nof course is that you can\ndo this with a short cut.\n\n499\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.660\nAnd the way that you do this one is that\nyou go to the end of where you believe\n\n500\n00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.508\nthat page should break.\n\n501\n00:26:25.508 --> 00:26:29.740\nHold down Ctrl+T and you press Enter and\n\n502\n00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.740\nthat will also give you\nthat page break as well.\n\n503\n00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.830\nSo there's a lot of different\nways that you can do this and\n\n504\n00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.930\nmake sure it's handled but\nthat's how you also control\n\n505\n00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.950\nthe way that the document's actually\ngonna break across those pages.\n\n506\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.210\nIt is important.\n\n507\n00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:50.180\nIt is essentially important especially if\nyou're printing this out for someone and\n\n508\n00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.980\nthey're expecting the document to look\nthe way that they want it to look.\n\n509\n00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.000\nNot so much whether you care about, right?\n\n510\n00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.410\nIt's what is actually expected of you.\n\n511\n00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:03.730\nSo if you think about, you can use all\nthe tools that you've gone over here today\n\n512\n00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:08.830\nto make sure that you can get the document\nto the presentation, to the format that\n\n513\n00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:14.610\nyou need to ensure that it looks the way\nthat your employer or your customer\n\n514\n00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:19.740\nis demanding it to look before it goes off\nto printing, don't overlook these tools.\n\n515\n00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.430\nWe've talked about it before\nin other episodes that\n\n516\n00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.300\nit's very easy to get frustrated and\nsay, I'll just manually do that.\n\n517\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.890\nWell, believe it or not that's even more\nfrustrating, we will take a little bit of\n\n518\n00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:34.010\ntime and effort and actually review what\nwe've actually gone over in terms of\n\n519\n00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:39.280\nconcepts here, you will find word being\none of the best tools that you can use.\n\n520\n00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.280\nWhen you are working with documents.\n\n521\n00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.330\n>> All right, very good and\nthank you there, Ronnie.\n\n522\n00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.320\nSo, in this episode, keep in mind\nwe've looked at a few things here,\n\n523\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.060\nwe've looked at how you can prevent things\nlike orphaned and widow we've looked at\n\n524\n00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.150\nsections on how they could make your\nformat look a little bit better as well as\n\n525\n00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.370\npage breaks, and one of the things I can\nsay Ronnie is thank you for that because\n\n526\n00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.490\nnow when you look at the extra characters\nthat are in the documents that I make,\n\n527\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.160\nit's not gonna look like a roadmap to\nmaybe one of your favorite major cities.\n\n528\n00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.100\nRonnie, do you have anything else for\nus on this one sir?\n\n529\n00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.090\n>> Well, remember the key here is\ngetting active into word itself.\n\n530\n00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.560\nAnd not just using it as a typewriter.\n\n531\n00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.770\nI know that that sounds funny but\nthat's what we primarily see it as.\n\n532\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.420\nBut hopefully what you're\nseeing throughout the series\n\n533\n00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.850\nIs that it is an effective editor.\n\n534\n00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.750\nIt is something that you\ncan do revisions in.\n\n535\n00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.810\nIt is something that you can\nenhance your documents in.\n\n536\n00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:28.240\nIt's something that you can really\nhave fun learning how to do.\n\n537\n00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.930\nAnd once you become proficient at it,\nyou love to actually to learn a little bit\n\n538\n00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.700\nmore and whether or\nnot it actually do what you need to.\n\n539\n00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.360\nAnd that's what's gonna make you better\nwith working inside a Word as the more\n\n540\n00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.670\noften that you're willing to play around,\ndownload a few of those documents.\n\n541\n00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.290\nRight?\n\n542\n00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.240\nI just wanted a public domain sites and\n\n543\n00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.500\nthat's what I've been\nusing those documents.\n\n544\n00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.530\nGo ahead take a look at it.\n\n545\n00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.430\nTry and make it look the way\nthat you want it to look.\n\n546\n00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:56.640\nAnd then you'll actually see how much\npower there is inside of Word 2016.\n\n547\n00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.180\n>> All right, Ronnie, well, as always,\nit's a pleasure having you here.\n\n548\n00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.220\nThank you, but it looks like we've\ncome to the end of another episode,\n\n549\n00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.470\nso signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n550\n00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.400\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n551\n00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.895\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n552\n00:29:08.895 --> 00:29:14.380\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:20.944\nAnd today's episode, we're gonna be\nmoving along in Microsoft Word 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:25.170\nAnd today, more specifically, we're gonna\nto be talking about creating tables and\n\n5\n00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.532\nI have got none other than Mr.\nRonnie Wong here to help us out today.\n\n6\n00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:30.052\nRonnie, how are you doing there?\n\n7\n00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:30.929\n>> I am doing fine.\n\n8\n00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.938\nIt's another good day to be right here as\nwe take a look at some of the different\n\n9\n00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:38.826\nthings that we might have to do Inside\na word and one of those is actually just\n\n10\n00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:42.895\na small element, but it actually is a kind\nof a neat way for you to actually add in\n\n11\n00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:47.155\nan extra element into your documents when\nyou're actually needing to make them,\n\n12\n00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.130\nwhich are of course, tables.\n\n13\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.330\nNow when we start talking about\nactually adding in tables,\n\n14\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.978\na lot of times it's because we\nare doing some type of presentation or\n\n15\n00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:57.971\nwe need to present well, just data.\n\n16\n00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:02.994\nNow we could open up another program\nout there, such as a Microsoft,\n\n17\n00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:07.759\nExcel 2016 and use that and\nthat's absolutely a valid way for\n\n18\n00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.549\nus to be able present the data as well.\n\n19\n00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.254\nBut what if she have your document and now\nyou actually are in the middle of it and\n\n20\n00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:19.814\nyou just in present a small subset of\nthat information you might find an Excel\n\n21\n00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:23.900\nspreadsheet, but you don't really\nactually have Excel in there.\n\n22\n00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.018\nAnd so you have a couple of options\nbefore you, we could do something\n\n23\n00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:32.225\nlike a screenshot of that Excel data and\nthen paste it in as an object.\n\n24\n00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.861\nThat's perfectly fine, but\n\n25\n00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:37.591\nthat object becomes a little bit more\nunusual to try and move in there\n\n26\n00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:42.250\ninside your document and doesn't flow\nas well as you might think it would.\n\n27\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.310\nBut when you can do, of course so, you can\nmainly create data inside of tables and\n\n28\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.190\ncreate a table inside of a Word\nthat will help you out instead.\n\n29\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.490\nAnd that way, it actually look\nseamless in your document,\n\n30\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.790\nit will actually provide the data\nthat you wanted to provide and\n\n31\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.510\nyou can even do a little bit of\nmodification to make it look great.\n\n32\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.337\nAnd you can even do a little bit of\nformatting to make it look great,\n\n33\n00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:06.964\nas well as using some basic formulas.\n\n34\n00:02:06.964 --> 00:02:10.477\nSo let's go ahead and\njump right in to it and\n\n35\n00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:15.659\ntake a look at how we actually can\ncreate a table inside of Word.\n\n36\n00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.110\nSo here it is on my machine,\n\n37\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.341\nI'm simply gonna launch up word\nfrom the desktop shortcut.\n\n38\n00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.559\nAnd inside the desktop shortcut,\n\n39\n00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.300\nlet's start from something we haven't\ndone throughout the entire series.\n\n40\n00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.936\nWe're gonna start from a blank\ndocument for right now and that way,\n\n41\n00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:31.058\nwe can see it happen from here.\n\n42\n00:02:31.058 --> 00:02:33.100\nNow if you know you're in\nthe middle of your document and\n\n43\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.720\nyou're gonna be inserting in a table,\nit doesn't matter where it is.\n\n44\n00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.826\nSo it can be anywhere along\nthe line of text that you have,\n\n45\n00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:42.605\nwherever your cursor is,\nthat's where it's gonna insert a table.\n\n46\n00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:47.747\nSo if I were working from scratch and\nI needed to insert in a table,\n\n47\n00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:52.888\nI simply go up to Insert and\nthen in the Insert here on that ribbon,\n\n48\n00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:56.370\nI have what we call\nthe Table grouping here.\n\n49\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.430\nAnd all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna click\non this drop-down that says, Add Table.\n\n50\n00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.260\nAnd now, I have a couple I can use\nto go ahead and create a table.\n\n51\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.762\nNow, I wanna explore this options just for\na moment here and I'm try and let you know\n\n52\n00:03:08.762 --> 00:03:12.960\nlike when you would pick some of these and\nwhen you would not pick this as well.\n\n53\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.832\nSo, if you know and\nthis is pretty much the key.\n\n54\n00:03:16.832 --> 00:03:21.168\nIf you know every column and\nthat how many column you're gonna need and\n\n55\n00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:24.550\nhow many rows of data you're\ngonna need in this table,\n\n56\n00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.584\nyou can actually use this\nto insert in the table.\n\n57\n00:03:27.584 --> 00:03:31.417\nNotice it gives me a one by one and\nif I scroll all the way out,\n\n58\n00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:34.279\nit actually goes out at\nleast to a ten by one.\n\n59\n00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.768\nAnd then I can scroll down and drop and\nas you take a look in the background of\n\n60\n00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:41.735\nmy live preview, you're actually seeing\nthat it can actually create this table.\n\n61\n00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:45.410\nNow the problem that we normally\nhave maybe not me not we.\n\n62\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.450\nWell, let's say, me that I normally have\nwhen I talk about creating table data.\n\n63\n00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.307\nCreating a table of data is fairly simple.\n\n64\n00:03:54.307 --> 00:04:00.469\nI think I need a table, but Wes,\nsometimes I don't know what I really need.\n\n65\n00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.084\nAnd so I might end up creating this ten\nby ten table saying, I'll just fill in\n\n66\n00:04:04.084 --> 00:04:08.270\neverything and then I'll figure out how\nto delete the cell that I don't need.\n\n67\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.257\nAfterwords once I fill in everything\nthat I want or that I need,\n\n68\n00:04:12.257 --> 00:04:16.259\nbut that becomes more work more\nextra stuff that you have to do.\n\n69\n00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.561\nSo as long as you actually have this\ninformation on hand and ready to go,\n\n70\n00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:22.152\nyou're perfectly fine.\n\n71\n00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:25.800\nBut if you don't, it now just becomes an\nobject inside and you take a look at it.\n\n72\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.499\nThe formatting's terrible, it doesn't\nreally lend itself to you just trying to\n\n73\n00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:34.257\ncreate on the fly a lot of the times but\nyou can do it if you chose to.\n\n74\n00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:37.914\nThe other option that you have and we're\nnot gonna pick that one or right now.\n\n75\n00:04:37.914 --> 00:04:40.030\nBut the other options that we have here,\n\n76\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.386\nof course is to actually insert in a table\nand that's gonna give us the most detail,\n\n77\n00:04:44.386 --> 00:04:47.080\nbut let's take a look at\nsome of the other ones too.\n\n78\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.130\nWe can draw a table out if we need to.\n\n79\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.606\nSo in other words,\nit can mainly scale the way they want.\n\n80\n00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:55.341\nWe can go ahead and open up Excel.\n\n81\n00:04:55.341 --> 00:05:00.990\nIf your installation on your PC not\nonly included Word, but also Excel.\n\n82\n00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.534\nIt will create a link and open up\nExcel and then you can literally add\n\n83\n00:05:05.534 --> 00:05:10.404\nin an Excel spreadsheet and then type\nin all your data that you need to and\n\n84\n00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:14.300\nmake that a part of the Excel or\nWord document, as well and\n\n85\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.220\nthen we also have these things\nthat we call Quick Tables.\n\n86\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.840\nNow we talk about Quick Tables here.\n\n87\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.336\nQuick tables,\nof course are already pre-defined or\n\n88\n00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:28.822\nwhat you see right here it says,\nBuilt-In tables and\n\n89\n00:05:28.822 --> 00:05:34.106\nyou'll see that what's happened here is\nthat calendars are built in elements.\n\n90\n00:05:34.106 --> 00:05:39.209\nNotice they've gone ahead and created\nsome for you and me that we can use if we\n\n91\n00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:44.420\nchoose to right off the bat, so I don't\nneed to manually recreate anything.\n\n92\n00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.432\nThey are saying,\n\n93\n00:05:45.432 --> 00:05:50.480\nwhy are you recreating the wheel when\nthis may work perfectly well for you?\n\n94\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.022\nS you insert that in and\nnow you can go back and modify and\n\n95\n00:05:54.022 --> 00:05:58.257\nchange the way it looks here by\nusing the table tools and design and\n\n96\n00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:00.820\nLayout tab doing whatever you want to.\n\n97\n00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.559\nSo, all of those are perfectly\nfine elements that we can use to\n\n98\n00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:08.214\ncreate tables when we take a look.\n\n99\n00:06:08.214 --> 00:06:14.170\nNow so when we start to do this, that's\nwhere you want to again figure it out.\n\n100\n00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.587\nSo don't just insert in table and\n\n101\n00:06:15.587 --> 00:06:17.822\nfigure out what data you need\nto put in at that point.\n\n102\n00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:21.000\nThe beginning of creating a table\nthen is actually going all right.\n\n103\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.680\nHere's what I wanna show.\n\n104\n00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.440\nHere's the columns that I want.\n\n105\n00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.494\nSo you wanna manually write\nit out is what you wanna do.\n\n106\n00:06:27.494 --> 00:06:33.680\nAnd that way, you go, okay, I know I'm\ngonna have a column here for categories.\n\n107\n00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.514\nI know I'm gonna have another\ncolumn here for description.\n\n108\n00:06:36.514 --> 00:06:40.602\nI know I'm gonna have another column for\nname and then you count it out and\n\n109\n00:06:40.602 --> 00:06:44.640\nthen go I think I'm gonna have up to\nthis many people or this many items.\n\n110\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.819\nAnd you go ahead and\nyou build your table from there.\n\n111\n00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.445\nThat's not limitation, cuz this table\ncan continue to add in more and\n\n112\n00:06:50.445 --> 00:06:53.070\nmore rows even beyond what you're given.\n\n113\n00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:58.250\nBut most of us, at least didn't work is\nprobably not gonna go beyond eight by ten.\n\n114\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.070\nIn other words, ten columns and\nthen eight different rows here.\n\n115\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.960\nNow if I'm not gonna get beyond that and\n\n116\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.260\nmost data that were gonna display\ninside work, but you can.\n\n117\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.867\nYou can actually keep adding more and\nmore rows, if you choose to.\n\n118\n00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:14.245\nBut let me show you the way\nthat I normally do it and\n\n119\n00:07:14.245 --> 00:07:16.110\nonce I actually know what data I need.\n\n120\n00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.225\nSo I normally come down here to where\nit says Insert Table, instead and\n\n121\n00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:23.225\nthat brings me to this\nInsert Table dialogue box and\n\n122\n00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:27.110\nlet's take a look at that\na little bit more in detail.\n\n123\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.339\nAnd all I just zoomed in just briefly,\nso that we can see it here.\n\n124\n00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:34.955\nOn this Insert Table dialogue box, it does\nthe same thing as what we saw in that\n\n125\n00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:38.506\nlittle tiny kind of gallery area\nwhere we will take a look and\n\n126\n00:07:38.506 --> 00:07:41.724\nnotice the default here is\nfive columns and two rows.\n\n127\n00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:43.390\nDoesn't mean that the limit set to that?\n\n128\n00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.296\nNo, it just means here's your starting\npoint and just wanted to get started here.\n\n129\n00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:51.923\nOr you can go ahead and control it by\nusing those spin up dials over the other\n\n130\n00:07:51.923 --> 00:07:55.731\nright-hand side to add in as much and\nas many as you want, but\n\n131\n00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:58.212\nnotice we also have AutoFit behavior.\n\n132\n00:07:58.212 --> 00:08:02.195\n>> AutoFit behavior says look,\nwe're not using standard preset sizes for\n\n133\n00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:06.698\neach of those columns and rows like we saw\nearlier when we actually did pick out like\n\n134\n00:08:06.698 --> 00:08:10.080\nthe number of rows and\nstuff in the gallery that we saw.\n\n135\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.410\nNotice that everything\nwas exactly uniform.\n\n136\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.260\nAutoFit says look, here it is,\n\n137\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.300\nwe can do the fix column automatically or\nI can actually do an autofit.\n\n138\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.470\nAutofit means fit whatever the widest\ntext is gonna be in that column or\n\n139\n00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.428\nin that row as far as the height and\nthis fit it that way.\n\n140\n00:08:26.428 --> 00:08:29.000\nWe can also, when we do the contents here.\n\n141\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.240\nAnd then, we can also autofit to the\nwindow size that we're actually on here.\n\n142\n00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.794\nSo, those are the elements that we can\nactually end up choosing depending on\n\n143\n00:08:36.794 --> 00:08:37.720\nwhat we need.\n\n144\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.914\nAt the beginning I just recommend,\n\n145\n00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:41.910\nof course, that you play around with it,\nfigure out what you need.\n\n146\n00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.730\n>> That autofit setting, I know one of the\nthings if you have columns in Excel and\n\n147\n00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.730\nthat data's a little bit larger than the\ncolumn, one of the things I have to do is\n\n148\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.900\ngo up to the top, click on it and it opens\nit up and then you can see all the text.\n\n149\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.230\nSo, the autofit you're saying,\n\n150\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.760\nit's just gonna adjust that column size\nbased on what you're typing in the column?\n\n151\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.770\n>> It really does.\n\n152\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.570\nThe same way that it works inside of Excel\nis the same way that it'll work here.\n\n153\n00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.180\nThe hard thing about this one, right,\nis that you don't see columns right away.\n\n154\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.590\nSo, you're not exactly sure if that's\ntalking about the same thing, but\n\n155\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.430\nit really is.\n\n156\n00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.080\nOkay?\n\n157\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.990\nSo, we can actually create our\ntable using this right here.\n\n158\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.520\nOkay?\n\n159\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.580\nSo, let me go ahead and\njust create a simple table.\n\n160\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.240\nAnd we'll just leave the defaults here for\nright now.\n\n161\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.840\nAnd, instead of the fixed column width,\n\n162\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.850\nnotice that I can actually change that\nto actual sizes there if I wanted to.\n\n163\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.390\nSo, I'm gonna leave it\nhere at the auto and\n\n164\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.030\nthat way it can actually\nadjust when we need to.\n\n165\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.788\nAnd that way we can manually\nadjust it as we need it as well.\n\n166\n00:09:31.788 --> 00:09:36.770\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n167\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.850\nAnd now, there it is.\n\n168\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.120\nI have my five column table\nhere with two different rows.\n\n169\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.712\nNow, whenever we talk about\nputting row data in here we might\n\n170\n00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:49.364\nactually start off saying, hey, what in\nthe world do I really need to present?\n\n171\n00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:56.470\nSo, I can go ahead and\ntake a look at each of these cells here.\n\n172\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.680\nAnd if I want to navigate through it,\nI just use my tab key.\n\n173\n00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.840\nAnd I'm just using tab.\n\n174\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.110\nAnd notice that it actually\nnavigate across both rows there.\n\n175\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.500\nAnd then, when I continue to\nthe end of that second row and\n\n176\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.200\nI tab again,\nyou can see we're adding in a third row.\n\n177\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.020\nSo, let me show you.\n\n178\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.560\nThere it is,\nI'm at the last one that I use the tab.\n\n179\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.160\nAnd then, if I hit tab again\nnotice it adds in a third row.\n\n180\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.260\nSo, it doesn't provide a limitation.\n\n181\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.180\nIt really,\nwhether we use that grid in the gallery or\n\n182\n00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.110\nwhether we actually use what I did there,\nessentially, it's just a starting point.\n\n183\n00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.110\nSo, it's not a limitation.\n\n184\n00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.140\n>> Yeah.\nOne of things that I usually struggle with\n\n185\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.630\nif I try to put a table in one\nof these documents is going and\n\n186\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.330\nfinding the cursor and then making sure\nthat the icon changes to right type so\n\n187\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.880\nyou can stretch the whole table out.\n\n188\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.750\nI didn't know about the tab.\n\n189\n00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.500\nSo, you tab, if you get to that second,\n\n190\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.410\nat the end, just tab a couple of times and\nyou don't have\n\n191\n00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.960\nto worry about finding your cursor-\n>> That's it.\n\n192\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.130\n>> And making sure the icon's right.\n\n193\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:45.960\nSo that's really cool.\n\n194\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.770\n>> Yeah.\nThat's exactly the way that you do so.\n\n195\n00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.292\nAnd if you need to navigate backward,\n\n196\n00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:52.900\nin other words through the table, you can\nalso do a Shift+Tab and notice that will\n\n197\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.110\nactually move it from the right to\nthe left and also, of course, down to up.\n\n198\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.430\nSo, if you do happen to not have your\nmouse handy, I don't know how you can't,\n\n199\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.450\nbut if you happen not to be able to do so\n\n200\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.890\nyou can always just use the keyboard to\nhelp you out and do what you need to do.\n\n201\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.620\nSo, let's take for an example\nthat what we're going to do here.\n\n202\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.488\nAnd I've been on this pirate mode for\na couple of days now.\n\n203\n00:11:14.488 --> 00:11:18.460\nLet's say that we're gonna\nmake a sign up sheet for\n\n204\n00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.770\npirates to come on board is\nwhat we're going to do here.\n\n205\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.380\nSo, I might go ahead and start up here\nat the very top and say, let's see,\n\n206\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.190\nthat would be possible enlistee.\n\n207\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.625\nHowever you say that, enlistee here.\n\n208\n00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:37.470\n[LAUGH] And then we will have their name.\n\n209\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.160\nSo, we'll say name and\nthen, of course, position.\n\n210\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.350\nPosition, I hope that\nspelled position there.\n\n211\n00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.636\nPosition [LAUGH].\n\n212\n00:11:47.636 --> 00:11:49.980\nIs that how you spell position?\n\n213\n00:11:51.282 --> 00:11:52.772\nWell, who knows.\n\n214\n00:11:52.772 --> 00:11:55.100\nPosition, let's see, rank.\n\n215\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.103\nI know if there's actually ranks\non pirate ships or not, but\n\n216\n00:12:00.103 --> 00:12:01.980\nI assume there's at least\na first mate there.\n\n217\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:08.060\nAnd then, desired, or sea experience.\n\n218\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.820\nLet's do that.\n\n219\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.830\nLet's just do experience.\n\n220\n00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.480\nAll right.\n\n221\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.300\nSo, there it is.\n\n222\n00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.590\nI'm creating that particular table.\n\n223\n00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:20.176\nFrom this point on,\nwe just simply enter in the data.\n\n224\n00:12:20.176 --> 00:12:22.059\nOkay?\nSo, I'm gonna say, enlistee signature.\n\n225\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.350\nThat way that we actually know.\n\n226\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.820\nSo, somebody's actually supposed to\nsign that and then we put their names.\n\n227\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.270\nOops.\n\n228\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.390\n>> You gotta put like\nBlack Beard in there.\n\n229\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.520\n>> Yeah, something like that.\n\n230\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.280\n>> Johnny Depp.\n\n231\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.570\n>> And I'm gonna apply for deckhand rank.\n\n232\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.805\nLet's see, I don't know, what?\n\n233\n00:12:37.805 --> 00:12:38.860\nSeaman.\n\n234\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.820\nI don't have a clue.\n\n235\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.705\nExperience, none.\n\n236\n00:12:41.705 --> 00:12:44.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I really am not.\n\n237\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.970\nAnd so-\n>> You're swabbing the deck.\n\n238\n00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.410\n>> Wes Bryan.\n\n239\n00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.470\nWes, he's gonna apply for First Mate here.\n\n240\n00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.960\nAnd his rank is gonna be,\nI'm gonna say First Mate.\n\n241\n00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.023\nI don't know.\n[LAUGH] See, I really have no,\n\n242\n00:12:57.023 --> 00:13:00.794\nand let's say he's got ten\nyears of pirate experience.\n\n243\n00:13:00.794 --> 00:13:01.298\nOkay?\n>> All right.\n\n244\n00:13:01.298 --> 00:13:03.440\nThere we go. So, now we are starting\nto create our list, right?\n\n245\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.030\nAnd we can continue to do this as more and\n\n246\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:10.050\nmore people jump on board here\nat this point I just hit tab.\n\n247\n00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.100\nAnd now, we can enter in another line and\n\n248\n00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.015\nnow we'll have this ready\nto go if we needed to.\n\n249\n00:13:15.015 --> 00:13:15.740\nOkay?\n\n250\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.940\nSo, everything seems good.\n\n251\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.190\nI know I can create a table from\nscratch using those table tools\n\n252\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.110\nthat are available to us.\n\n253\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.150\nAnd at this point here,\nwhat Wes was saying about the Autofit,\n\n254\n00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.740\nI didn't show that, and I should.\n\n255\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:35.150\nSo, even though it automatically created\nit, notice that I can hover in between\n\n256\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:40.360\nthose column lines, and\nit gives me double vertical arrows, or\n\n257\n00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.900\ndouble vertical lines,\nwith the arrows facing outward.\n\n258\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.120\nIf I double-click on that line,\nlet me see, oop.\n\n259\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.210\nI don't know, oh, it won't let\nme do it inside of, there we go.\n\n260\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.655\nI'm working on the Mac keyboard,\nit's kind of iffy if I do that.\n\n261\n00:13:53.655 --> 00:13:55.486\nBut it just took me a moment here.\n\n262\n00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:59.430\nLet me see if that one, I know Wes\ncan hear me doing it, but, yeah,\n\n263\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.990\nthis one actually did it.\n\n264\n00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.710\nThis one is kind of\nplaying around with me.\n\n265\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.790\nBut that's exactly what it's doing.\n\n266\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.510\nIt's doing that autofit to\nfit it the way we want it to,\n\n267\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.450\nto make it look a little bit better.\n\n268\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:14.640\nNow, Wes, believe it or not, though,\nokay, as much as this is, it's a long way.\n\n269\n00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.712\nIt could take a long time for\nus to create a table of data.\n\n270\n00:14:17.712 --> 00:14:22.720\nEven if I know what that stuff is, if I\ndo it this way it can take forever for\n\n271\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.970\nme to enter in all\nthe data that I need to.\n\n272\n00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.510\nOkay?\n\n273\n00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.020\nThere's another way where we can do\nthis in which if we take the time and\n\n274\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:36.170\nenter our data in correctly it absolutely\nis gonna create a table for us instead.\n\n275\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.300\nSo, let me show you that, too.\n\n276\n00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.990\nSo, we'll take kinda the same data here.\n\n277\n00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.930\nAnd this time, what we'll do is we'll\nactually create what we call delimiters.\n\n278\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:44.510\nOkay?\n\n279\n00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.460\nA delimiter can be anything.\n\n280\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.420\nAnd what I mean by that,\nis as long as I use the same tool\n\n281\n00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.640\nto represent the columns that I want,\nit will do this.\n\n282\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.370\nSo, let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n283\n00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:00.730\nSo if I do the same thing,\nenlistee signature, okay?\n\n284\n00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.140\nAnd this time I'm gonna put in blood.\n\n285\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.680\nI can't spell blood.\n\n286\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.720\n>> Well, that's okay cuz the signatures\nwill just be an X, right?\n\n287\n00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.240\n>> An X.\n>> I don't even know if pirates can even\n\n288\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.025\nspell, right?\n\n289\n00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:13.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then, at this point I\n\n290\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.050\ncan do whatever I want.\n\n291\n00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:14.950\nI'm gonna use a tab.\n\n292\n00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:19.888\nAnd then, I'm gonna type a name,\ntab again, position.\n\n293\n00:15:19.888 --> 00:15:26.730\nRank and experience.\n\n294\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.400\nOkay?\n\n295\n00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.771\nNow, as long as I keep that in mind, okay,\n\n296\n00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:36.394\nin other words as long as I keep doing\nthat, so everybody that signs in,\n\n297\n00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:42.487\nso I'm just hitting the tab one time and\nthen I'm gonna type in Ronnie Long and\n\n298\n00:15:42.487 --> 00:15:48.497\nthen deckhand, seaman Oops.\n\n299\n00:15:48.497 --> 00:15:50.088\nHold on.\nJust want to make sure that I only have\n\n300\n00:15:50.088 --> 00:15:50.837\none tab in there.\n\n301\n00:15:50.837 --> 00:15:51.754\nAnd then, experience here.\n\n302\n00:15:51.754 --> 00:15:55.421\nNone.\n\n303\n00:15:55.421 --> 00:16:01.879\nAnd then first mate.\n\n304\n00:16:06.046 --> 00:16:08.796\nYeah, first mate, and that means his rank.\n\n305\n00:16:08.796 --> 00:16:11.046\nI'm gonna put in Commander this time.\n\n306\n00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:13.798\n>> Right [CROSSTALK]\n>> Commander, that's right, and\n\n307\n00:16:13.798 --> 00:16:14.629\nthen 10 years.\n\n308\n00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:22.500\nAl right, so by just doing something like\nthis, what we can do is, we can take text.\n\n309\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.240\nAs long as those marks are the same in how\nI want to divide up the columns, I can now\n\n310\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.790\ngo ahead and select this text right here,\nif I haven't done anything wrong,\n\n311\n00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:39.180\nthen go back to Insert,\ncome back to the Table Grouping, and\n\n312\n00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:43.290\nthis third option right here, the one that\nI conveniently skipped over last time,\n\n313\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:48.150\nthis third option right here Convert Text\nto Table, I can select that, and\n\n314\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.490\nnow let's see what it does here.\n\n315\n00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.500\nClick OK, and there we go.\n\n316\n00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.230\nSo apparently I added in\na couple extra tabs there, and\n\n317\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.845\nI didn't realize that I had done so.\n\n318\n00:16:58.845 --> 00:17:02.740\nBut that's what these these two\nextra columns ended up being.\n\n319\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.110\nSomewhere along the line where I end\nit up adding in more than I realize.\n\n320\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.850\nBut you can see that it\ncan take regular data and\n\n321\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:12.380\ndo that, and actually convert it for\nus to do something.\n\n322\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.550\nSo it takes a little bit time but\nit can be done.\n\n323\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.510\nLet me show you how this actually\nworks much more effectively.\n\n324\n00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.180\nI've already got some data,\nnow let me if I opened it up right.\n\n325\n00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.500\nAnd let's call it Pirate Plunder,\nis what we've actually called it.\n\n326\n00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.790\nAnd let's say that from here, I went\nahead and done the same thing, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.790\nIs that we created this\nPirate Plunder sheet\n\n328\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.060\nwhere we have the categories\nof Pirate Plunder, right?\n\n329\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.464\nGold, silver, vittles, cuz we don't\nactually have to call it food,\n\n330\n00:17:38.464 --> 00:17:40.640\nwe have to call it vittles,\nand then jewels.\n\n331\n00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.835\nAnd then of course,\nwe have the description of these,\n\n332\n00:17:43.835 --> 00:17:48.280\nthe hole that it's being kept in,\nthe amount of the plunder that we have.\n\n333\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.072\nAnd then we have the value,\nin other words per whatever,\n\n334\n00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:56.022\nper gold buillon or chain, or\nwhatever is, the value, and\n\n335\n00:17:56.022 --> 00:17:59.587\nthen we have a total column\nover there on the very end.\n\n336\n00:17:59.587 --> 00:18:06.090\nWell the nice thing is, now if I select\nall of this data right here, and\n\n337\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:12.482\nthen I go back to Insert > Table,\nand I select Convert Text to Table,\n\n338\n00:18:12.482 --> 00:18:17.913\nit will go ahead and\nread those tabs that I used in between.\n\n339\n00:18:17.913 --> 00:18:21.212\nClick OK, and there we go.\n\n340\n00:18:21.212 --> 00:18:24.907\nNow notice how it actually\nis perfectly aligned up and\n\n341\n00:18:24.907 --> 00:18:28.280\ndoing what we wanted it to do here, okay?\n\n342\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:34.540\nSo we can very simply create the table of\ndata that we really need to, to do that.\n\n343\n00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.962\nAnd we can also use those autofit\noptions that will play along.\n\n344\n00:18:37.962 --> 00:18:41.470\nIt did for a moment, and\nnow it's not doing it again, and\n\n345\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.046\nthen adjust those values to what we need.\n\n346\n00:18:44.046 --> 00:18:48.076\nNow the other thing that we can do, now\nthat we have a table of data though Wes,\n\n347\n00:18:48.076 --> 00:18:52.820\nis notice that if you're, let's say that\nyou're a proper pirate like Mike right?\n\n348\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.280\nYou notice that here in this sense,\n\n349\n00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.350\nokay, this would probably\ndrive Mike a little bit nuts.\n\n350\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:03.130\nYou notice that gold, silver and\nthen vittles, and then jewels down here?\n\n351\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.370\nMan, what would Mike want?\n\n352\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.380\nMike Rodrick, the pirate himself,\nwould want this to be sorted, right?\n\n353\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.201\nTo be alphabetized,\nto do what we need it to do,\n\n354\n00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:16.515\nbecause this would not be a proper\npirate if it's not sorted correctly.\n\n355\n00:19:16.515 --> 00:19:21.212\nSo the good thing is, now that I've\nactually got it in tabular data, right?\n\n356\n00:19:21.212 --> 00:19:23.104\nI can select the table, and\n\n357\n00:19:23.104 --> 00:19:28.220\nnow notice my contextual tools\ncome up here, my table tools.\n\n358\n00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:34.004\nThen I can click on, let's say it's\ngonna be Layout here, select Layout.\n\n359\n00:19:34.004 --> 00:19:37.301\nAnd once I actually have Layout selected,\n\n360\n00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:41.147\non the last grouping over\nhere on the upper right,\n\n361\n00:19:41.147 --> 00:19:46.296\nnotice I have the ability to sort,\nis what I have the ability to do.\n\n362\n00:19:46.296 --> 00:19:49.212\nSo I can go ahead and sort that data.\n\n363\n00:19:49.212 --> 00:19:54.532\nWhen I click on that icon for\nsort it gives me the sorting table, and\n\n364\n00:19:54.532 --> 00:20:00.337\nwhat it does is it gives me the ability\nto chose the column here to sort by.\n\n365\n00:20:00.337 --> 00:20:03.023\nSo notice I have six columns up here, and\n\n366\n00:20:03.023 --> 00:20:07.740\nthen the first drop-down box\ngives me all six columns, okay?\n\n367\n00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.220\nAnd so when I have that,\nI can actually say hey,\n\n368\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.100\nI wanna sort by column one right now,\nokay?\n\n369\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.670\nAnd then, go ahead and\ndo that, I'm gonna click OK.\n\n370\n00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.070\nAnd now notice what I've done here,\n\n371\n00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.240\nWes, is I've taken the columns and\nnow this is actually better.\n\n372\n00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.465\nNotice I moved everything up,\n\n373\n00:20:23.465 --> 00:20:28.130\nand now we are actually in alphabetical\norder to be able to do that.\n\n374\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.660\nNow, what would also drive\nMike a little bit more,\n\n375\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.364\nnotice that I what I did here for gold,\nbullion and bars, look at that one.\n\n376\n00:20:36.364 --> 00:20:39.900\nThat one's actually also not\nsorted the way that we need to.\n\n377\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.140\nSo, I need to go back into that source,\nI'm gonna click on that table again.\n\n378\n00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.280\nAnd go back into Sort here and\n\n379\n00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.860\nthis time I'm gonna select by Column 2,\nand do the same thing.\n\n380\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.990\nNow I can actually choose what I want\nto sort by, so notice that you actually\n\n381\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.350\nhave paragraphs in these places, and\nthat's the only thing that we had.\n\n382\n00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.100\nBut it could be that there could be tabs,\nit could be spaces, you name it.\n\n383\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.455\nBut I'm gonna select,\nby 2, Column 2 and 1.\n\n384\n00:21:06.455 --> 00:21:10.880\nSo it always does this from the top to\nthe bottom of this dialogue box here\n\n385\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.630\nwhen you're actually doing the sort,\nright.\n\n386\n00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.868\nSo it'll go through and\nsort Column 1 first, and\n\n387\n00:21:14.868 --> 00:21:18.420\nthen it will go back now that that's\nsorted, and then sort Column 2.\n\n388\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.790\nSo that's the order that it's actually\ndoing that and when it does that.\n\n389\n00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.570\nSo now, when I click OK,\nnow notice that even here though, Okay?\n\n390\n00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:32.129\nWe now have it actually properly sorted,\nalso up here inside of our table.\n\n391\n00:21:32.129 --> 00:21:37.672\nSo it does actually work like\na spreadsheet program does work.\n\n392\n00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:41.211\nAnd so this is not exactly\nhas the power of Excel.\n\n393\n00:21:41.211 --> 00:21:45.657\nIt really doesn't, you don't ever wanna\ncome anywhere close to the power Excel,\n\n394\n00:21:45.657 --> 00:21:48.412\nbut, notice that you do\nhave that ability to do so.\n\n395\n00:21:48.412 --> 00:21:50.810\nPretty neat, If I say so myself.\n\n396\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.040\n>> Absolutely, yeah so\n\n397\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.480\nyou could take the data itself,\nyou could put it into a table.\n\n398\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.110\nNow, we got a question here,\nif you have the data already into a table,\n\n399\n00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.040\nlet's say that maybe you\ndon't need a table format.\n\n400\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.050\nIs there any way that you\ncan change it the other way?\n\n401\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.550\nYou can go from inside of a table,\nmaybe outside of a table?\n\n402\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.960\n>> There really is a way that you\ncan actually end up doing that\n\n403\n00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.040\nif you choose to.\n\n404\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.030\nSo let's say you already had that table,\nyou can actually select that table data\n\n405\n00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.140\nitself, and let me see here, there we go.\n\n406\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.170\nOnce I've selected the table,\n\n407\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.180\nI'm trying to see if I need to select\nthe entire table, no I don't, okay.\n\n408\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:32.970\nSo I just click back in the table here\nwhen my contextual tools right here for\n\n409\n00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:38.130\nthe table tools shows up and\ngives me this Layout tab,\n\n410\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:43.970\nover in the data grouping itself,\nagain on the upper right hand side,\n\n411\n00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.150\nnotice that third icon that's up there\nthat says Convert to Text, okay?\n\n412\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.960\nSo I can actually use that if I wanted to,\nto convert the entire thing,\n\n413\n00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.490\nthe text here.\n\n414\n00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:57.270\nNow when I do so, it's asking me how\ndo I want to separate the text that's\n\n415\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.770\nwithin here, and I know that I'm\nusing tabs inside, and I click OK.\n\n416\n00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.222\nAnd now look at that,\nthat's actually perfectly aligned.\n\n417\n00:23:06.222 --> 00:23:10.817\nRemember the original data that we had in\nplace didn't look anything like this, but\n\n418\n00:23:10.817 --> 00:23:14.134\nnow notice that everything is\nactually perfectly lined up.\n\n419\n00:23:14.134 --> 00:23:17.090\nSo you can actually take the time\nto actually do that as well.\n\n420\n00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.720\nAnd this way,\n\n421\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.390\nif you just wanted to make it appear as a\nlist, or if you wanted to go in there, and\n\n422\n00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.460\nnow you can actually change or add in\ndifferent values, you can do that as well.\n\n423\n00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.985\nSo it actually does work fairly\neasily like that if we wanted it to.\n\n424\n00:23:29.985 --> 00:23:33.495\n>> I could see where that would come in\nhandy if you started out like we've seen\n\n425\n00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:37.365\nwith the data that you had at first,\nwhere it's not organized so much.\n\n426\n00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:40.617\nI mean, you had it fairly organized,\nbut you import it into the table, and\n\n427\n00:23:40.617 --> 00:23:41.730\nthen take it back out of the table.\n\n428\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.196\nAnd now you've save yourself a lot of\nSpace bars and Enters trying to get that\n\n429\n00:23:45.196 --> 00:23:48.630\ninformation back in the format that\nyou want, so a really cool technique.\n\n430\n00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.381\nAll right Ronnie, so\nwhat else we got on tap here?\n\n431\n00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:54.196\n>> Yeah well let's go ahead and\ntake a look at some of the other features.\n\n432\n00:23:54.196 --> 00:23:55.922\nI'm gonna\n>> Get back in this table.\n\n433\n00:23:55.922 --> 00:23:58.132\nWell, I'm gonna do a control z I\nthink I'm gonna do a control z.\n\n434\n00:23:58.132 --> 00:24:00.395\nSorry, I hit the wrong button.\n\n435\n00:24:00.395 --> 00:24:01.766\nSo of course, it's not gonna work.\n\n436\n00:24:01.766 --> 00:24:04.367\nA Ctrl+Z for undo.\n\n437\n00:24:04.367 --> 00:24:08.752\nSo this is the one that's by far one\nof the saving shortcuts that I've ever\n\n438\n00:24:08.752 --> 00:24:10.893\nlearned in my years of experience.\n\n439\n00:24:10.893 --> 00:24:14.370\nCtrl+Z has saved me so\nmuch work, it's amazing.\n\n440\n00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.480\nNow one of the other things I also wanna\nshow you is right up here on the Home tab,\n\n441\n00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.804\nif I click on this Show/Hide mark,\n\n442\n00:24:21.804 --> 00:24:25.930\nI want you to see the actual mark\nthat's holding these tables.\n\n443\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:31.453\nIt kind of looks like a little ball\nwith 4 feet that angle out of it there,\n\n444\n00:24:31.453 --> 00:24:34.367\nyou don't normally have to see this.\n\n445\n00:24:34.367 --> 00:24:38.519\nBut if you're ever unsure that\nsomething is not lining up right,\n\n446\n00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:43.437\nthat's what you wanna use as how hide\nmarks here just briefly to help you out.\n\n447\n00:24:43.437 --> 00:24:48.674\nNow we can, of course, format and\nmodify this a couple of different ways,\n\n448\n00:24:48.674 --> 00:24:52.932\nbut let me start off by adding\nin this Pirate Plunder up here.\n\n449\n00:24:52.932 --> 00:24:58.901\nI want this to actually be a single across\nthe top of the table here entry for\n\n450\n00:24:58.901 --> 00:25:02.340\npirate plunder is what I want to do.\n\n451\n00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.813\nSo can I actually add in an additional\nrow up here if I want to?\n\n452\n00:25:06.813 --> 00:25:11.531\nWell, if I right-click on the first cell\nI can go up to Insert and notice that it\n\n453\n00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:16.415\ngive me the ability to insert columns to\nthe left, to the right, above or below.\n\n454\n00:25:16.415 --> 00:25:19.367\nI'm gonna select Insert Row Above now and\n\n455\n00:25:19.367 --> 00:25:24.508\nnow notice it actually gives me,\nwell, five different columns again or\n\n456\n00:25:24.508 --> 00:25:28.823\nsix different columns, but\nthat's not what I really want.\n\n457\n00:25:28.823 --> 00:25:32.509\nI want this to be one\nrow here that I can put\n\n458\n00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:36.533\nPirate Plunder in the center and\ncenter it.\n\n459\n00:25:36.533 --> 00:25:42.612\nThe way I can do that is by selecting\nall the cells in that first row and\n\n460\n00:25:42.612 --> 00:25:46.771\nthen if I go back to Layout,\nI'm gonna look for\n\n461\n00:25:46.771 --> 00:25:50.629\nthe grouping that's called Merge Cells.\n\n462\n00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:56.500\nSo if I take a look, there it is Layout\nand almost right in the center top of\n\n463\n00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.271\nthe page, there's that Merge grouping and\nthere is one that says, Merge Cells.\n\n464\n00:26:01.271 --> 00:26:06.826\nSo if I select that, now notice\nthat that becomes a single cell for\n\n465\n00:26:06.826 --> 00:26:12.987\nme and then I can go ahead and copy or\nI'm gonna cut here and do a Ctrl+X and\n\n466\n00:26:12.987 --> 00:26:18.955\nthen I can click inside that cell and\ndo a Ctrl+V and paste it in there.\n\n467\n00:26:18.955 --> 00:26:20.859\nI'm gonna center the text here.\n\n468\n00:26:20.859 --> 00:26:27.415\nBut this time,\nI'm also going to change the font here\n\n469\n00:26:27.415 --> 00:26:33.096\na little bit to make it\nlook more parody here and\n\n470\n00:26:33.096 --> 00:26:40.536\nwe'll even change the size to\nmake it look not too gigantic.\n\n471\n00:26:40.536 --> 00:26:42.557\nAll of a sudden,\nit begins to look silly and ridiculous.\n\n472\n00:26:42.557 --> 00:26:44.740\nSo there we go.\n\n473\n00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.732\nNow at least I know what\nthis table's about,\n\n474\n00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:52.631\nI add in a perfectly good header into\nthe table, it really helps out here.\n\n475\n00:26:52.631 --> 00:26:57.764\nNow notice that final column\nover on the right-hand side.\n\n476\n00:26:57.764 --> 00:27:00.591\nWell, what am I actually\nsupposed to do with this as well.\n\n477\n00:27:00.591 --> 00:27:04.541\nI suppose I should create a formula and\nwe wanna do that too.\n\n478\n00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:07.541\nNow before I do that there was a couple\nother things I wanted to show and\n\n479\n00:27:07.541 --> 00:27:09.420\nI was just remembering\nas I look back over.\n\n480\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.690\nWes, over here on the left-hand\nside web categories.\n\n481\n00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.050\nYou see where it says, gold,\njewels, silver, vittles.\n\n482\n00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.160\nAll that actually is good,\nbut fairly redundant.\n\n483\n00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.061\nI want this to look polished and\nprofessional here.\n\n484\n00:27:22.061 --> 00:27:25.961\nSo what would be better is if I actually\nwas able to kind merge these things down\n\n485\n00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:27.526\nto make it a little bit better.\n\n486\n00:27:27.526 --> 00:27:28.525\nSo let me show you again.\n\n487\n00:27:28.525 --> 00:27:31.301\nSo we're going to use that\nMerge Cells again, so\n\n488\n00:27:31.301 --> 00:27:34.080\nI'm gonna select those two cells.\n\n489\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.480\nGo back to Layout and\n\n490\n00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:40.040\nmerge this together and\nthen I'm gonna get rid of one of these.\n\n491\n00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.640\nI'll say like where it says,\ngold here and then I'm gonna center that.\n\n492\n00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.873\nAnd let's see if I center it toward,\nyeah, okay.\n\n493\n00:27:48.873 --> 00:27:49.483\nSo there we go.\n\n494\n00:27:49.483 --> 00:27:54.108\nSo now,\nI've actually merged those together and\n\n495\n00:27:54.108 --> 00:27:57.961\nI'm gonna do the same thing for Jewels and\n\n496\n00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:01.703\nmerge here and\nsee if I can center that and\n\n497\n00:28:01.703 --> 00:28:07.556\nthen get rid of one of those like that,\nsame thing with silver.\n\n498\n00:28:07.556 --> 00:28:11.894\nOops, I'm gonna see if I can grab this and\nthen merge those cells together and\n\n499\n00:28:11.894 --> 00:28:15.054\nI'm gonna get rid of, well,\nI'm going to see if I can.\n\n500\n00:28:15.054 --> 00:28:16.865\nLet me see I'm trying to get rid of.\n\n501\n00:28:19.437 --> 00:28:20.133\nThis here.\n\n502\n00:28:20.133 --> 00:28:23.105\nNow the other thing that I can do with\nthis, I needed one that actually had\n\n503\n00:28:23.105 --> 00:28:25.298\na little bit of space to it and\nsilver actually does and\n\n504\n00:28:25.298 --> 00:28:28.150\nnotice that there is also this\nalignment where I can change the text.\n\n505\n00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.962\nOops, there we go.\n\n506\n00:28:29.962 --> 00:28:31.053\nNot wanting to do that, there we go.\n\n507\n00:28:31.053 --> 00:28:32.824\nThat's the one I wanna do,\n\n508\n00:28:32.824 --> 00:28:37.367\nchange the text direction of where\nthat actually appears if I want to.\n\n509\n00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:42.753\nSo you can see where we can add that\nin and we could do the spacing here.\n\n510\n00:28:42.753 --> 00:28:43.798\nSo let me see if I can do that.\n\n511\n00:28:43.798 --> 00:28:44.472\nThere we go.\n\n512\n00:28:44.472 --> 00:28:48.937\nI can do silver, but when I look at it\nsideways, it looks a little bit weird.\n\n513\n00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:50.330\nSo, I want to make sure\nI spelled it right.\n\n514\n00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:55.331\nThere we go and then we can do\nthe same thing with vittles here.\n\n515\n00:28:55.331 --> 00:28:59.456\nWe'll merge those cells\ncenter that thing up and\n\n516\n00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:04.496\nthen we'll get rid of some of this here,\nI'm gonna try to.\n\n517\n00:29:10.601 --> 00:29:12.039\nAnd center that up.\n\n518\n00:29:16.613 --> 00:29:18.892\nOh, I probably should've left\nthe middle one, shouldn't I?\n\n519\n00:29:18.892 --> 00:29:22.467\n[LAUGH] But you can actually\nsee how it ends up working out.\n\n520\n00:29:22.467 --> 00:29:24.079\nSo now it looks a little better,\n\n521\n00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:27.841\nlook like we took a little bit of time\nto fill all that and merge those cells,\n\n522\n00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:31.571\nbe able to also change direction of\ntext of text inside that cells as well.\n\n523\n00:29:31.571 --> 00:29:34.637\nSo I want to do that since\nwe're doing the merge, anyways.\n\n524\n00:29:34.637 --> 00:29:38.363\nSo last thing I wanna show is that\nidea of actually using formulas.\n\n525\n00:29:38.363 --> 00:29:41.908\nNow when we talk about using formulas,\nmost of us our heads go to Excel,\n\n526\n00:29:41.908 --> 00:29:44.390\nit doesn't tend to go inside of Word.\n\n527\n00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.600\nBut if you're only doing\nbasic formulas and I mean,\n\n528\n00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.180\nreally basic like multiplication,\naddition Subtraction, division.\n\n529\n00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:57.072\nYou can do some of that and the good thing\nis if you've learned a little bit of\n\n530\n00:29:57.072 --> 00:30:00.191\nskills in Excel,\nit really helps you out here.\n\n531\n00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:04.658\nSo I'm gonna click on this first row right\nhere and we are not gonna do everything,\n\n532\n00:30:04.658 --> 00:30:08.310\nbut this is where there's also\nlimitations and you'll see this.\n\n533\n00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:13.964\nSo let's say I wanted to figure out the\ntotal plunder for gold bars at this point.\n\n534\n00:30:13.964 --> 00:30:16.211\nWell, what we would normally do\nis we would take the amount.\n\n535\n00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:19.482\nI've got 500 of them, the value for\neach bar is about 100.\n\n536\n00:30:19.482 --> 00:30:24.533\nI should come up with what is that 50,000\nor so is what I should come up with.\n\n537\n00:30:24.533 --> 00:30:28.417\nSo when I actually do something like that,\nwhat can I do?\n\n538\n00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:30.884\nI can actually insert a formula\ninto that final cell.\n\n539\n00:30:30.884 --> 00:30:34.439\nSo I'm going to click on formula here and\n\n540\n00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:38.527\nthat will bring up this\nformula dialogue box.\n\n541\n00:30:38.527 --> 00:30:42.269\nNow when I take a look at the formula\ndialogue box, notice under formula right\n\n542\n00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:46.110\nnow it says, sum and it's actually\nadding up the values to the left.\n\n543\n00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.104\nWell, that's not exactly what I need.\n\n544\n00:30:48.104 --> 00:30:53.330\nWhat I need though is to multiply\nwhat's actually in the amount\n\n545\n00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:57.976\ncolumn by the value up there\nin the value column as well.\n\n546\n00:30:57.976 --> 00:31:02.580\nSo it's at this point, we actually can\nreference this in the couple of different\n\n547\n00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.434\nways and let me see if I can\nget this one right here.\n\n548\n00:31:05.434 --> 00:31:08.404\nSo we can actually use some\nof our skills from Excel and\n\n549\n00:31:08.404 --> 00:31:12.629\nthe way that this ends up working normally\nis that if we understand like A1,\n\n550\n00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:15.336\nthe cell reference where\nthe first column is A and\n\n551\n00:31:15.336 --> 00:31:18.923\nthen each row underneath that begins one,\ntwo, three, four.\n\n552\n00:31:18.923 --> 00:31:22.811\nWell, this I think would actually\nbe the second row down here.\n\n553\n00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:28.317\nSo if I do this,\nwhat I need to do is do an equal sign and\n\n554\n00:31:28.317 --> 00:31:32.463\nnow actually go to column A, B, C, D.\n\n555\n00:31:32.463 --> 00:31:40.314\nSo I type in D and\nthis would be row one, two, three.\n\n556\n00:31:40.314 --> 00:31:47.371\nSo D3 and then I do an asterisk for\nthe equals sign times E3.\n\n557\n00:31:47.371 --> 00:31:52.215\nNow I could be wrong here because\nI did add in that single pirate\n\n558\n00:31:52.215 --> 00:31:57.637\nplunder line up above there and\nnotice that and that you did add it in.\n\n559\n00:31:57.637 --> 00:31:59.611\nSo we can do simple formulas.\n\n560\n00:31:59.611 --> 00:32:03.015\nWe can't do like Excel and\nnow take that formula and\n\n561\n00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:06.590\ndrag it down and do an Autofill,\nit doesn't do that.\n\n562\n00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:11.521\nSo each one of those lines, I'd have\nto go back in and fill it in manually.\n\n563\n00:32:11.521 --> 00:32:15.223\nBut yes, you can at least\nshow tabled data in that way.\n\n564\n00:32:15.223 --> 00:32:19.082\nAnd now, I can go ahead and do that for\nevery single one after that and\n\n565\n00:32:19.082 --> 00:32:21.611\ncontinue to fill in the data and\ndisplay it.\n\n566\n00:32:21.611 --> 00:32:26.265\nThis is probably why you don't\nwant to do this if you have\n\n567\n00:32:26.265 --> 00:32:30.733\nlike 200 lines data but\n10 or 12 lines not bad.\n\n568\n00:32:30.733 --> 00:32:35.013\nIf you need complicated formulas\nnot the tool, not the tool to use.\n\n569\n00:32:35.013 --> 00:32:38.863\nBut if you're displaying this inside of a\ndocument, try to make sure that your data\n\n570\n00:32:38.863 --> 00:32:41.234\nlooks good,\nthis is the way they go about doing it.\n\n571\n00:32:41.234 --> 00:32:44.366\nSo where there's a lot there on just\ntabled out and then, of course,\n\n572\n00:32:44.366 --> 00:32:47.992\nyou can add in additional formatting to\nmake it look however you want it to look.\n\n573\n00:32:47.992 --> 00:32:48.689\n>> Very good.\n\n574\n00:32:48.689 --> 00:32:51.620\nAnd so some of the things that\nwe've looked in this episode.\n\n575\n00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.020\nWe've looked at taking your text and\nconverting it to a table.\n\n576\n00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.013\nWe've looked at taking the same thing,\nthat table maybe you already\n\n577\n00:32:58.013 --> 00:33:00.902\nhave the data in the table and\nyou wanna bring it back the other way,\n\n578\n00:33:00.902 --> 00:33:04.070\ntake the table and convert the text\npull the the text back out.\n\n579\n00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.033\nWe've also look at modifying\nthe layout of the table in general.\n\n580\n00:33:08.033 --> 00:33:10.643\nShow your quick tables and\neven the Autofit.\n\n581\n00:33:10.643 --> 00:33:13.661\nThe other things that we look\nat are merging cells and\n\n582\n00:33:13.661 --> 00:33:16.140\nusing formulas to modify the data as well.\n\n583\n00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.418\nSo oh, great stuff.\n\n584\n00:33:17.418 --> 00:33:19.350\nRonnie, you have anything else for\nus on this one?\n\n585\n00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.950\n>> Not really, but just realize\nit can be an effective tool but\n\n586\n00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.230\nremember that there is limitations to it.\n\n587\n00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.826\nDon't think that this is gonna be\nlike Excel and that's the key.\n\n588\n00:33:26.826 --> 00:33:31.485\nOnce you go, all right, I just really\nneed to show the data is better for\n\n589\n00:33:31.485 --> 00:33:33.981\nthat complicated data no so good for.\n\n590\n00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:34.712\n>> I was gonna say,\n\n591\n00:33:34.712 --> 00:33:38.330\nI'm gonna need a break out a calculator\nanytime you talk about math and i'm done.\n\n592\n00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.653\nWell, Ronnie, thank you for being here.\n\n593\n00:33:39.653 --> 00:33:41.358\nA pleasure to have you here as always and\n\n594\n00:33:41.358 --> 00:33:43.590\nlooks like we are coming\nto the end of this episode.\n\n595\n00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.971\nSo signing out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n596\n00:33:46.971 --> 00:33:47.969\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n597\n00:33:47.969 --> 00:33:49.570\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n598\n00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:55.690\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.370\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.527\nAnd in today's episode we're gonna be\nmoving along in Microsoft Word 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:23.229\nAnd today we're gonna be looking\nat how to create a list and\n\n6\n00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.840\nwho better to have us here.\n\n7\n00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.940\nHere with is is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.960\nHow are you doing there Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.750\n>> We're doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.790\nIt's another great day to be right\nhere taking a look at Word 2016, and\n\n11\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910\nwe want to talk about\nthe idea of creating lists.\n\n12\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.770\nAnd don't get me wrong you're\nprobably saying what's the big deal.\n\n13\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.340\nA list is a list is a list.\n\n14\n00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.950\nThere's no doubt that\nwhen we talk about just\n\n15\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.220\nlisting out items that is exactly true.\n\n16\n00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.240\nBut when we talk about using inside of\nword this is very important because\n\n17\n00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.630\nlists in their appearance and\nthe way they're actually presented.\n\n18\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.960\nCan make a difference and\ncan make a meaningful impact and\n\n19\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.940\nit's just not about putting\nstuff into a document.\n\n20\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.130\nSo let's go ahead and see how we can go\nahead and create just a list here and\n\n21\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.280\nthen modify it and make it actually\nappear like something that we\n\n22\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.920\nmight actually choose to\nuse if we were doing this.\n\n23\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.980\nNow I've been keeping a pirate theme\npretty much the whole time we've been in\n\n24\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.320\nthis little series here, so we've actually\ntaken a look around at several things but\n\n25\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.070\nkeeping that idea of a pirate theme,\nlet's go ahead and create a list.\n\n26\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.600\nI wanna create a list\nof different positions\n\n27\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.610\nthat normally we would\nfind on pirate ships.\n\n28\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.300\nDon't get me wrong,\nit's not an exhaustive list.\n\n29\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.740\nIt's a list of what I can remember and\nsome of the things I've written down but\n\n30\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.400\nwe wanna create a list and here it is.\n\n31\n00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.490\nHere's what makes it kind of not\nexactly so important, right?\n\n32\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.046\nSo if I go ahead and type in Pirate, let\nme put on my glasses so I can see here.\n\n33\n00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:48.647\nPirate Ship Positions,\n\n34\n00:01:48.647 --> 00:01:53.190\nokay, and I'll zoom this in just\na little so that we can see it there.\n\n35\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.860\nPirate Ship Positions, and\n\n36\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.880\none of the first things of course\nwould be a ship's captain.\n\n37\n00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.660\nWe understand that.\n\n38\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.140\nAnd then if I press Enter we also\nof course would need a Navigator.\n\n39\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.050\nWe would need someone\nlike a Helmsman here.\n\n40\n00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.550\nAnd then one of more important things\nwhich I did not realize on a Pirate Ship\n\n41\n00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.760\nthat's very important is\na Quarter Master as well, and\n\n42\n00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.400\nI could at least spell Quarter Master.\n\n43\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.266\nNow, the next one is actually\na little bit more unusual here.\n\n44\n00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.465\nNow Wes this is not trying to test you,\nbut\n\n45\n00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:33.985\nI want to see if do you know\nhow to pronounce this word?\n\n46\n00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:36.295\n>> I can't really see it there.\n\n47\n00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:38.825\n>> It actually is spelled\nout like boatswain.\n\n48\n00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.775\nLet me zoom in here so\nthat we can see this.\n\n49\n00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:42.675\nThere we go.\n\n50\n00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:43.835\nCan you see that?\n\n51\n00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:46.185\nIt actually spells boatswain.\n\n52\n00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:49.085\n>> I would probably say the same thing,\nboatswain.\n\n53\n00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.735\n>> Yeah you and I would actually say\nthat exact same thing and you and\n\n54\n00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:52.980\nI would both be wrong.\n\n55\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.410\nI actually kind of pronounce\nthat like the word bosen.\n\n56\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.090\nIt's what it really yeah, who would have\nguessed that that's what it would be so,\n\n57\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.590\nthat's can only how we end up pronouncing\nit, is like bosen here is what I have read\n\n58\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.890\nand understood in my priority knowledge\nthat I have [LAUGH] which is not much.\n\n59\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.270\nAnd then, there's something\nelse that we call it Cooper.\n\n60\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.380\nThere's a possibility and\nthere's a carpenter.\n\n61\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.640\nThere's a doctor.\n\n62\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.270\nIt's kinda fun that it\nactually list it down there.\n\n63\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.920\nAnd then there's a master gunner.\n\n64\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.000\nOf course,\nthat means there's actually gunners too.\n\n65\n00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.990\nAnd then we have musicians I did not know,\nbut\n\n66\n00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.135\nthe musician actually one of\nthe listed crew members on a,\n\n67\n00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:40.918\nif I can spell, [SOUND], musicians, see.\n\n68\n00:03:40.918 --> 00:03:44.600\nAnd then the last one\nthat's listed here is ABS.\n\n69\n00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.960\nAnd that means Able Bodied Sailor, okay.\n\n70\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.320\nWho is by far the most common.\n\n71\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.110\nCan't spell Sailor.\n\n72\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.520\nThat's what I need to, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.200\nSo there is a pretty generic and\nlist that we have in hand.\n\n74\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.290\nAnd if we were to try and\n\n75\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.070\ntalk about some of the different positions\nthat are actually on, it shows both.\n\n76\n00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.130\nNow, again we're not here\nto discuss all the work,\n\n77\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.880\nwe're talking about this idea\nof a list but, you're right.\n\n78\n00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.870\nIf all we're doing is\nlisting out stuff like this,\n\n79\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.320\nit really doesn't make\nthe impact that we need to.\n\n80\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.290\nAnd in a document list\nneed to make an impact.\n\n81\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.960\nAnd the way that we can do so is by using\nsome of the ways that Word has available\n\n82\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.160\nto us to actually be able to\nmake an impact on our document.\n\n83\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.040\nAnd so, we'll say that if we work for\na copy editor,\n\n84\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.600\nhe's probably actually in\nthe middle of editing a book, and\n\n85\n00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.790\nthey wanted to include in a list of\nthe positions that are available here.\n\n86\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.880\nThat's enough.\n\n87\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.410\nThat's actually an entire list that\nI have but it doesn't look like, so\n\n88\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.500\nin we would want to actually\nappear on the book.\n\n89\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.920\nSo I may wanna ask you to choose add in\nsome things to help set this thing up.\n\n90\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.560\nSo I'm just choosing all of\nthose positions right there.\n\n91\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:07.570\nAnd when I do that on my ribbon,\nright up here on the Home tab,\n\n92\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.550\nI have in the paragraph entry, and as you\nsee, kinda three dots in a row, a 1, 2,\n\n93\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.700\n3 and then a 1A1 when you see\nthat right there at the top and\n\n94\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.490\nthose are all things that can help us\nout with different lists that we have.\n\n95\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.390\nSo if I hover over that first\none we have bullet points.\n\n96\n00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.940\nThe second one of course can allow\nus to create numbering in a list.\n\n97\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.380\nAnd then the third one right here\nof course can create what we call\n\n98\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.010\na multi-level list as well.\n\n99\n00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.220\nSo when we take a look at that and\nI've selected all these positions,\n\n100\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.770\nI can just come in here and just simply\nchoose, let's say this first bullet point.\n\n101\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.510\nAnd now notice that that highlights\nthat a little bit differently, right?\n\n102\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.500\nIt gives me enough so that I can actually\npoint out the idea of a bullet point if I\n\n103\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.850\nwant to, to individually set off each one\nof these positions as being something\n\n104\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.700\nwe may actually choose to discuss it,\nokay, is what we want to make sure we do.\n\n105\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.840\nSo we can simply add in a bullet point.\n\n106\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.730\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and do a control\nz if I can actually find control z and\n\n107\n00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.800\nof course I can add in a number list.\n\n108\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.630\nAnd I'm just using the defaults\nthat are set here inside of Word.\n\n109\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.030\nNow when I do that one, let me see\nif I can zoom in a little bit more.\n\n110\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.620\nNow notice that I didn't have\nto type in all of those numbers.\n\n111\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.810\nNow, West that doesn't\nseem like a big deal but\n\n112\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.060\nif this were a list of 40 positions and\nwe had to manually type those things in,\n\n113\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.110\nthat would also be tiring for\nme after a while as well.\n\n114\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.660\nSo you can actually go ahead and\nhave that list there and\n\n115\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.250\nthen just add in additional numbers.\n\n116\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.060\n>> Now I noticed that when you\nput in the bullets there that\n\n117\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.240\nthey're pretty uniform there.\n\n118\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.620\nNow is there any way that\nmaybe you can modify them?\n\n119\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.470\nDo you have to just go with that default,\n\n120\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.700\nyou know just bullet after\nbullet after bullet?\n\n121\n00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.980\n>> Yeah you really don't right,\n\n122\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.510\nbecause there are actually some\ndifferent ones that are actually.\n\n123\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.290\nActually available for us here.\n\n124\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.760\nSo I just selected that whole thing,\nwent back to bullets.\n\n125\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.990\nYou can change whatever you want for\neach one of them in this way.\n\n126\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.910\nIf you're creating a list their actually\nassuming that these are items that\n\n127\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.650\nare meant to be together and that's why\nwe're getting a single bullet point for\n\n128\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.666\neach one of them and\nthat they're actually uniform that way.\n\n129\n00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:09.410\nIf we were to create\ndifferent bullet points for\n\n130\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.190\neach one we may not understand what\nthe bulleting is about, and so\n\n131\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.720\nthat's why we're probably\nnot actually doing that.\n\n132\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.500\nNow we do have the ability to add\nin some other information here.\n\n133\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.380\nBut let's go ahead and\ntalk about the differences\n\n134\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.190\nbetween using things like bullet points,\nand also of course, a numbering list.\n\n135\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.290\nNow the little screen tips\nreally don't help us.\n\n136\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.150\nAnd why will we choose to\ndo one over the other.\n\n137\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.040\nBut here's what normally would we talk\nwhen we start using bullet points, right.\n\n138\n00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.500\nIf there are a list of items and\n\n139\n00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.820\nI don't want to indicate any one item is\nany more important than another item,\n\n140\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.750\nnormally that's why we would\ncreate a bulleted list.\n\n141\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.920\nNow, we have to list them somehow.\n\n142\n00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.606\nBut some people like,\nif you take a look, of course,\n\n143\n00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:55.235\nwhatever is listed at the top\nis the most important,\n\n144\n00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:58.558\nand whatever is listed at the bottom\nis the least important here.\n\n145\n00:07:58.558 --> 00:08:01.803\nNow in this instance, you're perfectly,\nyou're probably right,\n\n146\n00:08:01.803 --> 00:08:04.560\nis that this is the way that\nthis list normally breaks down.\n\n147\n00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.123\nThere's Captain of course at the top,\nan then the Able Bodied Sailor\n\n148\n00:08:09.123 --> 00:08:12.910\nthe guy that does everything\nthat's left to do he sails.\n\n149\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.950\nHe's a pirate at the same time,\nhe does whatever's left over to do.\n\n150\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.320\nPerfectly fine.\n\n151\n00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.330\nBut if we were emphasizing the importance\nin other words of the order.\n\n152\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.122\nThat is when we would choose something\nlike a numbered list instead.\n\n153\n00:08:26.122 --> 00:08:30.220\nSo it's here that we would\nactually give an indication\n\n154\n00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.670\nby using that numbered list that what is\nat the top is normally more important now.\n\n155\n00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:40.240\nIn choosing the numbered list here, so\njust like we can change, of course,\n\n156\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.760\nthose different bullets,\nup here on the numbered list,\n\n157\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.080\nthere's a little tiny\ndrop down beside that.\n\n158\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.670\nI can also change the appearance\nof that numbering list as well\n\n159\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.640\nbecause there's a library for us.\n\n160\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.760\nSo, if I wanted to,\nI could actually do it by the roman\n\n161\n00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.460\nnumerals which is seems more parody\nto me for one reason or another or\n\n162\n00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.670\nI can do like this,\nwhere I have the one and then,\n\n163\n00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:09.330\nof course the closing parentheses we\ncan do it in alphabetizing instead.\n\n164\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.780\nYou name it, there's actually\nmultiple ways where you can do this.\n\n165\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.020\nNow you don't have to be set\nwith this particular set,\n\n166\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.460\nthese numbers, these are the ones\nthat are built in the library.\n\n167\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.520\nYou can even create your\nown if you want to.\n\n168\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.480\nBut you just gotta kind of realize\nthat yes that's why you would\n\n169\n00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.650\nactually create a list and do it the way\nthat you, that we have talked about here.\n\n170\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.250\nIs being able to make sure that\nwe wanna indicate importance or\n\n171\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.780\nimportance in terms of\nthe order of this list.\n\n172\n00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.020\nWe're gonna use numbers and\n\n173\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.340\nwe're just trying to list it but\nwe have to have it listed some way.\n\n174\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.330\nWe might choose to use\nbullet points instead.\n\n175\n00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.550\nNow once we actually have\nthese things inside of,\n\n176\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.040\nwhether we're actually doing a bulleted\nlist or a numbered list here.\n\n177\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.400\nWe might need to add in some\nadditional details of course.\n\n178\n00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.500\nSo, let me go ahead and press Enter.\n\n179\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.830\nI just clicked at the end of Captain,\nI press Enter.\n\n180\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.150\nAnd notice to try and\nkeep the list together,\n\n181\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.680\nwhat it gave me the ability to do\nwas add in another bullet point.\n\n182\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.600\nNow I don't wanna add in another position,\nbut\n\n183\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.380\nwhat if I wanted to describe what\nthe captain actually was responsible for?\n\n184\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.027\nNotice that I can press tab and\nthat actually gives me an indention in.\n\n185\n00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:19.070\nAnd it now associates kind of this\nunusual numbered list instead.\n\n186\n00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.570\nBecause it was not expecting\nto see something like that.\n\n187\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.160\nSo I can change that by simply clicking\nback on the bullet point here.\n\n188\n00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.030\nAnd even changing that bullet to\nanother library style instead indicate\n\n189\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.580\na different order or\na different level of position.\n\n190\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.919\nSo, I simply go ahead and\ndo this, and I can say,\n\n191\n00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:43.236\nCaptain, of course, is the overall.\n\n192\n00:10:45.472 --> 00:10:48.630\nLeader and Commander.\n\n193\n00:10:52.428 --> 00:10:55.521\nAll right, so we could do that and\nthen we're gonna ask you to go ahead and\n\n194\n00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:56.400\npress enter again.\n\n195\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.960\nThose are gonna give you another\nbullet point right after that.\n\n196\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.941\nAnd we could go ahead enumerate\nsome other things that\n\n197\n00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:06.756\nthe Captain also does which is,\ngathers the crew,\n\n198\n00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:17.700\nSets the goal for the ship, you name it.\n\n199\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.630\nYou can continue to do that.\n\n200\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.960\nAnd you of course can use\nyour tabs to help you out.\n\n201\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.920\nNow if I do a Shift+Tab,\nlet me see if I'm doing it right here.\n\n202\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.380\nLet's see if I do a Shift+Tab that works,\nnope.\n\n203\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:32.170\nSo if I go ahead and, let's see if I\nactually do another indention in here,\n\n204\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.290\nyeah if I go ahead even from this\npoint here I was hoping that yeah\n\n205\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.150\na ship have does work that way\nthen that should go all the way up\n\n206\n00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.920\nto the end there which\nis what I was hoping.\n\n207\n00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.240\nSo notice, it says gathers the crew.\n\n208\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.470\nIf I thought that there were other things\nI wanted to enumerate I can tab again\n\n209\n00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.360\ninside and there it goes.\n\n210\n00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.140\nIt actually does that.\n\n211\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.390\nIf I wanted to reset that level.\n\n212\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.350\nI can change that indent.\n\n213\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.930\nNow that is not the only\nway you can do that.\n\n214\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.040\nUp here in your paragraph grouping\nyou also have the ability to increase\n\n215\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.810\nthe indent or\ndecrease it as well from up here and\n\n216\n00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.549\nthat also helps you to set that out.\n\n217\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.570\nAnd I might need to go ahead and\nchange the numbering.\n\n218\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.800\nNotice that I can go ahead and\nput that back in there.\n\n219\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:19.120\nAnd then I can select that second level\nand tell it that I want to indent that in.\n\n220\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.380\nAnd now notice that I can\nactually use that indention\n\n221\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.580\nto kinda describe what\nthe Captain also does to.\n\n222\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.130\nSo it allows us to add in more and\ncreate different list and\n\n223\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.300\npossibly outlines if we need to.\n\n224\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.810\nNow the other thing that we can also do,\n\n225\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:43.520\nis to also use spacing In our\nparagraphs to help us out, as well.\n\n226\n00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.480\nSo, if I select that, and\nI add in some additional spacing here.\n\n227\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.060\nLet me see if I can add in.\n\n228\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.760\nIt says remove line spacing.\n\n229\n00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.350\nSo, apparently,\nI hadn't already done that.\n\n230\n00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:58.870\nLet me add in a little of space\nafter that paragraph here.\n\n231\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.500\nSelect the whole thing and do that.\n\n232\n00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.560\nApparently I have removed it\ninstead of added it in there.\n\n233\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.660\nLet me use this cuz I'm currently not so\ngood at adding in when I wanna do.\n\n234\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.930\nYou go, then adds in a little\nbit of spacing in between is\n\n235\n00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.850\nwhat we want so, actually you've done\nlook like you're added in at all.\n\n236\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.619\nMaybe I'm lying to you.\n\n237\n00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:27.730\nIt actually did that after\nthe first paragraph.\n\n238\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.040\nThe rest of this is actually\nseen as one paragraph.\n\n239\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.340\nSo that's what's happening is\nactually doing after the pirate ship\n\n240\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.900\npositions here.\n\n241\n00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.810\nSo by creating some list like this and\nwhere we can do this.\n\n242\n00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:43.050\nYou can modify and then end up changing\nwhat you actually want to be able to do.\n\n243\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.100\nNow in terms of numbering and\n\n244\n00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.720\nmoving things around, it's just as\nsimple as I've actually showed you.\n\n245\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.040\nThere's not a lot for\nus to do in terms of creating numbers, but\n\n246\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.760\nwhat we can do at this point then\nis go ahead and start to modify and\n\n247\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.460\nchange up the way these things\nare going to appear for what we want.\n\n248\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.360\nSo we would normally do something\nlike this and maybe that I could\n\n249\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.210\nfind out that hey, that numbering thing,\nI'm not so really happy with that.\n\n250\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.810\nI think I'm gonna change it back\nto the bullet points here and\n\n251\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.320\nI can actually center the whole thing.\n\n252\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.480\nI don't want to.\nThat doesn't look good.\n\n253\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.440\nWhy would I do anything like that?\n\n254\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.070\nSo you can actually see now by\ncreating these types of bullets or\n\n255\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:26.390\nnumbering lists it can really help out\nespecially when you take a look and\n\n256\n00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.360\nhaving to list out a bunch of information.\n\n257\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.400\nNow there's really not\na lot to this lesson.\n\n258\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.150\nIt really does kind of\nend just about there.\n\n259\n00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.260\nBut just take the time and\n\n260\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.640\nexplore those different options\nof numbering or bulleting and\n\n261\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.140\nthen of course modifying the way that it's\nactually gonna look for your document.\n\n262\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.514\nIt's gonna help you make\na more effective document.\n\n263\n00:14:44.514 --> 00:14:45.860\n>> All right, very good,\nwell thank you Ronnie.\n\n264\n00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.621\nWe've look at adding a bullet points, or\nbullet if you will, and customizing this\n\n265\n00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:55.192\nbullet as well as adding numbers to your\nlists, modifying the spacing as well.\n\n266\n00:14:55.192 --> 00:14:57.635\nWe've looked at modifying\nyour numbering too.\n\n267\n00:14:57.635 --> 00:15:00.505\nRonnie would you like to throw\nanything else before we call it a day?\n\n268\n00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:02.045\n>> Well just kind of remember, right.\n\n269\n00:15:02.045 --> 00:15:06.095\nThe goal is not to be super fanciful here,\nit's to make sure that they're marked and\n\n270\n00:15:06.095 --> 00:15:08.065\nthey're linear the way that you want to.\n\n271\n00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:10.575\nUse the bullet points for\nindicating that there's a list but\n\n272\n00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:14.170\nyou're not really trying to emphasize the\nimportance of the order in the list, and\n\n273\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.350\nyour emphasizing the importance\nof the ordering list,\n\n274\n00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.700\nuse numbers instead and\ncreate that number list that you want.\n\n275\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.210\n>> Well thank you Ronnie, it's\na pleasure to have you here as always.\n\n276\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.260\nAnd it's looks like we come to the end of\nthis episode we signing out for ITPro.TV.\n\n277\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.723\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n278\n00:15:27.723 --> 00:15:28.535\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n279\n00:15:28.535 --> 00:15:29.998\n>> And well see you next time.\n\n280\n00:15:29.998 --> 00:15:34.520\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.351\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:20.962\nAnd in this episode we're going to be\nmoving along in Microsoft Word 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.122\nAnd today we're gonna be looking at not so\n\n6\n00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.830\nmuch the efficiency that\nwe've been looking at.\n\n7\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.670\nIt's gonna be all about\nhow to speed up some of\n\n8\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.810\nthe things that you're trying\nto do through inserting and\n\n9\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.400\nformatting objects and who better to\nhave with us today Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.004\nHow's it going today how you doing Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:35.580\nHow ya doing today?\n\n12\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.216\n>> It's a great day to be right here as\nwe continue to take a look at some of\n\n13\n00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:41.413\nthe ways that Word makes things easier and\n\n14\n00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:43.880\nquicker is really what\nwe're focusing in on.\n\n15\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.046\nThe idea of an efficiency of course,\nis less clicks.\n\n16\n00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.330\nBeing able to do things in\na more streamlined manner.\n\n17\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.212\nBut sometimes we just need to do\nthings quickly is what we need to do.\n\n18\n00:00:53.212 --> 00:00:57.651\nAnd a lot of that has to do of course with\ndifferent object that we do have to worry\n\n19\n00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:02.170\nabout and of course, formatting that\nwe also have to deal with as well.\n\n20\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.060\nSo Word really does give\nus this ability to do so.\n\n21\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.790\n>> You know, one of the things\nI was thinking about now,\n\n22\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.200\nkind of going off the subject just for\na second, I love music, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.969\nSo one of the things that I have and\nsome of these digital processors,\n\n24\n00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.784\nyou have to peek and\ntweak little settings and\n\n25\n00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:17.101\nthen once you get your settings\nright you click a button.\n\n26\n00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.962\nAnd now I don't have to go back, and\nI don't have to preset all of that,\n\n27\n00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:21.360\ncuz it can be very time consuming.\n\n28\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.750\nSo, this is gonna be something, you know,\n\n29\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.740\nalmost some of the stuff that we're gonna\nsee, some of the things you can have ready\n\n30\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.900\nto go on hand so you don't have to keep\nretyping things over and over and over.\n\n31\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.790\n>> It really is.\n\n32\n00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.980\nAnd of course Word has a lot\nof them built in for us but\n\n33\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.780\nremember that sometimes that doesn't\nwork exactly that we want to.\n\n34\n00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.480\nLet me show you what I'm talking about\nbefore I try to talk anymore here.\n\n35\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.230\nSo here it is.\n\n36\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.200\nWe're using the same document that we\nhave been using pretty much throughout\n\n37\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.960\nthe entirety of the series that we've had.\n\n38\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.190\nBut I want to show you a few things,\nright?\n\n39\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.770\nSo there are inside of Word built-in\n\n40\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.020\ntools that really do help to\nmake things a lot faster and\n\n41\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.860\nwhat I'm referring to now is right up\nhere in the upper right-hand corner.\n\n42\n00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.540\nAnd if I can actually do that,\nit's what we call Quick Parts.\n\n43\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.780\nSo I'm trying to learn a little bit\nmore here right there where it says\n\n44\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.580\nQuick Parts.\n\n45\n00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.540\nNow that's exactly like it sounds.\n\n46\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.960\nThe very fact is that they\nwant this to be here for you.\n\n47\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.160\nAnd there's a whole storage of different\nobjects that are ready done and\n\n48\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.790\nthat you and\nI use that we just don't even realize.\n\n49\n00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.770\nAnd they've got it kind of managed and\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n50\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.350\nWe simply select that Quick Parts,\nand then when we\n\n51\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.080\nopen it up we actually see that there's\nsome auto-text that's in there and\n\n52\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.690\nit's automatically filling\nin some text for us.\n\n53\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.930\nWe can add in document\nproperties if we need to, or\n\n54\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.220\neven add in a field of information for\nplace holders.\n\n55\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.290\nStuff that I may want to actually go ahead\nand say, look I don't know exactly what\n\n56\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.750\nI'm going to put for here right now but I\nknow that I'm going to need this space so\n\n57\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.430\nlet me go ahead and\nput an object in here to help us out.\n\n58\n00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.870\nAnd then of course we have this\nBuilding Blocks Organizer.\n\n59\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.230\nIf I select that Building Blocks\nOrganizer, and it's actually easier for\n\n60\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.930\nme to kinda expand out the names so that\nwe can see it just a little bit here, you\n\n61\n00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.630\ncan see that there's several things that\nhave actually right here that we can see.\n\n62\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.050\nSo accent bars, other types of formatting\nthat's already pre-made for us,\n\n63\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.080\nWord has a lot of these things already set\nup so that we can use them very easily.\n\n64\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.190\nBut that doesn't always fit or suit\neverything that I need to be able to do.\n\n65\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.660\nSo let's take for an example,\nif I'm working this document, I realize\n\n66\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.150\nsomething, that what I want to do is I\nwant to be able to take the formatting and\n\n67\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.760\neverything that's actually right here.\n\n68\n00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.030\nLet's just take Nicolo Machiavelli\nname for right now.\n\n69\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.670\nAnd I know that I want to use it but\nwhen I actually want to use it\n\n70\n00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.880\nI want to make sure it always\nappears in this same manner.\n\n71\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.020\nSo the good thing is I\ncan highlight it and\n\n72\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.380\nI can make it into one\nof those Quick Parts.\n\n73\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.620\nAnd the way that I do\nthat is highlight it.\n\n74\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.470\nI go up to Quick Parts.\n\n75\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.420\nAnd then, I select,\nSave Selection to Quick Parts Gallery.\n\n76\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.870\nNow when I go ahead and save that,\nI can give it another name if I want to.\n\n77\n00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.030\nAnd I'm just gonna call it Nicolo here\nto make it short and easy for me to see.\n\n78\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.150\nI can save it to the standard\nQuick Parts gallery if I want to.\n\n79\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.930\nOr I can put it into another category of\n\n80\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.630\ndifferent Quick Parts that\nare actually out there for us.\n\n81\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.510\nSo I'm just gonna leave it\n\n82\n00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.550\nas is under Quick Parts cuz\nthat's where I want to see it.\n\n83\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.790\nI can give a description.\n\n84\n00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.230\nAnd this is gonna be Name Formatted.\n\n85\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.900\nAnd then I have it saved and\nI have some options.\n\n86\n00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.450\nNotice that I can actually save this and\n\n87\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.670\nhave it insert when we use\nit as the content only.\n\n88\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.910\nOkay so it's not gonna do anything but\nsave it as content only.\n\n89\n00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.750\nI can have it and say I'll need to insert\nin my own paragraph when I do this.\n\n90\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.380\nThis is really good when you\nknow what you're gonna add in\n\n91\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.650\nmore additional information\nbehind what you actually need.\n\n92\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.320\nSo create your own paragraph and\n\n93\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.580\nthat way it'll actually fill in the space\naround it as you add in more information.\n\n94\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.660\nOr even into its own page.\n\n95\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.270\nSo you can create quick pages very\nquickly and add an additional page.\n\n96\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.720\nAnd you might do something like this.\n\n97\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.080\nLet's say for an example, that you know\nyou add in your own signature line.\n\n98\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.350\nHaving a Quick Parts is a great way for\nyou to do that and\n\n99\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.750\nactually Word already has\nsome of those built in but\n\n100\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.460\nif they're not actually to your\nliking you can build your own.\n\n101\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.280\nYou might even do so for\na contract of some sort or\n\n102\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.040\nyou have in a signing sheet or\na cover sheet.\n\n103\n00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.672\nAll these are actually good reasons why\nyou might choose to use something like\n\n104\n00:05:30.672 --> 00:05:32.090\nQuick Parts here but\n\n105\n00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.920\nI'm just using this here as a very\nsimple example for right now.\n\n106\n00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.322\nBut every time I want to use\na name here when I start typing,\n\n107\n00:05:38.322 --> 00:05:42.436\nI may actually just choose\nNicolo Machiavelli and make it in italics.\n\n108\n00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:46.790\nThat's not the neatest example in the\nworld but it'll actually help us out here.\n\n109\n00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.070\nSo any place that I knew\nthat as I went through and\n\n110\n00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.740\nI started proofreading this document and I\nstarted see things I might choose it now.\n\n111\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.100\nOf course this would be\nstylistically terrible for\n\n112\n00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.830\nme to do if I referred to his whole name\nthe first time the whole time that I was\n\n113\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.040\ndoing it but lets say right here where it\nactually does zoom in and has his name.\n\n114\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.120\nAnd so,\nI wanna make sure that I replaced it and\n\n115\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.300\nmake sure those are exactly the same.\n\n116\n00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.100\nSo I can highlight Machiavelli and\nthen select Quick Parts and\n\n117\n00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.450\nyou'll notice right away,\nit gives me this right here.\n\n118\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.760\nWhy is it actually a Quick Part or\na Quick Part gallery right here?\n\n119\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.090\nWell, if not, what I would have to do is I\nwould have to go and find the Quick Parts,\n\n120\n00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.690\nI don't have to click on insert.\n\n121\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.430\nGo find that grouping where Quick Parts\nis, and then click on Quick Parts,\n\n122\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.640\nand then go down to\nthe building blocks organizer.\n\n123\n00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.050\nScroll all the way down to Nicolo,\nclick enter, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.920\nThat by using this Quick Parts gallery,\n\n125\n00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.050\nthat just shows right up\nhere in the top of the list.\n\n126\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.512\nI select it, and now, what you can\nactually see here, right, is it really\n\n127\n00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:51.740\ndid insert the name right in where I\nwanted to and actually italicized as well.\n\n128\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.720\nSo it really can help us to say,\nto be much\n\n129\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.910\nquicker in the things that we actually\nchoose to manually create as well.\n\n130\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.060\nSo these are what you want to do, right?\n\n131\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.920\nSo there's a lot of times where you\nmight actually have a document that's\n\n132\n00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.820\nformatted exactly like you want to see but\nyou don't know exactly how it happened.\n\n133\n00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.090\nSelect the whole thing, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.610\nSave it as a Quick Part and\nthen open up another document.\n\n135\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.760\nAnd you can cuz it actually saves it\nin a Word document or in Word itself.\n\n136\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.220\nAnd then you can actually reuse that\nQuick Part again somewhere else.\n\n137\n00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.640\nSo it really is helpful.\n\n138\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.600\nSo remember that if you do need to\nmodify something as well let's say that\n\n139\n00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.740\nQuick Part, I can go up to Quick Parts,\ncome down to Building Blocks Organizer.\n\n140\n00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.770\nAnd if I could expand this out I would but\nthere's no expansion to that one.\n\n141\n00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.807\nAnd now I simply scroll\ndown to the end for Nicolo.\n\n142\n00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.228\nAnd there is the actual Quick Part\nthat I have saved here.\n\n143\n00:07:48.228 --> 00:07:52.735\nI can select edit properties, and it's\nright here where you can change what you\n\n144\n00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:57.172\nneed, but if it's not going to allow you\nto, and you don't want that actually\n\n145\n00:07:57.172 --> 00:08:01.433\nin your gallery anymore, all you have\nto do is delete it right out of there.\n\n146\n00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:04.371\nClick Yes, and then you are ready to go.\n\n147\n00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:07.918\nThe only thing that you have to remember\nwhen you name that quick part is that you\n\n148\n00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:09.315\ncan't have any spaces in it and\n\n149\n00:08:09.315 --> 00:08:13.060\nnormally you shouldn't actually name\nit with the number at the beginning.\n\n150\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.400\nIt should be an alphabetic character\nof some sort if you do it but\n\n151\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.110\nbesides that, you can actually use\nthose parts wherever you want to in\n\n152\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.070\nthe documents that you create, and it is.\n\n153\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.560\nIt's all about efficiency, so a lot of\ntimes, the more quick parts you have,\n\n154\n00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.760\nthe better it's going to be.\n\n155\n00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.220\nAnd we already see that there\nare quick parts all over Word.\n\n156\n00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.430\nIf I go ahead and select, let's say for\n\n157\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.990\nan example,\nI do have a header up here somewhere.\n\n158\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.370\nSo I select headers, a lot of times.\n\n159\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.830\nAnd then I go down to Header,\n\n160\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.640\nyou'll see that there's a built-in\nQuick Parts gallery right there.\n\n161\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.200\nSame thing for footers.\n\n162\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.170\nYou can also see there's\na built-in gallery.\n\n163\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.670\nAnd these are some of those\nthings that we also saw in that\n\n164\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.890\nbuilding blocks gallery\nthat we talked about.\n\n165\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.650\nBut they're actually separated out\nhere into their own individual places.\n\n166\n00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.610\nSo it's been around for\n\n167\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.270\nawhile, just not very easily\naccessible if you don't know about it.\n\n168\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.630\nSo remember that the key to\nmaking it quicker for you, right,\n\n169\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.790\nis not just to use those standard\nbuilt-in ones but actually create\n\n170\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.490\none that you want to see, even if it\ntakes you ten or 15 minutes to do so.\n\n171\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.580\nSave it as a Quick Part and\nnow it's all your own.\n\n172\n00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.630\nIt actually makes everything\na lot faster for you.\n\n173\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.560\n>> That's great.\nIt's good having presets you know,\n\n174\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.860\nnot having to constantly type\ninformation in very redundantly.\n\n175\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.730\nIt's gonna slow you down in your progress\nor maybe the lack of progress, so\n\n176\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.280\nvery good.\n\n177\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.260\nAll right Ronnie, so\nwhat do we have next up?\n\n178\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.150\n>> Well what we also wanna\ndo is be able of course to\n\n179\n00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.950\nhelp our documents actually\nemphasize points that we want to do.\n\n180\n00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.810\nAnd we can do this with what we\ncall things like pool quotes or\n\n181\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:48.392\ntext boxes that we can insert\ninto emphasize points that want.\n\n182\n00:09:48.392 --> 00:09:52.330\nLet me show you an example right here\non my screen and that will help us out.\n\n183\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.190\nSo let's say that as I went through this\ndocument that I realized that there were\n\n184\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.610\nthings that I wanted to emphasize if I\nwas reprinting the prints for someone and\n\n185\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.460\nso we can actually have a quote inside and\nwe can create a text box and\n\n186\n00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.470\nthat way it essentially highlights what\nwe actually want to be able to do.\n\n187\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.950\nNow the nice thing about the way\nthat these insert text objects go\n\n188\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.120\nis that if I create one you can see that\nit also gives me this little kind of.\n\n189\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.520\nIt always looked a little\nbit strange to me this\n\n190\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.310\nlittle icon over here on the upper right\nhand corner let me see if I zoom in there\n\n191\n00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.240\nthat way we can see it just\na little bit better too.\n\n192\n00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.785\nAnd this is what I'm talking about,\nwhich is that object right there, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:38.640\n[LAUGH] Now it always looked a little\nworm to me is what it looks like.\n\n194\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.480\nBut that is actually showing you how that\nobject, how that particular box that I've\n\n195\n00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.500\njust created there, how it actually\nfits in to the text itself.\n\n196\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.220\nSo notice it didn't actually put that box\nin its own paragraph It then put the box\n\n197\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.020\nin front of the text.\n\n198\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.735\nThis particular box if I select it and\n\n199\n00:10:55.735 --> 00:10:59.070\nmove it notice that\nthe text moves around it.\n\n200\n00:11:00.165 --> 00:11:01.120\nSee that?\n\n201\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.460\nDoesn't matter where I\nactually move it and put it.\n\n202\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.850\nThe text literally moves\naround that object.\n\n203\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.679\nIf I want to change that I can\nclick on the Layout Options here,\n\n204\n00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:14.847\nthen I can show whether\nit's in line with the text,\n\n205\n00:11:14.847 --> 00:11:19.488\nwith text wrapping has a square around it,\ntight through the text, top and\n\n206\n00:11:19.488 --> 00:11:24.085\nbottom, etc., behind the text,\nyou name it, well that would be good.\n\n207\n00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:27.468\nSome of them were good, some of them would\nbe terrible like the idea of actually\n\n208\n00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:30.980\nhaving it through the text even though\nit's a text box, that's terrible idea.\n\n209\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.940\nBut you can do that if you wanted to.\n\n210\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:38.320\nSo, it actually does help for you to\nbe able to do something just like this.\n\n211\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.110\nNow, the key, of course, if actually\ngoing to do something like this\n\n212\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.590\nto use it highlight,\nto emphasize points, is you need,\n\n213\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.980\nof course,\nto find quotes to be able to do this.\n\n214\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.280\nSo, this is what happens when you don't\nsleep, Wes, like I didn't last night.\n\n215\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.530\nAnd you just go through and\n\n216\n00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.940\nyou read the entirety of the prints, and\nyou actually start making boxes like this.\n\n217\n00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.530\nSo I wanna show you how I did this.\n\n218\n00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.422\nSo let me go back and\nfind another location here and\n\n219\n00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:04.600\nI've already copied what I wanted and\n\n220\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.460\nI'm gonna select add oh I just added it\nover didn't I crud I sure did all right.\n\n221\n00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.590\nSo we're gonna scroll down\nhere a little bit and\n\n222\n00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.720\nsee if I can find what I was looking for.\n\n223\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.280\nI did something silly\nin my bookmark there.\n\n224\n00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.270\nInstead of actually saying go to,\nI selected add so I'm actually just,\n\n225\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.170\njust did that and\nnow I just overwrote my shortcut.\n\n226\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.780\nWe'll just put it in, let's say,\nright here in this paragraph instead.\n\n227\n00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.440\nSo, there was a quote that I wanted to\nappear in that particular section of text\n\n228\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.200\nat this point so, I had highlighted and\nmaybe that's what I need to do,\n\n229\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.196\nI need to use a find here and\nlet's see if I can find that.\n\n230\n00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:47.110\nSo I'm gonna select Find, this actually\nhelp me out a little bit more,\n\n231\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.879\nlet me do the actual Advanced Find, that\nwill help me out a little bit more here.\n\n232\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.800\nClick More and then I need to look for\nsome formatting.\n\n233\n00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.860\nSo if I select Formatting I'm\ngonna select Highlight, and\n\n234\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.180\ntell it to find the next highlighting,\nand there we go.\n\n235\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.810\nThat will help me out much better than\nwhat I was gonna do which was just insert\n\n236\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.520\nit in a random place here.\n\n237\n00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.350\nSo let's say that as I\nwas reading through this,\n\n238\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.380\nit was this particular phrase\nright here that I have highlighted\n\n239\n00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:20.040\nthat I wanted to pull into what one\nof those text box quotes, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.440\nSo how do I get that?\n\n241\n00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.290\nWell, the first thing that we want to do\nthen is we wanna make sure that we select\n\n242\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.050\nthat text.\n\n243\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.561\nNow, I went in and highlight it so\n\n244\n00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:31.808\nthat we could see it on the screen\nis what I wanted to do.\n\n245\n00:13:34.844 --> 00:13:38.580\nThen I'm going to copy that text, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:44.670\nSo once I have it copied, now I can go and\ncreate a text box, I can select Insert, in\n\n247\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:49.020\nthe text grouping on the upper right-hand\ncorner over I can select Text Box.\n\n248\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.150\nAnd what I want is just a simple text box.\n\n249\n00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.620\nAnd so\nthat inserts it right into the middle.\n\n250\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.960\nSo to grab your reader's attention with\na great quote from the document or\n\n251\n00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.000\nto use this space to emphasize a key\npoint, that's all we have to do.\n\n252\n00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.070\nNow all I need to do is right-click.\n\n253\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.690\nAnd I want to paste the contents\nin here and keep the text only.\n\n254\n00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:14.605\nAnd I'm gonna make that also\nitalicized now of course.\n\n255\n00:14:14.605 --> 00:14:19.400\nCuz I can and\nmake it bold that'll work all right.\n\n256\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.850\nSo now I have italicized and bolded okay.\n\n257\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.910\nSo even though it's actually in line\nwith the text itself notice that\n\n258\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.950\nit's actually pushing the text around and\nthe way that I want it to be.\n\n259\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:38.670\nAnd so, by default that's the way that\nwe keep in the layout options here.\n\n260\n00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.540\nIf I want it to go into\na tight square around it,\n\n261\n00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.330\nI don't know if that's actually\nany better or not, let's see.\n\n262\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.650\nIt is a little bit tighter.\n\n263\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.840\nBut you can actually see\nwhere you can move that.\n\n264\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.120\nThat green line is normally\nabout telling you,\n\n265\n00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.820\nhey you're way out of the margins\nas you start seeing things.\n\n266\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.460\nI'm just trying to make sure I knock out.\n\n267\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.235\nI don't actually leave individual words\nlike that over on the right hand side.\n\n268\n00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:06.110\n[LAUGH] It's almost difficult to do that.\n\n269\n00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.270\nSo now we can see where we can highlight\nthat and make that that point.\n\n270\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.240\nOr if I wanted to, if I knew this was not\ngonna be printed but just seen, I could\n\n271\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.370\neven add in something like that, add in\nthat background to change everything up.\n\n272\n00:15:20.038 --> 00:15:23.970\nSo inserting that text box is\nanother way to help emphasize things\n\n273\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:28.080\nwe'll not having to go out of your way\nto figure out an another idea to do so.\n\n274\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.960\nSo making it once again much faster to do\nthe things that we want to be able to do.\n\n275\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.120\nSo text boxes are fairly quick.\n\n276\n00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.160\nBeing able to work with that building\nblock organizer a little bit to delete out\n\n277\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.280\nor add in new things that we create is\nalso gonna help us to be quicker as well.\n\n278\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.076\nSo a lot of good information that\nreally helps us out right then.\n\n279\n00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.828\nThe other thing that we\nalso want to pay attention,\n\n280\n00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:56.073\nis that Word has some built-in options.\n\n281\n00:15:56.073 --> 00:16:01.651\nNow, this one we're just gonna\n\n282\n00:16:01.651 --> 00:16:06.823\nstart from a blank document.\n\n283\n00:16:06.823 --> 00:16:11.058\nAnd there's sometimes where we know what\nwe need but we don't know exactly how to\n\n284\n00:16:11.058 --> 00:16:15.169\nstart and we don't know if Word's actually\ngonna be the appropriate tool, so\n\n285\n00:16:15.169 --> 00:16:17.370\nlet me kinda give you a for instance here.\n\n286\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.630\nLet's say that what I need is\nan organizational chart, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:25.550\nWhen I need an organizational chart,\nI know what I'm kind of envisioning in my\n\n288\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.220\nmind but a lot of times, of course,\nme then trying to make that\n\n289\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:34.610\ntranslate into what Word has may not\nactually do what I think it's going to do.\n\n290\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.620\nSo if that's not gonna happen,\nwell, what can I do?\n\n291\n00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.130\nThe good thing is there's actually\nsome objects inside of Word,\n\n292\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.790\nsome extra tools that will help us out,\nand of course, Word calls it SmartArt.\n\n293\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.190\nActually, throughout Microsoft Office\nit's called SmartArt as well.\n\n294\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.930\nSo here's what we are going to do,\n\n295\n00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.610\nlet's gonna change out the layout here for\na moment.\n\n296\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.100\nI'm gonna change this\norientation to landscape and\n\n297\n00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.270\nthen change my margins here a little\nbit to, the top and bottom, one inch,\n\n298\n00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.389\nthat's fine, that's all we need, and then\nI wanna create an organizational chart.\n\n299\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.510\nIf I go back to Insert, I was trying\nto make sure I knew where I was going,\n\n300\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:16.700\nInsert, there's a group in called\nIllustrations and then there is SmartArt.\n\n301\n00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.160\nIf I choose SmartArt,\n\n302\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.960\nit gives me a list of different\ngraphics that I can actually use.\n\n303\n00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.180\nAnd if I know that I'm gonna be\ncreating an organizational chart,\n\n304\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.620\nin other words a hierarchy,\nI can go down to that grouping,\n\n305\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:34.100\nthat category that's called Hierarchy, and\nthen I can click on each one of these.\n\n306\n00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.870\nAnd on the right-hand side\nit gives me a description\n\n307\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.150\nof the way that this\norganizational chart works.\n\n308\n00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.210\nSo this is just a basic\norganizational chart.\n\n309\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.060\nHere's one if I had pictures that I wanted\nto add in here, we could also do so, here.\n\n310\n00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.190\nHere's another one that says name and\ntitle of the people's positions.\n\n311\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.140\nA half-circle, you name it,\neach one of these\n\n312\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:00.820\nof course has their particular benefit\nthat you wanna actually be able to follow.\n\n313\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.660\nSo that is what you would end up choosing.\n\n314\n00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.930\nI'm gonna choose the standard\norganizational chart right up\n\n315\n00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.590\nhere at the top, just because it's easy,\nand then click OK.\n\n316\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:16.389\nAnd now you'll see that it actually gives\nus the text that we need right here, and\n\n317\n00:18:16.389 --> 00:18:17.812\nI could stretch it out.\n\n318\n00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:23.900\nAnd now I simply can work with it, I can\nstart adding in some information here.\n\n319\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:29.143\nSo let's say that we're actually\ndoing the organization here,\n\n320\n00:18:29.143 --> 00:18:32.300\nand let's do our pirate Captain to it.\n\n321\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.587\nSo I can do Captain, and\nnotice that it goes ahead and\n\n322\n00:18:36.587 --> 00:18:40.394\nresizes everything inside for\nme if I want to.\n\n323\n00:18:40.394 --> 00:18:47.063\nAll right,\nnext to that is gonna be First Mate.\n\n324\n00:18:47.063 --> 00:18:51.923\nAnd then let's see here,\nwe'll do Quartermaster,\n\n325\n00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.624\nand then we'll do the Bosun.\n\n326\n00:18:57.877 --> 00:19:03.040\nAnd of course there is the Master Gunner.\n\n327\n00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.960\nIt is what we also have now.\n\n328\n00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.002\nSo there's a quick way\nthat we can do that, and\n\n329\n00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:12.526\nif I now need to format it I can now\nchoose some different formatting,\n\n330\n00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:15.736\nand I can even have it stand\nout a little bit more.\n\n331\n00:19:15.736 --> 00:19:20.291\nYou notice that we can actually use all\nof the styles that's actually available,\n\n332\n00:19:20.291 --> 00:19:21.620\ndon't like the color.\n\n333\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.910\nOf course, I can choose different\naccent colors to help us out here.\n\n334\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.470\nAnd that way, this actually allows us\nto focus in more on the organization\n\n335\n00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.240\nthan on trying to figure\nout how to build a chart.\n\n336\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.990\n>> That's very good cuz I've worked\nwith some of the mind mapping software,\n\n337\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.690\nmaybe Vizio, so this is nice that\nyou could do this inside of Word.\n\n338\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:44.790\nAnd you don't have to go to another\nsoftware, maybe print that out, maybe\n\n339\n00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.810\nexport it to a PDF, take a screenshot\nof it, put it back into your document.\n\n340\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.590\nSo it looks like it gives you a lot more\nflexibility, if you will, rather than\n\n341\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.840\nhaving to have multiple programs in\norder to just make something like this.\n\n342\n00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.330\n>> It really does, right?\n\n343\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.630\nThe whole goal, right, is if you have\na document, then you realize that you need\n\n344\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.700\nto insert in something like this, well,\nyou have that option that Wes was\n\n345\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:12.664\ntalking going to another program that's\ndesigned to help you to do that.\n\n346\n00:20:12.664 --> 00:20:18.680\nAnd then, maybe saving that as\na JPEG object, or something that you\n\n347\n00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.290\nmight have right there, and then importing\nit in, and then trying to line it up.\n\n348\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.223\nThis is native inside of Word,\nwhich means it really, hopefully,\n\n349\n00:20:27.223 --> 00:20:31.646\nwill be designed to go along with what\nyou actually need here to help you out.\n\n350\n00:20:31.646 --> 00:20:35.421\nSo by having something just that simple in\nat least your starting point and you're\n\n351\n00:20:35.421 --> 00:20:39.083\nnot just try and go I don't know how to\ndo that, I'll create a text box here, and\n\n352\n00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:42.662\nthen I'll draw some different lines,\nand then try and figure it out as well.\n\n353\n00:20:42.662 --> 00:20:45.230\n>> I was gonna say it's kinda\nlike the universal remote, right?\n\n354\n00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.630\nYou don't have to have 15 remotes\nto do 15 different things.\n\n355\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.360\nWe have it all right\nnatively inside of Word.\n\n356\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.875\nNow the other thing I know is I'm very\nartistically challenged, so sometimes,\n\n357\n00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:59.865\nas our documentation needs to\nget a little bit more elaborate,\n\n358\n00:20:59.865 --> 00:21:03.435\nmaybe we have to add\nadditional objects in there,\n\n359\n00:21:03.435 --> 00:21:07.485\nagain, to give it more flair,\nif you will, so what else can we do?\n\n360\n00:21:07.485 --> 00:21:08.805\n>> Yeah, let's show you some more, right?\n\n361\n00:21:08.805 --> 00:21:10.125\nSo I just left it at the default,\n\n362\n00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:13.820\njust to show you the basic creation and\nhow fast it could go.\n\n363\n00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:19.310\nBut with the SmartArt object itself\nover here on the left-hand side,\n\n364\n00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.350\nyou see kind of a little arrow\nthat's pointing out to the left.\n\n365\n00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.933\nOh, that makes sense.\n\n366\n00:21:23.933 --> 00:21:25.938\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right there,\n\n367\n00:21:25.938 --> 00:21:29.559\nthat little object that doesn't\nhave a left pointing arrow and\n\n368\n00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:33.950\nthat is how we can manipulate this\nobject and add in some other things.\n\n369\n00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:39.213\nSo if I click right there,\nI can go up to the Captain here and\n\n370\n00:21:39.213 --> 00:21:41.801\nactually add in some other.\n\n371\n00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:47.153\nSo let me say, First Mate, I can now\ngo ahead at that particular level,\n\n372\n00:21:47.153 --> 00:21:51.790\nright, First Mate there might be,\nlet me tab in, let me go and\n\n373\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.102\ntab that and let's say what\nis that gonna be, Cabin Boy.\n\n374\n00:21:56.102 --> 00:21:59.080\n[LAUGH] I don't remember that movie.\n\n375\n00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.240\nThis one I remember.\n\n376\n00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.260\nCabin Boy, and then I can also add in,\n\n377\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.335\nlet's say Master Gunner is\ngonna be a gunner position.\n\n378\n00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:09.876\nBosun is gonna have a carpenter.\n\n379\n00:22:11.946 --> 00:22:13.271\nUnderneath them, and of course,\n\n380\n00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:16.830\nall the other people that are actually\ndealing with the maintenance of the boat.\n\n381\n00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:21.392\nSo notice that you can easily,\njust by hitting Enter or Tab,\n\n382\n00:22:21.392 --> 00:22:23.992\nokay, and then Able Body Sailor.\n\n383\n00:22:25.453 --> 00:22:30.700\nAnd then of course, Deck and etc.,\nand notice how that organizational\n\n384\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.518\nchart continues to fill in without\nme having to actually figure out\n\n385\n00:22:35.518 --> 00:22:40.900\nlike what's gonna happen if I move\nthis thing the way that I want to.\n\n386\n00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.437\nIt really does allow us to again focus in\non the information that we need to focus\n\n387\n00:22:45.437 --> 00:22:49.424\nin on, allowing Word to actually do\nall of the other pretty stuff that\n\n388\n00:22:49.424 --> 00:22:51.250\nwe're talking about.\n\n389\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.340\n>> It can help out here.\n\n390\n00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.690\nSo yeah, these organizational charts,\n\n391\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.020\nthe quick parts, all of those\nare actually good things that we need.\n\n392\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.940\nBut remember like what\nwe were talking about,\n\n393\n00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.020\na lot of it is about when do you need it.\n\n394\n00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.490\nNormally, when we think about it is when\nwe're in the middle of that document,\n\n395\n00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.630\nthen we go,\nyou know what would be a good idea?\n\n396\n00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.360\nThen I add in a flowchart right here,\njust a small one, or I need to add in our\n\n397\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.910\norganizational chart right here so\nthat way the text flows around the thing.\n\n398\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:21.232\nOr actually flows in line with it the same\nway we just talked about things like\n\n399\n00:23:21.232 --> 00:23:25.552\nthe text boxes that we just put into our\ndocument as well, so it can do that,\n\n400\n00:23:25.552 --> 00:23:26.577\nit can help us out.\n\n401\n00:23:26.577 --> 00:23:31.010\nNow the other thing that we also\nwant to take a look at briefly here\n\n402\n00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.099\nis the idea of captioning these objects,\ntoo.\n\n403\n00:23:34.099 --> 00:23:38.721\nSo when we talk about captioning, right,\nif this is actually one of let's say five\n\n404\n00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:42.683\nor six different things, objects like\nthis that I have in my document,\n\n405\n00:23:42.683 --> 00:23:46.841\nI also want to maybe able to create\na table of those objects at some point, or\n\n406\n00:23:46.841 --> 00:23:50.631\nat least make sure I can identify them and\nhave people refer to them.\n\n407\n00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:54.949\nLet's say I'm doing a presentation,\nand here's my report, and I say,\n\n408\n00:23:54.949 --> 00:23:59.127\nhey, I want you to take a look at\nfigure 1-4, okay, well I can try and\n\n409\n00:23:59.127 --> 00:24:02.840\nmake a text box and just add it\ninto the bottom of this document.\n\n410\n00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.214\nBut Word also gives us the ability to\nadd in captions to objects, as well.\n\n411\n00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:09.140\nLet me show you how to\ndo that using this here.\n\n412\n00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.680\nAnd then we'll add in another object,\nas well, to help us out.\n\n413\n00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.550\nSo I'm gonna select the object.\n\n414\n00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.362\nFrom here, if I select References,\n\n415\n00:24:17.362 --> 00:24:22.550\nI have a grouping up here at\nthe top that is called Captions.\n\n416\n00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.110\nRight up there just about top center.\n\n417\n00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.960\nAnd notice it says Insert a Caption.\n\n418\n00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.940\nSo once I have that object selected,\nI can select Insert Caption.\n\n419\n00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:38.280\nAnd now very, very tiny and I, Wes,\nI wish I knew why they made it like this.\n\n420\n00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.460\nI do not know why.\n\n421\n00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.150\nBut that is a little, tiny line.\n\n422\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.870\nAnd so it's right here, if it's Figure 1,\nand I may just go ahead and\n\n423\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.090\nrefer to that, I'm gonna put a colon in.\n\n424\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.620\nOh I can't do it in that type, I forgot.\n\n425\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.490\nI always have to do this here.\n\n426\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.423\nFigure one and I'm gonna put pirate.\n\n427\n00:24:57.628 --> 00:24:59.045\nShip.\n\n428\n00:25:01.924 --> 00:25:03.920\nOrgchart.\n\n429\n00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.710\n[LAUGH]\nI know.\n\n430\n00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.040\nIt now becomes funny to me that I'm trying\nto organize a pirate ship into the proper\n\n431\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.050\n[LAUGH] organizational chart here.\n\n432\n00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.270\nSo I can do that.\n\n433\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.990\nAnd I'm gonna actually have it\npositioned right below the item.\n\n434\n00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.220\nI can also position it above.\n\n435\n00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:25.020\nAnd then, click okay when I do so,\nnotice that I can actually go ahead and\n\n436\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.390\ndo that and add that in there.\n\n437\n00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:30.141\nNot only that, I, of course, again,\n\n438\n00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:35.144\ncan come in and\nadd in a border around that object to,\n\n439\n00:25:35.144 --> 00:25:39.920\nlet me see, I'm trying,\nlet me reformat that and\n\n440\n00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.510\nFormat Object, there we go,\nand add in a line.\n\n441\n00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.470\nOh that's a fill, sorry.\n\n442\n00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:49.410\nI'm about to do the wrong thing.\n\n443\n00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:50.810\nAll right, solid line.\n\n444\n00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.710\nThat'll make it stand out\njust a little bit more here.\n\n445\n00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:55.376\nWe'll just do the basic black.\n\n446\n00:26:00.077 --> 00:26:02.080\nAt least that's what the hope is,\nthere we go.\n\n447\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.160\nSo now we can see where Figure 1 here\nis actually that organizational chart,\n\n448\n00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.850\nand then if I wanted to add in a another\nobject, I simply go up to Insert and\n\n449\n00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.780\nI'm gonna select Picture.\n\n450\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.430\nAnd let's, I pulled Peter's\npicture in a little bit earlier,\n\n451\n00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.230\nhe was playing a video game.\n\n452\n00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.780\nAnd so\nI added in Peter's picture right here\n\n453\n00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.120\nas he is playing a video game getting\nvery excited, and this object, of course,\n\n454\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.670\nis way too big, so I'm gonna\nshrink it down just a little bit.\n\n455\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.171\nOr at least I think I am.\n\n456\n00:26:34.171 --> 00:26:38.756\nMake a little bit smaller, and then, of\ncourse, that means I have to kinda rotate\n\n457\n00:26:38.756 --> 00:26:43.285\nthat object a little bit, rotate it to\nthe right, oops, rotate it to the right.\n\n458\n00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:45.370\nAnd I'm gonna see if I can crop it now.\n\n459\n00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.260\nCropping has been a little bit\nchallenging because of the scale of\n\n460\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.260\nthe way that my computer's working,\nbut that'll work.\n\n461\n00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.413\nAdd that in there out of that way,\nand then let me scroll down here,\n\n462\n00:26:56.413 --> 00:27:00.200\nsee if I can grab this corner here and\nscroll up this way.\n\n463\n00:27:07.653 --> 00:27:11.176\nAll right, so\nnow that that object is there,\n\n464\n00:27:11.176 --> 00:27:15.290\nI can also caption this, same exact way.\n\n465\n00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.370\n>> I now go ahead and\nselect my References, and\n\n466\n00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.580\nI now select Insert Caption, and\n\n467\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:29.090\nthis right here, I can zoom in, and\nI know you can barely see it, but\n\n468\n00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:34.570\nit actually is two lowercase Roman\nnumeral numbers is what we have here.\n\n469\n00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.160\nSo in other words, it's already seeing\nthat this is the second object in\n\n470\n00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.240\nmy document.\n\n471\n00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:44.350\nSo at this point, I can put,\nI remember, I can't zoom in to do this.\n\n472\n00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.359\nSo this is Peter.\n\n473\n00:27:51.261 --> 00:27:54.990\nHaving a good time at work.\n\n474\n00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.850\nThere we go.\n\n475\n00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.640\nClick OK.\nAnd so now,\n\n476\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.710\nboth of my objects are actually in there.\n\n477\n00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.470\nAnd it will follow that documentation,\n\n478\n00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:06.060\nthat numbering along to really help\nus to do what we wanna be able to do.\n\n479\n00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.991\nWe, of course, at any time,\nbecause if you click on it,\n\n480\n00:28:08.991 --> 00:28:12.860\nnotice that the insertion point\nwill go right into those captions.\n\n481\n00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.470\nAnd we can always come back in and\nchange those captions if we need to.\n\n482\n00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.480\nSo you can always right click.\n\n483\n00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.094\nAnd then go ahead and change the font,\nthe paragraph, the style, you name it.\n\n484\n00:28:24.094 --> 00:28:26.265\nYou can actually rename\nthem however you want to,\n\n485\n00:28:26.265 --> 00:28:27.770\nmark it up the way that you need to.\n\n486\n00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:30.820\nAnd it will follow exactly\nwhat you want it to do.\n\n487\n00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.600\nSo captions can be really helpful,\nespecially when you're using a lot of\n\n488\n00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.160\nthings like elements\nthat you add in there.\n\n489\n00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.910\nAnd you wanna make sure\nyou keep track of them.\n\n490\n00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.810\nAnd later on,\nas we go into more advanced studies,\n\n491\n00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:45.680\nwe can even show you how to create\na table of objects, or a table of charts,\n\n492\n00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.740\na table of pictures that you might use and\nactually insert into a book.\n\n493\n00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.510\nThat way, people can look it up and\nattach a page number to it.\n\n494\n00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.500\nYou name it.\n\n495\n00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.010\nUsing all the elements that are actually\ninvolved in what we've just talked about\n\n496\n00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.150\nhere is really helpful as you actually\nstart working with larger and\n\n497\n00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.160\nlarger documents.\n\n498\n00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.670\n>> That's great.\n\n499\n00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.230\nSo we've talked about a lot of\ngood information in this episode.\n\n500\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.410\nWe talked about using text boxes.\n\n501\n00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:09.169\nWe talked about the building block\norganizer and using smart art.\n\n502\n00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:11.270\nRonnie, you got anything else for us?\n\n503\n00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:15.140\n>> Right now, we're just taking look that,\nwhat we're seeing here and\n\n504\n00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.030\neverything that we've that so\nfar up on to this series.\n\n505\n00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:23.850\nIt's all about giving familiar\nwith Microsoft Office Word.\n\n506\n00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.600\nMaking sure that we feel confident\nin the way that we can work with it.\n\n507\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.522\nAnd we also, of course,\n\n508\n00:29:28.522 --> 00:29:32.300\nhave taken a little bit time showing you\nthat look, the more that you work with it,\n\n509\n00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.080\nthe more tools that you find available,\nyou'll see how useful those tools are.\n\n510\n00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.670\nA lot of those tools\nonly work to your benefit\n\n511\n00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.010\nif you will take the time to try and\nuse them.\n\n512\n00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.430\nIt takes a little bit of\ntime at the beginning, but\n\n513\n00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.440\nonce you actually understand\nthat they're there and\n\n514\n00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.030\nyou know at least the beginnings of how\nthey work, they're relatively intuitive.\n\n515\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.868\nIn other words, it makes it easy.\n\n516\n00:29:53.868 --> 00:29:56.430\nOnce you actually go, okay,\nI know I can sort that in there, but\n\n517\n00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.510\nlet me right click and see what I\ncan actually affect and fix there.\n\n518\n00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.750\nLet me go ahead and\ndo a little bit more exploration and yeah,\n\n519\n00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:07.230\nI should become a master at actually using\nall those tools inside of Microsoft Word.\n\n520\n00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.891\nIt is worth your time and\n\n521\n00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:13.560\nyour effort to do so if you are looking\nfor that job or if you're actually saying\n\n522\n00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.930\nI need to be better at this\ncuz I wanna help people out.\n\n523\n00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.140\nOr I'm about to start at college, and\nI want to actually be able to learn\n\n524\n00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.950\nmore about Word because I know it's\ngonna be an effective tool for me.\n\n525\n00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.630\nThis is a great series for\nyou, as well, and\n\n526\n00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.590\njust try and make sure that you\ntake a little bit more time\n\n527\n00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.800\nis really gonna be the best benefit\nthat you can at the beginning.\n\n528\n00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.220\nAnd then you'll work with it so easily.\n\n529\n00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:40.390\nIt will just become another appendage for\nyou, another tool that you actually have\n\n530\n00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.640\nthat would just be the most\neffective tool in your life.\n\n531\n00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.100\nWhen you're actually at work.\n\n532\n00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.010\n>> Great information, Ronnie, as always.\n\n533\n00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:48.550\nThank you,\nit's a pleasure having you here.\n\n534\n00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.910\nBut it looks like we're coming\nto the end of this episode.\n\n535\n00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.540\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n536\n00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.530\nI've been your host here at ITProTV,\nWes Bryan.\n\n537\n00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.440\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n538\n00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.745\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n539\n00:30:57.745 --> 00:31:03.433\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
