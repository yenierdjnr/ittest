The certification combines breadth of knowledge with extensive pre-requisites to ensure that candidates who successfully complete the exam are competent and well versed in the various tools and techniques used by successful project managers. The certificate is targeted at individuals with over five years of experience working as a project manager and seeking to validate their knowledge and experience through becoming certified. Individuals without five years of documented experience should consider the Certified Associate of Project Management (CAPM) certification.
