	"description": "This exam has been retired. CompTIA and the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) have worked in conjunction to create the CompTIA Linux+ certification. The certification covers the basic knowledge required of a junior level Linux administrator. Candidates are expected to be able to work competently across a wide array of environments and skill sets. Unlike many certifications, candidates who complete the Linux+ exams (LX0-101 and LX0-102) are awarded with not one, but two certifications: the CompTIA Linux+ certification and the LPI LPIC-1 certification. That makes this an excellent starting point for people interested in working with Linux as you gain essential base knowledge as well as fill out your resume.",
