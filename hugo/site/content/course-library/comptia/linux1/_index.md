	"description": "CompTIA and the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) have worked in conjunction to create the CompTIA Linux+ certification. The certification covers the basic knowledge required of a junior level Linux administrator. Candidates are expected to be able to work competently across a wide array of environments and skill sets. Unlike many certifications, candidates who complete the Linux+ exams (LX0-103 and LX0-104) are awarded with not one, but three certifications: the CompTIA Linux+ certification, the LPI LPIC-1 certification and SUSE Certified Linux Administrator (CLA). That makes this an excellent starting point for people interested in working with Linux as you gain essential base knowledge as well as fill out your resume.",
