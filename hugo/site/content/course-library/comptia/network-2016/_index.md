	"description": "The Network+ certification was introduced by CompTIA in 1999 and was designed to do for Network Technicians what the A+ certification did for Computer Technicians. Obtaining Network+ certification shows that the holder possess the same knowledge and skills of someone who has worked for nine months as a Network Technician. The Network+ exam covers topics ranging from theory (terminology, topology and design) to hardware (routers, switches and cabling) and provides users with a broad, vendor neutral perspective on the topics required to work in the field of Network Administration.",
