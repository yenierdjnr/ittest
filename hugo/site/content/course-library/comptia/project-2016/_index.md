	"description": "The CompTIA Project+ show is for business professionals who need to assist in coordinating projects or manage small projects. It is not specifically geared toward the IT field but projects in general. A viewer of the show in addition to persona study will gain knowledge and skills required to assist in planning and managing a small-to-medium-size project. He or she will understand the project life cycle, learn steps to ensure appropriate communication, manage resources and stakeholders, and learn techniques to maintain project documentation used to support the completion of projects. The show helps prepare CompTIA Project+ candidates with least 12 months of total experience in leading, managing, directing, and/or participating in small-to-medium-size projects for examination.",
