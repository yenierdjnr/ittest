Also in long documents, we demonstrate how to create a master document with sub documents for large projects. Other topics in this series include how to collaborate in Word and through Office 365 online, secure your documents, and document properties.  While Word 2016 Expert is a continuation from the Word 2016 Advanced and Essentials series, episodes can be viewed individually for specific topics or in sequence.",
