	"description": "React and Firebase are two technologies that are becoming more and more mainstream. You may have heard of both, but how do the pieces fit together? Join us in this series as we take React and build a chat application that leverages Firebase for all of the backend services. You will discover building React components, using Firebase observers to sync data to your front-end application, the difference between Stateful and Stateless Functional Components, and much more. If you are looking to level up your understanding of React and Firebase, then we will see you there!",
