	"description": "Docker is a set of tools that provide a runtime for creating, managing and orchestrating containers. Docker provides the ability for developers, system admins, or hobbyists to provision a container that can be configured as similarly to a virtual machine without all of the resource intensity. This series introduces the usage of the Docker client to run containers, managing the Docker daemon, using Docker Machine for provisioning runtime environments for the Docker toolset, Docker Compose for orchestrating and managing multi-container applications, as well as Docker Swarm for distributing those containers across multiple nodes in a cluster of machines. Stay tuned to get started with Docker!",
