	"description": "The Cloud Fundamentals video series is designed to introduce the viewer to cloud computing, which works from providers that can have thousands of servers and have more than enough hardware and CPU resources to support their systems and they rent out the extra capacity to users so the potential is not wasted. Positions like system administrators, developers and CIOs all benefit from implementing cloud technology. Cloud concepts and theory are discussed and then actual deployment examples of practical applications are demonstrated using Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.",
