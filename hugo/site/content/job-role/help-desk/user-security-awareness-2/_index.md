	"description": "This is a non-technical course designed for every end user.  Our experts explain very common security topics that are critical to be aware of in today’s work environment, but explains in the “end-users” non-technical language, so everyone can understand.  Many stories are told as examples for easier understanding.  One might think this is super easy and doesn’t go deep on topics, but you would be wrong, this course is a perfect fit for everyone to understand and prevent security risk.  This course is also a living course, which means we will continue to add episodes as new security topics, subject, stories appear, so continue to check back and see what new items have shown up.  Enjoy",
