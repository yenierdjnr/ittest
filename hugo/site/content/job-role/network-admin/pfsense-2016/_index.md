	"description": "The pfSense show is presented to help users to become familiar and proficient at deploying the free network firewall.  This free solution provides the features found in most commercial firewalls and even some features not found in some of them.  It is completely scalable only limited by the hardware you provide.  To make for easier management and configuration, a full featured and intuitive web-based configurator is integrated to support all features.  You’ll see that it’s relatively easy to get it functional.  The show also shows how to implement firewall filters, nat rules, network services, VPNs and additional packages.",
