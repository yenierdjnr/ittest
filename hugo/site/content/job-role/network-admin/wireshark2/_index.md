	"description": "Wireshark 2.2.4  is a free and open source network packet sniffer and protocol analyzer developed as a first response tool. It is the most widely-used network protocol analyzer.  I can be used to examine all network traffic because it’s a mini swiss army knife to network administrators who needs detailed visibility into the traffic on their network.  It displays the raw data obtained by the sniffer and turns it into readable and meaningful data so that the user will be able to spot issues as well as correct network problems.  It’s power lies in the ability to help an analyst find the proverbial “needle in a haystack” when the user is up to speed on what to look for and how to do it.  This show helps the network professional get started with Wireshark!",
