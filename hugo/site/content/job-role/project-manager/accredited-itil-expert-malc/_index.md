	"description": "The intent of the Managing across the Lifecycle (MALC) qualification is to give candidates the skills to support an organizationâ€™s service delivery by bridging the service lifecycle stages. The qualification demonstrates that candidates have learned the value of one combined service management practice as opposed to separate subject areas. ITIL processes and practices, as learned from the lifecycle and capability streams of the intermediate certificates, are put into a context of delivering this value.",
