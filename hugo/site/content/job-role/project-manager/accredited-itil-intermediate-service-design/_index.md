	"title": "Accredited ITIL Intermediate - Service Design",
	"description": "Our Service Design show takes the ideas for new services born in Service Strategy and turns these into a defined blueprint for the development of the services. We look at the operational aspects to designing an IT service, such as Service Level Management, managing suppliers, and planning for service availability and resilience. All of our planning cumulates into a Design Package which we then handover to the Service Transition lifecycle phase. Like all ITIL shows we also look at critical success factors and key performance indicators and we do some exam prep too!",
