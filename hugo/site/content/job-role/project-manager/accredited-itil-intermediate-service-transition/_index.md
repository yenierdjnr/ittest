	"description": "In these episodes we look at the transition of an IT service from a design plan to a live service. We examine closely processes such as Change Management and Release and Deployment Management and we also look at what services are made of in Service Asset \u0026 Configuration Management. We look at the concept of early life support and also the value of knowledge in enabling decision making. Like all ITIL shows we also look at critical success factors and key performance indicators and we do some exam prep too!",
