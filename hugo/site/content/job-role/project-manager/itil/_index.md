	"description": "The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) was created to help businesses manage their IT operations more efficiently and reliably. The ITIL framework provides a collection of practices that businesses can choose to adopt that focus on aligning IT operations with the goals of the business. These practices range from creating new service offerings to day-to-day operations and managing incidents. Many organizations choose to follow ITIL because it prevents them from having to \"reinvent the wheel\" when it comes to IT processes and operations. The ITIL Foundations certification is designed to introduce the candidate to the general processes in ITIL and how they can be used to benefit an organization.",
