	"description": "This show explores the foundational concepts and workings of Azure SQL. We start by defining why you might decide to implement a hosted database in Azure SQL vs an on-premise solution; detailing some of the benefits of moving to Azure SQL. We then describe some of the more advanced benefits of using Azure SQL like using Resource Groups, Geo-Restore, Point-In-Time Restore, and Self-Service Restore.
