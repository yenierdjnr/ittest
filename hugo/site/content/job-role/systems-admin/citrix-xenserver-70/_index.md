The low cost of entry makes XenServer an attractive option for small and medium businesses looking for advanced hypervisor functions (clustering, live migration, centralized management) without the large price tag associated with competing products. This latest version is designed to integrate better with Windows and provide a feature rich virtualization solution to compete with VMWare and Microsoft's Hyper-V market share.",
