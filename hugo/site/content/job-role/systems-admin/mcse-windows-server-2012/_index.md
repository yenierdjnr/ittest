	"description": "The Designing and Implementing a Server Infrastructure exam is the first of two exams required to obtain the Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) certification. This exam departs from the traditional pattern of \"how\" to perform tasks and instead focuses on \"why\" these things are done and “why” one would want to make certain decisions like use IPsec instead of PPTP or have four active directory domain controllers instead of one. This course covers topics ranging from server capacity planning and placement to active directory topology design. The typical viewer would be anyone involved in designing network solutions or working in a consulting role.",
