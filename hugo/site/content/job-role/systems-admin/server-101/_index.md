	"description": "The Windows Server 101 show is meant for those who have little to no experience in managing and maintaining Windows Server.  It fills in the gap for the desktop support technician who wants some basic and practical Window Server Skills, for the IT professional who may work in other areas and want learn more about Windows Server Administration as well as for the A+ and Network+ certified who need the learn just some Window Server Management and Maintenance before they dive into the MCSA to MCSE certification tracks. The goal is introduction and immediate skill development to manage Windows Server.   This is not for the professional who already has years of experience.",
