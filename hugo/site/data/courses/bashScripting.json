	"description": "Unix and Unix-like operating systems(Linux/BSD), known for their speed and reliability, are becoming an ever increasing presence in many data centers and server closets. That being the case, systems administrators that are new to the command-line driven nature of these systems will need to get up to speed on how to interact with the CLI shell environment found as the default on the majority of those systems. In this series, we introduce you to that shell environment known as the Bourne Again Shell or bash, for short. The series starts with an introduction to the bash environment, showing and explaining to you how to navigate through the system using text-based commands. This includes file system navigation, setting file permissions, manipulating output, etc. Then, building upon that foundation, we show you how to automate repetitive tasks by creating customized scripts. All the main bash scripting abilities are covered; from basic repetitive command execution, to more complex functionality like arithmetic, arrays, conditional statements(if-then/elif/case-esac), program loops(for/while/until), and functions/libraries.",

			"description": "In this episode, Ronnie and Daniel introduce how to use functions in BASH scripting.   Functions are used to reduce repetitive nature of scripting when certain tasks are called over and over again, according to the guys.  They show us how functions can be made and then called within our scripts.  Even though we can simply create them within the script, we can also take output of a function and have that output to a variable for uses complex scripts.  Daniel then shows how to create a library of functions and how to call that library within scripts.",
