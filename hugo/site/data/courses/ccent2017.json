They talk about how to put a limit on the number of mac addresses each port will allow to connect.  Don and Ronnie show the default settings of port configuration and show how to manipulate and change the default settings to get port security working exactly how you may need to work.",

Routing protocols are the preferred method when you have multiple routers and there are many advantages to using them, they explain.   Don and Ronnie also take a few moments to describe the difference between Distance Vector and Link State Protocols too.   Lastly, they mention how a cisco router deals with the possibility of multiple routes to the same destination from multiple protocols by using Administrative Distance—the trustworthiness of a route protocol and the load balancing that can occur if  multiple routes have the same metric.",
