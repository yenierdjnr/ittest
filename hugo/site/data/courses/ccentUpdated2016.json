Stateless addresses are auto configured and stateful addresses will be assigned through DHCPv.6.  In stateful addressing the advertisement is from the dhcp server using imcp 134 on ff02::1,   if stateless then the advertisement is from the client on ff02::2 on ICMP 133",

			"description": "In this episode, Todd Lammle focuses in on two discovery protocols that help to show the physical connections and layer 2 information of those devices.  Configuring both CDP and LLDP, he explains the differences and similarities between them.  DNS and DHCP are two networking topics that are important and every candidate should be able to configure both on the cisco routers.  Remember that if your dhcp server resides on a different network than the DHCP clients an IP helper address must configured on the router interface facing the clients.",
