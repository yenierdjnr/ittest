	"description": "The Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) is the most well known Cisco certification path. It takes the general networking theory from the CCENT certification and applies it in real world scenarios. It moves beyond configuring individual devices into more complex territory often requiring the configuration of numerous devices to create a robust and optimized network. While studying for this certification, you will revisit the routing and switching topics from the CCENT in more depth as you learn about and implement the advanced features of each technology.",

Enabling bpduguard sends a port into err-disabled state if a single bpdu is detected, Don explains.  They also explain to how enable this globally for every port and then how to disable it for the ports needed.",
