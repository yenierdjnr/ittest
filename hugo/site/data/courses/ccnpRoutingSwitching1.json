			"description": "In this episode, Daniel and Don continue exploring redundancy protocols found on Cisco switches, this time covering the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol or VRRP. Just like HSRP, VRRP allows you to set up standby switches to take over in the case of a failure with the main switch. Also, they go over the topic of load balancing using the Gateway Load Balancing Protocol(GLBP).",
