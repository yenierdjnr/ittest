This course prepares the viewers for the Cisco ASA Express Security exam (500-260), which covers basic firewall configuration as well as the new features found in Cisco FirePOWER (formerly FireSIGHT) and is commonly required for Cisco Channel Partners that are selling and promoting Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA). One should attain the knowledge to at least be able to take an ASA out of the box, configure it to a network, get it filtering traffic and successfully get FirePOWER enabled and running. The knowledge one can attain in the CCENT and CCNA can serve as a great foundation base when learning about Cisco ASA.",
