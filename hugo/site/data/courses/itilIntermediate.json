The entire goal is have the knowledge ready for how needs it at the right time, according to the team.  They review the constant idea of the need and the scope.  With the nature of the “ocean” of information there of course needs one some type of system (SKMS) to help with the management, distribution and use of the data available, according to the guys.  They also emphasize there is no one system to do it all but it will require integration of multiple systems that may have data; it may require a custom system; it may require just record keeping that is indexed to allow for the discovery of that information.  This is not a topic to be overlooked, according to the guys.",
