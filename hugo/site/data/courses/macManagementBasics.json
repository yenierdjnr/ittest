Apple Remote Desktop benefits those managing a large quantity of Macs. Viewers will be shown how to set up clients and copy over files and install software on client profiles, as well as hear some of the ways ARD can be used to control the Macintosh system in a network, including: software distribution, remote assistance and administration, asset management and reporting, and automation.",
