	"description": "In this series, Daniel and Justin walk you through an in-depth primer on the Python programming language. Whether you have some other programming experience or you are completely new to coding, you will be given the tools necessary to get started writing programs with Python. They cover topics like printing output to the screen, assigning and utilizing variables, getting input from the user, decision making, iteration/loops, creating lists, dictionaries, and tuples, using and creating functions, slicing, and more. If you're looking for an easy programming language to get started, or you want to add another language to your repertoire, Python is a great choice.",
